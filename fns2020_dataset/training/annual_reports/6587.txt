Annual Report 2005
Chairman’s statement
> Performance
During the past four years we have systematically evolved GKN into a highly focused and technology
led engineering group with strong leadership positions in Automotive, OffHighway and Aerospace.
In 2005, through restructuring and investment, we accelerated our strategy to build a GKN which,
while maintaining its focus, will be even more global than before. Today our production capacity
is increasing in Mexico, Brazil, Poland, Slovenia, India and China where we are building on a strong
presence established over a number of years. 
Our businesses overall have made progress in both sales and trading proﬁt. Despite ﬂat production
of light vehicles in North America and a slight decline in Western Europe – our two largest
automotive markets – global light vehicle production increased by 3% as a result of growth in
Brazil, India and China. However, we still had to deal with continued high input costs. 
Whilst Automotive proﬁts were down, the transformation of our Aerospace business allowed us to
take advantage of both continuing strong defence expenditure and an upturn in the civil market which
led to substantially higher Aerospace proﬁts. OffHighway also showed continuing improvement.
Following receipt, some 15 months ago, of the proceeds of the sale of our 50% shareholding in
AgustaWestland we have been examining acquisition opportunities rigorously. We have not set
ourselves any arbitrary deadlines but will use our balance sheet strength when we ﬁnd opportunities
which we believe can deliver real, long-term shareholder value.
In common with other UK pension funds, GKN’s UK scheme has been adversely impacted by
declining real interest rates and increased longevity. While recognising the long-term nature of
pension liabilities, we believe this deﬁcit must be addressed and therefore are making an
immediate contribution of £200 million into the scheme. 
> Results
Post-tax earnings for the year before restructuring charges, proﬁts on sale of businesses and
changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments were £163 million compared with
£172 million in 2004 and earnings per share on the same basis were 22.1p compared with 23.1p
in 2004. For continuing operations trading proﬁt rose to £228 million from £214 million in 2004.
Net debt at the end of the year was £65 million compared with net funds of £65 million at the end
of 2004.
> Dividend
Subject to prevailing economic conditions the Board is committed to a progressive dividend policy
and recommends that a ﬁnal dividend of 8.2p be paid on 17 May 2006 bringing the total dividend
for the year to 12.2p (2004 – 11.9p). The dividend is covered 1.8 times (2004 – 1.9 times) by
earnings before the impact of restructuring and impairment charges, proﬁts on the sale of
businesses and changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments.
> The Board
There were a number of changes in the composition of the Board. Following completion of nine
years’ service as a non-executive Director, Baroness Hogg ceased to be the Senior Independent
Director with effect from 31 December 2005 and has been succeeded in that role by Sir Ian Gibson.
Sarah continues as Deputy Chairman until her retirement from the Board at the AGM on 12 May
2006. Sir Peter Williams has taken over from Sarah as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
and John Sheldrick has succeeded Sir Peter as Chairman of the Audit Committee, both with effect
from 1 January 2006.
Richard Clowes, Group Managing Director Corporate Development, left the Group on 31 December
2005 and Ian Grifﬁths, Group Managing Director Automotive, resigned from the Group on 3 February
2006 to take up a senior external position. Both Richard and Ian served GKN over a considerable
number of years and we thank each of them for their very valuable contribution. 12 GKN plc
Annual Report 2005
> Corporate social responsibility
Last year I reported that we had carried out a global survey of our social responsibility behaviour
and practice which would enable us to reﬁne and improve the way we interact with employees,
customers, suppliers and communities. As a result we are introducing The GKN Code which is
supported by a number of policies, some of which are new and some of which are updates of
existing policies. The Code is common to all parts of the Group and sets out a clear and unambiguous
framework of conduct and behaviour. 
> The future
GKN made good progress in 2005 in building a strong platform for the future. Our balance sheet
remains strong and well able to support our growth ambitions.  
Roy Brown
27 February 2006
Chief Executive’s statement
> A year of progress
2005 has been an exciting year in the development of GKN and we made excellent progress across
all of our major businesses. We achieved a solid ﬁnancial performance and continued to deliver
on the strategic actions which will re-establish the Group on a long-term growth path.
In a year of mixed automotive markets and escalating raw material and energy costs our Automotive
businesses in total increased sales and produced a very respectable level of proﬁts. Programme
wins and successful new product launches conﬁrmed Driveline’s market and technology leadership
and a soundly based improvement in Sinter Metals’ performance underpinned our continued
conﬁdence in this sector. OffHighway increased both sales and market share and the proportion
of its revenues derived from the global construction equipment market. The successful
transformation of Aerospace is conﬁrmed by our results and we further strengthened our position
on the world’s latest aircraft and engine programmes.
As a result of our new technologies, new programme wins and new investments, our progress in
2005 will make a major contribution to the future success of GKN.
> Changing our global footprint
In 2004 we informed shareholders of our plans to build on our long-established presence in
high-growth, low-cost economies. By rebalancing our global manufacturing assets we will better
exploit opportunities offered by the emerging, growth economies of Asia, Latin America and Eastern
Europe. By 2008 our Driveline business plans to have approximately 50% of its constant velocity
joint production capacity in these regions compared with 30% in 2003.
During 2005 we made rapid advances towards this goal. Taking full ownership of our joint venture
in Mexico was an important step and we are investing to double our capacity there. Driveline is
also increasing capacity in Brazil, Poland and Slovenia. Powder Metallurgy, Other Automotive and
OffHighway have moved to establish new capacity in markets such as Brazil, India and China, all
of which will be in place during 2006. Meanwhile we are implementing the closure of a number of
Driveline and Powder Metallurgy plants in North America and Western Europe.
> The contribution of technology
Three years ago we stated that GKN was determined to become a technology led company. Our
progress in achieving this ambition has been rapid.  GKN plc 13
Annual Report 2005
In Driveline our engineers launched two new constant velocity joint technologies which are exciting
the interest of vehicle manufacturers. These new technologies represent the ﬁrst breakthrough in
constant velocity joint design since the product was invented 70 years ago.
In 2005 we commissioned our Advanced Composite Facility on the Isle of Wight in the UK to
accelerate the development of new material and process technologies for aerospace. We are
grateful for funding support from the UK Department of Trade & Industry and the South East
Development Agency. The Facility was opened by Alun Michael MP , Minister of State for Industry.
GKN’s technology status in aerospace was conﬁrmed by our selection by Northrop Grumman to
join the team responsible for development and production of the X-47B unmanned combat aircraft.
Prototype production work on this programme began in 2005. We also embarked on a major
extension of our facility in Alabama, USA, to produce the world’s ﬁrst all-composite fan case for
the new General Electric GEnx jet engine for airliners such as the Boeing 787 and 747-8 and the
Airbus A350.
> Managing GKN
As a result of the Board changes described by the Chairman we have enlarged the Executive
Committee of the Board which now also includes the chief executives of our operating divisions
– Driveline Driveshafts, Sinter Metals, Diversiﬁed Businesses Group, OffHighway and Aerospace.
These changes to the Executive Committee were with effect from 1 January 2006. I am conﬁdent
that through this team of experienced and talented executives we will be able to continue to drive
forward our strategic development with maximum vigour.
Credit for our successes in 2005 is spread widely throughout the global GKN organisation. People
at all levels have been challenged by the execution of our strategic plan and have shown exceptional
skill and dedication. I thank them all for their contribution to what has been a memorable year of
progress in the development of GKN. 
> Outlook
There is a broadly stable outlook for major automotive markets whilst aerospace markets look set
to remain strong. 
In Automotive, industry forecasts for North American and Western European markets are for little
change in production volumes, although there remains some risk of disruption to the former
following recent supplier insolvencies. However, developing markets, especially in Asia Paciﬁc, are
expected to show continuing strong growth. Prices for steel and other automotive raw materials
appear to have stabilised although energy costs are still showing some increase. 
With its presence in emerging markets and strategic restructuring programme nearing completion,
Driveline should have another solid year. Powder Metallurgy expects to show further recovery and
growth. Results for our other smaller Automotive businesses will be impacted by redundancy costs. 
OffHighway’s agricultural markets softened slightly during 2005 but are expected to remain around
current levels throughout 2006, with continuing strong demand in construction markets. We expect
our business to continue to make good progress. 
Aerospace markets will remain strong and we expect to continue to improve performance albeit
at a lower rate of growth than the exceptional rate seen in 2005. 
Interest costs on borrowings will rise in 2006 as increases in US interest rates will impact foreign
currency borrowings by around £9 million. 
Overall we expect to continue the progress seen last year into 2006, with the further beneﬁts of
restructuring together with the strength of our order book accelerating growth from 2007 onwards.

GKN people and their
achievements in 2005
Encouraging achievement by
individuals and teams is at the
heart of GKN’s global drive for
excellence.
GKN looks for excellence in 
how we perform as a business,
excellence in how we serve
customers and shareholders and
excellence in how we manage 
our impact on the environment
and how we interact with the
wider community of which we 
are a part.
On the next four pages we

GKN people and their success
in striving for excellence.  16 GKN plc
Annual Report 2005
GKN people and their achievements in 2005 
Roy Parton, Materials Manager, Ken Lane, Operator
and Lynne Woodcock, Customer Liaison, are members
of the GKN Wheels team at Telford in the UK. In 2005
the Telford team received an Excellence Award for
Customer Focus from the Institute of Mechanical
Engineers. GKN Wheels has become known for its
rapid response to customer emergencies. Roy, Ken
and Lynne were involved in a typical emergency
exercise when a major customer had been let down 
by another supplier. An urgent request for a batch of
wheels was received on a Friday and delivered to a
plant in Germany on the Monday morning. All in a
weekend’s work!
Karen Whitbread, Technical Manager and Mike McKee, Technical
Lead, work for GKN Aerospace in Alabama, USA. During 2005 they
were deeply involved in a breakthrough in the use of composites
in aircraft structures. General Electric has awarded GKN a contract
to produce the world’s ﬁrst composite fan containment case for a
large turbofan. The new engine, the GEnx, will power the Boeing
787 and 747-8 as well as the Airbus A350. Production of the GEnx
containment case is now underway at GKN’s plant in Tallassee,
Alabama. A major expansion of the plant was initiated in 2005 to
handle this addition to GKN’s output. GKN Aerospace’s engineering
team won the GKN Group Technology Innovation Award in 2005
for their work on this project. Mike is holding an aluminium bond
tool used on the ﬁrst full-scale case to be produced. GKN plc 17
Annual Report 2005
Workplace safety is of paramount concern for
GKN people and we are proud of our record of
improvement. In 1999 our accident frequency
rate per 1,000 employees was 24.8. In 2005 
it was 5.2. David Craig, Vice President and his
team from GKN Aerospace in St Louis, Missouri,
USA, developed a meticulous, behaviour-based
approach to safety using trend analysis and 
risk proﬁling. Their achievements won them
GKN’s top safety award for 2005.
There is a small ﬁshing village on the West Coast
of Thailand whose livelihood was devastated by
the Asian tsunami. Boonnarong Petchsongkram,
SCIL and EMS Manager at GKN Driveline’s plant
in Rayong in Thailand, decided to bring hope back
into the lives of the villagers. He mobilised a GKN
team who drove 1,000 kilometres with more than 
a ton of food as well as cash. Three months later
the GKN volunteers returned to build new houses
and help the villagers acquire new boats. Thanks
to Boonnarong and his colleagues the villagers
of Kampoun have returned to the life they knew
before the tsunami. In 2005 Boonnarong received 
a special GKN Award for Outstanding Contribution
to the Community.
New technologies are at the heart of GKN’s ambition
to expand the global market for powder metallurgy
based products. Peter Moelgg, GKN Sinter 
Metals Senior Vice President Engineering 
and Bernhard Terﬂoth, Development
Manager, Hydraulics, discuss their new 
Planetary Hydraulic pump. The unique 
characteristics of the new pump – for 
example very high pressure, dual ﬂow 
and very low energy absorption – are 
enabling automotive customers to either 
eliminate multiple pumps or downsize 
products to improve vehicle packaging 
in areas such as transmission and 
steering systems. 18 GKN plc
Annual Report 2005
GKN people and their achievements in 2005 
The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is an important
programme for GKN Aerospace. In addition 
to major work on the aircraft’s engine and 
on the airframe, GKN has been contracted by
Lockheed Martin to design and produce the
cockpit canopies. These canopies represent
radical progress as they embody a continuous
outer skin incorporating an external coating
system with a thick windshield laminated to
the inside. The advantages of this design are 
a combination of high-speed bird strike
resistance, canopy ejection capability and 
low signature. JSF Canopy team members
Herbie Rodriguez and Ray Rodriguez prepare
one of the ﬁrst canopies to be shipped from
GKN’s plant in Garden Grove, California.
Managing our impact on the environment is a long-established
concern of GKN. Our environmental team at GKN Driveline in 
Porto Alegre, Brazil, led by Environmental Co-ordinator Andrea
Pampanelli developed a composting process which, in a year, 
was able to convert 600 tonnes of organic waste and sludge from
the facility’s treatment plants into a saleable compost. This process
not only reduces the cost of waste disposal but also beneﬁts the
environment. The team was honoured with the Chief Executive’s
Award last year for their outstanding environmental contribution. 
GKN’s new crosstrack
TM
and countertrack
TM
technologies
are the ﬁrst major breakthroughs in CVJ technology
for 70 years. Thomas Weckerling, Design Engineer 
CV Joints and Wolfgang Hildebrandt, Advanced 
Sideshaft Development Manager, GKN Driveline,
demonstrate GKN’s new countertrack sideshaft.
Countertrack technology reduces weight
through its smaller package size, improving 
fuel economy and performance. The new 
technology also improves a vehicle’s
driveability and can improve overall
levels of reﬁnement. These new joints
were introduced to customers in 2005. 
The ﬁrst pilot applications are now underway. Lean Enterprise is a global initiative launched by GKN 
to drive signiﬁcant improvements in its performance.
Sharon Nash is plant director of GKN Driveline’s
majority-owned Unidrive plant in Clayton, Victoria 
in Australia. In 2003 the plant created a programme
called the ‘The New Way of Working – the Unidrive 
Way’ which set out to align their practices with the 
Lean Enterprise initiative. Between 2003 and 2005 
the plant, which produces automotive sideshafts and
propshafts, has been transformed. There has been a
21% improvement in productivity, the number of parts
per million classiﬁed as rejects has dropped into single
ﬁgures, return on sales has doubled and the accident
frequency rate has been halved. All of this has happened
as a result of a concerted effort by all members of the
450-strong Unidrive team.
Peter Watkins, Global Best Practice Director with Bob Poole, Site Continuous
Improvement Leader (SCIL) at GKN Driveline’s plant in Arnage, near Le Mans
in France. A major element in GKN’s global drive for a Lean Enterprise culture
is the development of a cadre of specialists who can coach and advise plant
leadership and employee teams on how to engage employees and how best
to deploy Lean tools and techniques. Bob Poole became one of the Group’s
ﬁrst ‘ﬂight’ of SCILs during 2005. SCILs are 
recognisable on the shop ﬂoor by their 
distinctive white polo shirts with GKN’s
‘Lean Enterprise’ symbol.

Business review
> Group activities
GKN is a global engineering business serving the automotive, off-highway and
aerospace markets.
Automotive activities comprise GKN Driveline, Powder Metallurgy and Other
Automotive companies which supply a variety of components, largely to the
global car and light vehicle markets.
OffHighway designs and manufactures steel wheels and driveline systems
for the global agricultural, construction and industrial machinery markets.
Aerospace activities are concentrated on structural components, propulsion
systems and special components for both military and civil aerospace
markets.
There are operations in over 30 countries with 36,500 employees in subsidiary
companies and a further 3,400 in joint ventures.
A detailed review of these activities is set out on pages 25 to 29.
> Strategy and business objectives
GKN is committed to providing long-term shareholder value by supplying
outstanding products and services to produce growth in sales and sustained
proﬁtability. We aim to achieve this from:
> market leadership in our business segments through:
– advanced technology, ﬁrst class engineering capability and cost leadership
– exceptional customer service
– global presence and
– world class manufacturing
> focused acquisitions which meet strict rate of return criteria and add to our
technology, global presence or customer base.
Information relating to employees and the Group’s health, safety and
environmental performance in 2005 is given in the corporate social
responsibility review on pages 31 to 36.
> International Financial Reporting Standards
Results for the year have been reported for the ﬁrst time under International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union.
Comparative ﬁgures for 2004 have been restated accordingly but have not
been audited. Reconciliations of key ﬁgures for 2004 between UK GAAP (the
previous basis of reporting) and IFRS are shown at note 37 to the ﬁnancial
statements. 
In this transitional year it is worth noting that one of the key features of IFRS
is the requirement for certain, previously unrecognised, ﬁnancial assets and
liabilities to be recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value at the balance
sheet date. The change in value from one balance sheet date to the next is
reﬂected in the income statement unless hedge accounting is applied. Such
movements (which have no effect on cash ﬂow), together with signiﬁcant
items such as major restructuring costs, asset impairments and proﬁts on
sale of businesses, have been separately disclosed in the income statement
as components of operating proﬁt.
Other features of IFRS which affect the interpretation of performance include
the reporting of the post-tax results of joint ventures as part of the Group’s
pre-tax proﬁt, the exclusion of sales of joint ventures and discontinued
businesses from Group sales and the analysis of post-employment costs
between operating and ﬁnance costs. Post-employment obligations and
related deferred tax assets are also fully recognised on the balance sheet.
> Review of operations
In this review, and elsewhere in the annual report, sales are those of
continuing operations and, in addition to statutory measures of proﬁt, we
have made reference to trading proﬁt, proﬁt before tax and earnings excluding
the impact of restructuring and impairment charges, proﬁts on sale of
businesses and changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments
noted above, since we believe they show more clearly the underlying trend in
performance. 
Where appropriate, reference is also made to results excluding the impact of
both 2004 and 2005 acquisitions and divestments as well as the impact of
currency translation on the results of overseas operations.
> Group performance
Sales of subsidiaries £3,648 million (2004 – £3,481 million)
Sales of continuing subsidiaries were £3,648 million compared with
£3,481 million in 2004. Excluding the impact of currency translation,
acquisitions and divestments the increase was £67 million (2%).
In Automotive businesses, sales of £2,711 million compared with
£2,625 million a year earlier, largely reﬂecting the relatively stable market
conditions in Europe and North America together with some beneﬁt from
currency translation and changes in status from joint venture to subsidiary.
OffHighway sales improved to £310 million from £287 million in 2004.
Excluding divestments made in 2004, the improvement was £38 million (14%)
as a result of market share gains in agricultural and construction machinery
markets and price changes arising from raw material cost increases. 
Aerospace sales showed solid growth as a result of sustained military demand,
an improvement in civil aircraft production and the start of some new
programmes and were £627 million compared with £569 million in 2004.
Trading proﬁt (operating proﬁt of subsidiaries before changes in the fair
value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments, restructuring and impairment
charges and proﬁts on sale of businesses) £228 million (2004 – £214 million)
Group trading proﬁt was £228 million compared with £214 million in 2004,
an increase of £14 million (6.5%). The currency impact on the translation of
overseas proﬁts was small at £5 million positive. Raw material costs were
signiﬁcantly higher than in 2004 with a gross increase of approximately
£54 million and a net impact of some £28 million after some recovery from
customers. There was a net beneﬁt of £6 million from 2004 and 2005
acquisitions and divestments. The charge to trading proﬁt for depreciation,
amortisation and ﬁxed asset impairments fell by £19 million.
Automotive companies’ trading proﬁt totalled £164 million compared with
£169 million in 2004 with the impact of raw material and energy cost increases
being somewhat offset by productivity improvements and lower overheads,
together with the favourable impact of currency (£4 million) and changes in
status of companies (£9 million). Costs of customer defaults in the year of
£6 million were compensated by various one-off credits including the GKN plc 23
Annual Report 2005
settlement of legal and other claims. The margin of trading proﬁt to sales was
6.0% (2004 – 6.4%) as a consequence of only partial recovery of cost
increases in Driveline and Powder Metallurgy and the move from proﬁt to loss
in our Other Automotive businesses.
Some beneﬁt was seen from the previously announced strategic restructuring
actions and asset write-downs both through lower ﬁxed costs and reduced
depreciation.
OffHighway proﬁt reﬂected the strong level of sales and rose by £2 million
(11%) to £20 million. Excluding the impact of 2004 divestments and currency
translation the increase was £5 million (33%). Margin rose to 6.5% from 6.3%
in 2004.
Aerospace proﬁt rose to £54 million from £38 million in 2004, largely as a
consequence of higher sales. Margin improved from 6.7% to 8.6% for the
year as a whole, reaching 9.1% in the second half.
Corporate and unallocated costs of £10 million (2004 – £11 million) represent
stewardship, governance and compliance costs relating to the overall Group
rather than individual businesses.
The overall Group margin was 6.3% compared with 6.1% in 2004, slightly
below the Group’s long-term target range.
Restructuring and impairment costs £98 million (2004 – £262 million)
During the year the Group continued the restructuring announced in the ﬁrst
quarter of 2004. This involves moving some 20% of Driveline production
capacity from high-cost, low-growth economies to the low-cost, high-growth
emerging markets of Eastern Europe, South America and Asia Paciﬁc, together
with further cost reductions in Powder Metallurgy in support of the recovery
of that business and overhead cost reductions elsewhere in the Group. Costs
charged in the year totalled £77 million (2004 – £100 million) with £46 million
(2004 – £36 million) in Driveline, £28 million (2004 – £44 million) in Powder
Metallurgy and £3 million (2004 – £20 million) elsewhere.
In addition, in Automotive businesses, other impairments of £21 million 
arose in respect of a move of production to low-cost regions and related
proﬁtability issues.
Proﬁts on sale of businesses £1 million (2004 – £24 million)
There were no business disposals during the year. The 2005 proﬁt of £1 million
relates to ‘earn-out’ proﬁts of a prior year divestment. The proﬁt of £24 million
in 2004 arose on the disposal of the Group’s tube connecting business
in Germany.
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments £(33) million
(2004 – £nil)
The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge much of its
transactional exposure, including that between Group companies. These have
been accounted for under IAS 39 from 1 January 2005. As permitted by the
standard, prior year ﬁgures have not been restated. At 1 January 2005 the net
fair value of such instruments was an asset of £29 million and at the end of
2005 the ﬁgure was a liability of £13 million. Transactional hedge accounting
has not been applied in 2005 and the difference of £43 million is charged
separately as a component of operating proﬁt. This has been partially offset
by the change in value (£9 million) in embedded derivatives in Aerospace
supply contracts and £1 million in commodity hedges in Powder Metallurgy
leaving a net charge of £33 million.
Operating proﬁt
Operating proﬁt of £98 million compared with a loss of £24 million in 2004,
reﬂecting the movements discussed above.
Post-tax earnings of continuing joint ventures and associated company
£10 million (2004 – £16 million)
The reduction of £6 million in the Group’s share of post-tax earnings of joint
ventures arose largely at the pre-tax level as a consequence of the change in
status of Velcon SA de CV as a subsidiary following the increase in
shareholding which occurred on 1 February 2005, together with lower proﬁts
at Emitec (where sales were down by 8%) and Shanghai GKN Drive Shaft
Company Ltd (as margins reduced slightly). These were partially offset by ﬁrst
time proﬁts from Chassis Systems Ltd, the joint venture with Dana, as the
start-up phase ended. 
Financing costs £35 million (2004 – £75 million)
Interest payable totalled £61 million (2004 – £69 million) which arose mainly
on the £675 million bonds and £30 million debenture in issue. Offsetting this
to some extent was £48 million (2004 – £23 million) interest receivable on
short-term deposits and the beneﬁts of lower borrowing costs on foreign
currency debt used to hedge the Group’s overseas investments. The year-on-
year movement mainly reﬂected a full year’s interest on the £1 billion received
on the divestment of the Group’s shareholding in AgustaWestland at the end
of November 2004.
Other net ﬁnancing charges of £22 million (2004 – £29 million) relate to the
Group’s funded post-employment beneﬁt schemes and consist of interest on
the schemes’ liabilities partially offset by expected returns on assets. The
£7 million reduction in the year arose mainly as a result of the returns credited
in respect of the £100 million contribution prepayment made to the UK scheme
at the end of 2004.
Proﬁt before tax of continuing operations
Total proﬁt before tax excluding restructuring and impairment charges, proﬁts
on sale of businesses and changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial
instruments of £203 million was £48 million higher than the £155 million in
2004 with most of the increase due to the interest received on the
AgustaWestland proceeds noted above. After including these items, the 
ﬁgure for the year was a proﬁt of £73 million (2004 – loss £83 million) as a
consequence of lower charges for restructuring and asset impairments. 
Taxation
The tax charge for the year was £14 million (2004 – £32 million) and
comprised a charge on proﬁt before tax of subsidiaries excluding restructuring
and impairment charges and the change in fair value of derivative ﬁnancial
instruments of £40 million (2004 – £45 million) and credits on restructuring
and impairment charges of £20 million (2004 – £13 million) and on derivative
ﬁnancial instruments of £6 million (2004 – £nil).
The £40 million charge expressed as a percentage of proﬁt before tax of
subsidiaries of £193 million was 21% compared with the 2004 percentage of 24 GKN plc
Annual Report 2005
Business review continued
32% on the same basis. The reduction in rate is largely the result of the
settlement of a number of outstanding issues during the second half of 2005.
Excluding the effect of any prior year items which may impact the tax charge
in 2006, the 2006 tax rate is expected to show a slight increase as a result of
anticipated changes to the geographical mix of proﬁts.
The total effective tax rate was 19.2% (in 2004 there was a loss before tax
caused, in part, by the impairment of goodwill on which tax was not
recoverable).
Discontinued operations
There were no discontinued activities during the year. Figures for 2004
reﬂected the post-tax trading results of AgustaWestland for 11 months to
30 November and of Aerosystems International to 13 August together with
the proﬁts made on their divestment.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share from continuing operations were 7.7p (2004 – loss per
share 16.1p). Before restructuring and impairment charges, proﬁts on sale of
businesses and changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments
the ﬁgure was 22.1p (2004 – 14.6p).
Earnings per share for both continuing and discontinued businesses were
7.7p (2004 – 105.0p). Before restructuring and impairment charges, proﬁts
on sale of businesses and changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial
instruments the ﬁgure was 22.1p (2004 – 23.1p).
Cash ﬂow
Operating cash ﬂow, which GKN deﬁnes as cash generated from operations
(£308 million) adjusted for capital expenditure (£229 million) and proceeds
from the disposal of ﬁxed assets (£9 million), was £88 million compared with
£3 million in 2004.
The inﬂow on working capital and provisions totalled £15 million (2004 – 
£6 million outﬂow) largely reﬂecting continuing tight control of both inventory
and receivables.
Capital expenditure (on tangible and intangible assets) totalled £229 million
(2004 – £195 million). Of this, £206 million (2004 – £180 million) was on
property, plant and equipment and represented 150% of the depreciation
charge. This higher than normal ratio largely reﬂected the cost of investment
in emerging markets and is likely to reduce slightly in 2006 as the restructuring
programme is completed. Thereafter it should return to a level of 1.1 to 1.2 times.
Expenditure on intangible assets totalled £23 million (2004 – £15 million) and
reﬂected initial non-recurring costs on Aerospace programmes and computer
software costs.
Net interest paid totalled £14 million compared with £46 million in 2004 with
the reduction a result of the 2004 AgustaWestland proceeds which were
placed on short-term deposit.
Tax paid in the year was £35 million (2004 – £47 million) due to the timing of
payments and the ﬁgure for 2006 is expected to be slightly higher.
Dividends received from joint ventures totalled £6 million (2004 – £8 million
from continuing businesses and £2 million from discontinued).
The Group monitors free cash ﬂow, which is cash ﬂow excluding acquisitions,
share buybacks and currency translation but including dividends paid. Free
cash ﬂow for the year was an outﬂow of £41 million (2004 – £167 million outﬂow,
including £100 million pension prepayment) mainly due to the £37 million of
expenditure on strategic and other major restructurings. The Group’s balance
sheet remains strong and with continued recovery in our businesses it is
anticipated that following completion of the restructuring, cash generation
will improve markedly.
Acquisitions and divestments
The net expenditure on acquisitions and divestments in the year was
£50 million (2004 – receipts £1,045 million). £35 million (after taking account
of funds in the business at the date of acquisition) was spent on the
acquisition, in February 2005, of the 51% of Velcon SA de CV (renamed GKN
Driveline Celaya SA) not already owned. A further £10 million was spent on the
remaining 16% of Tochigi Fuji Sangyo KK (renamed GKN Driveline Torque
Technology KK) with the balance on a small OffHighway acquisition, offset by
proceeds of £1 million from a prior year earn-out arrangement.
Share buyback
During the year the Group continued the share buyback programme of up to
£100 million initiated in October 2004 and spent £30 million in purchasing
11.9 million shares. At 31 December 2005 the cumulative amount spent was
£60 million on 25.2 million shares which are held in treasury. The buyback
programme will be continued in 2006.
Net borrowings/funds
At the end of the year the Group had net debt of £65 million (2004 – net funds
£65 million). These included the beneﬁt of £50 million (2004 – £53 million)

borrowings in joint ventures was £5 million (2004 – £2 million).
Shareholders’ equity
Shareholders’ equity at the end of 2005 was £875 million compared with
£905 million at the end of 2004. 
Proposed dividend
As noted in the Chairman’s statement on page 11, a ﬁnal dividend of 8.2p per
share is proposed. Together with the interim dividend of 4.0p, the total
dividend for the year will be 12.2p, an increase of 2.5% over the equivalent
ﬁgure for last year. The cash cost to the Group is some £87 million. The
dividend is covered 1.8 times (2004 – 1.9 times) by earnings before the impact
of restructuring and impairment charges, proﬁts on sale of businesses and
changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments. 
> Divisional developments and performance
Automotive
Markets
Car and light vehicle production is a key driver of performance in our
Automotive businesses. By comparison with 2004, production in Western
Europe was marginally down while North America was ﬂat.
Overall Western European production of 16.2 million vehicles was down by
1.7% with reductions in Italy (12%), Spain (7%) and the UK (3%) partially
offset by an increase in the larger market of Germany (3%).
North American production in 2005 of 15.8 million vehicles was level with
2004. In the US, however, there continued to be a major shift in Vehicle
Manufacturers’ (VM) market shares with both General Motors and Ford losing
share, largely to the beneﬁt of Japanese manufacturers.
By contrast, there was strong growth in production in the emerging markets
of Brazil (10%) and India (8%) whilst, after a slow ﬁrst half, China improved
by 15% for the year as a whole.
Current expectations for 2006 are for a similar pattern to apply in Western
Europe and North America which are both forecast to be level with 2005.
Elsewhere, external forecasts are for Brazil to fall slightly before recovering in
2007 while China and India are likely to increase production over the next
few years, largely to satisfy domestic demand. 
GKN Driveline
Products and markets
GKN Driveline specialises in the manufacture of components for light vehicle
drivelines (deﬁned as the components that transfer torque between a vehicle’s
transmission and its driven wheels). These include geared components
(transfer cases, power transfer units and ﬁnal drive units), torque management
devices (TMDs) and driveshafts (propshafts for longitudinal power
transmission and sideshafts for lateral transmission). The segment comprises
GKN Driveline Driveshafts (GKN Driveshafts), GKN Driveline Torque Technology
Group, Industrial and Distribution Services, and Speciality Vehicles. 
GKN Driveshafts is the global leader in the production of constant velocity
jointed (CVJ) products for use in light vehicle drivelines. The majority of CVJs
are used in sideshafts for front wheel drive, rear wheel drive and four wheel
drive vehicles; CVJ sideshafts are required for every driven axle with
independent suspension. Some, but not all, longitudinal propshafts are also
ﬁtted with CVJs. 
In 2005, based on internal estimates, GKN Driveshafts’ businesses, including
its joint ventures, produced over 40% of CVJs for the global light vehicle
market. The market share of the next largest producer is estimated at 16%
with nearly 25% of CVJs produced by VMs’ in-house operations. The strong
order win rate achieved during the year continues to underpin our market share.
GKN Driveshafts manufactures CVJs and related products in 21 countries
across all major vehicle producing regions of the world and has enjoyed
considerable success in developing markets, with strong market shares of
some 85% in South America and 52% in the Asia Paciﬁc region (excluding
Japan and South Korea).
GKN Driveshafts is also one of the largest suppliers of premium propshafts,
which we deﬁne as those propshafts with sophisticated joints, materials or
other features. We estimate that in 2005 premium propshafts represented
approximately 35% of global light vehicle propshaft demand, or some 
10 million propshaft assemblies. GKN Driveshafts’ share of this segment was
in the region of 20%.
GKN Driveline Torque Technology Group (TTG) produces a wide range of
driveline components aimed at managing the ﬂow of torque to the driven
wheels based on road conditions, vehicle situation and driver intent. TMDs are
mechanical (passive) or electro-mechanical (active) devices that improve

vehicle performance and handling by controlling the ﬂow of torque throughout
the driveline.
GKN offers a complete range of TMD solutions as both stand-alone and
integrated devices to VMs and to certain tier one suppliers. We estimate that
in 2005 GKN supplied approximately 18% of TMDs for light vehicle
applications globally. Sales volumes of our electronically controlled coupling
devices (ETM and EMCD) are expected to increase progressively, building
upon our established passive product range, including the Viscodrive and
Super LSD product families.
Geared components are currently approximately half of TTG’s annual sales,
realised through installation on many successful all wheel drive and four wheel
drive vehicles. We are also involved in many active development projects on
future vehicle programmes and the ﬁrst high volume production programme
will be launched in the US in 2006. We continue to beneﬁt from above market
growth in power transfer units and ﬁnal drive units as VMs increasingly
introduce new ‘crossover’ vehicles that combine four wheel drive with car-like
dynamics, comfort and improved fuel economy. Our products are well
positioned for success in these areas. 
Our Industrial and Distribution Services (IDS) business provides a
comprehensive range of new and remanufactured sideshafts and components
for the passenger vehicle aftermarket. It also provides a service to repair and
replace heavy truck propshafts and also engineers and produces low volume,
highly specialised driveline components from its remanufacturing plants,
warehouses and service facilities throughout Europe. The Speciality Vehicles
business services non-automotive markets, such as marine and all-terrain,
with driveline components. 
2005 Highlights
Driveline subsidiaries’ sales in the year totalled £1,993 million compared with
£1,899 million in 2004. £31 million of the increase was accounted for by the
impact of currency translation while £92 million arose from the inclusion of
sales of Velcon from 1 February 2005 and a full year contribution from Tochigi
Fuji Sangyo following their change in status to subsidiaries. There was a small
(£3 million) reduction in respect of IDS businesses transferred to OffHighway.
The underlying decrease of £26 million largely reﬂected the slightly lower
demand in Western Europe noted above and changes in model mix.
Strong sales growth was seen in Driveline’s joint venture operations although
these are not shown in the Group accounts.
Trading proﬁt of £154 million was £2 million (1%) below 2004. After taking
into account the favourable impact of currency (£4 million) and acquisitions
(£12 million) there was a reduction of £18 million which mainly reﬂected the
impact of raw material (£34 million) and energy cost increases. 
The restructuring programme to move productive capacity from high-cost, low-
growth mature markets to the low-cost, high-growth emerging markets of Asia,
South America and Eastern Europe accelerated during the year. The closures
of two US and one European plant were announced, the cost of which in the
year was £29 million, whilst a new forging plant was opened in Poland and
manufacturing facilities were expanded in Slovenia, Poland, Mexico and Brazil.
As a result, divisional capital expenditure on tangible assets at £115 million
(2004 – £101 million) was 1.6 times the depreciation charge of £74 million
(2004 – £81 million). It is anticipated that the ratio will reduce somewhat in
2006 and return to the normal level of 1.1 to 1.2 times in 2007.
£71 million (2004 – £74 million) was incurred on research and development
and was charged to proﬁt in the year. Much of this was incremental
development on existing applications but our research efforts produced the
most signiﬁcant advance in CVJ design for many years and, in November, we
announced details of our countertrack
TM
and crosstrack
TM
technologies. These
give a weight advantage as well as the possibility of improved turning circles
or increased vehicle wheelbase with the same turning circle. Their application
is now attracting considerable interest from vehicle designers and their
patented design is seen as fundamental in maintaining GKN Driveline’s
technological leadership.
TTG continued to drive operational efﬁciency and reduce costs, disposing of
minor non-core subsidiaries, announcing the closure of a site and concluding
a voluntary redundancy programme involving some 130 employees. At the
same time, pension arrangements were changed and a multi-employer
scheme exited which signiﬁcantly reduced the pension liability that existed
when the company was acquired.
There were positive developments in the expansion of the business with
signiﬁcant wins with all major Japanese VMs, particularly new business
secured with Toyota, conﬁrming TTG as a tier one supplier in Japan. Against
this, however, the cancellation of the General Motors 361 vehicle platform, on
which GKN had been awarded the high volume TMD, was a disappointment. 
In-depth technology forums were held with a number of Japanese and
European VMs and tier one partners to demonstrate product development
and systems integration capabilities. These were well received and have led
to a number of strategic joint development programmes.
Powder Metallurgy
Products and markets
GKN’s Powder Metallurgy business produces metal powder and sintered
products which are largely iron based, although growth is currently seen in the
use of aluminium and other alloys. Although market statistics are somewhat
imprecise, GKN estimates that it has in the region of 16% global market share
in the sintered product business with sales to major automotive and industrial
original equipment manufacturers and ﬁrst tier suppliers. 
GKN’s sintered component production takes place in the Americas, Europe
and Asia Paciﬁc with the highest growth rates in the Asia Paciﬁc region. It is

signiﬁcantly larger than its competition and as such is well placed to drive
technology leadership in product and process through the leverage of global
resources. This global manufacturing footprint continues to develop with the
establishment of further operations in India and China to support new
business secured in the region.
Hoeganaes is the largest producer of metal powder in North America with
more than 50% market share. It has also continued its development outside
the US, particularly through growth in Europe due to increased usage by GKN’s
own sintering companies in this region. Hoeganaes’ sales to external
customers accounted for some 50% of its shipments and just over 10% of the
Powder Metallurgy division’s sales. The European business, centred on a plant
in Romania, continued to develop steadily, albeit from a small base. 
Growth in Powder Metallurgy is expected to continue, fuelled primarily by
substitution for cast or forged components.
2005 Highlights
Sales in the year of £588 million compared with £590 million in 2004.
Excluding the impact of currency translation the reduction was £7 million
(1.2%). This reduction arose entirely in the US sintering business which was
down by 8% on the previous year, reﬂecting lower sales to its major customers
General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler. Elsewhere there was 3% growth in
Europe, and 15% in the Rest of the World albeit from a low base. Hoeganaes
(13% of sales) in the US also saw lower volumes as overall US powder
consumption fell by 8% in 2005 despite the generally ﬂat market, primarily
as a result of the change in vehicle mix away from large Sports Utility Vehicles
(SUVs) to passenger cars. Hoeganaes’ sales value, however, was essentially
ﬂat with lower volumes largely offset by higher revenues from the recovery of
scrap steel cost.
In spite of considerable increases in raw material costs totalling some 
£13 million, trading proﬁt improved to £12 million from £5 million in 2004.
This reﬂected operational and productivity improvements in the US together
with lower depreciation costs and some price recovery from customers.
The Sinter Metals restructuring programme announced in 2004 continued
during the year and has contributed to an encouraging improvement in
performance. As noted above, plant consolidation has been extended to
further accelerate recovery. In 2005 we initiated discussions over the viability
of our Romulus, Michigan plant which concluded in January 2006. Also, in
January 2006 we announced the closure of the UK factory at Lichﬁeld. North
American asset impairments, primarily in respect of Romulus, of £17 million
have all been charged as restructuring in the 2005 accounts together with
impairments of £4 million in respect of another Sinter facility. Costs associated
with plant closures in the US and the UK, primarily redundancy, are estimated
at £25 million and will be reﬂected in 2006.
In Hoeganaes, an impairment charge of £5 million was recognised in respect
of North American plant no longer considered viable in light of expected
changes in the business.
Divisional capital expenditure on plant and equipment at £43 million (2004
– £54 million) was high when measured against depreciation of £27 million
(2004 – £40 million). The former was inﬂated by investment in support of new
business won in 2003 and 2004 which has yet to be reﬂected in revenue, and
the latter lower due to prior year asset impairments. The ratio of 1.6 times is
expected to reduce somewhat in 2006.
During the year there were a number of important business wins. Sinter won
new business worth $180 million per annum which will support a return to 5%
to 8% annual growth and also developed its customer base into Japan and
Korea. In Hoeganaes new programmes are expected to result in increased
market share in both 2006 and, particularly, 2007.
Other Automotive
Products and markets
Our Other Automotive activities which are predominantly UK-based, but with
facilities in the US and China, manufacture structural components, chassis
and engine cylinder liners for the passenger car, SUV and light vehicle and
truck markets in Western Europe and the US. 
2005 Highlights
Other Automotive sales by subsidiaries of £130 million were £6 million (4%)
below 2004, mainly reﬂecting the cessation of the Thompson Chassis
business during the second half of 2004. The major replacement programme
is being conducted through our Chassis Systems Ltd joint venture with Dana.
A disappointing loss of £2 million was incurred in the year as a result of the
business transfers and cessation noted above and higher raw material costs.
This compared with a proﬁt of £8 million in 2004 which was favourably
impacted by end of platform life beneﬁts.
Late in 2005, in conjunction with a local minority partner, a low-cost Chinese
cylinder liner facility, which will serve both existing and emerging markets,
began production. As a consequence, and in order to re-align the UK cost
base, in January 2006 we announced a redundancy programme at GKN
Sheepbridge Stokes Ltd. The cost of this will be charged in 2006. Trading
performance in 2005 and future projections for the UK business necessitated
an impairment review which has led to an impairment charge of £10 million
being recognised in the 2005 accounts. This is included within the
restructuring and impairment line in the income statement.
Emitec
Emitec, our 50% joint venture with Siemens, manufactures metallic substrates
for catalytic converters in Germany and the US. Their results are reported in
post-tax earnings of joint ventures.
In terms of trading, 2005 sales were 8% lower than in 2004. This largely arose
in Germany where customer demand fell and legislation requiring the
retroﬁtting of particulate ﬁlter catalysts for diesel engines was delayed. This
is now expected to be enacted in 2006 and is likely to result in growth from
2007 onwards.
OffHighway
Products and markets
OffHighway designs and manufactures steel wheels and driveline systems
for the global agricultural, construction and industrial machinery sectors.
During 2005, approximately 60% of its sales were to the agricultural market,
25% to the construction equipment market and 15% to the industrial
machinery market. 28 GKN plc
Annual Report 2005
Business review continued
Agriculture
In Europe (48% of divisional sales) the overall agricultural machinery market
in 2005 was slightly below the previous year with increased production of
combine harvesters and hay tools being offset by a decline in the production
of tractors. 
In North America (12% of divisional sales) the picture was similar with overall
year-on-year demand some 3% lower as a result of production of both tractors
and combines being down from the record levels of 2004. 
Industry forecasts are for a slight decline in both markets in 2006.
Construction
In 2005, global construction markets have continued to grow at the record
levels seen in the second half of 2004. This was somewhat against earlier
expectations with the dampening of demand in China being offset by
continued strong growth in North America and Europe which account for 13%
and 11% of divisional sales, respectively. Construction markets are likely to
remain strong in 2006.
Industrial machinery
This sector (15% of divisional sales) includes products for the material
handling, mining and other related industries. Demand in 2005 was higher
than the previous year, led by increased sales of fork lift trucks and mining
vehicles. The outlook for 2006 is for little change in demand.
2005 Highlights
OffHighway sales of £310 million were £23 million higher than 2004 which
included eight months’ results from a German tube connecting subsidiary
which was sold in August 2004. Adjusting for this and the impact of currency,
small portfolio changes and minor acquisitions towards the end of 2005, sales
showed a £38 million (14%) increase over the previous year as a result of
signiﬁcant market share gains and contract wins together with some beneﬁt
from the recovery of raw material cost increases.
Trading proﬁt as reported increased to £20 million (2004 – £18 million) but
on a comparable company and currency basis there was an increase 
of £5 million (33%), reﬂecting both volume increases and operating
efﬁciencies, some of which were achieved through plant rationalisations in
Europe and Canada.
The business expanded its product portfolio in the last quarter of 2005 and
January 2006 with two small acquisitions, which have combined annualised
sales of approximately £18 million, and has also opened new facilities in
Brazil and China. Technological improvement in rim reinforcement design for
off-highway wheels has resulted in lower cost manufacture and has also
opened up new markets in forestry equipment.
Aerospace 
Products and markets
GKN Aerospace is a global ﬁrst tier supplier of airframe structures,
components, assemblies and engineering services to aircraft prime
contractors and operates in two main product areas, Aerostructures and
Propulsion Systems and Special Products.
As a leader in the design and manufacture of advanced composites,
transparencies and complex metal structures at the component and assembly
level we serve all the major airframe and engine original equipment
manufacturers. Products and services are provided to both ﬁxed wing and
rotary wing manufacturers, with some 60% of sales in the US. Current annual
sales are approximately 65% to military and 35% to civil customers. 
The overall aerospace market showed continued signs of improvement in
2005, with sustained strength in the military sector and higher demand in
the civil market. Airbus and Boeing delivered in aggregate 660 aircraft in 2005,
up from 605 in 2004. The civil sector is ﬁrmly into an upswing and is likely to
experience strong short-term growth. Military demand is largely driven by US
defence spending and, notwithstanding the four-yearly review of programme
commitments, is likely to remain solid.
GKN Aerospace has secured business on key new international programmes
such as the Airbus A400M Military Transport, the Boeing 787, the F-35 Joint
Strike Fighter and the Northrop X-47B Joint Unmanned Combat Air System.
These successes have been supported by GKN Aerospace’s continuing
strength in material, manufacturing and systems technologies.
Market trends continue to indicate signiﬁcant growth opportunities for GKN
Aerospace driven by increased use of composite materials on new platforms
and engines. 
2005 Highlights
GKN Aerospace sales were £627 million compared with £569 million in 2004.
There was a £3 million beneﬁt from currency translation and excluding this the
increase was £55 million (10%). The increase was the result of strong defence
sales, engineering contract work on new programmes, growth in the civil
aircraft market and the commencement of production on earlier contract wins.

Annual Report 2005
Trading proﬁt of £54 million was £16 million above 2004. Excluding the impact
of currency, the increase was £15 million (39%) which reﬂected not only the
higher sales level but also improved operational performance, productivity
and continued cost reduction initiatives and the absence of asset write-downs
which had impacted 2004.
During the year the Advanced Composite Development Centre was opened on
the Isle of Wight in the UK. The immediate goal of the Centre will be to reduce
the current cost of carbon ﬁbre composite structures from today’s values,
through a combination of qualiﬁcation of new raw products and automated
manufacturing methods and techniques.
Major development milestones were successfully achieved on a number of
new programmes including the manufacture of the ﬁrst GEnx composite
engine fan casing and important components for the Joint Strike Fighter.
Although no new major aircraft programmes were launched during the year,
the division was still able to secure additional incremental business across a
range of existing programmes with an estimated value of over $500 million.
> Other ﬁnancial matters
Treasury management
GKN co-ordinates all treasury activities through a central function, the purpose
of which is to manage the ﬁnancial risks of the Group as described below and
to secure short and long-term funding at the minimum cost to the Group. The
central treasury function operates within a framework of clearly deﬁned Board
approved policies and procedures, including permissible funding and hedging
instruments, exposure limits and a system of authorities for the approval and
execution of transactions. It operates on a cost centre basis and is not
permitted to make use of ﬁnancial instruments or other derivatives other than
to hedge identiﬁed exposures of the Group. Speculative use of such
instruments or derivatives is not permitted. 
The central treasury function prepares a formal twice-yearly report to the Board,
as well as formal monthly reports for the Finance Director and other senior
executives of the Group. In addition, the gross and net indebtedness of the
Group is reported on a weekly basis to the Chief Executive and the Finance
Director, whilst liquidity, interest rate, currency and other ﬁnancial risk
exposures are monitored daily. The central treasury function is subject to an
annual internal and external review of controls.
Funding and liquidity
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of retained earnings and
borrowing facilities, including bank and capital markets borrowings and
leasing. The relative proportions of equity and borrowings are governed by
speciﬁc Board approved parameters. These are designed to preserve prudent
ﬁnancial ratios, including interest, dividend and cash ﬂow cover, whilst also
minimising the overall weighted average cost of capital to the Group.
All the Group’s borrowing facilities are arranged by the central treasury function
and the funds raised are then lent to operating subsidiaries on commercial
arm’s-length terms. In some cases operating subsidiaries have external
borrowings, but these are supervised and controlled centrally. The Group’s
objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and ﬂexibility
through borrowing at a range of maturities from both capital markets and 
bank sources.
Bank borrowings are principally in the form of ﬁve-year committed multi-
currency bilateral revolving credit facilities with a group of relationship banks.
There were no borrowings against these facilities as at 31 December 2005.
Capital markets borrowing of £705 million includes unsecured issues of
£350 million 6.75% bonds maturing in 2019 and £325 million 7% bonds
maturing in 2012, together with £30 million debenture stock of Westland
Group plc which is secured on assets of that company and certain of its
subsidiaries. 
At the year end the Group had committed borrowing facilities of
£1,087 million, of which £737 million was drawn. The weighted average
maturity proﬁle of the Group’s committed borrowings was 9.9 years. This
leaves the Group well placed to fund its strategic growth plans and to
withstand any sudden changes in liquidity in the ﬁnancial markets.
The Group also has access to signiﬁcant lines of uncommitted funds which are
used principally to manage day-to-day liquidity. Wherever practicable, pooling,
netting or concentration techniques are employed to minimise gross debt.
At the year end the Group had £542 million on deposit in the UK mainly held
in money market funds or with banks at maturities of three months or less. 
Risk management
The Group is exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In the normal
course of business, the Group also faces risks that are either non-ﬁnancial or
non-quantiﬁable, including country and credit risk.
The Group uses interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward rate agreements,
netting techniques and forward exchange contracts as required to manage
the primary market exposures associated with its underlying assets, liabilities
and anticipated transactions.
Counterparty credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance
by counterparties to ﬁnancial instruments. Credit risk is mitigated by the
Group’s policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment
graded long-term credit rating, normally at least AA– or equivalent, and
assigning ﬁnancial limits to individual counterparties.
Interest rate risk
The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost
and reduce volatility in reported earnings. This policy is achieved by
maintaining a target range of ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate debt for discrete annual
periods, over a deﬁned time horizon. This is achieved partly through the ﬁxed
rate character of the underlying debt instrument, and partly through the use
of straightforward derivatives (forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps
and swaptions). The Group’s normal policy is to require interest rates to be
ﬁxed for 30% to 70% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast to arise
over a 12-month horizon. However, this policy was suspended in December
2004 as it was deemed inappropriate given the absence of ﬂoating rate bank
debt following the receipt of the sale proceeds of GKN’s share in
AgustaWestland. Consequently, as at 31 December 2005, 89% of the Group’s
gross ﬁnancial liabilities were at ﬁxed rates of interest, whilst the weighted
average period in respect of which interest has been ﬁxed was 9.9 years. 30 GKN plc
Annual Report 2005
Business review continued
Currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or
purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries’
functional currency. Under the Group’s foreign exchange policy, such
transaction exposures are hedged once they are known, mainly through the
use of forward foreign exchange contracts. The Group has a signiﬁcant
investment in overseas operations, particularly in continental Europe and the
Americas. As a result, the sterling value of the Group’s balance sheet can be
affected by movements in exchange rates. The Group therefore seeks to
mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures by matching the
net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their
functional currencies, except where signiﬁcant adverse interest differentials
or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing either directly (in either the local domestic or
euro-currency markets), or indirectly through the use of rolling annual forward
foreign exchange contracts. Borrowings created through the use of such
contracts amounted to £631 million at 31 December 2005 and were
denominated in US dollars (36%), euro (50%) and Japanese yen (14%). 
Pensions and post-employment obligations
GKN operates a number of deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution schemes
across the Group. The total charge to trading proﬁt in respect of current and
past service costs was £35 million (2004 – £32 million), whilst other net
ﬁnancing charges included in net ﬁnancing costs were £22 million (2004 –
£29 million).
The decrease in other net ﬁnancing charges reﬂects the higher expected return
on pension scheme assets from the increased level of assets at the start of
2005. This resulted in part from the £100 million prepayment made by the
Group to the UK pension scheme in December 2004. The higher expected
return was partially offset by an increase in the notional interest charge on
higher pension scheme liabilities. Further information including asset, liability
and mortality assumptions used is provided in note 31 to the ﬁnancial
statements.
UK pensions
The UK deﬁned beneﬁt scheme is considered to be relatively mature as only
5,000 of its 56,600 members are currently in service. As a UK deﬁned beneﬁt
scheme, this is run on a funded basis with funds set aside in trust to cover
future liabilities to members. A £100 million prepayment towards the UK
deﬁcit was made in December 2004. The Group has also announced its
intention to make a further payment of £200 million in 2006. No further deﬁcit
payments are planned in 2006.
The charge relating to UK post-employment beneﬁts reﬂected in trading proﬁt
in respect of current and past service costs was £16 million (2004 –
£14 million), whilst other net ﬁnancing charges included in net ﬁnancing 
costs were £5 million (2004 – £12 million).
The deﬁcit at £449 million (2004 – £455 million) was largely unchanged from
the end of 2004 as the increase in asset values from higher actual returns
was largely offset by the higher net present value of liabilities from the 
55 basis point reduction in the discount rate.
Overseas pensions
The principal regions involved are the Americas, continental Europe and the
Rest of the World.
The charge to trading proﬁt relating to overseas post-employment obligations
in respect of current and past service costs was £19 million (2004 –
£18 million), whilst other net ﬁnancing charges included in net ﬁnancing costs
were £17 million (2004 – £17 million).
The increase in the deﬁcit of £20 million to £419 million (2004 – £399 million)
was largely as a result of the higher net present value of liabilities from
reductions in discount rates and revised mortality assumptions.
Summary
In total, at 31 December 2005 the deﬁcit was £885 million (2004 –
£854 million) for the reasons stated earlier.
Financial resources and going concern
At 31 December 2005 the Group had net borrowings of £65 million. In addition
it had available, but undrawn, committed borrowing facilities totalling
£350 million.
Having assessed the future funding requirements of the Group and the
Company, the Directors are of the opinion that it is appropriate for the accounts
to be prepared on a going concern basis.
Cautionary statement
The business review and certain other sections of this annual report contain
forward looking statements that are subject to risk factors associated with,
amongst other things, the economic and business circumstances occurring
from time to time in the countries and sectors in which the Group operates. It
is believed that the expectations reﬂected in these statements are reasonable
but they may be affected by a wide range of variables which could cause actual
results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. GKN plc 31
Annual Report 2005
Corporate social responsibility review
> Living our Values
GKN’s approach to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is underpinned by a
set of enduring values focused on customers and quality, enterprise and
innovation, people and the community, the environment and business ethics.
These have guided our behaviour for almost 250 years. 
Our commitment to continuous improvement in everything we do led us to
reappraise, in early 2005, how the Values are applied throughout the Group.
Whilst the V alues remain central to the way in which GKN operates, we decided
to reinforce them by developing The GKN Code. The Code provides a framework
for the behaviour of all employees whatever their job, wherever they are
located. It is supported by a number of policies, some of which update existing
policies and some of which are new. The Code and Policies are progressively
being implemented throughout all of our businesses and will be available in
some 20 languages.
> The GKN Code and Policies
The GKN Code is designed to ensure that our business in all its aspects
continues to be run in an ethical, socially responsible and sustainable 
manner by:
> complying with all relevant laws and regulations wherever we operate and
conducting our business with integrity and in such a manner as to reinforce
our reputation;
> maximising shareholder value whilst safeguarding shareholders’ investment
by combining high standards of business performance with high standards
of corporate governance and risk management;
> providing excellent products and services to our customers and seeking to
win new business through fair competition;
> dealing honestly and fairly with our suppliers and sub-contractors;
> treating our employees justly and with respect, recognising their abilities
and differences, rewarding them for their achievements and providing them
with a healthy and safe working environment;
> playing our part in the protection of the environment both in the operation
of our facilities and the design of our products; and 
> contributing positively to the communities in which we operate.
These principles are underpinned by policies relating to ethical standards
(including a speciﬁc policy on the appointment of agents and consultants),
employment, health and safety, business continuity, competition law, supplier
management, environment (including a speciﬁc policy on energy), community,
data protection and employee disclosure (whistleblowing).
It is the responsibility of all companies in the Group and all employees to
ensure that The GKN Code is followed and that we comply with the Policies.
> CSR framework
The Governance and Risk Sub-Committee has responsibility for developing
strategy for and providing oversight and direction on all matters relating to
governance, risk management and CSR with a view to ensuring that all GKN
businesses act as good corporate citizens and in accordance with GKN’s
Values. As part of its remit the Sub-Committee developed The GKN Code and
Policies during 2005. It is chaired by Grey Denham, Company Secretary; other
members include business leaders from different divisions and geographical
locations, together with specialists in governance, risk, ﬁnancial control,
human resources and corporate communications. The Sub-Committee reports
regularly to the Executive Committee of the Board and a formal presentation
is made annually to the Board.
The Sub-Committee works closely with the Group Risk Management Council
(GRMC), the policy advisory and steering group on accidental risk and
sustainable development. The GRMC provides oversight and direction on the
management of accidental risk across GKN. It also develops strategy for and
reports on the progress of key elements of sustainable development within
GKN. It is supported in its role by Divisional Risk Management Councils which
ensure that best practice processes are embedded within the Group’s
operations.
Maureen Constantine, Group Human Resources Director, has responsibility for
ensuring that appropriate health, safety and environmental programmes are
in place throughout the Group and that performance is reviewed regularly.
Grey Denham, together with the internal audit department and the Audit
Committee, oversees compliance with Group Policies.
> Governance and risk
The management of social responsibility issues is an integral part of the
Group’s overall corporate governance procedures and therefore this review
should be read in conjunction with the corporate governance statement on
pages 90 to 94. The management of risks associated with CSR issues is
encompassed within the internal control procedures described in that section.
From 2006, as part of these procedures, Group companies will be required to
conﬁrm twice-yearly that they operate in compliance with The GKN Code and
the Policies. 
The most signiﬁcant risks that we have identiﬁed in relation to social
responsibility issues are loss of reputation resulting from the manner of
operation of our businesses and safety issues arising from quality or design
of our products. Both of these could, potentially, impact shareholder value
signiﬁcantly as well as our employees and the communities in which we
operate. In environmental terms, our manufacturing processes are not
inherently high risk, nevertheless great care is taken to prevent any adverse
impact arising.
> Assurance
The Group operates globally and it is therefore appropriate that our approach
to social responsibility is global. Accordingly, this review covers all of our
subsidiary operations worldwide. It also embraces our joint venture companies
through an open exchange of information and ideas. Where practicable
performance data is collected from those companies. The performance data
presented in this review has been the subject of self-certiﬁcation together
with some independent veriﬁcation of data or data collection processes as
described below.
GKN supports the terms of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and continues to work towards
ensuring that there is no breach of these within its businesses. Our ultimate
aim is to ensure that similar standards operate throughout our supply chains. 32 GKN plc
Annual Report 2005
Corporate social responsibility review continued
> How we operate
Over the past ﬁve years we have developed a set of tools and enablers that
embed continuous improvement in all aspects of the way we do business.
Through the progressive use of a Business Excellence Model as a strategic
analysis tool we prioritise strategic actions, conduct gap analysis, apply
consistent measurements, and focus on proactive improvement and
knowledge sharing, which collectively drive change through the organisation
and across all business processes. CSR is a key element within the Business
Excellence Model. All divisions have undertaken high level assessments and
150 assessments at regional and plant level have also been completed. 
Within the Group there are 170 trained assessors who provide momentum 
to the process.
The three Sub-Committees of the Executive Committee – the Technology
Sub-Committee, the Lean Enterprise Sub-Committee, and the Governance and
Risk Sub-Committee – have made a signiﬁcant contribution during 2005.
Through their work, we ensure that we establish clear leadership accountability,
continue to operate as a global entity with common processes and ways of
working where appropriate, carry out process measurement and improvement
activities, and share knowledge and best practice to ensure we deliver against
our objectives. For GKN a key component of our Business Excellence Model is
‘Lean Enterprise’, a speciﬁc set of enablers and measures that drive
continuous improvement of our production, business and people processes.
Under the oversight of the Lean Enterprise Sub-Committee three councils have
been established, the People Excellence Council, the Production Excellence
Council and the Business Process Excellence Council. Whilst all three Councils
have an important role to play in achieving excellence, the People Excellence
Council has a particularly pivotal role. People excellence provides the
foundation on which production excellence and business process excellence
are built. Its major objective is the establishment and deployment of
the principle of ‘Development for All’, ensuring that the Group has the 
right skills and competence at all levels in the organisation to achieve its
strategic objectives.
> Enabling our people to meet their full potential
In building a sustainable business, GKN’s people are of paramount
importance. Operating in over 30 countries, with almost 40,000 employees,
we recognise the importance of respecting local and national cultures and of
enabling our people to understand and deal with the impact of economic and
business changes in their working lives. We embrace diversity in all aspects
of our business and work consistently to build an inclusive culture.
To fulﬁl our vision of growth and the creation of shareholder value, we must
have knowledgeable, skilled and competent people. Development plans and
opportunities are in place at all levels in the organisation. We continue to
operate apprenticeship schemes and a graduate development programme
(the International Leadership Development Programme) to provide
engineering and leadership capability for the future. Our training programmes
encourage learning and sharing of technical know-how across companies and
divisions. Our programme of employee international assignments helps to
promote cross-cultural awareness as well as providing excellent development
opportunities. There are currently almost 100 assignees in 20 countries across
the Group with an average length of assignment of some three years.
We collaborate with a number of external bodies associated with sector skills
development as well as professional and educational institutions. Work
experience opportunities are provided for schools and colleges local to our
facilities and in some cases we contribute to curriculum development.
Our organisational capability is reviewed through a rigorous Organisational
and Management Development Review conducted at regional, divisional and
Group level on an annual basis. The effectiveness of our development and
succession plans is reviewed annually by the Board.
We conduct training programmes and technical events, some of which also
beneﬁt other stakeholders. A number of technical forums have been held with
global customers and, as part of the deployment of Lean Enterprise training,
supply chain management training (which commenced in 2005) will
become a focal point in 2006, some elements of which will cascade into the
supply chain.
Employee feedback
We welcome feedback from our employees and believe employee surveys are
an effective means of soliciting employee opinion. All companies are required
to conduct an employee survey every two years.
As a precursor to the 2005 International Leadership Conference, a Leadership
Survey of the 210 delegates was conducted to assess the extent to which
leadership behaviours are aligned with GKN’s Values. The results suggested
strong alignment but with a need for more focus on involvement with the
communities in which we operate. The new Community Policy will identify
ways of contributing more positively to the community including, for example,
greater use of work placements, involvement in local environmental projects,
readiness to respond in local or national emergencies, and governorships on
school and college boards and similar bodies.

> Our commitment to the community
During 2005, GKN’s businesses and employees again made a signiﬁcant
contribution to the communities in which we operate. Cash donations were
made to many local, national and international projects including the
international relief funds established for victims of the Asian tsunami in
December 2004 and for those affected by the Kashmiri earthquake and by
Hurricane Katrina in the US. Those organisations to which cash contributions
were made are listed on the GKN website at www.gkn.com. 
Total community support during the year amounted to some £902,200. The
tremendous achievements of our employees at GKN Driveline Rayong,
Thailand, in providing support to victims of the tsunami are referred to on
page 17. Other examples of community support include:
Asia Paciﬁc – Amongst the many community activities in which GKN Driveline
India is actively involved is a project to provide a basic infrastructure to
disabled children with special learning needs. The company provides funding
and assistance to a local day care centre which provides specialist educational
services for the children in areas such as sensory training, personal
independence, speech therapy, physiotherapy and elementary craft training.
The Americas – GKN Driveline in Brazil continued its successful Renascer
Project, initiated in 1994, to provide young people from low income families
with opportunities for personal and professional development. Working in
partnership with local schools the company offers three-year placements to
students to give them experience of manufacturing. In recognition of this and
the many other community projects in which it is involved, the company won
a national award for social accountability in 2005.
South Africa – GKN Sinter Metals Cape Town has taken a proactive approach
to AIDS education for employees since 1999 and activities were dramatically
stepped up in December 2004 to coincide with World AIDS Day. A system of
Peer Group Educators was established to encourage employees to have HIV
screening and counselling and also to make positive lifestyle choices. They
engaged in a range of activities, also involving employees from neighbouring
companies, including role play and training videos. The company is committed
to ﬁnding further innovative ways in which to help employees address this
extremely important issue.
Europe – GKN Driveline Bruneck in Italy involved more than 800 children in
local elementary schools in a project entitled ‘Step by Step’ which, through
various initiatives including workshops, competitions and discussions,
increased their awareness of the environmental impact of mobility and of the
kind of behaviour that could have a more positive impact on the environment.
In a related project, local children built a model car giving them basic technical
knowledge and increasing their enthusiasm for teamworking.
> Working with our stakeholders
We deﬁne stakeholder as any person or organisation who is affected by, or
whose actions impact upon, our business. These include customers, local
communities, shareholders, suppliers, employees, business partners, local
authorities, government agencies and non-governmental organisations
(NGOs). We engage with these stakeholders in a variety of ways.
As part of our aim to contribute positively to the communities in which we
operate, wherever possible we employ local labour in our businesses. We
invest in local community projects both by way of ﬁnancial donations and
through the volunteer work of our employees, particularly in less developed
countries. 
Over the last few years, a number of meetings have been held with major
shareholders and NGOs to discuss the Group’s performance with regard to
corporate social responsibility and it is our intention to continue to seek
dialogue with major stakeholders.
We are aware that there are some investment organisations and individuals
who are concerned by companies’ involvement in the defence industry.
Following the sale of our helicopter joint venture, AgustaWestland, GKN’s
primary interest in defence equipment is through GKN Aerospace which is a
ﬁrst tier supplier of aerospace structures, propulsion systems and special
products for US and European military aircraft programmes. All sales outside
domestic markets are strictly in accordance with the relevant government
export approval procedures.
In addition to the impact of our own activities, the impact of our supply
partners and the products we manufacture both during their life and in their
end of life phase are of increasing importance. We continue to seek to identify
ways in which we can support our key suppliers in this regard to our mutual
beneﬁt. As a component supplier, the impact of our products has to be
addressed also in partnership with our customers as well as our suppliers. This
continues to be an important focus of attention and is addressed in our new
Supplier Management Policy which is being introduced, as part of The GKN
Code, in 2006.
GKN plays a substantive role in a number of key industrial organisations. We
are founder members of the Industry and Parliament Trust, the UK Per Cent
Club and the UK Emission Trading Scheme. We are active members of the
Engineering Employers’ Federation and Confederation of British Industry in
the UK and the German Employers’ Federation. We are also active members
of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) in the UK, CLEPA
(the European Association of Automotive Suppliers), the Society of British
Aerospace Companies, the US Organisation for International Investment and
the British Occupational Health Research Foundation. In addition, we are
represented on the boards of the Automotive Academy, Skills4Auto and on the
Engineering Training Board.
GKN Driveline was one of 11 founding signatories to the SMMT’s sustainability
strategy ‘Towards Sustainability’ which outlines the automotive industry’s
commitment to balance economic progress with environmental care and social
responsibility. The sixth Annual Sustainability Report published towards the
end of the year demonstrated the increasingly prudent use of resources within
the automotive industry.
> Managing health and safety in GKN
Whilst expert advisers are available centrally and within divisions, we continue
to focus on strong, committed, visible and supportive leadership, together
with appropriate employee behaviours as the main drivers of health and safety
improvement throughout the Group towards a goal of zero preventable
accidents.  34 GKN plc
Annual Report 2005
Corporate social responsibility review continued
The deployment of Business Excellence within GKN continues to provide a
framework for achieving excellence in safety. A key part of our strategy is to
encourage every employee to take ownership of their own health and safety
and that of their immediate colleagues. Health and safety performance is
reported to the Board and the Executive Committee as part of the regular CSR
reports. In addition, signiﬁcant incidents are reported to Executive Committee
members within 24 hours and reviewed at the next meeting of that Committee. 
In conjunction with our management of safety, there is a parallel set of
provisions for safeguarding employees’ health with the focus clearly on the
avoidance of work-related ill health through the completion of workplace
based risk assessments, occupational health management intervention, the
promotion of wellness programmes and active data collection and monitoring.
In the introduction of lean manufacturing, issues of health and safety,
ergonomics and the health hazards of any chemicals involved in production
are all considered when deﬁning ‘Standard Work’ – the correct way of doing
each job.
Many GKN businesses now incorporate in their operations features from the
health and safety management system OHSAS 18001 and 17 GKN companies
have now achieved certiﬁcation to this standard.
Performance
Our performance in 2005 again shows an improvement against the key
performance indicators of accident frequency rate (AFR) and accident severity
rate (ASR). Whilst ASR continues to improve, the element attributable to
occupational ill health has been fairly constant over the years and is
comparable with benchmark companies and with the non-industrial workforce
in the countries in which we operate, reﬂecting the background level of health
issues in the general population. 
We also focus on the types of health issues which could be problematic in the
engineering industry. In particular, data is collected on dermatitis,
occupational asthma and vibration white ﬁnger (hand-arm vibration
syndrome) where there is no lost time. The virtual absence of cases is
reassuring.
We were deeply saddened by the death in November of an independent
contractor as a result of an accident during rooﬁng work being carried out by
his ﬁrm on GKN premises in Romania. No GKN personnel were involved in
carrying out the work and appropriate safeguards were in place. The accident
was the subject of detailed internal and external investigations.
Over the last ﬁve years AFR performance has improved by 74% and ASR by
60%. Our serious injury rate (SIR) also improved in 2005 and shows a 71%
reduction over the last ﬁve years. Further improvements have been made to
processes and systems for the management of serious accident risk. During
2005, nine enforcement actions (ﬁve of which carried no penalty) with ﬁnes
totalling £2,630 occurred in plants in Australia, Italy and the US.
Targets
Objectives and targets continue to be applied primarily at plant level where
they can best reﬂect a plant’s speciﬁc needs, risks, priorities and opportunities
for improvement. In addition, divisional targets are established for the three
key performance indicators i.e. AFR, ASR and SIR. Performance targets are
applied in two ways. Every part of GKN must target an overall, clear and positive
improvement trend leading to and maintaining a best in class performance.
Where considerable improvement is needed, plants have speciﬁc, often
aggressive, targets. In 2005, 66% of plants improved or maintained their
excellent AFR performance and 53% of plants achieved their AFR targets. For
ASR 61% of plants maintained or improved their performance and 48% met
their targets. Divisional targets were met in 75% of cases.
In addition to performance targets for AFR, ASR and SIR we also apply targets
to and measure performance against key enablers including health and safety
training and the publication of health and safety objectives and plans. These
enablers and associated targets are subject to change as part of a dynamic
approach which addresses developing needs and priorities and drives
continuous improvement. They consistently operate at an achievement level
of 75% or above.
Benchmarking results place our accident rates well below industry averages
in the UK, Germany and the US. Against those of our peer companies in the
UK and the US where comparative data is available, our performance
compares very favourably. 
Veriﬁcation
We recognise the importance placed by stakeholders on veriﬁcation to ensure
that the data which is reported on in this review is robust. A previous external
review of processes and procedures used in the collection and reporting of
health and safety data revealed no signiﬁcant deﬁciencies. Veriﬁcation and
assurance of the effectiveness of data collection systems is demonstrated
through the achievement of certiﬁcation to international standards and, in
many countries, compliance with local legal requirements. We will review how
best to develop this process going forward.

Safety Award Scheme
The GKN Safety Award Scheme, which has been a key contributor in
transferring best practice in health and safety across the Group, has been run
annually since 1997 and attracted 47 entries in 2005, demonstrating the high
level of interest, involvement and commitment to safety throughout GKN.
Leadership, employee involvement and team working together with excellent
progress were key attributes recognised by the judges. Five teams received
awards from Kevin Smith, Chief Executive, at an awards ceremony attended
by over 200 people. The overall winner was GKN Aerospace St. Louis in the US
for the introduction of a safe behaviour observation and intervention
programme and improvement process, owned and implemented by line
management with employee involvement and integrated into the quality
programme, and also for an excellent safety performance. The other winners
were GKN Driveline Trier, Germany, GKN Driveline Nagoya, Japan, GKN
OffHighway division and GKN Sheepbridge Stokes, UK.
> Environment
Environmental management continues to form an important element of the
Group’s integrated approach to risk management. GKN’s environmental
management system is part of this approach and is broadly based on the
international management standard, ISO 14001. Both of these impose a
requirement for continuous improvement in environmental performance and,
in the case of ISO 14001, a requirement to demonstrate that improvement to
an independent certifying body.
Environmental performance is reported to the Board and the Executive
Committee as part of the regular CSR reports. In addition, any signiﬁcant
incident is reported to Executive Committee members within 24 hours and
reviewed at the next meeting of that Committee.
Targets
GKN is committed to achieving compliance with ISO 14001 at all its
manufacturing sites throughout the world. 96 plants are currently certiﬁed to
the ISO 14001 standard and a further three are planning to achieve
certiﬁcation in 2006. Two of our European companies continue to maintain
certiﬁcation to the ECO Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS).
Operating sites are required to set targets, in particular on energy
consumption, water use and waste generation, in line with the commitment
to continuous improvement.
Performance
As reported in last year’s review, in our Automotive and OffHighway businesses
we have progressively been measuring our performance against key
environmental indicators (energy, waste, water) by reference to volume
consumed or generated relative to weight of products shipped rather than
relative to sales as previously, recognising the disadvantages of using sales
as a metric. This methodology is reﬂected in the performance data reported
below. We have however continued to use sales as the metric within our
Aerospace businesses where the widely differing range of products
manufactured and the drive towards ever lighter components means that
weight is not an appropriate measure of production. As in last year’s review,
we continue to report environmental performance on a divisional basis.
This year we have included performance data relating to carbon dioxide (CO
2
)
emitted as a result of energy consumed by the Group. This includes indirect
emissions of CO
2
from power stations that generate the electricity we consume
(calculated using average data for the emissions of CO
2
per kWh of generated
power for each country, published by the International Energy Agency). Overall,
CO
2
emission levels follow a similar trend to energy consumption with only
slight variations due to changes in energy mix.
Our business processes across the Group are diverse and this is reﬂected in
the range of environmental performance by division. In particular, Sinter Metals
consumes energy and water at a much higher rate by unit weight of product
than other divisions within the Group. This business manufactures a high
volume of small products using processes that are energy intensive and have
high water usage due to its cooling processes.
Overall, most divisions achieved similar or slightly improved performances
in each of the four key indicators compared with 2004 as shown in the 
charts below.
As the accuracy of our reported data continues to improve, this can result in
anomalies in year-on-year comparison. However, it also provides us with a
clearer focus for improvement opportunities which are receiving a high level
of attention. There are a signiﬁcant number of initiatives throughout our plants
which are contributing to improved performance. For example, GKN Aerospace
St. Louis plant in the US, which represents over 50% of the division’s overall
water consumption, achieved a 63% reduction in its water consumption in
2005 following the installation of new recycling systems. The GKN Sinter
Metals plant in Manitowoc, USA also achieved signiﬁcant savings in water
consumption due to the optimisation of water ﬂow rates in the furnace cooling
zones prior to the installation of recirculatory water cooling towers. A signiﬁcant
contribution to GKN’s overall environmental footprint is the CO
2
emitted by
power stations that generate the electricity we use to run our plants. In 2005
we made a step towards reducing that impact when GKN Sinter Metals at

Corporate social responsibility review continued
Pimpri in India signed an agreement to purchase 48% of its electricity in 2005
from a local wind farm operator. The plant has also harnessed solar energy to
preheat water for use in boilers and the site canteen.
We continue to beat the targets we set ourselves under the UK Emission
Trading Scheme, the overall target being a 10% reduction in our absolute CO
2
emission over a ﬁve-year period to 2006. The incentive payments we have
received as a result are being invested in energy savings schemes in the UK
to reduce further our CO
2
emissions.
In addition to targeting continuous improvement in the environmental impact
of our business processes, we continue to focus on environmental issues in
the design of new products. GKN Driveline announced, at the end of 2005, the
development of two new constant velocity joint technologies which, when
assembled together in a driveshaft, are expected to be lighter, more fuel
efﬁcient and quieter, due to reductions in driveline noise, vibration and
harshness. New product development at our cylinder liner business in the UK
has focused on reduced weight and reductions in NO
X
and particulate
materials emissions.
During the year, two enforcement actions against GKN companies resulted in
ﬁnes totalling some £16,000. One, in the US, related to an accidental spillage
of acid and the other, in the UK, related to breaches of waste management
legislation. In addition, a ﬁne of $22,000 was paid for a waste management
offence in the US which occurred in a prior year.
Veriﬁcation
As part of the certiﬁcation to ISO 14001, the suitability of systems in place to
gather and report data is assessed by external independent certifying bodies.
In addition, Group companies are required to certify the accuracy of the data
that they report centrally, and most companies have developed their own
internal auditing systems. The energy data relating to UK companies has been
successfully audited as part of the UK Emission Trading Scheme for the base
years (1998-2000) and on an annual basis for the life of the Scheme. In 2006
we are planning to carry out a pilot external audit of 2005 environmental data
submitted by a sample number of sites.
The GKN Green Scheme, which attracted 52 entrants in 2005, continues to
recognise and reward Group companies which have developed innovative
ways of reducing their environmental impact. The Green Scheme overall winner
in 2005 was GKN Driveline in Brazil for the development of a technique for
composting organic and other wastes arising from the production process
which can be sold as a soil improver. Other winners were GKN Driveline in
Carcastillo, Spain, GKN Driveline Vigo, Spain, the Sinter Metals facility at
Pimpri, India, and the Hoeganaes facility at Gallatin in the US.
> Conclusion
Despite our long history of good corporate citizenship, we are never
complacent about our performance and strive for continuous improvement in
CSR as in every aspect of our business. The GKN Code and Policies, developed
in 2005, will reinforce in all our businesses and amongst all our employees
the imperative to uphold our Values in everything we do.
This will be further underpinned in 2006 with the launch of a new employee
award scheme which will reward excellence in customer service, performance
improvement, technology and innovation as well as health and safety and the
environment. This, together with a new award recognising outstanding service
to the communities in which we operate, will ensure that CSR continues to be
an integral part of the way we do business.

December 2005 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the
consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash ﬂow statement, the
consolidated statement of recognised income and expense and the related
notes. These Group accounts have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Company accounts of GKN plc for the year
ended 31 December 2005 and on the information in the report on Directors’
remuneration that is described as having been audited on page 83.
> Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the Group
accounts in accordance with applicable law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in
the statement of Directors’ responsibilities on page 89. 
Our responsibility is to audit the Group accounts in accordance with relevant
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for
and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section
235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving
this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any
other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group accounts give a true and
fair view and whether the Group accounts have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent
with the Group accounts, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law
regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited Group accounts. The other
information comprises only the Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the
report on Directors’ remuneration, the Chairman’s statement, the Chief
Executive’s statement, the business review, the corporate governance
statement and the other information listed on the contents page of the annual

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
> 1 Accounting policies and presentation
The Group’s key accounting policies that have been applied under IFRS are
summarised below.
Basis of preparation and consolidation
The Group consolidated ﬁnancial statements are for the 12 months ended 31
December 2005. These consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as applicable to companies
reporting under IFRS and those IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations issued
and effective and endorsed by the European Union as at the time of preparing
these statements.
The Group’s IFRS transition balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 was prepared
in accordance with the accounting policies set out in this note where those
policies were applicable at that date. The primary areas where policies set out
below were not applicable to the Group’s transition to IFRS were those in
respect of Financial Instruments as governed by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement’. Full details of the impact on the Group’s
ﬁnancial results and position as a consequence of the transition to IFRS are
set out in note 37 to these ﬁnancial statements.
The Group ﬁnancial statements consolidate the ﬁnancial statements of the
Company and its subsidiaries unless the Group is restricted in the extent to
which it can exercise control over those subsidiaries either as a result of
contractual or commercial restrictions. In these instances the Group’s
investment in those subsidiaries is carried at its estimated fair value. Intra-
group transactions and balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising
from intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included in the
consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition or to the date of
disposal. All business combinations are accounted for by the purchase
method. Proﬁts and losses on the realisation of currency net investments
include the accumulated net exchange differences that have arisen on the
retranslation of the currency net investments since 1 January 2004 up to the
date of realisation.
The proﬁt or loss on discontinued operations comprises the after tax results
up to the date of disposal or discontinuance and the proﬁt and loss on the
disposal or closure where businesses are sold or closed by the date on which
the ﬁnancial statements are approved. A discontinued operation is a business
or businesses that have either been disposed of or satisﬁes the criteria to be
classiﬁed as held for sale and that represents either a material line of business
within the Group or within one of its divisions or a primary geographical area
of operation. Where businesses fall to be treated as discontinued in the current
year the comparative data is reclassiﬁed to reﬂect those businesses as
discontinued. Minority interests represent the portion of shareholders’ equity
attributable to third party shareholders not belonging to the Group.
Presentation of income statement
IFRS is not prescriptive as to the format of the income statement. The format
used by the Group, in arriving at the results of continuing operations, in these
ﬁnancial statements is explained below.
Sales shown in the income statement are those of continuing subsidiary
companies only.
Operating proﬁt is the pre-ﬁnance proﬁt of continuing subsidiary companies
and, in order to achieve consistency and comparability, is analysed to show
separately the results of normal trading performance and individually
signiﬁcant charges and credits. Such items arise because of their size or nature
and, in 2005, comprise:
> charges relating to the Group’s strategic restructuring programme announced
in 2004;
> the impact of the annual goodwill impairment review;
> asset impairment and restructuring charges which arise from events which
are signiﬁcant to any reportable segment;
> proﬁts or losses on businesses sold or closed which do not meet the
deﬁnition of discontinued operations and which the Group views as capital
rather than revenue in nature, and
> changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments between the
opening and closing balance sheets.
The Group’s post-tax share of joint venture proﬁts is shown as a separate
component of proﬁt before tax.
Net ﬁnancing costs are analysed to show separately interest payable, interest
receivable and the net of interest payable on post-employment obligations and
the expected return on pension scheme assets.
Foreign currencies
Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates account in the currency of their
primary economic environment of operation, determined having regard to the
currency which mainly inﬂuences sales revenue and input costs. Non-sterling
results and cash ﬂows are translated to sterling at average exchange rates.
Transactions of subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates approximating
to the rate ruling on the date of the transaction except in the case of material
transactions where actual spot rate may be used if it more accurately reﬂects
the underlying substance of the transaction. Where practicable, transactions
involving foreign currencies are protected by forward contracts. Assets and
liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at
the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments
Listed investments and other ﬁnancial assets held for sale are measured at
fair value at each period end. Changes in the fair value are recognised in the
income statement.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments including forward foreign exchange contracts
are taken out by the Group to manage its exposure to (i) changes in the fair
value of recognised assets and liabilities, (ii) risk associated with the variability
in cash ﬂows in relation to both recognised assets or liabilities or forecast
transactions and (iii) changes in the value of the Group’s net investment in
overseas operations. All derivative ﬁnancial instruments are measured at the
balance sheet date at their fair value.
Where derivative ﬁnancial instruments are not designated as or not
determined to be effective hedges any gain or loss on the re-measurement of
the fair value of the instrument at the balance sheet date is taken to the income
statement. Where derivative ﬁnancial instruments are held as and are effective
as hedges against the fair value changes in recognised assets and liabilities, GKN plc 43
Annual Report 2005
re-measurement gains and losses on the instrument are matched against the
re-measurement gain or loss on the recognised asset and liability in the
income statement. Re-measurement gains and losses on derivative ﬁnancial
instruments held as net investment hedges are recognised in equity via the
statement of recognised income and expense until the instrument and the
underlying hedged investment are sold, when the proﬁt or loss arising is
recognised in the income statement. Any derivative ﬁnancial instruments no
longer designated as effective hedges are restated at market value and any
gains or losses are taken directly to the income statement.
Interest differentials resulting from the use of derivative ﬁnancial instruments
to hedge the Group’s exposures to interest ﬂuctuations are dealt with in the
income statement.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised at their
fair value when the nature, characteristics and risks of the derivative are not
closely related to the host contract. Gains and losses arising on the re-
measurement of these embedded derivatives at each balance sheet date are
taken to the income statement.
Borrowings are measured at their amortised cost unless they are matched by
an associated effective hedging ﬁnancial instrument in which case they are
stated at their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and
overdrafts together with highly liquid investments of less than three months
maturity. Unless an enforceable right of set-off exists, the components of cash
and cash equivalents are reﬂected on a gross basis in the balance sheet.
The carrying value of other ﬁnancial assets and liabilities, including short-
term receivables and payables, are stated at amortised cost less any
impairment provision unless the impact of the time value of money is
considered to be material.
Sales and revenue recognition
Sales and revenue from subsidiaries in continuing operations shown in the
income statement exclude value added taxes and generally represent the
invoiced value of goods and services charged to customers net of returns,
early cash settlement discounts and rebates. Invoices are raised and revenue
recognised when goods are despatched, services rendered or when the risks
and rewards of ownership otherwise irrevocably passes to the customer and
the collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured.
In Aerospace, on long-term development and/or supply contracts, revenues
are recognised based on the value of work done at the achievement of
predetermined contractual or other milestones embedded in the
arrangements with the customer. Associated funded cost reduction
programme costs are recognised in the income statement in line with the
attributable overall linked customer contract.
Royalty and licence income is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance
with relevant agreements and included within sales.
Intangible assets
All intangible assets, excluding goodwill arising on a business combination,
are stated at their amortised cost or fair value less any provision for
impairment.
Research and development costs
Research expenditure is written off as incurred.
Where development expenditure results in new or substantially improved
products or processes and it is probable that recovery will take place, it is
capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the product’s life up
to a maximum of seven years in Automotive and 15 years in Aerospace starting
from the date on which serial production commences. Costs are capitalised
as intangible assets unless physical assets, such as tooling, exist when they
are classiﬁed as property, plant and equipment.
Computer software costs
Where computer software is not integral to an item of property, plant or
equipment its costs are capitalised and categorised as intangible assets.
Amortisation is provided on a straight line basis over its economic useful life
which is in the range of three to ﬁve years.
Acquired intangible assets – business combinations
Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination
including but not limited to customer contracts, order backlog, intellectual
property rights, patents and know-how and that can be separately measured
at fair value on a reliable basis, are separately recognised on acquisition at
their fair value. Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis to the income
statement over their expected useful lives.
Goodwill – business combinations
Goodwill arising on consolidation consists of the excess of the fair value of the
consideration over the fair value of the identiﬁable intangible and tangible
assets net of the fair value of the liabilities including contingencies of
businesses acquired at the date of acquisition. Goodwill in respect of business
combinations of subsidiaries is recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill
arising on the acquisition of a joint venture or associated undertaking is
included in the carrying value of the investment.
Where negative goodwill arises, following re-assessment of fair values, it is
credited to the income statement in the period in which the acquisition is
made.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses that arise
from annual assessment of its carrying value. To the extent that the carrying
value exceeds the value in use, determined from estimated discounted future
net cash ﬂows or recoverable amount, goodwill is written down to the value
in use and an impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment
Cost
Property, plant and equipment are valued at cost or valuation less
accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Cost comprises the
purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use but
excludes interest.
Where freehold and long leasehold properties were carried at a valuation at
23 March 2000, these values have been retained as book values and therefore
deemed cost at the date of the IFRS transition.
Where assets are in the course of construction at the balance sheet date they
are classiﬁed as capital work in progress. Transfers are made to other asset
categories when they are available for use. 44 GKN plc
Annual Report 2005
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued
> 1 Accounting policies and presentation continued
Depreciation
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or assets in the course of
construction. In the case of all other categories of asset, depreciation is
provided on a straight line basis over the course of the ﬁnancial year.
Depreciation is applied to speciﬁc classes of asset so as to reduce them to their
residual values over their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed annually.
The range of main rates of depreciation used are:
Years
Freehold buildings up to 50
Steel powder production plant 18
General plant, machinery, ﬁxtures and ﬁttings 6 to 15
Computers 3 to 5
Commercial vehicles and cars 4 to 5
Leasehold properties are amortised by equal annual instalments over the
period of the lease or 50 years, whichever is the shorter.
Leased assets
Where ﬁxed assets are ﬁnanced by leasing arrangements which give rights
approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been
purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitment is shown as
obligations under ﬁnance leases. The rentals payable are apportioned
between interest, which is charged to the income statement, and capital which
reduces the outstanding obligation. Operating lease rentals are charged to
the income statement as incurred over the lease term.
Impairment of non-current assets
All non-current assets are tested for impairment when events occur or
circumstances indicate that their carrying values might be impaired. Goodwill,
capitalised development costs and acquired intangibles are subject to annual
impairment tests. Impairments arising are charged to the income statement.
Joint ventures and associated companies
Joint ventures, although not subsidiaries, are those businesses in which the
Group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise joint control with its
partners under a contractual arrangement. Associates are those businesses
in which the Group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise signiﬁcant
inﬂuence through its representation on the board of directors.
The post-tax results of joint ventures and associates are included in the income
statement before proﬁt before taxation.
In the consolidated balance sheet the investment is carried as a non-current
asset at the share of the joint venture’s or associate’s equity including any
goodwill arising on the Group’s acquisition of its interest.
Inventories
Inventories are valued on a FIFO or weighted average cost basis at the lower
of cost and estimated net realisable value, due allowance being made for
obsolete or slow-moving items. Cost includes the relevant proportion of works
overheads assuming normal levels of activity.
Deferred taxation 
Full provision is made for deferred tax on all temporary timing differences
resulting from the difference between the carrying value of an asset or liability
and its tax base.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the
deferred tax asset will be recovered in future.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted proﬁts of overseas branches,
subsidiaries and joint ventures except to the extent that the parent is unable
to control the timing of any future proﬁt remittances by the overseas entity
and it is probable that a future remittance will take place.
Pensions and post-employment beneﬁts
The Group’s pension arrangements comprise various deﬁned beneﬁt and
deﬁned contribution schemes throughout the world. In the UK and in certain
overseas companies pension arrangements are made through externally
funded deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, the contributions to which are based on the
advice of independent actuaries or in accordance with the rules of the
schemes. In other overseas companies funds are retained within the business
to provide for retirement obligations.
The Group also operates a number of deﬁned contribution and deﬁned beneﬁt
arrangements which provide certain employees with deﬁned post-
employment healthcare beneﬁts.
The Group accounts for all post-employment deﬁned beneﬁt schemes through
full recognition of the schemes’ surpluses or deﬁcits on the balance sheet at
the end of each year. Actuarial gains and losses are included in the statement
of recognised income and expense. Current and past service costs,
curtailments and settlements are recognised within operating proﬁt. Returns
on scheme assets and interest on obligations are recognised as a component
of net ﬁnancing costs.
For deﬁned contribution arrangements the cost charged to the income
statement represents the Group’s contributions to the relevant schemes in
the period in which they fall due.
Share-based payments
Share-based incentive arrangements are provided to employees under the
Group’s share option, incentive and other share award schemes. Share
options granted to employees and share-based arrangements put in place
since 7 November 2002 are valued at the date of grant or award using an
appropriate option pricing model and are charged to operating proﬁt over the
performance or vesting period of the scheme. The annual charge is modiﬁed
to take account of shares forfeited by employees who leave during the
performance or vesting period and, in the case of non-market related
performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely the option will vest.
Government grants
Grants receivable from governments or similar bodies are credited to the
balance sheet in the period in which the conditions relating to the grant are
met. Where they relate to speciﬁc assets they are amortised on a straight line
basis over the same period as the asset is depreciated. Where they relate to
revenue expenditure and/or non-asset criteria they are taken to the income
statement to match the period in which the expenditure is incurred and criteria
met.
Treasury shares
GKN shares which have been purchased and not cancelled are held as treasury
shares and deducted from shareholders’ equity.
Dividends
The annual ﬁnal dividend is not provided for until approved at the Annual
General Meeting whilst interim dividends are charged in the period they are
paid. GKN plc 45

All business segments shown above are continuing. Discontinued activities in 2004 were the Group’s joint venture investments in Aerospace companies which
contributed £62 million of post-tax earnings in the year and a further £825 million post-tax proﬁt on their disposal.
Intra-group sales, which are priced on an ‘arms length’ basis, between both segments and regions are not signiﬁcant. The analyses of operating proﬁt by
business include an allocation, based on their nature, of costs incurred centrally in the United Kingdom and United States of America. Unallocated costs
represent corporate expenses. Segment assets comprise all non-current and current assets (as per the balance sheet presented on page 40) but exclude
deferred tax assets and cash and cash equivalents. Segment liabilities include trade and other payables, provisions and post-employment obligations but exclude
borrowings and taxation liabilities. Cash and cash equivalents and borrowings are not allocated to speciﬁc segments as these resources are managed centrally
and no business in any segment has sufﬁcient autonomy to manage these resources. Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to
acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one year. GKN plc 47

Restructuring
During 2005, the Group continued to deploy its strategic reorganisation programme, ﬁrst announced in March 2004, that involves the migration of Driveline
production capacity from high cost to low cost/high growth economies, actions in support of the recovery in Powder Metallurgy and the realignment and
reduction of production capacity and overhead costs in other areas of the business. Charges recognised in the year in respect of this programme amount to

Restructuring charges in Driveline in 2005 arise as a consequence of the announced closures of three manufacturing plants, two in North America and one in
Western Europe, and the continued reduction in the level of ﬁxed cost headcount in plants primarily in the Driveline European operations. The costs charged
as incurred or provided for in operating proﬁt and separately identiﬁed as restructuring costs include the costs of committed and contractual severance and
other employee related exit beneﬁts; post-employment augmentations and curtailments, provisions in respect of onerous lease, property and other contracts,
asset impairment charges in respect of plant and machinery not transferable to other facilities, the write-down of surplus properties to their estimated realisable
value and impairment of dedicated consumable inventories. Incremental costs borne by the Group as a consequence of dedicated restructuring and transition
teams is also charged to restructuring. In addition, in respect of the closure of the Driveline Western European facility, the costs incurred by the Group in the
period from announcement to formal agreement of the Social Plan have been treated as directly attributable to the restructuring as the workforce effectively
withdrew their labour whilst on full pay resulting in the immediate curtailment of production. Customer demand in the period was satisﬁed by other production
facilities. GKN plc 49
Annual Report 2005
Powder Metallurgy charges arise as a consequence of the Board approved closure of ﬁve plants. These actions remain broadly in line with the original plans
though do include an extension to the original scale and constitution of the programme. Charges comprise property and plant and equipment impairments of
£26 million and the cost of redundancies where irrevocable external announcements had been made by 31 December 2005 and actions had commenced.
OffHighway charges spent and provided represent plant closure and facility rationalisation costs, including onerous property lease costs. Corporate charges
relate to the cost of rebasing central overheads and relate primarily to the reduction in headcount which gave rise to redundancy and pension augmentation
charges.
Cash outﬂow in 2005 in respect of the 2005 and earlier years’ restructuring actions amounts to £37 million (2004 – £21 million). Of this amount £1 million
(2004 – £5 million) relates to the remaining spend on restructuring programmes commenced in earlier years and disclosed as exceptional items under UK GAAP .
2004 restructuring charges comprise asset impairments (£63 million); redundancy charges (£23 million) and reorganisation costs (£14 million). The analysis
of 2004 restructuring by segment is set out in note 2.
Other impairments
In addition to impairment charges borne as a consequence of strategic reorganisation activities, a £21 million impairment charge has arisen in 2005 relating
to the write-down of goodwill, property, plant and equipment at two automotive businesses where, as a consequence of current and future trading performance
and projections, sufﬁcient doubt exists over the recoverability of the assets. The impairment reviews were carried out with reference to both value in use and
fair value recoverabilities. Further details regarding the goodwill impairment of £11 million is given in note 11. The remaining £10 million impairment to property,
plant and equipment relates to a UK business within the Other Automotive segment where, during 2005, a decision was made to transfer certain production
to a new Chinese facility. This fact and continued declining proﬁtability has led to the signiﬁcant impairment charge. In 2004, Other impairment charges were
recognised in respect of the Powder Metallurgy business amounting to £162 million as a consequence of the annual impairment review.

The proﬁt recognised in 2005 reﬂects the cash receipt in respect of a contingent earnout arrangement on the 2004 disposal of an Aerospace business.
The primary 2004 transaction relates to the OffHighway disposal of its TCD (Tube Connecting) business to Eaton Corporation. 2004 transactions generated cash
proceeds of £29 million.
d) Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments
IAS 39, which has been adopted for the ﬁrst time from 1 January 2005, requires derivative ﬁnancial instruments to be valued at the date of the balance sheet
and any difference between that value and the intrinsic value of the instrument to be reﬂected in the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Any subsequent
change in value is reﬂected in the income statement unless hedge accounting is achieved. Such movements do not affect cash ﬂow or the economic substance
of the underlying transaction and the Group has not attempted to achieve transactional hedge accounting in 2005. As a consequence, and to assist year-on-
year comparison, the change in value has been identiﬁed as a separate element of operating proﬁt. Details of the charges and credits to 2005 operating proﬁt
are set out in note 24.
Comparative information has not been presented in accordance with the IFRS 1 exemption governing restatement of comparative information on the adoption

> 7 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the proﬁt attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue
during the period, excluding Ordinary Shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive
potential Ordinary Shares. The Company has only one category of dilutive potential Ordinary Shares; share options.
The calculation is performed for the share options to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average
market share price of the Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options. The number of
shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options. 52 GKN plc

> 10 Share-based payments
The Group has granted options over shares to employees for a number of years under different schemes. Where grants were made after 7 November 2002 they
have been accounted for as required by IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’. As permitted by the transitional arrangements of that standard, awards made before
that date have not been so accounted. All options have been valued at the date of grant by an independent third party using a Monte Carlo model which uses
the same principle as a binomial model.
Details of awards made since 7 November 2002 are:
a) Employee Sharesave Scheme
In September 2003 the Company awarded options to UK employees under an approved Sharesave scheme the terms of which were that the employee entered
into regular savings commitment up to a maximum of £250 per month for a three year period. The cumulative savings were then used to acquire options over
a number of shares at a 10% discount to market price at the date of grant. There were no performance conditions but, in general, the employee must remain
in employment for the three year period. Inputs to the valuation model were: option price 229p, volatility 38%, expected dividend yield 4.3%, risk free interest
rate 4.49%, and a term of 3.25 years.
b) Executive Share Option Schemes (ESOS)
Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in March 2003 under the 2001 scheme and in September 2004 and April 2005 under the 2004
scheme. Under both schemes options were granted with a ﬁxed exercise price equal to the market price at the date of grant and subject to meeting performance
conditions over a three year period. In the case of the 2001 scheme, the performance condition was based on earnings per share (EPS) growth whilst under
the 2004 scheme the condition is based on total shareholder return (TSR) compared with that of comparator companies. Under the 2001 scheme only, where
the performance condition is not satisﬁed in full after the ﬁrst three years, retesting is carried out each year up to six years from the date of grant. Inputs to the
valuation model were: option price 163p to 256.9p, volatility 34% to 38%, expected dividend yield 4.6% to 6.2%, risk free interest rate 4.28% to 4.92% and
expected terms of 6.4 years to 6.7 years. The EPS target for the 2003 award was not achieved and, as a consequence, the provision of £2 million in respect
thereof at 31 December 2004 was released to trading proﬁt in 2005.
c) Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIP)
Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in March 2003 under the 2001 scheme and in September 2004 under the 2004 scheme. In April
2005 awards were made to Directors under the 2004 scheme. Under both schemes, options were granted subject to TSR performance over a three year period
compared with a comparator group. There is no retest facility under either scheme. Inputs to the valuation model were: option price nil, volatility 34% to 39%,
expected dividend yield 4.6% to 6.2%, risk free interest rate 4.05% to 4.92% and a term of 3 years to 4 years 9.5 months.
Further details of both ESOS and LTIP schemes are given in the remuneration report on pages 96 and 97. GKN plc 55
Annual Report 2005
d) Bonus Co-Investment Plan
Under the Bonus Co-Investment Plan, certain senior employees (excluding Directors) are entitled to use up to 10% of their gross short-term annual bonus potential
to purchase shares in the Company at market price. Provided they remain in employment for three years and the shares are retained for that period, the
Company matches those shares. For shares purchased by employees in 2004 the match was on a two for one basis and in 2005 was two and a half for one. In
addition, in 2005 there is a further one for one match if certain proﬁt targets are achieved. All shares under the scheme are purchased in the open market.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price nil, volatility, where applicable, 37%, expected dividend yield 4.9% to 5.4%, risk free interest rate, where
applicable, 4.94% and a term of 3 years.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a period commensurate with the term of the awards. The risk free interest rate is the rate obtainable
from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.

The net book amount of Other intangible assets includes non-recurring costs (consisting of design and development) on major aerospace contracts of
£33 million (2004 – £21 million), computer software £17 million (2004 – £14 million) and intellectual property rights arising from business combinations of
£4 million (2004 – £5 million). Computer software under ﬁnance leases amounts to £1 million (2004 – nil). No individual Other intangible asset is material to
the Group.
Impairment
During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment. An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or cash generating
unit (CGU) to their recoverable amount. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results. Following the impairment tests,
a goodwill impairment of £11 million was recognised within operating proﬁt. This charge related to part of the Driveline business in the Asia Paciﬁc region
supplying a speciﬁc customer, where forecast performance is projected to be lower than previously expected. The pre-tax discount rate used for this CGU was
8.5%. The 2004 goodwill impairment related to the North American Powder Metallurgy business where planned recovery had been delayed by high material
prices and weak markets for the business’ major customers.
For the purposes of carrying out impairment tests, total Group goodwill has been allocated to a number of CGUs and each of these CGUs has been separately
tested. The allocation of goodwill by business segment is set out in note 2. The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a primary or secondary reportable
segment. In many cases, the CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation. The only amount of goodwill allocated to an individual CGU which is signiﬁcant to
total Group goodwill relates to goodwill, attributable to a US Aerospace business, of £78 million.
All of the recoverable amounts were measured based on value in use except for current year acquisitions, where market values have been used. Detailed
forecasts for the next ﬁve years have been used in the impairment tests. These are based on approved budgets and represent a best estimate of future
performance.
A number of key assumptions have been made as a basis for the impairment tests. In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management
reﬂecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information and these are set out below. Where a reasonably possible change
to an assumption would lead to an impairment, a sensitivity analysis has been provided which quantiﬁes the amount of change required for an impairment to
result. GKN plc 57
Annual Report 2005
Total Group
Discount rates
A relative risk adjustment (or ‘beta’) has been applied to discount rates to reﬂect the risk inherent in speciﬁc CGUs. In determining the risk adjusted discount
rate, management have applied an adjustment for risk of such companies relative to all other sectors on average determined using an average of the betas of
comparable listed companies.
Except for operations in Brazil and India, where rates of 22% and 14% respectively have been used, the following risk adjusted pre-tax discount rates have
been used for impairment testing:
Driveline – 8.5-11.5%
Powder Metallurgy – 11.0%
OffHighway – 9.5%
Aerospace – 11.0%
Long-term growth rates
To forecast beyond the ﬁve years covered by detailed forecasts, a long-term average growth rate has been used. In each case, this is equal to the published
International Monetary Fund average growth rate in gross domestic product for the most recent ten year period in the territory where the CGU is primarily based.
This results in a range of growth rates from 1.1% for Japan, to 6.0% for India, with most countries between 2.0% and 3.0%.
Driveline
In determining the recoverable amount of Driveline CGUs, it has been necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate future cash ﬂows. The main
assumptions include discount rates, long-term growth rates, future sales prices and volumes (with reference to speciﬁc customer relationships and product
lines), a realistic estimate of new business, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise beneﬁts from annual productivity improvements. Assumptions
have also been made regarding input costs, including steel prices. It is not considered that a reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would
generate a different impairment test outcome to the one included in this annual report except for the Asia Paciﬁc business, which has been impaired in the
current year. Here, because of the nature of the relationship with the customer and resulting interdependencies of the key operational assumptions, it is not
possible to give meaningful sensitivity analysis. However, a 1% increase in the discount rate would lead to an additional impairment of £3 million. For this
CGU, the goodwill allocated to it for impairment testing was £24 million of which £11 million has been impaired. The maximum further goodwill impairment
therefore which would result if the above key assumptions were to change is £13 million.
Aerospace
In addition to the discount rate and long-term growth rate, the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of Aerospace CGUs were speciﬁc
volumes on certain US military programmes, the achievement of forecast selling prices, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise planned
productivity improvements. Whilst management are conﬁdent that their assumptions are appropriate, it is possible that there would be an impairment were
there to be a change in the discount rate, and this is reasonably possible. In respect of the signiﬁcant goodwill allocated to one CGU a discount rate of 11%
has been used and a 1% increase in this rate would remove the existing valuation headroom and each subsequent 1% increase leading to an approximate

With effect from 1 February 2005 the Group increased its shareholding in GKN Driveline Celaya SA (formerly Velcon SA de CV) with the result that it is accounted
for as a subsidiary, rather than as a joint venture, from that date.
The joint ventures have no signiﬁcant contingent liabilities to which the Group is exposed and nor has the Group any signiﬁcant contingent liabilities in relation
to its interest in the joint ventures.
The share of capital commitments of the joint ventures are shown in note 34.
Investment in associated company
With effect from 1 April 2004 the Group increased its shareholding in GKN Driveline Torque Technology KK (formerly Tochigi Fuji Sangyo) with the result that it
is accounted for as a subsidiary, rather than as an associated company, from that date. Because it had been a publicly quoted company with a March year-end
its results as an associate were included six months in arrears. The Group’s share of its sales and net expenses until 1 April 2004 was £47 million and 
£46 million respectively. 60 GKN plc

Other investments mainly comprise the Group’s net investment in GKN Aerospace Services Structures Corp. which is a wholly owned subsidiary established
in 2003. This corporation operates under a proxy agreement with the United States Department of Defense developing high technology, classiﬁed products
for the Joint Strike Fighter. The agreement currently places signiﬁcant restrictions on the Group’s management and control of the business for the life of the
contract so that, in accordance with IAS 27 it has been excluded from the consolidation and treated as an investment. The amount of the investment has been
fully provided. At 31 December 2005, the excluded net liabilities were £3 million (2004 – £2 million) and the operating loss for the year then ended was
£1 million (2004 – £1 million). During the year, the Group provided engineering and design services to GKN Aerospace Services Structures Corp. which amounted
to less than £1 million (2004 – £1 million).
Other receivables comprise mainly amounts recoverable in respect of employee deferred compensation arrangements in the United States of America.

On 19 December 2005 the Group, through its subsidiary GKN Driveline Torque Technology KK, executed an agreement to commence the transfer of control of
its 60% shareholding in its Chinese casting business (Fujiwa China) to its business partner, Lioho Corporation (Taiwan). At the 31 December 2005 transfer of
effective control had not taken place as formal approval from the Chinese and Taiwanese authorities was awaited. The Chinese authorities approved the
transaction on 23 February 2006 and the Taiwanese authorities are scheduled to meet to consider the transaction on 2 March 2006. This disposal is expected
to take place before the end of March 2006. The consideration receivable in respect of this transaction will be sufﬁcient to cover the carrying value of the assets
net of liabilities being disposed, hence no impairment charge has been recognised on classiﬁcation of these assets and liabilities as held for sale.
At 31 December 2005 two properties with a combined carrying value of less than £1 million were being actively marketed for disposal at values in excess of
their carrying value. It is expected that the disposal of these properties will take place within 12 months.

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating fair values for ﬁnancial instruments:
Short-term borrowings, cash and deposits approximate to book value due to their short maturities. For bank and other loans, carrying ﬁxed rates of interest,
included within long-term borrowings, the repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at the relevant interest rates applicable
at 31 December 2005. Bonds included within long-term borrowings have been valued using quoted closing market values.
> 23 Financial risk management
The Group’s multi-national operations and debt ﬁnancing expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, foreign
exchange rates, credit risks, liquidity and interest rates. The Group has in place risk management policies that seek to limit the adverse effects on the ﬁnancial
performance of the Group by using various instruments and techniques including foreign currency ﬁnancial instruments, debt and other interest rate derivatives.
Risk management policies have been set by the Board and applied by the Group and are implemented by the central treasury function that receives regular
reports from all the operating companies to enable prompt identiﬁcation of ﬁnancial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken. The treasury function has
a policy and procedures manual that sets out speciﬁc guidelines to manage foreign exchange risks, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of ﬁnancial
instruments to manage these.
a) Foreign exchange risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional
currency. Under the Group’s foreign exchange policy, such transaction exposures are hedged once they are known, mainly through the use of forward foreign
exchange contracts.
The mark to market maturity proﬁle of forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2005 is amounts arising within one year £5 million, amounts
arising between one and ﬁve years £9 million and amounts arising after ﬁve years £1 million.
The Group has a signiﬁcant investment in overseas operations, particularly in continental Europe and the Americas. As a result, the sterling value of the Group’s
balance sheet can be affected by movements in exchange rates. The Group therefore seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures by
matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except where signiﬁcant adverse interest
differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic. This is achieved by borrowing either directly in either the local domestic
or euro-currency markets or indirectly through the use of rolling annual forward foreign exchange contracts. Borrowings created through the use of such contracts
amounted to £631 million at 31 December 2005. 66 GKN plc
Annual Report 2005
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued
> 23 Financial risk management continued
b) Interest rate risk
The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings. This policy is achieved by maintaining
a target range of ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate debt for discrete annual periods, over a deﬁned time horizon. This is achieved partly through the ﬁxed rate character
of the underlying debt instrument, and partly through the use of straightforward derivatives (forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps and swaptions). The
Group’s normal policy is to require interest rates to be ﬁxed for 30% to 70% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast to arise over a 12 month horizon.
However, this policy was suspended in December 2004 as it was deemed inappropriate given the absence of ﬂoating rate bank debt following the receipt of
the sale proceeds of GKN’s share in AgustaWestland. At 31 December 2005 89% of the Group’s gross borrowings were subject to ﬁxed interest rates.
The Group is partly funded by ﬁxed rate borrowings (£708 million) that are exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
As at 31 December 2005 £576 million was on deposit with various banks and in money market funds of which £542 million was on deposit in the UK. A 1%
change in interest rates would have a £5 million impact on proﬁt before tax.
c) Credit risk
Financial
The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to ﬁnancial instruments. Credit risk is mitigated by the Group’s
policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment graded long-term credit rating, normally at least AA– or equivalent, and assigning ﬁnancial
limits to individual counterparties. The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is £100 million, whilst the maximum mark to market exposure for
forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2005 to a single bank was £2 million.
Operational
As tier one suppliers to both automotive and aerospace manufacturers the Group may have substantial amounts outstanding with a single customer at any
one time. There are many advantages in these relationships and the credit risk is managed at a number of levels. Debtor days and overdue accounts are
reported to divisional management who co-ordinate any action required and overall divisional performance is regularly reviewed by the Group Executive
Committee. As at 31 December 2005 no individual outstanding balance exceeded 1% of sales.
d) Liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains committed facilities that are designed to ensure the Group has sufﬁcient available funds for operations and planned expansions.
During the year, the Group entered into new facilities of £350 million expiring in July 2010 of which £350 million remained undrawn at the year end.

Restructuring provisions outstanding at 31 December 2005 relate primarily to the estimated future cash outﬂows in respect of redundancies and onerous
contracts (predominantly leases) arising from the Group’s strategic reorganisation programme, details of the charges in respect of which are included in note 3.
Warranty
Provisions set aside for warranty exposures either relate to monies provided systematically based on historical experience under contractual warranty obligations
attaching to the supply of goods or speciﬁc provisions created in respect of individual customer issues undergoing commercial resolution and negotiation.
Legal and environmental
Legal provisions amounting to £11 million (2004 – £12 million) relate to management estimates of amounts required to settle or remove litigation actions that
have arisen in the normal course of business. Further details are not provided to avoid the potential of seriously prejudicing the Group’s stance in law.
As a consequence of primarily legacy activities a small number of sites in the Group are subject to environmental remediation actions, agreed with relevant
local and national authorities and agencies. Amounts charged and carried reﬂect the current best estimates of the likely cost of remediation and inherent timings.
Other
Other provisions include amounts set aside in terms of insurance provisions held within the Group’s captive insurance company of £9 million (2004 –
£13 million), provisions held in respect of onerous loss making contracts of £14 million (2004 – £17 million), and long service and non-pension beneﬁt
employee obligations arising primarily in the Group’s continental European and Australasian subsidiaries of £11 million (2004 – £9 million). Insurance
provisions and charges are established in accordance with external insurance and actuarial advice. The onerous loss making contract provisions relate 
to speciﬁc non-cancellable contractual commitments where it is anticipated that unavoidable net operating losses will arise. 68 GKN plc

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
All of the deferred tax assets were available for offset against deferred tax liabilities and hence the net deferred tax asset at 31 December 2005 was £112 million
(2004 – £122 million).
Deferred tax assets totalling £165 million (2004 – £106 million) have not been recognised in relation to taxable losses and other deferred tax assets on the
basis that their future economic beneﬁt is uncertain. Deferred tax assets in respect of unrecognised taxable losses totalling £40 million will expire between
2019 and 2025 (2004 – £21 million between 2019 and 2024). 
Deferred tax assets totalling £123 million (2004 – £134 million) have been recognised relating to territories where tax losses have been incurred in the year.
It is anticipated that future proﬁtability arising from restructuring and other actions will result in their realisation.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries except where the distribution of such proﬁts is planned. If the earnings were
remitted in full tax of £15 million (2004 – £9 million) would be payable.

At the last Annual General Meeting, shareholder authority was obtained for the Company to purchase up to a maximum of 72.2 million of its own Ordinary
Shares (representing 10% of the issued share capital of the Company on 31 December 2004) for a period ending on the earlier of the next Annual General
Meeting or 5 August 2006, provided that certain conditions (relating to the purchase price) are met. The Notice of the 2006 Annual General Meeting proposes
that shareholders approve a resolution updating and renewing this authority. Shares in the Company may also be purchased by the GKN Employees’ Share
Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust.
At 31 December 2005 there were 25,220,000 Ordinary Shares of 50p each (nominal value £12.6 million) held as treasury shares following the purchase during
the year in the open market of 11,895,000 shares at a cost of £30 million (including expenses). These shares, which represented 3.4% of the called up share
capital at the end of the year, have not been cancelled but are held as treasury shares and represent a deduction from shareholders’ equity.
During the year shares issued under the share option schemes generated £10 million (2004 – £2 million). 70 GKN plc

Retained earnings include the accumulated proﬁts and losses arising from the consolidated income statement and certain items from the statement of
recognised income and expense attributable to equity shareholders less distributions to shareholders. Also included within the retained earnings balance at
1 January 2004 is goodwill written off directly to equity and accumulated net currency variations on overseas net assets and hedging instruments under legacy
GAAP and the impact of the adoption of IFRS (note 37).
Other reserves include the UK GAAP revaluation reserve, accumulated adjustments in respect of piecemeal acquisitions and other accumulated reserves where
distribution has been restricted due to legal or ﬁscal requirements. The accumulated debit balance as at 1 January 2004 arises as a consequence of the
demerger transaction of Industrial Services in 2001.
The hedging reserve and the exchange reserve represent, respectively, the accumulated net currency variations on hedging instruments and equity shareholders’
interest in overseas net assets. GKN plc 71

2005 Acquisitions
During 2005 the Group has executed two acquisitions as detailed below:
a) Acquisition on 1 February 2005 of the remaining 51% of the equity shares of Velcon SA de CV , a Driveline CVJ business (now called GKN Driveline Celaya) in
Mexico, for a fair value consideration of £44 million.
b) Acquisition on 8 November 2005 of Lakin Manufacturing Corporation’s QDS Henschen business, assets (excluding cash) and trade, a business based in the
United States of America engaged in the design and manufacture of hubs, spindles and axles primarily for off-highway applications, for a fair value
consideration of £6 million.

Intangible assets assessed as part of the fair value exercise include customer lists, the Velcon brand, order backlog and order book levels and contractual water
access rights. No signiﬁcant value was deemed attributable to these intangibles primarily as their value was contingent on access to existing GKN technology.
Those recognised, which were lower than £1 million, were based on external market data.
Fair value adjustments on tangible ﬁxed assets include revaluation of property based on an external third party valuation and reappraisal of plant and machinery
using depreciated replacement cost methodology. Inventories acquired have been fair valued either based on current replacement cost in respect of raw
materials or selling price adjusted for costs of disposal and a selling price margin for ﬁnished goods and work in progress. Post-employment obligations were
valued in accordance with IAS 19, though the amount recognised was less than £1 million.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of the remaining 51% stake represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired to acquire full control
over a signiﬁcant geographically located manufacturing presence vital to the execution of Driveline’s manufacturing footprint changes. The fair value adjustment
to the carrying value of the Group’s joint venture 49% investment in Velcon SA de CV (£3 million) has been charged to equity as a matter of accounting policy.
In the period post the acquisition Velcon SA de CV has contributed sales amounting to £53 million and trading proﬁt of £9 million. 
The net outﬂow of cash and cash equivalents on the acquisition of the 51% stake in Velcon SA de CV was £35 million being the cash consideration of
£44 million net of cash acquired £9 million. 72 GKN plc

The book value of net assets acquired prior to the acquisition amounted to £3 million. The provisional fair value of net assets acquired primarily represents
plant and equipment, inventory and intangible assets (customer contracts, order backlog and brand name). The goodwill arising represents the value of
synergies attributable to the combination. Fair values remain provisional and will be ﬁnalised in the 2006 annual accounts once the fair value assessment exercise
is ﬁnalised. The post-acquisition contribution towards to Group sales and trading proﬁt was not material. 
During the year the Group acquired the remaining minority interest in GKN Driveline Torque Technology KK under court sanction. Amounts paid were £10
million. The resultant credit has been taken to equity.
The estimated impact on the 2005 Group results of current year acquisitions if they had taken place on 1 January 2005 would not have been material.

Pensions and healthcare – funded
The Group’s pension arrangements comprise various deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution schemes throughout the world. A number of retirement plans
are operated which provide certain employees with post-employment healthcare beneﬁts.
Pensions
In the UK, pension arrangements are made through an externally funded deﬁned beneﬁt scheme. In the United States of America and the Rest of the World
there are a number of externally funded deﬁned beneﬁt schemes while in certain companies in Europe funds are retained within the business to provide for
post-employment obligations.
(a) Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
Independent actuarial valuations of all deﬁned beneﬁt scheme assets and liabilities were carried out at 31 December 2005. The present value of the deﬁned
beneﬁt obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Key assumptions were:

Rate of increase in medical costs:
initial/long-term 9.5/4.3 10.0/5.0 n/a n/a
The underlying mortality assumptions for the major schemes are as follows:
United Kingdom
The key current year mortality assumptions for the scheme are that a male aged 65 lives for a further 18 years, whilst a male aged 40 is expected to live a further
19.5 years after retiring at age 65. These assumptions are based on speciﬁc scheme experience, which has been subject to review by the Continuous Mortality
Investigative Board, rather than by reference to general UK mortality tables.
Overseas
In the USA, RP-2000 tables scaled to 2006 were adopted in the year, whilst there was also a change in Germany where the RT2005-G tables were adopted. 74 GKN plc

The settlement and curtailment credits of £15 million (2004 – £nil) includes the £7 million settlement credit arising from the exit from a multi-employer deﬁned
beneﬁt scheme which was offset by other restructuring charges amounting to £5 million as disclosed in note 3(a). The £5 million curtailment credit included
within restructuring and impairment charges arises from the announced closure of Driveline facilities as disclosed in note 3(b). The £3 million curtailment credit
included in Trading proﬁt arises from structural changes to retiree medical beneﬁt arrangements in the United States of America.
A 1% increase in the assumption on medical costs would increase the total service cost and interest cost by £1 million and the liability by £13 million. A 1%
decrease in the assumption would reduce the total service cost and interest cost by £1 million and the liability by £10 million.

The expected return on plan assets is a blended average of projected long-term returns for the various asset classes. Equity returns are developed based on
the selection of the equity risk premium above the risk free rate which is measured in accordance with the yield on government bonds. Bond returns are
selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the scheme’s holdings of these instruments. All other asset class returns
are determined by reference to current experience. The actual return on plan assets was £307 million (2004 – £174 million).

> 35 Related party transactions
In the ordinary course of business, sales and purchases of goods take place between subsidiaries and joint venture companies priced on an ‘arm’s length’
basis. Sales of product by subsidiaries to joint ventures in 2005 totalled £57 million (2004 – £84 million). The amount due at the year end in respect of such
sales was £11 million (2004 – £9 million) (see note 16). Purchases by subsidiaries from joint ventures in 2005 totalled £10 million (2004 – £27 million). The
amount due at the year end in respect of such purchases was £3 million (2004 – £7 million) (see note 18).
At 31 December 2005 a Group subsidiary was owed £8 million (2004 – £7 million) by a joint venture in respect of a loan, bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1%
(see note 14).
> 36 Post-balance sheet events
In January 2006 the Group announced the closure of a Powder Metallurgy operation in the UK and conﬁrmed the decision to close a similar operation in the
United States of America. The total charge to proﬁt in 2006 is likely to be approximately £25 million. Furthermore, a signiﬁcant restructuring of a UK Other
Automotive business was announced which is likely to impact around 50% of the workforce.
In February 2006 the Group agreed to contribute £200 million to the UK pension scheme. This will increase the Group’s net borrowings and decrease post-
employment obligations. 78 GKN plc

> 37 Explanation of transition to IFRS
This is the ﬁrst year that the Group has presented its consolidated results under IFRS. The last ﬁnancial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended
31 December 2004. The date of transition to IFRS was 1 January 2004. Set out below are the overall IFRS transition reconciliations which reconcile proﬁt
after taxation for the full year 2004 and the net asset positions as at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 between UK GAAP as reported and IFRS. 
The information presented in this note has not been audited. The information presented in this note is consistent with that disclosed in April 2005 when the
Group initially published its “Restatement of 2004 Financial Information for the impact of IFRS”, apart from a minor change in respect of deferred taxation 
as at 1 January 2004.

Notes to IFRS transition statements
In preparing these consolidated ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRS 1, the Group has applied the mandatory exceptions and certain of the optional
exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS. The applicable optional exemptions from full retrospective application elected for by the Group were as
follows:
A) Business combinations exemption
The business combinations exemption in IFRS 1 has been applied whereby business combinations that took place prior to the 1 January 2004 transition date
have not been restated.
B) Employee beneﬁts exemption
All cumulative actuarial gains and losses as at 1 January 2004 have been recognised.
C) Cumulative translation differences exemption
The previous translation reserve has been set to zero at 1 January 2004. This exemption has been applied to all subsidiaries in accordance with IFRS 1.
D) Exemption from restatement of comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39
The exemption allows the application of previous GAAP rules to derivatives, ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities and to hedging relationships for the 2004
comparative information. The adjustments required for differences between UK GAAP and IAS 32 and IAS 39 are determined and recognised at 1 January 2005
with the previous valuation bases of UK GAAP being retained for the 2004 comparative. 
E) Revaluations as deemed cost
Tangible ﬁxed assets previously stated at revalued amounts have been treated as deemed cost as at 1 January 2004.
The mandatory exception from full retrospective application applied by the Group related to estimates where under IFRS estimates at 1 January 2004 should
be consistent with estimates made for the same date under previous GAAP , unless there is evidence that those estimates were in error. No change to estimates
have been made.
The following notes explain the adjustments between balance sheets drawn up under UK GAAP and IFRS at 31 December 2004 (the last date at which an audited
balance sheet was drawn up under UK GAAP) and the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Balance sheet notes
a) Goodwill is subject to amortisation under UK GAAP whereas no amortisation is charged under IFRS with goodwill being subject to an annual impairment
review. The adjustment reﬂects the reversal of the 2004 amortisation charge of £23 million and the recognition of an additional £12 million impairment.
b) As part of the transition to IFRS, purchased computer software was reclassiﬁed from tangible to intangible non-current assets and long-life tooling in
Automotive businesses was reclassiﬁed from inventory to tangible non-current assets. Also, elements of non-recurring costs in Aerospace businesses
(being design, development and tooling expenditure on long-term programmes) were reclassiﬁed from inventory to either intangible or tangible non-current
assets. The intangible element was reviewed for impairment as required by IAS 36 and its carrying value reduced by £13 million. IFRS 3 requires intangible
assets to be recognised on acquisition. The acquisition of TFS was therefore reassessed and £5 million of intangible assets were recognised.
c) The adjustment reﬂects the impact of the adoption of IFRS by the Group’s joint venture operations. The major factors were the adoption of IAS 19 and related
deferred taxation adjustments offset by the reversal of the goodwill amortisation charge.
d) The adjustment mainly reﬂects the recognition of previously unrecognised post-employment obligations under IAS 19 which gave rise to a previously
unrecognised deferred tax asset of £184 million at 31 December 2004.
e) Under UK GAAP the balance sheet contained a prepayment in respect of pensions of £198 million at 31 December 2004. The adoption of IAS 19 resulted
in this prepayment being written off and replaced by liabilities which were £588 million higher than the previously recognised ﬁgure. There has also been
a reanalysis of debtors due in more than one year.
f) The adjustment reﬂects the re-analysis of restructuring liabilities to provisions and the re-analysis of creditors due in more than one year and provisions
due in less than one year.
g) Under IFRS, dividends are not recognised until they become irrevocable by approval at the Annual General Meeting. The adjustment reverses the accrual
which had been made under UK GAAP .
h) Under IFRS deferred tax must be recognised on all temporary differences and non-qualifying assets on business combinations. The effect of this was to increase
the liability by £24 million at 31 December 2004.
i) Accumulated translational adjustments in respect of net assets and net asset hedging instruments are required to be reported as separate components of
equity, and included within Other reserves.
j) The Group hedges its net investment in overseas subsidiaries using a variety of ﬁnancial instruments. Under IFRS and UK GAAP these are accounted for
using hedge accounting. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts used for net investment hedging has been re-analysed in the IFRS balance sheet
consistent with the adoption of IAS 39 on 1 January 2005. 82 GKN plc
Annual Report 2005
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued
> 37 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued
Income statement notes
k) Cash discounts allowed of £3 million have been reclassiﬁed from cost of sales to sales.
l) The implementation of IAS 19 has resulted in the impact of changes in the value of the deﬁcits being recognised in the statement of recognised income
and expense rather than in the income statement. Further, under IAS 19 the cost of post-employment obligations is analysed between operating proﬁt and
ﬁnance costs. Consequently there is an increase in operating proﬁt of £55 million and an increase of £29 million in net ﬁnancing costs.
The implementation of IFRS 2 requires the cost of any share-based payments made after 7 November 2002 to be recognised in the income statement over
the period in which services are received. The Group has made a number of awards to employees during 2004 as set out in note 10 to the ﬁnancial
statements and the cost recognised was £3 million.
Further to note b), the transition date impairment of non-recurring costs in Aerospace businesses resulted in a £1 million beneﬁt to operating proﬁt due to
reversal of amortisation charges, which were offset by the amortisation charge on intangible assets arising on acquisitions.
m) The recognition of deferred tax on post-employment obligations together with all timing differences gave rise to an increase in the tax charge for the year of
£10 million.
n) The reversal of amortisation of goodwill increased the post-tax proﬁts of continuing joint ventures by £1 million and of discontinued joint ventures by
£5 million.
o) Under IFRS, goodwill previously written off directly to reserves is not recycled through the income statement when an investment is sold or closed. Further,
the implementation of IFRS in the Group’s joint ventures gave rise to a change in their carrying value and there were some changes in respect of currency
movements and deferred tax. As a consequence, the proﬁt recognised on the divestment of the Group’s shareholding in AgustaWestland NV and Aerosystems
International Limited increased as follows:

Independent auditors’ report to the members of GKN plc
We have audited the Company accounts of GKN plc for the year ended
31 December 2005 which comprise the balance sheet and the related notes.
The Company accounts have been prepared under the accounting policies
set out therein. We have also audited the information in the report on Directors’
remuneration that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the Group accounts of GKN plc for the year
ended 31 December 2005 on page 37.
> Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the report on
Directors’ remuneration and the Company accounts in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the statement of
Directors’ responsibilities on page 89.
Our responsibility is to audit the Company accounts and the part of the report
on Directors’ remuneration to be audited in accordance with relevant legal
and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this
opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Company accounts give a true
and fair view and whether the Company accounts and the part of the report
on Directors’ remuneration to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the Company accounts, if
the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is
not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited Company accounts. The other
information comprises only the Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the
report on Directors’ remuneration, the Chairman’s statement, the Chief
Executive’s statement, the business review, the corporate governance
statement and the other information listed on the contents page of the annual
report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Company
accounts. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
> Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the Company accounts and the part of the report on Directors’
remuneration to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant
estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the
Company accounts, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate
to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Company accounts
and the part of the report on Directors’ remuneration to be audited are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or
error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the Company accounts and the part of the report
on Directors’ remuneration to be audited.
> Opinion
In our opinion:
> the Company accounts give a true and fair view, in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2005; and
> the Company accounts and the part of the report on Directors’ remuneration
to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

> Signiﬁcant accounting policies and basis of preparation
The separate ﬁnancial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985. They have been prepared under the historical cost
convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
A new ﬁnancial reporting standard, FRS 21 ‘Events after the balance sheet date’ became effective in 2005. This standard does not permit dividends to be accrued
where they have not been approved at the balance sheet date. Accordingly prior year numbers have been restated.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Treasury shares
GKN shares which have been purchased and not cancelled are held as treasury shares and deducted from shareholders’ equity.
Dividends
The annual ﬁnal dividend is not provided for until approved at the Annual General Meeting whilst interim dividends are charged in the period they are paid.
> 1 Proﬁt and loss account
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has elected not to present its own proﬁt and loss account for the year. The loss for the
year ended 31 December 2005 was £73 million (2004 – proﬁt £11 million).
Auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the Company was £0.5 million (2004 – £0.5 million).

Pursuant to the articles (as amended), the Company has executed a deed poll
of indemnity for the beneﬁt of the Directors of the Company and persons who
were Directors of the Company during the ﬁnancial year under review in respect
of costs of defending claims against them and third party liabilities. These
provisions are currently in force. The indemnity provision in the Company’s
articles of association also extends to provide a limited indemnity in respect
of liabilities incurred as a director, secretary or ofﬁcer of an associated
company of the Company. 
A copy of the deed poll of indemnity and of the Company’s articles of
association are available for inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce
during normal business hours and will be available for inspection at the
Company’s AGM.
> Donations
Contributions to good causes made by Group companies around the world
amounted to some £902,200 in 2005. This included cash donations to UK
registered charities of £139,000 for educational purposes and £97,900 for
community activities. Further details of contributions made by the Group
worldwide are given in the corporate social responsibility review on page 33
and on the Company’s website.
It is the policy of the Group not to make political donations. During 2005, no
donations were made to EU political organisations, no EU political expenditure
was incurred and no contributions to political parties outside the EU were
made within the meaning of Part XA of the Companies Act 1985. 
The Group’s US Aerospace business has a Political Action Committee (PAC)
which is funded entirely by employees and their spouses. No funds are
provided to the PAC by GKN and any administrative services provided to the
PAC by the US Aerospace business are fully charged to and paid for by the
PAC, and the Company does not therefore consider these to be political
donations. Employee contributions are entirely voluntary and no pressure is
placed on employees to participate. Under US law, an employee-funded PAC
must bear the name of the employing company.

> Payments to suppliers
It is Group policy to abide by the payment terms agreed with suppliers,
provided that the supplier has performed its obligations under the contract.
Given the nature and diversity of the Group’s international purchasing
arrangements and contracts, it is not Group policy to follow any speciﬁc code
or standard in relation to payment practice.
GKN plc, as a holding company, did not have any amounts owing to trade
creditors at 31 December 2005.
> Corporate governance
The Board’s statement on corporate governance matters is given on pages 90
to 94, and its report on Directors’ remuneration is set out on pages 95 to 103.
> Directors’ responsibility for the accounts
At the end of each ﬁnancial year the Directors are required by the Companies
Act 1985 to prepare accounts which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and of the Group and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group
for that year. In preparing the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005,
the most appropriate accounting policies, supported by reasonable and
prudent judgements and estimates, have been used consistently. The Group
accounts have been prepared on the basis of applicable International Financial
Reporting Standards effective and endorsed by the European Union as at
31 December 2005 and the Company accounts have been prepared in
accordance with UK applicable accounting standards. The Directors are
responsible for ensuring that the Company and the Group keep proper
accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
ﬁnancial position of the Company and the Group and which enable them to
ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985. In addition,
the Directors are responsible for ensuring that an appropriate system of
internal control is in operation to provide them with reasonable assurance
that the assets of the Company and the Group are properly safeguarded and
to ensure that reasonable steps are taken to prevent or detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
> Auditors
Resolutions to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors of the
Company and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration will
be proposed at the AGM.

Corporate governance
In accordance with the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, GKN is required
to state whether it has complied with the relevant provisions set out in
Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) and,
where the provisions have not been complied with, to provide an explanation.
GKN is also required to explain how it has applied the principles set out in 
the Code.
The following paragraphs, together with the report on Directors’ remuneration
on pages 95 to 103, provide a description of how the main and supporting
principles of the Code have been applied within GKN. The Directors’ statement
of compliance with the Code is given on page 94.
> The Board of Directors
The Board is collectively responsible for the success of the Company. Its role
is to provide entrepreneurial leadership of the Company within a framework
of prudent and effective controls which enables risk to be assessed and
managed; to set the Company’s strategic aims, ensure that the necessary
ﬁnancial and human resources are in place for the Company to meet its
objectives, and review management performance; to set the Company’s
values and standards and ensure that its obligations to its shareholders
(including reporting to shareholders on the Board’s stewardship) and others
are understood and met. Speciﬁc responsibilities reserved to the Board
include:
> setting Group strategy and approving an annual budget and medium-term
projections;
> reviewing operational and ﬁnancial performance;
> approving major acquisitions, divestments and capital expenditure;
> reviewing the Group’s systems of ﬁnancial control and risk management;
> ensuring that appropriate management development and succession plans
are in place;
>reviewing the activities of the three sub-committees of the Executive
Committee;
> reviewing matters relating to corporate social responsibility, including the
environmental, health and safety performance of the Group;
> approving appointments to the Board and to the position of Company
Secretary, and approving policies relating to Directors’ remuneration and
the severance of Directors’ contracts; and
> ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue takes place with shareholders.
The Directors’ responsibility for the preparation of accounts is explained on
page 89 (their conﬁrmation that they consider it appropriate to prepare the
accounts for 2005 on a going concern basis is given on page 30).
A description of the role of the Board, together with that of the Chairman, Chief
Executive, Senior Independent Director and Company Secretary, is available
on the GKN website at www.gkn.com and further details of the Board’s role in
relation to the Group’s systems of internal control and risk management are
given on pages 93 and 94. Descriptions of the speciﬁc responsibilities which
have been delegated to the principal Board Committees are given on pages
91 to 93.
The Board currently comprises two executive and seven non-executive
Directors including the Chairman. Biographical details of the Directors are
given on page 21. With the exception of the Chairman, who is presumed under
the Code not to be independent, and Baroness Hogg, who is no longer
considered to be independent by virtue of her length of service on the Board,
all the non-executive Directors are regarded by the Board as independent and
the Board does not consider that there exist any relationships or circumstances
likely to affect the judgement of any Director.
The Board normally meets 11 times a year, including at least one meeting at
a Group operating company. Comprehensive brieﬁng papers are provided to
all Directors one week before Board meetings. During the year there are
sufﬁcient opportunities for the Chairman to meet with the non-executive
Directors without the executive Directors being present should this be deemed
appropriate.
All Directors have direct access to the advice and services of the Company
Secretary who is tasked with ensuring that Board procedures are followed. In
addition, Directors may, in furtherance of their duties, take independent
professional advice, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
The Company maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal
proceedings and other claims against its Directors. Details of indemnities in
place between the Company and the Directors can be found in the Directors’
report on page 88.
Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive have been split since 1997. Whilst
collectively they are responsible for the leadership of the Company, the
Chairman’s primary responsibility is for leading the Board and ensuring 
its effectiveness and the Chief Executive is responsible for running the
Company’s business.
The other signiﬁcant current commitments of Roy Brown, Chairman, are listed
in his biography on page 21. The Board is satisﬁed that his commitments do
not unduly restrict his availability to GKN and, in particular, would not do 
so in the event of GKN being involved in a major corporate transaction or 
other action.
Induction and professional development
On joining the Board, a Director receives a comprehensive induction pack
which includes background information about GKN and its Directors, and
details of Board meeting procedures, Directors’ responsibilities, procedures
for dealing in GKN shares and a number of other governance-related issues.
This is supplemented by a brieﬁng with the Company Secretary. The Director
meets with the Chief Executive and with relevant senior executives to be
briefed on the general Group strategy and each individual business portfolio.
Plant visits are organised as necessary for new Directors. External training,
particularly on matters relating to the role of a Director and the role and
responsibilities of Board Committees, is arranged as appropriate.
Ongoing training is provided as and when necessary and may be identiﬁed in
annual performance reviews (see below) or on an ad hoc basis. The suitability
of external courses is kept under review by the Company Secretary who is
charged with facilitating the induction of new Directors both into the business
and as to their roles and responsibilities as Directors, as well as with assisting
in the ongoing training and development of Directors.
Training and development of Directors in 2005 took various forms, including
visits to GKN plants (both with the Board as a whole and on an individual
basis), attendance by certain Directors at courses run by executive educational
establishments and professional bodies, attendance at external training
sessions and seminars on matters relevant to members of remuneration
committees, seminars facilitated by professional services ﬁrms on
International Financial Reporting Standards and workshops run by external
bodies on various commercial and regulatory matters. GKN plc 91
Annual Report 2005
Performance evaluation
During 2005, the Board continued its ongoing evaluation process to assess
performance and identify areas in which effectiveness might be enhanced. The
Chairman conducted performance evaluations of each Director and, taking
into account the views of the other executive Directors and the non-executive
Directors, of the Chief Executive. Baroness Hogg, as Senior Independent
Director, led the evaluation by the non-executive Directors of the performance
of the Chairman, taking into account the views of the executive Directors. 
To assist the evaluation process, a number of assessment areas were
identiﬁed in advance and used as a framework for conducting the appraisal
interviews. Such areas included commitment and preparation, training and
development, contribution, and interaction with other Board members. As
part of the performance evaluation, the Chairman evaluated with each Director
the effectiveness of the Board and of the principal Board Committees.
The results of the evaluations were discussed by the Board and used to
consider opportunities for improvement. Minor changes to Board and
Committee procedures were identiﬁed and have been implemented.
Director re-election
All Directors are subject to re-election by shareholders at the ﬁrst Annual
General Meeting following their appointment by the Board. Under the articles
of association of the Company, each of the Directors is required to retire by
rotation at least once every three years. Any non-executive Directors who have
served for more than nine years are subject to annual re-election. Details of
the Directors retiring and seeking re-election at the 2006 Annual General
Meeting are given in the Notice of Meeting circular. The Chairman conﬁrms
that, following the performance evaluations undertaken in 2005, the
performance of the Directors seeking re-election continues to be effective,
and that they continue to demonstrate commitment to their respective roles.
The Deputy Chairman conﬁrms that, following the performance evaluation
which she undertook in 2005 as Senior Independent Director, the performance
of the Chairman continues to be effective, and that the Chairman continues
to demonstrate commitment to his role. 
Communicating with shareholders
Meetings between Directors, senior management and major institutional
shareholders are held during the year in accordance with GKN’s investor
relations programme and when required in relation to particular issues. The
Senior Independent Director and the other non-executive Directors are
encouraged to attend presentations to analysts and shareholders, in particular
the annual and interim results presentations.
The Chairman, periodically, offers to major investors in GKN the opportunity
to meet with him should they so wish to discuss matters relating to
governance, including Directors’ remuneration, and strategy. Feedback to the
Board is provided by the Chairman on any issues raised with him. The Finance
Director reports twice-yearly to the Board on meetings with investors. These
reports include summaries prepared by the Company’s brokers on the
market’s reaction to results announcements and the subsequent meetings
between management and investors. External brokers’ reports on GKN are
circulated to all Directors and the Board is briefed periodically by external
ﬁnancial consultants on investor perceptions of GKN.
All Directors normally attend the Annual General Meeting and shareholders
are invited to ask questions during the meeting and to meet with Directors after
the formal proceedings have ended. Shareholders at the meeting are advised
as to the level of proxy votes received, including the percentage for and against
each resolution together with the level of votes withheld, following each vote
on a show of hands.
In its annual and interim reports, trading statements, results presentations and
City announcements generally, GKN endeavours to present an accurate,
objective and balanced picture in a style and format which is appropriate to
the intended audience. The GKN website provides information about the
Group including copies of annual and interim reports and presentations made
to institutional investors.
> Board Committees
The full terms of reference of the following Board Committees are available
upon request and on the GKN website.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee consists of the executive Directors and, with effect
from 1 January 2006, the Group’s senior executive team under the
chairmanship of the Chief Executive.  The current membership of the Executive
Committee is given on page 20. The Committee is tasked with leading,
overseeing and directing the activities of the Group, reviewing divisional and
Group strategy plans and deciding how the various risks facing the Group are
to be managed. It reviews the Group’s annual budget prior to submission to
the Board and monitors monthly performance of the Company against the
approved plans. It also reviews acquisitions and divestments, and corporate
development activity and approves major human resource policy issues
including management development and training. The Committee is also
responsible for reviewing and leading the implementation of business and
operational processes across the Group. It normally meets monthly.
The Executive Committee has three sub-committees consisting of members
of senior management:
> the Lean Enterprise Sub-Committee, under the chairmanship of Kevin Smith,
Chief Executive, is responsible for monitoring and reviewing key elements
that contribute directly to operational performance and the improvement of
‘business health’. It is assisted in this by three senior executive councils
covering people excellence, production excellence and business process
excellence;
> the Technology Sub-Committee, under the chairmanship of Martyn Vaughan,
Chief Executive GKN OffHighway, is responsible for setting policy and
providing guidance and direction in relation to technologies employed across
all business areas, and provides input to the Executive Committee to
contribute to the formulation of the Group’s business strategy; and
> the Governance and Risk Sub-Committee, under the chairmanship of the
Company Secretary, Grey Denham, is responsible for monitoring and
reviewing matters relating to governance and compliance, risk management
and corporate social responsibility.
Chairman’s Committee
The Chairman’s Committee consists of the non-executive Directors together
with the Chief Executive under the chairmanship of the Chairman. The
Committee meets before each Board meeting and is a forum for the Chairman
and Chief Executive to brief and obtain the views of the non-executive Directors
on particular issues.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of the independent non-executive Directors.
John Sheldrick assumed the chairmanship of the Committee from Sir Peter
Williams with effect from 1 January 2006 following Sir Peter Williams’
appointment as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
As Group Finance Director of Johnson Matthey plc, Mr Sheldrick has, as
required by the Code, recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. 92 GKN plc
Annual Report 2005
Corporate governance continued
The Committee monitors the integrity of the Company’s ﬁnancial statements
and the effectiveness of the external audit process. It is responsible for
ensuring that an appropriate relationship between GKN and the external
auditors is maintained, including reviewing non-audit services and fees, and
makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment, reappointment or
dismissal of the external auditors. It also reviews bi-annually the Group’s
systems of internal control and the processes for monitoring and evaluating
the risks facing the Group. The Committee reviews the effectiveness of the
internal audit function (see page 94) and is responsible for approving, upon
the recommendation of the Chief Executive, the appointment and termination
of the head of that function. It also reviews periodically the Group’s employee
disclosure procedures policy which provides for employees to disclose, in
conﬁdence, instances of wrongdoing by other employees.
The Committee reviews annually its effectiveness and recommends to the
Board any changes required to its terms of reference. No changes to the
Committee’s terms of reference were recommended following the 2005 review.
The Audit Committee meets at least four times a year, including meetings
before the annual and interim results announcements and at the planning
stage of the annual external audit process. Members’ attendance record at
meetings of the Committee in 2005 is given on page 93.
The Committee has authority to investigate any matters within its terms of
reference, to access resources, to call for information and to obtain external
professional advice at the cost of the Company. Should there be any
disagreement between the Committee and the Board which cannot be
resolved, the Committee has the right to report the issue to shareholders
within the Company’s next annual report.
No person other than the members of the Committee is entitled to be present
at meetings but others may be invited to attend by the Committee. The head
of the internal audit function and the external auditors usually attend meetings
of the Committee. At each meeting there is an opportunity for the external
auditors, and annually an opportunity for the head of internal audit, to discuss
matters with the Committee without any executive management being
present. The minutes of each meeting are circulated to all members of the
Board. The Committee has independent access to the internal audit function
and to the external auditors and both the head of internal audit and the
external auditors have direct access to the Chairman of the Committee outside
formal Committee meetings. The Chairman of the Committee has quarterly
meetings and regular intervening contact with the head of internal audit, and
twice-yearly formal meetings as well as ad hoc contact with the external
auditors on speciﬁc matters.
The Audit Committee has the speciﬁc task of keeping under review the nature
and extent of non-audit services provided by the external auditors in order to
ensure that objectivity and independence are maintained. As a matter of
policy, the auditors are excluded from invitations to undertake assignments
of a purely consultancy nature. For other non-audit work, the policy is that
GKN does not use the external auditors unless there are compelling reasons
to do so, i.e. they can provide a unique skill or a service not readily available
from any other source. Under the policy, agreed by the Board, any proposal
to use the auditors for non-audit work must be submitted to the Finance
Director who will, depending on the nature of the service, seek the prior
authorisation of the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The external auditors
have in place processes to ensure their independence is maintained including
safeguards to ensure that, where they do provide non-audit services, their
independence is not threatened. They have written to the Audit Committee
conﬁrming that, in their opinion, they are independent.
During the year, the Audit Committee discharged its responsibilities by:
> reviewing the Group’s draft 2004 preliminary annual results announcement
and ﬁnancial statements and 2005 interim results statement prior to Board
approval (including consideration of the signiﬁcant accounting judgements
contained therein) and reviewing the external auditors’ detailed reports
thereon;
>reviewing the Group’s 2004 ﬁnancial statements as restated under
International Financial Reporting Standards and the associated
announcement released in April 2005;
> reviewing the Group’s trading update announcement prior to release at the
Annual General Meeting;
> reviewing the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting policies including
changes necessary in the light of the transition to International Financial
Reporting Standards;
> reviewing regularly the potential impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial statements
of certain matters such as impairments of ﬁxed asset values and
International Financial Reporting Standards;
>reviewing the effectiveness of the 2004 external audit process and
recommending to the Board, after due consideration, the reappointment of
the incumbent external auditors at the Annual General Meeting;
> reviewing the application of the Board’s policy on non-audit work performed
by the Group’s external auditors together with the non-audit fees payable to
the external auditors in 2004;
> reviewing compliance with the Group’s policy on the employment of former
employees of the external auditors;
> reviewing the external auditors’ plan for the audit of the Group’s 2005
accounts, which included key areas of focus, key risks on the accounts,
conﬁrmations of auditor independence and the proposed audit fee, and
approving the terms of engagement for the audit;
> reviewing reports from the internal audit function and the external auditors
on the Group’s systems of internal control in advance of the announcement
of the Group’s results for 2004 (the internal report included a summary of
and commentary on the annual detailed divisional reports on their business
risks and internal control processes) and reporting to the Board on the results
of this review, and reviewing interim updates prior to the half-year results;
> receiving regular updates from management on key ﬁnancial control matters
arising in the Group;
> reviewing work undertaken by management in connection with analysis of
fraud risks;
> reviewing a post-acquisition report on the integration and performance of a
signiﬁcant recent acquisition;
> reviewing the terms of reference, resources, performance and effectiveness
of the internal audit function, its work programme for 2005 and quarterly
reports on its work and ﬁndings during the year, and monitoring compliance
by Group companies with its recommendations; and
> reviewing the Group’s employee disclosure procedures policy. GKN plc 93
Annual Report 2005
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of the independent non-executive
Directors. Sir Peter Williams assumed the chairmanship of the Committee from
Baroness Hogg with effect from 1 January 2006. The Committee is responsible
for approving the terms of service and setting the remuneration of the
executive Directors and the Company Secretary in accordance with a
remuneration policy which is approved annually by the Board. It is also
responsible for determining the fees of the Chairman and the terms upon
which the service of executive Directors is terminated having regard to a
severance policy adopted by the Board, and for monitoring the remuneration
of senior managers just below Board level. It also prepares for approval by the
Board the annual report on Directors’ remuneration (set out on pages 95 to 103).
The Committee meets periodically when required. Members’ attendance
record at meetings of the Committee in 2005 is given opposite. No person
other than the members of the Committee is entitled to be present at meetings
but others may be invited by the Committee to attend. No Director nor the
Company Secretary is present when the Committee considers, or acts in,
matters relating to himself.
The Committee has access to such information and advice both from within
the Group and externally, at the cost of the Company, as it deems necessary.
It is responsible for appointing any consultants in respect of executive
Directors’ remuneration.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee consists of the non-executive Directors and the
Chief Executive under the chairmanship of the Chairman of the Board (except
when the Committee is dealing with the appointment of a successor as
Chairman of the Board when the Senior Independent Director chairs the
Committee).
The Committee leads the process for identifying and makes recommendations
to the Board on candidates for appointment as Directors of the Company and
as Company Secretary, giving full consideration to succession planning and
the leadership needs of the Group. It also makes recommendations to the
Board on the composition of the Chairman’s and Nominations Committees
and the composition and chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration
Committees. It keeps under review the structure, size and composition of the
Board, including the balance of skills, knowledge and experience and the
independence of the non-executive Directors, and makes recommendations
to the Board with regard to any changes.
The Committee meets periodically when required. Members’ attendance
record at meetings of the Committee in 2005 is given opposite. No person
other than the members of the Committee is entitled to be present at meetings
but others may be invited by the Committee to attend.
The Board has agreed the procedures to be followed by the Nominations
Committee in making appointments to the various positions on the Board and
as Company Secretary. These procedures, under which the Committee agrees
a description of the role, experience and capabilities for a Director, are
available on GKN’s website. The Committee has access to such information
and advice both from within the Group and externally, at the cost of the
Company, as it deems necessary. This may include the appointment of external
executive search consultants, where appropriate.
> Directors’ attendance record
The attendance of Directors at relevant meetings of the Board and of the Audit,

> Internal control
The Board attaches considerable importance to, and acknowledges its
responsibility for, the Group’s systems of internal control and risk management
and receives regular reports on such matters.
The Board’s policy is to have systems in place which optimise the Group’s
ability to manage risk in an effective and appropriate manner. The Board has
delegated to the Executive Committee responsibility for identifying, evaluating
and monitoring the risks facing the Group and for deciding how these are to
be managed. The Governance and Risk Sub-Committee of the Executive
Committee facilitates this process. There is a standing agenda item at every
Executive Committee meeting to enable its members to advise if any material
internal control issues, serious accidents or events having a major commercial
impact have arisen or any signiﬁcant new risks have been identiﬁed, with
subsequent reporting to the next Board meeting and/or Audit Committee
meeting if appropriate.
Continuing processes under the oversight of the Governance and Risk
Sub-Committee are in place for all parts of the Group to assess the major risks
to which their operations are exposed and the way in which such risks are
monitored, managed and controlled. The risks covered by these processes
include those relating to strategy, operational performance, ﬁnance (including
risk ﬁnancing and fraud), product engineering, business reputation, human
resources, health and safety, and the environment. These processes are
summarised in a ‘risk map’ which is reviewed at least annually by the 
Audit Committee. 94 GKN plc
Annual Report 2005
Corporate governance continued
Each year all Group businesses are required formally to review their business
risks and to report on whether there has been any material breakdown in their
internal controls. This formal review is supplemented by an interim review
conducted at the half year. Companies also have to conﬁrm annually whether
they have complied with statutory and regulatory obligations as well as with
internal policies on matters such as competition law, employment, ethics,
document management, data protection and employee disclosure. Risk
proﬁling is undertaken across all subsidiaries to identify accidental risks and
highlight action required to mitigate such risks.
The objective of the Group’s risk management processes is to ensure the
sustainable development of GKN through the conduct of its business in a 
way which:
> satisﬁes its customers;
> develops environmentally friendly products and processes;
> provides a safe and healthy workplace;
> protects against losses from unforeseen causes;
> minimises the cost and consumption of increasingly scarce resources;
> prevents pollution and waste;
> maintains proper relationships with our suppliers and contractors; and
> maintains a positive relationship with the communities in which it does
business.
The Group Risk Management Council acts as a steering group for the
management of accidental risk across GKN, including but not limited to health
and safety, environment, business continuity, risk proﬁling and risk ﬁnancing.
The Council is under the overall supervision of the Governance and Risk
Sub-Committee referred to above.
The Group’s systems and procedures are designed to identify, manage and,
where practicable, reduce and mitigate the effects of the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives. They are not designed to eliminate such risk,
recognising that any system can only provide reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The review process
The Board reviews the Group’s systems of internal control and risk
management on an ongoing basis by:
> setting the strategy of the Group at both Group and divisional level and,
within the framework of this, approving an annual budget and medium-term
projections. Central to this exercise is a review of the risks and opportunities
facing each business and the steps being taken to manage these;
> reviewing on a regular basis operational performance and updated forecasts
for the current year. Comparisons are made with budget and the prior year
and appropriate action plans put in place to optimise operational and
ﬁnancial performance;
> retaining primary responsibility for acquisition and divestment policy, and
the approval of major capital expenditure, major contracts and ﬁnancing
arrangements. Below Board level there are clearly deﬁned management
authorities for the approval of capital expenditure, major contracts,
acquisitions, investments and divestments, together with an established
framework for their appraisal, which includes a risk analysis and post-
implementation plan, and where appropriate, a post-acquisition review;
> receiving regular reports on the Group’s treasury activities, having approved
the operating policies and controls for this function;
>performing at least annually a review of the Group’s pension fund
arrangements and insurance and risk management programmes;
> receiving two reports each year, following their review by the Executive
Committee, on corporate social responsibility matters, which include
environmental, health and safety performance of the Group’s operations;
and
> reviewing at least annually management development and succession plans.
The Executive Committee also reviews management development issues
twice a year.
The Board receives an annual report from the Audit Committee concerning
the operation of the systems of internal control and risk management. This
report, together with the reviews by the Board during the year of the matters
described above, enables the Board to form its own view on the effectiveness
of the systems.
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the ongoing control
processes and the actions undertaken by the Committee during 2005 to
discharge this responsibility are described on page 92. To assist it in this role
the Committee liaises closely with the internal audit department. This
department utilises a risk-based internal audit programme and its purpose is
to review and test the systems, controls, processes, procedures and practices
across the Group. The head of internal audit reports directly to the Chief
Executive and the department’s reports are seen by the relevant members of
the Executive Committee. The resolution of any control issues raised by Board
members or in reports reviewed by the Audit Committee are discussed in
Committee with management.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal
control and risk management during the period covered by this annual report.
It conﬁrms that the processes described above, which accord with the
guidance on internal control appended to the Code (the Turnbull Guidance),
have been in place throughout that period and up to the date of approval of
the annual report.
> Compliance with the Code
It is the Board’s view that, throughout 2005, GKN was in compliance with the
relevant provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code. GKN plc 95
Annual Report 2005
Report on Directors’ remuneration
> Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Board’s Remuneration Committee is responsible for formulating the
Group’s policy for the remuneration of the executive Directors of GKN plc. The
Committee reviews the policy annually and recommends any changes to the
Board as a whole for formal approval.
Within the framework of the agreed policy, the Committee determines the
detailed terms of service of the executive Directors, including basic salary,
incentives and beneﬁts, and the terms upon which their service may be
terminated. The Committee also determines the fees of the Chairman and is
responsible for recommending to the Chief Executive and monitoring the level
and structure of remuneration for the most senior managers below Board
level. The Committee’s full terms of reference are available on GKN’s website
at www.gkn.com.
The Committee consists entirely of independent non-executive Directors.
Baroness Hogg chaired the Committee throughout 2005, a position she held
since May 2002. She resigned from the Committee on 31 December 2005
and was succeeded as Committee Chairman by Sir Peter Williams. The other
current members of the Committee are Sir Ian Gibson, Helmut Mamsch, Sir
Christopher Meyer and John Sheldrick, all of whom, together with Sir Peter
Williams, served on the Committee throughout 2005. Members’ attendance
at meetings of the Committee in 2005 is summarised on page 93.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for appointing external
independent consultants to advise on executive remuneration matters and
has adopted a policy under which an individual external consultant appointed
by it to advise on the determination of Board level remuneration shall not also
act as consultant to any company in the GKN Group. The Committee has
appointed and received advice during 2005 from Towers Perrin in relation to
executive Director remuneration. During 2005 Towers Perrin consultants
(different from the consultant who provided advice to the Remuneration
Committee) were also appointed by the Group to provide advice to GKN
subsidiaries in relation to actuarial valuations relating to retirement plans in
Japan and assistance in the design and implementation of healthcare
programmes and software implementation in the US. Towers Perrin did not
provide any other services direct to the Group during the year.
The Committee also receives input from the Group’s Chief Executive when
considering the remuneration of the other executive Directors.
The Committee’s terms of reference and procedures, which are reviewed
annually under the Board’s performance evaluation procedures described on
page 91, comply with the best practice provisions of the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance. (The Board’s statement of overall compliance with the
Combined Code is given on page 94.)
> Remuneration policy
This section describes GKN’s policy for the remuneration of its executive and
non-executive Directors as at the date of this report and for the foreseeable
future.
GKN’s remuneration policy for executive Directors is designed to attract, retain
and motivate executives of the high calibre required to ensure that the Group
is managed successfully to the beneﬁt of shareholders. To achieve this, an
internationally competitive package of incentives and rewards linked to
performance is provided.
In setting remuneration levels the Remuneration Committee takes into
consideration the remuneration practices found in other multinational
companies of similar size and also ensures that the remuneration
arrangements for executive Directors are compatible with those for executives
throughout the Group. It also considers the most recent pay awards in the
Group generally when reviewing the basic salaries of the executive Directors.
The remuneration of the executive Directors comprises basic salary and
beneﬁts in kind set at competitive levels, short-term variable remuneration
dependent upon the achievement of performance targets, and longer-term
rewards including retirement beneﬁts and performance-related long-term
incentives. Further details of each of these elements are given in the following
paragraphs. On the basis of the expected value of long-term incentives and
achievement of on-target performance for the purposes of the short-term
variable remuneration scheme, the total annual remuneration (excluding
pension beneﬁts) of each executive Director under the Group’s remuneration
policy is weighted approximately 50% performance-related and 50% non
performance-related, valued as at the time of award of long-term incentives,
with ﬂexibility to change the balance between the performance-related and
non performance-related elements when the Remuneration Committee
considers it appropriate. The Remuneration Committee believes that these
proportions represent an appropriate balance between certainty of income
and incentive-based remuneration linked to the achievement of GKN’s
operational and strategic objectives.
The fees of the non-executive Directors are set at a level that the Board believes
will attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a
substantial contribution to the Group’s affairs. The fees paid are
commensurate with those paid by other UK listed companies of comparable
size and complexity.
Basic salary
This is based on a number of factors including market rates together with the
individual Director’s experience, responsibilities and performance. The
Remuneration Committee’s objective is to maintain salaries at around the
median level of the relevant employment market and in this connection it
reviews annually data drawn from an analysis of senior executive salary levels
in approximately 100 major UK companies provided to it by independent
consultants.
Individual salaries of Directors are reviewed annually by the Committee with
any increase usually being effective from 1 July.
Beneﬁts
These comprise principally car and healthcare beneﬁts and premiums paid on
additional life assurance policies in connection with pension arrangements.
The level of beneﬁts provided to executive Directors is consistent with that
provided by other major companies. These beneﬁts do not form part of
pensionable earnings.
Performance-related short-term variable remuneration
Payments may be made annually under arrangements which link remuneration
to the achievement of short-term operational targets relevant to GKN’s long-
term strategic objectives. These targets will typically relate to a combination
of corporate and, where appropriate, individual portfolio proﬁt and cash ﬂow
performance. Achievement of on-target performance will result in payments
of approximately 50% of an executive Director’s salary and payments are
normally capped at 100% of salary. 96 GKN plc
Annual Report 2005
Report on Directors’ remuneration continued
Details of the targets and cap for 2005 are given below in the section ‘Directors’
remuneration 2005’.
The Remuneration Committee has absolute discretion to alter targets to reﬂect
changed circumstances such as material changes in accounting standards or
changes in the structure of the Group. It may also make discretionary payments
in respect of exceptional performance. Payments to Directors are based upon
a percentage of basic salary received during the year and do not form part of
pensionable earnings under Directors’ pension arrangements.
Long-term incentive arrangements
The Remuneration Committee believes that performance-related long-term
incentives which closely align executive rewards with shareholders’ interests
are an important component of overall executive remuneration arrangements.
In 2004 shareholders approved revisions to both elements of GKN’s current
long-term incentive arrangements for executive Directors and other senior
executives – the GKN Long Term Incentive Plan and the GKN Executive Share
Option Scheme. The substantive differences between the revised
arrangements and those approved previously by shareholders in 2001 (under
which awards remain outstanding but no further awards will be made) are
referred to below. The structure of the Company’s performance-related
long-term incentives is considered annually as part of the award process and
the Committee believes the current arrangements remain appropriate.
Award levels under each of the Long Term Incentive Plan and the Executive
Share Option Scheme are set such that the combined rewards available to an
individual Director, assuming full vesting, are no greater than they would have
been had the Group’s long-term incentive arrangements comprised only a
single element. The combined maximum potential annual award under both
elements of the long-term incentive arrangements is 250% of basic salary, or
such higher overall percentage which may be applied where necessary
speciﬁcally to recruit or retain an individual.
There are no provisions under the rules of either the Long Term Incentive Plan
or the Executive Share Option Scheme for the automatic release of unvested
awards on a change of control of GKN plc.
GKN Long Term Incentive Plan (L TIP)
In summary, under the LTIP introduced in 2004, each executive Director may
be awarded annually a conditional right to receive GKN plc Ordinary Shares
up to a maximum value of 150% of basic salary (100% of basic salary for
awards made prior to 2004). The value of shares for this purpose is calculated
by reference to the average of the daily closing prices of GKN plc Ordinary
Shares during the preceding year. L TIP awards to executive Directors in 2005
were made at a value of 80% of basic salary.
The number of shares that the Director will ultimately receive will depend on
the Group’s performance during the three years commencing on 1 January in
the year of award and on satisfaction of a personal shareholding requirement
(see page 99).
Performance is measured by comparing the total shareholder return (i.e. the
internal rate of return from the cash ﬂows arising from buying, owning and
selling a company’s shares), or ‘TSR’, from GKN shares with the return on
shares of other companies chosen by the Remuneration Committee as an
appropriate comparator group. The Committee considers relative TSR to be an
appropriate performance criterion as it represents the investment return
received by GKN’s shareholders over the measurement period compared with
the return investors could have received by investing in alternative stocks over
the same period. This incentive arrangement is therefore less affected by
changes in economic conditions and short-term stock market sentiment than
plans based on certain other measures. For awards made from 2004 onwards,
the comparator group comprises a tailored peer group representing GKN’s
major competitors and customers worldwide. (Where a comparator company’s
shares are listed on an overseas market, the TSR of that company is calculated
in local currency. The Committee believes this method of measurement
provides a true indication of a company’s performance, without potential
distortions brought about by windfall movements in currency.)
The companies making up the comparator group for the awards granted in
2004 and 2005 (unless speciﬁed otherwise) are as follows:
Automotive companies
Magna International Inc Canada Tomkins plc UK
Torch Investment Co Ltd China Wagon plc UK
Faurecia SA France American Axle &
Valeo SA France Manufacturing Inc USA
DaimlerChrysler AG Germany ArvinMeritor Inc USA
Volkswagen AG Germany Borg Warner Inc USA
Fiat SpA Italy Dana Corporation USA
Denso Corporation Japan Delphi Corporation USA
NGK Spark Plug Co Ltd Japan Ford Motor Company USA
Toyota Motor Corporation Japan General Motors Corporation USA
Scania AB Sweden Johnson Controls Inc USA
Mayﬂower Corporation plc* UK Visteon Corporation USA
*2004 comparator group only
Aerospace companies
Bombardier Inc Canada Boeing Company/The USA
Zodia SA France General Dynamics
Finmeccanica SpA Italy Corporation USA
BAE Systems plc UK Goodrich Corporation USA
Cobham plc UK Lockheed Martin Corporation USA
Meggitt plc UK Raytheon Company USA
Rolls-Royce plc UK United Technologies
Smiths Group plc UK Corporation USA
The comparator group for awards granted under the LTIP arrangements
approved by shareholders in 2001 (the pre-2004 awards) consisted of the
companies constituting the FTSE 100 Index at the start of the measurement
period excluding companies in the telecommunications, media, technology
and ﬁnancial services sectors. (It was thought appropriate to exclude certain
non-manufacturing sectors, some of which had contributed signiﬁcantly to
the volatility of the FTSE 100 Index.) The Remuneration Committee is of the
view, however, that a tailored peer group, such as those being used in 2004
and 2005, provides a more meaningful comparator group.
For awards granted from 2004 onwards, if GKN’s TSR ranks in the upper
quartile of the comparator group at the end of the three-year measurement
period the conditional award is converted into a deferred right to receive all
of the shares, which will not be released to the Director for at least one further
year other than in the speciﬁc circumstances set out in the rules of the LTIP .
(For pre-2004 awards, this deferment period was two years.)  GKN plc 97
Annual Report 2005
If the ranking is at the median level, 30% (50% for pre-2004 awards) of the
shares will be received at the end of the deferment period, with no shares
being received for below median ranking. For intermediate rankings between
median and upper quartile, the executive Director will receive a proportionate
number of shares increasing on a straight-line basis. For 2004 awards
onwards, dividends will be treated as having accrued from the beginning 
of the third year of the measurement period on any shares that vest and 
the equivalent cash amount will be paid to the Director on release of such
shares (no dividends accrue on either vested or unvested shares under
pre-2004 awards).
GKN obtains the required TSR data and ranking information from an external
consultant to ensure that the comparative performance is independently veriﬁed.
However, irrespective of GKN’s TSR, before any shares become eligible for
release the Remuneration Committee must be satisﬁed that this is justiﬁed by
the underlying ﬁnancial performance of the Group over the measurement period.
GKN Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)
In summary, under the ESOS each executive Director may be awarded annually
an option to subscribe for a number of GKN plc Ordinary Shares. The
Remuneration Committee decides the level of awards in each year. For awards
from 2004 onwards, annual award levels are not speciﬁcally capped under the
ESOS, but when combined with awards under the LTIP (which are capped at
150% of basic salary) they cannot exceed 250% of basic salary, except where
necessary speciﬁcally to recruit or retain an individual. ESOS awards to
executive Directors in 2005 were made at 120% of basic salary, giving a
combined award value with LTIP for 2005 of 200% of basic salary.
The number of shares that a Director can ultimately acquire upon exercise of
the option is dependent upon satisfaction of a performance condition and a
personal shareholding requirement (see page 99), set by the Remuneration
Committee before an option is granted. Performance for awards granted from
2004 onwards is measured by comparing the TSR from GKN shares with the
TSR from shares of companies in a comparator group comprising the
constituents of the FTSE 350 Index at the start of a three-year measurement
period commencing on 1 January in the year of award. The Remuneration
Committee believes the FTSE 350 Index to be appropriate as it is a broadly
based index which contains more manufacturing and engineering companies
than the FTSE 100 Index. 50% of the shares under option can be acquired by
the Director if GKN ranks at the median level in the comparator group with no
shares being receivable for below median TSR performance. 100% of the
shares can only be acquired if GKN ranks in the upper quartile of the
comparator group, with a straight-line sliding scale for rankings between
median and upper quartile. No retesting of the performance condition after
the end of the measurement period is permitted.
The TSR information is obtained from an external consultant to ensure that the
performance is independently veriﬁed. In addition, notwithstanding GKN’s
TSR, the Remuneration Committee must be satisﬁed that the vesting of an
option is justiﬁed by the underlying ﬁnancial performance of the Group over
the measurement period.
For options granted from 2001 to 2003 inclusive, the performance condition
is linked to the increase in GKN’s earnings per share, or ‘EPS’, (calculated in
accordance with International Accounting Standard 33, adjusted to exclude
individually signiﬁcant charges and credits (including, but not limited to, major
restructuring costs, proﬁts or losses on disposal of businesses and the change
in fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments where hedge accounting has
not been used) as disclosed in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements and the tax
thereon) over the three years commencing on 1 January in the year of award.
50% of the shares can be acquired if the increase over this period is not less
than the increase in the Retail Prices Index (RPI) plus 9%. The remaining 
50% can only be acquired in full if such increase is RPI plus 15% (with a
straight-line sliding scale for increases between RPI plus 9% and RPI 
plus 15%). If the performance condition is not satisﬁed in full after the ﬁrst
three-year period, so that less than 100% of the shares under option can 
be acquired, the performance condition will be reassessed each year up to 
six years from the date of grant (the RPI plus 9% will be increased by 3% for
each year beyond the third year, and the RPI plus 15% will be increased by 5%
for each year beyond the third year). At the end of the six-year period, any
unvested options will lapse. As stated above, there will be no such retesting
of awards made from 2004 onwards.
Options granted under the ESOS are normally exercisable between the third
and tenth anniversary of the date of grant. The exercise price is ﬁxed at the
market price of GKN’s shares at the time of grant.
Retirement beneﬁts
For executive Directors subject to the UK restrictions on pensionable earnings
in the Finance Act 1989 (the earnings cap), retirement provision is secured by
the Company by a combination of amounts paid to individual ‘money-
purchase’ schemes and supplementary allowances paid to each Director. In
certain cases, dependent in part upon the individual’s salary level at
commencement of employment, retirement beneﬁts are also provided through
membership of the Executive section of the GKN Group Pension Scheme,
which is a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme. The retirement provisions are made in

Annual Report 2005
Report on Directors’ remuneration continued
order to assist each Director towards securing overall retirement beneﬁts
comparable in value with those available under the pension scheme had it not
been for the operation of the earnings cap.
GKN’s pension scheme provides Directors with a pension of up to two-thirds
of basic annual salary (up to the earnings cap) on retirement at age 60 after
20 or more years’ service and proportionately less for shorter service or for
retirement before pension age. A standard employee contribution, currently
5% of gross salary, is required under the scheme, except in the case of
members who joined it prior to 1991 when such contributions were
introduced. In addition, from 1 April 2004 members have been required to pay
a further 2%.
The arrangements for providing retirement beneﬁts to executive Directors and
other senior executives have been reviewed in the light of changes in the
taxation of pensions being introduced by the Government from April 2006. For
those currently affected by the limit on annual pensionable earnings, which
includes all executive Directors, a notional limit will be maintained beyond
April 2006 so that, overall, the existing pension and salary supplement
arrangements will be broadly unchanged. For senior executives who joined the
Company prior to June 1989 and are currently not affected by the limit on
pensionable earnings, no compensation is to be offered for any additional
tax suffered by the individual in the event that the value of their pension
exceeds the new Lifetime Allowance.
Service agreements
The service agreements of executive Directors are with GKN Holdings plc, the
parent company of the GKN Group prior to the Industrial Services demerger in
2001 and now a wholly-owned subsidiary of GKN plc. The non-executive
Directors do not have service agreements, their terms of service being
contained in letters of appointment.
The Board’s current policy is that, unless local employment practice requires
otherwise, the service agreements of its executive Directors will be terminable
by the employing company on one year’s notice. The agreements terminate
in any event at the end of the year in which the Director attains the age of 60.
Other than in the event of early termination following a change of control of
GKN plc, there is no contractual provision for predetermined compensation
payable upon early termination of an executive Director’s service agreement.
In the event of such a severance (other than on a change of control) the
Remuneration Committee would apply the principles of the severance policy
adopted by the Board. Under this policy, which may be varied in individual
cases, an immediate lump sum severance payment will be made to the
Director equivalent to one year’s basic salary plus one year’s pension
contributions. Consideration would be given to the inclusion in the severance
payment of additional elements relating to short-term variable remuneration
and major beneﬁts in kind. However, such additional elements will not
normally be included where the severance is as a result of underperformance.
Consideration would also be given to paying the severance payment in 12
equal instalments which will only be paid to the extent that the Director has
not been able to mitigate his or her loss by the date of the relevant payment.
In the event of the service agreement coming to an end by mutual consent,
the Remuneration Committee will approve such termination arrangements as
are appropriate in the particular circumstances.
As permitted by the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, if termination
of a Director’s service agreement occurs on less than due notice within 12
months following a change in control of GKN plc, a predetermined amount is
payable to the Director equivalent to one year’s basic salary, pension
contributions, beneﬁts in kind and loss of entitlements under short-term
performance-related remuneration arrangements.
An enhancement to the pension rights of an executive Director upon early
retirement will only be considered in exceptional cases and a full costing would
be provided to the Remuneration Committee at the time of its deliberations.
In any event, such enhancement would not be considered unless objectives
set for the Director had been met or it was otherwise merited in the opinion
of the Remuneration Committee.
It is also the Board’s policy that, at the time of consideration of a proposed
appointment of an executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will take
into account the likely cost of severance in determining the appropriateness
of the proposed terms of appointment.
External appointments
The Board recognises the beneﬁt which GKN can obtain if executive Directors
of GKN serve as non-executive Directors of other companies. Subject to review
in each case, the Board’s general policy is that each executive Director may
accept one non-executive directorship with another company (but not the
chairmanship of a FTSE 100 company) from which the Director may retain the
fees.
Kevin Smith is a non-executive Director of Scottish and Southern Energy plc.
Nigel Stein is a non-executive Director of Wolseley plc. They each retain the fees
payable in respect of these appointments (currently £40,000 and £50,000 per
annum respectively). Ian Grifﬁths, who left the service of the Group on
3 February 2006, was a non-executive Director of Ultra Electronics Holdings
plc throughout 2005. He also retained the fee payable in respect of that
appointment in 2005 (£29,000 per annum).
Terms of appointment of Chairman and non-executive Directors
Roy Brown became Chairman in May 2004 for an initial period of three years
terminable at any time upon 12 months’ notice by either party. He receives a
fee, determined by the Remuneration Committee, of £240,000 per annum. He
does not participate in the Group’s short-term variable remuneration or long-
term incentive arrangements or in its pension scheme.
The fees received by each of the remaining non-executive Directors, including
the Deputy Chairman, are determined by the Board upon the recommendation
of the Chairman and the Chief Executive. In respect of 2005, the Deputy
Chairman and Senior Independent Director, Baroness Hogg, received an annual
fee of £55,000. The basic fee received by the other non-executive Directors in
2005 was £40,000. In addition, the Chairmen of the Audit Committee (Sir
Peter Williams) and Remuneration Committee (Baroness Hogg) received
£7,000 and £5,000 respectively to reﬂect the signiﬁcant extra responsibilities
attached to these positions. The non-executive Directors do not participate in
the Group’s short-term variable remuneration or long-term incentive
arrangements or in its pension scheme, nor do they receive beneﬁts in kind.
The current policy, save in exceptional circumstances, is for non-executive
Directors to serve on the Board for nine years with interim renewals after three
and six years, subject to mutual agreement and annual performance reviews. GKN plc 99
Annual Report 2005
With effect from 1 January 2006, Sir Ian Gibson was appointed to the position
of Senior Independent Director, receiving an annual fee of £50,000, Sir Peter
Williams was appointed Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, receiving
the additional fee payable in respect of that position, increased to £8,000, and
John Sheldrick was appointed Chairman of the Audit Committee, receiving the
additional fee payable in respect of that position, increased to £9,000. Also
with effect from 1 January 2006, the basic fee payable to non-executive
Directors was increased to £45,000. Whilst ceasing to be Senior Independent
Director on 31 December 2005, Baroness Hogg continues as Deputy Chairman
until her retirement from the Board at the AGM in May 2006. She will continue
to receive a fee at a rate of £55,000 per annum until that date.
Shareholding requirement
In order to reinforce the alignment of their interests with those of shareholders
generally, all Directors are subject to a shareholding requirement.
Under a policy adopted by the Remuneration Committee, executive Directors
are required to establish and maintain an investment in GKN plc Ordinary
Shares equivalent to at least 100% of their basic salary. The receipt of any
shares by a Director from an award made under the LTIP and ESOS is
conditional upon the shareholding requirement being met on the third
anniversary of the grant of the award. For these purposes any deferred rights
under the LTIP will be counted as shares.
Each executive Director must acquire the minimum required shareholding by
adding to any existing shareholding using performance-related rewards which
may be received under the GKN short-term variable remuneration and long-
term incentive arrangements. Until the required shareholding level is reached,
an executive Director must apply, in the purchase of GKN shares, 30% of that
amount of the gross (i.e. before tax) payment under the short-term (annual)
variable remuneration scheme which exceeds 50% of the Director’s gross
basic salary at that time, and must retain such number of shares received
under the LTIP and ESOS as represents at least 30% of the gross gain which
the Director would have realised on the exercise of such an award had the
shares been sold on the day of exercise.
It is the Board’s policy that non-executive Directors will normally be expected
to acquire a holding of GKN plc Ordinary Shares of a value equivalent to 30%
of one year’s basic fee within three years of appointment.
Total shareholder return performance
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 (the Act) requires GKN’s TSR
performance to be displayed in chart form against the TSR of a readily available
broad equity market index. The Committee considers that in order to maintain
consistency, it continues to be appropriate to show the FTSE 100 Index to fulﬁl
this requirement.
The chart below (left) therefore illustrates the TSR performance (based on an
initial investment of £100) of GKN plc Ordinary Shares over the period from
the Industrial Services demerger in 2001 until the end of 2005 compared to
the TSR that would have been obtained over the same period from a
hypothetical investment in the companies constituting the FTSE 100 Index. The
interim points show the cumulative TSR at each calendar half year-end date.
(As GKN plc was incorporated during the course of 2001, Schedule 7A to the
Act only requires the comparative TSR performance of the Company’s shares
to be shown since 1 August 2001 when the Company became the listed parent
company of the GKN Group just prior to the demerger.)
However, for the purposes of the LTIP and ESOS different comparator
companies are used (see pages 96 and 97). In addition, the TSR calculation
methodology required by the LTIP and ESOS is different from that required 
by the regulations for the broad equity market index graph. We therefore 
show in the table below GKN’s TSR and rank against the TSR of the relevant
comparator group, together with the percentage of the conditional award
converted into a deferred award, for the ﬁve most recently completed
measurement periods as computed under the terms of the LTIP .

FTSE 100 Index less the telecommunications, media, technology and ﬁnancial services sectors and
comprised 57, 63 and 64 companies (including GKN) respectively.

(a) The executive Directors’ basic salaries at 31 December 2005 were: Mr K Smith £659,237; Mr R J Clowes £367,636; Mr I R Grifﬁths £468,000; Mr N M Stein £392,895. The average year-end basic salary of
those executives in the most senior executive grade below Board level whose remuneration is monitored by the Remuneration Committee was £200,068 (all non-sterling amounts have been translated into
sterling at the year-end exchange rate for this purpose).
(b) Payments of supplementary allowances to certain executive Directors to assist them towards securing retirement beneﬁts are included in the money-purchase contributions and allowances for pension
beneﬁt purposes disclosed in the ﬁrst table on page 102. The allowances, detailed below, have therefore been excluded from the total remuneration shown in the table above although they are part of the
Directors’ aggregate emoluments for the purpose of disclosure under the Companies Act 1985: Mr K Smith £153,000 (2004 – £133,000); Mr R J Clowes £103,000 (2004 – £99,000); Mr R W Etches £nil (2004
– £26,000); Mr I R Grifﬁths £142,000 (2004 – £128,000); Mr N M Stein £110,000 (2004 – £103,000).
(c) The service agreement of Mr Clowes terminated by way of redundancy on 31 December 2005. Under Mr Clowes’ redundancy arrangements a payment equivalent to £504,311 was payable to him. This
consisted of 12 months’ basic salary and beneﬁts (including payments relating to pensions, health assurance and car entitlement).
(d) Retired 30 June 2004. Comparative ﬁgure for 2004 represents total emoluments payable on retirement (full details of which were contained within the 2004 Report); the performance-related element of
this (£11,000) was, however, paid in 2005.
(e) Resigned from the service of the Group with effect from 3 February 2006 to take up an appointment external to the GKN Group. No termination payment was payable to Mr Grifﬁths consequent upon him
leaving service.
(f) Left service 30 June 2004. Comparative ﬁgure for 2004 represents total emoluments payable on cessation of employment (full details of which were contained within the 2004 Report); the performance-
related element (£10,000) and a proportion of the termination element (£127,000) were, however, paid in 2005. As Mr Keating was paid in US$, for this purpose his in-service emoluments have been
translated at US$1.82/£1 and his termination costs at US$1.84/£1 being respectively the average exchange rates for the ﬁrst and second halves of 2004.
The 2005 performance-related payments were triggered by the achievement of a number of Group and divisional targets relating to proﬁt before tax and cash
generation. Proﬁt performance equal to target would have resulted in payments of 40% of salary. The maximum amount that an individual could receive under
the proﬁt element was 90% of salary. In addition, cash ﬂow targets were set for the Group as a whole or, where appropriate, the cash ﬂow performance of the
Director’s portfolio for each half of the year. All cash ﬂow targets were achieved, resulting in payments equal to 10% of salary. In relation to proﬁt performance,
achievements resulted in payments of between 16% and 41% of salary.

(a) Represents the earliest exercise date (assuming satisfaction of relevant performance criteria and personal shareholding requirements) and latest expiry date of options held by the Director during the year.
(b) The service agreement of Mr Clowes terminated by way of redundancy on 31 December 2005. Under the rules of the ESOS, any options which vest under his awards will be exercisable for a period of
six months following vesting. The number of shares the subject of his 2004 ESOS award has been reduced, by 91,377 shares, pursuant to the rules to reﬂect his cessation of employment during the course
of the relevant measurement period. Mr Clowes’ SAYE option became exercisable immediately upon his termination.
(c) Resigned from the service of the Group with effect from 3 February 2006, as a consequence of which all outstanding ESOS awards lapsed on that date in accordance with the rules.
(d) The SAYE share option scheme is open to all UK subsidiary employees with six months’ service or more. Participants save a regular monthly sum of up to £250 for three years (or ﬁve years for options
granted prior to 2003) and can use these savings and any bonus payable under the scheme to exercise the options. For options granted prior to 2003, the exercise price was set at the maximum discount
permitted by the Finance Act 1989 of 20% below the market price before the start of the savings period. For options granted in 2003 this discount was reduced to 10% (no SAYE share options were granted
in 2004 or 2005).
(e) The closing mid-market price of GKN plc Ordinary Shares on the London Stock Exchange on 30 December 2005 (being the last day of trading for 2005) was 288p and the price range during the year was
228.75p to 300p.
(f) At 31 December 2005, the total number of GKN plc Ordinary Shares which had been issued on the exercise of options granted by the Company or were the subject of such options remaining outstanding
under the ESOS and the SAYE share option scheme was 21.2 million and 8.4 million respectively. This represents approximately 2.9% of the issued share capital of the Company at that date in respect of
discretionary (i.e. executive) schemes and 4.0% of the issued share capital of the Company at that date in respect of all (i.e. both executive and all-employee) schemes.
Conditional and deferred rights to GKN plc Ordinary Shares under the L TIP held by the executive Directors at 31 December 2005 and 1 January 2005, together
with awards made and lapsed during the year, were as follows:

(a) The closing mid-market price on the date of award of the shares comprising the conditional awards made during the year was 259p per share. The measurement period relating to these awards ends on
31 December 2007.
(b) The service agreement of Mr Clowes terminated by way of redundancy on 31 December 2005. Under the rules of the L TIP , the shares that are the subject of his conditional awards are eligible for release at
the end of the relevant measurement period; the award granted during 2005 lapsed on Mr Clowes’ date of leaving in accordance with the rules as he left in the ﬁrst year of the measurement period. The number
of shares the subject of his 2004 award has been reduced, by 41,592 shares, pursuant to the rules to reﬂect his cessation of employment during the course of the relevant measurement period.
(c) Resigned from the service of the Group with effect from 3 February 2006, as a consequence of which all outstanding LTIP awards lapsed on that date in accordance with the rules.
(d) Since 31 December 2005, the following conditional rights to GKN plc Ordinary Shares in respect of awards granted in relation to the measurement period 2003 to 2005 have lapsed: Mr K Smith 
207,750 shares; Mr R J Clowes 115,600 shares; Mr I R Grifﬁths 103,400 shares; Mr N M Stein 119,200 shares.
(e) During both 2005 and 2004, no conditional rights were converted into deferred awards, no awards vested and no shares were released to Directors. 102 GKN plc

> GKN American Depositary Receipts
GKN has a sponsored Level 1 American Depositary Receipt (ADR) programme
for which The Bank of New York acts as Depositary. Each ADR represents one
GKN plc Ordinary Share. The ADRs trade in the US over-the-counter 
(OTC) market under the symbol GKNLY. When dividends are paid to
shareholders, the Depositary converts such dividends into US dollars, 
net of fees and expenses, and distributes the net amount to ADR holders. 
For enquiries, The Bank of New York can be contacted by telephone 
on +1-888-BNY-ADRS (toll-free for US residents) or +1-212-815-3700 
(for international residents), via their website at www.adrbny.com or by
e-mail enquiry to shareowners@bankofny.com.
> Electronic receipt of documents
Shareholders can elect via the GKN or Shareview websites (see inside back
cover) to receive certain shareholder documents (including annual and interim
reports and notices of shareholder meetings) electronically rather than by
post. If shareholders elect for the electronic option, they will receive a
notiﬁcation by e-mail each time a document is published advising them that
it is available for viewing on GKN’s website. The e-mail will contain a link to the
relevant page on the website, providing shareholders with easy access to the
document which can then be read or printed. By electing for this electronic
option, shareholders will receive documents more speedily, avoid the
possibility of delays in the postal system, save postage costs and help

(a) The stated market values are used to allocate the base cost of GKN Ordinary Shares, on the basis
of the relative percentages speciﬁed, between GKN Ordinary Shares and ‘B’ Shares and between GKN
Ordinary Shares and Brambles Ordinary Shares in calculating any CGT liability under the ‘B’ Share return
of capital and the Industrial Services businesses demerger arrangements. Worked examples and
guides to the general tax position of United Kingdom shareholders under these arrangements are
given in the circulars dated 20 April 2000 and 22 June 2001 respectively (copies of which are available
on request from GKN’s Corporate Centre) and are available on GKN’s website at www.gkn.com.
(b) Being the ﬁrst day of trading of the ‘B’ Shares.
(c) Being the ﬁrst day of trading of the Brambles Ordinary Shares. From this date, the market price of
GKN Ordinary Shares reduced to reﬂect the value of the businesses demerged into the Brambles
group.
(d) Adjusted for subsequent rights and capitalisation issues (prior to the issue of the ‘B’ Shares on
30 May 2000) and the two for one GKN Ordinary Share split in May 1998.
(e) If the GKN Ordinary Shares in respect of which the ‘B’ Shares/Brambles Ordinary Shares were
issued were held by you on 6 April 1965 or 31 March 1982, you will be deemed to have also held the
‘B’ Shares/Brambles Ordinary Shares on such date. In such cases, the 1965/1982 market values
(adjusted as described in note (d)) are apportioned between GKN Ordinary Shares and ‘B’ Shares
and, if you also received Brambles Ordinary Shares, between GKN Ordinary Shares and Brambles
Ordinary Shares using the relative percentages speciﬁed above in respect of the ﬁrst day of trading
market values. The apportioned market values are shown in the table.

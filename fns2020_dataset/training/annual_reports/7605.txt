Hunting at a Glance
Hunting’ s three main manufacturing divisions 
cover the entire wellbore, from surface 
equipment to fracturing, from the beginning 
of the well’ s life cycle to the end, with its 
Well Construction, Well Completion and 
Well Intervention business units.
Meeting  
market demand
Our Clients 
We work with the international and 
national oil companies in all the major 
producing regions of the world as well  
as with all the major energy service 
companies and independent operators  
in the principal producing regions.
Well Construction 
We provide products and services related 
to the initial drilling and construction 
phase of the wellbore. This division 
includes Hunting’s new Advanced

Chairman’ s Statement
“ Despite the world economic 
uncertainty , global demand for 
energy continued to grow . ”
The Group has had another successful 
year of further expansion as management 
integrate the activities of the companies 
acquired in 201 1 and continue to invest 
substantial capital in new facilities.
Underlying profit before tax from 
continuing operations in 2012 was 
£123.6m (201 1 – £79.8m), a 55% 
increase. Reported profit before tax  
from continuing operations was  
£80.7m (201 1 – £38.8m).
Despite the world economic uncertainty , 
global demand for energy continued to 
grow in the year. The industry we serve 
needs not only to provide for that growth 
but also to replace rapidly depleting 
reserves, leading to increasing demand 
for our sophisticated and highly 
engineered products.
Within that general picture, the great 
success of new methods of extracting 
unconventional oil and gas (‘the shale 
revolution’) has had extraordinary effects, 
particularly in the US. The resulting excess 
supply of natural gas has led to low US 
prices for that commodity , but similar 
drilling and production methods are being 
applied to ‘shale oil’ . The result is that 
crude oil production in the US is rising 
after many years of decline.
The Group is well placed in the shale 
revolution, particularly following the 
201 1 acquisition of Hunting Titan, and is 
actively exporting their technology to 
other areas of shale potential such as 
Europe and the Far East.
Activity in the Gulf of Mexico has fully 
returned to the levels it enjoyed prior to 
the tragic Macondo incident of 2010. Our 
facilities serving that market are stretched, 
with further expansion under way . In 
Europe, the North Sea is busy and, once 
again, several of our recently expanded 
facilities are experiencing high utilisation. 
Similarly , our activities in South-East Asia 
and in China are moving ahead strongly .
Within Hunting Energy Services, Well 
Construction activities had another 
highly successful year – emphasising 
the deep strength of several of the core 
activities we have been developing 
over many years. Well Completion, 
the largest contributor, had a satisfactory 
year with profits well ahead of 201 1. 
The smaller Well Intervention activity 
reported continued volatility in the year, 
however activity levels are anticipated 
to improve across the coming year. Business Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information Company Overview
Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012

“ Capital expenditure on new 
and replacement facilities was 
even greater in 201 2 than in  
the previous year . ”
For over 70 years, the Group has had 
a small oil exploration and production 
business in the southern US. We have 
decided to produce from existing 
wells but not to invest further in new 
exploration and production projects, 
except as contractually committed.
Gibson Shipbrokers, a world leader in its 
industry , did well to produce fine results 
in difficult and highly volatile markets.
Shareholders of longer standing will 
know that the Group once had many 
aviation-related activities in its stable. The 
last of these, the Canadian company Field 
Aviation, was sold during the year to the 
management. We wish the company 
every success in the future.
Capital expenditure on new and 
replacement facilities in 2012 was even 
greater than in the previous year. Despite 
this, the Group generated more than  
£54.6m of cash with the result that net 
debt reduced by a similar amount. The 
balance sheet is in excellent shape, with 
financial gearing reduced during the 
year from 30% to 20%.
Underlying diluted earnings per share 
from continuing operations were 57 .5p 
(201 1 – 38.7p), an increase of 49% on the 
previous year. Reported diluted earnings 
per share from continuing operations 
were 40.0p (201 1 – 20.3p).
We are recommending a final dividend 
for 2012 of 1 4.0p per share, payable on 
1 July 201 3 to shareholders on the register 
on 14 June 201 3, giving a total of 18.5p 
for the year, a 23% increase.
Your Company has once again had 
a good year in strong markets and I 
am confident we will be able to take 
advantage of further developments 
in this exciting industry .
I thank all our staff throughout the 
world for our continued success.

As new products are added to the 
inventory , steps have been taken to 
integrate and expand the local presence in 
a tailored and targeted fashion. Perforating 
products are now manufactured at 
facilities in Canada while regional 
warehousing has been established 
throughout the Group’ s existing global 
presence. This allows for an immediate 
response to market needs. 
Coiled tubing tools and pressure control 
equipment have been integrated beyond 
their original acquisition sites to be 
replicated in regional centres within North 
America and Asia Pacific. Improved 
manufacturing efficiencies have been 
made and Lean Manufacturing principles 
embedded across our facilities to enhance 
the Group’ s competitive position. 
These actions will facilitate new revenue 
opportunities and cost efficiencies as 
the Group develops its offering from 
established to new growth markets. 
Underpinning these strategic objectives 
is the commitment to manufacture and 
deliver quality assured products with a 
reputation for total customer satisfaction 
under the Hunting brand.

Chief Executive’ s Review
to underlying profit from continuing 
operations increasing 59% to £128.8m 
(201 1 – £81.0m). Underlying diluted 
earnings per share from continuing 
operations increased by 49% to 57 .5p 
(201 1 – 38.7p).
Reported profit from continuing 
operations was £85.9m (201 1 – £41.0m) 
and reported diluted earnings per share 
from continuing operations was 40.0p 
(201 1 – 20.3p).
Our results have been delivered against 
a market backdrop where the energy 
industry in North America has seen 
a shift in focus from onshore natural 
gas drilling to liquids-focused targets, 
resulting in a 1 3% decline in the number 
of active onshore rig units in the year. 
This has been partially offset by a 1 9% 
increase in the number of offshore active 
Introduction
Hunting has again reported a record 
set of financial results in a year where 
the Group has progressed its strategy 
to internationalise its product portfolio 
enhanced by the businesses acquired 
in recent years. 2012 has been a year 
of integration, consolidation and 
further organic expansion aimed at 
maximising the enlarged Group’s profit 
and margin potential. Plans to further 
grow the manufacturing footprint 
are also under way as expansion 
opportunities in new geographic 
territories are considered.
The Group has reported an annual 
increase in revenue of 36% to £825.8m. 
The increase in business momentum 
seen in the first quarter of the year, 
and generally consistent demand for 
our products throughout 2012, led 
units drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, further 
supported by a 6% increase in other 
regions where Hunting operates 
internationally . The WTI crude oil price 
has also been relatively stable throughout 
the year ensuring that capital expenditure 
by the major energy exploration and 
services companies has been sustained. 
These factors have enabled many of 
Hunting’s businesses to achieve 
outstanding operating results.
In the year Hunting Titan products and 
components began to be manufactured 
at a number of Hunting’s North 
American locations to maximise cost 
benefits and plans are in place to 
commence manufacturing in China 
during 201 3. Hunting Titan’s sales reach 
has been extended to Europe, the Middle 
East and Asia Pacific, with personnel 
being appointed at our key regional 
facilities, extending sales opportunities 
for perforating systems and accessories 
into a wider international customer base.
Hunting’s efforts to further extend its Well 
Construction, Well Completion and Well 
Intervention product offering throughout 
all of its international operating hubs 
is also producing results. This includes 
combining sales and manufacturing 
capabilities of the new acquisitions into 
our Canadian, European and Asia Pacific 
markets and also broadening the existing 
product and service lines offered by 
our UK operations into larger North 
American markets where new demand 
has been identified.

In parallel to these integration initiatives, 
Hunting continues to increase its 
international presence. Hunting Specialty 
has broadened its manufacturing 
and sales reach into Canada and the 
Advanced Manufacturing Group is 
planning international expansion with 
new markets being developed in Asia 
Pacific over the coming year.
Our European and Middle East 
operations continued strong recruitment 
efforts during the year, supporting the 
opening of our expanded facility at 
Badentoy , Scotland and relocation of our 
Middle East operations to new enlarged 
facilities allowing service and repair 
functions to be undertaken. Hunting has 
also commenced a greenfield initiative in 
sub-Sahara Africa, driven by increasing 
sales into West Africa and strong oil and 
gas exploration activities in East Africa. 
In November 2012, a new management 
team based in South Africa joined 
the Group and were tasked to develop 
further sales across the continent and 
to develop plans for establishing a 
manufacturing presence in the region. 
While this initiative will take time to 
develop, it marks a further step in the 
Group’s strategy to further expand its 
international manufacturing capabilities 
into new geographic territories.
In a globally tighter regulatory 
environment and with an increasingly 
diverse operating landscape Hunting 
continues to focus on new product 
innovation and development. In the 
year, the Group integrated its global 
engineering operations, with centres 
of excellence being focused at our 
Aberdeen and Houston facilities. The 
engineering group has a clear pipeline 
of new connection products under 
development with new WEDGE-
LOCK™ and SEAL -LOCK™ designs 
either continuing or completing testing 
in the year. As part of the coordinated 
drive to be the independent supplier of 
choice for premium connection product 
lines, the Group has sanctioned the 
construction of a new development and 
testing facility in Houston. This is targeted 
at accelerating approval timescales for 
new product lines and reducing reliance 
on third party laboratory testing.
Elsewhere in the Group, in April 2012 
we concluded the sale of Field Aviation 
Company Inc, for a total consideration 
of £7.5m. 
With this disposal, the last of its aviation 
entities, Hunting is now a more focused 
energy services group.
The Group continues to recruit key 
personnel in all of its major business 
units, strengthening its core 
manufacturing, sales, human resources 
and finance functions, with the global 
workforce increasing 12% to 3,866 by 
year-end (201 1 – 3,453).
With these encouraging initiatives and 
achievements, Hunting is well positioned 
as an integrated global energy service 
group driven by innovation for our 
international customer base.
Health, Safety and Environment
During 2012 Hunting Energy Services 
recorded 8.44m personnel hours, with 
82 recordable incidents arising in the 
year. There were no fatalities in the year 
(201 1 – nil).
Outlook
Our view for 201 3 is a slow start with an 
improving second half. This conclusion is 
derived from discussions with major oil 
and gas companies, independents and 
OEM clients about their capital spend 
forecasts. Further, order intake in Q4 
2012, current backlogs, facility 
expansions, product introductions and 
inquiry levels are blended to conclude 
that 201 3 will be a year of progress.
Activity levels within our three core 
reporting divisions, Well Completion, 
Well Construction and Well Intervention 
will be driven by factors within each of 
the geographic regions they operate in:
North America
The current rig count for the US and 
Canada is 1 1% below this period in 
2012. Forecasts are evenly split between 
a rising versus a falling rig count for the 
year. Our belief is, with strong oil prices 
prevailing, it will improve modestly 
onshore and remain strong offshore. 
Further improvements in drilling and 
completions will provide increasing 
activity and product usage despite a 
lagging rig count.
Premium Connections will benefit from 
the offshore demand. Accordingly , new 
capacity will be added throughout the 
year. Mud motor usage will lag in some 
regions, climb in others but will offer little 
growth due to slower natural gas 
development.
Within the Advanced Manufacturing 
Group a number of product lines still 
retain an 1 1 to 12 month backlog 
resulting in expansion plans for the 
second half of the year.
The Subsea division will return to 
expected profitability following a year of 
“re-certification” . Its backlog has grown 
significantly with major call off from 
clients expected Q2 201 3 onward.
Our manufacturing and accessories 
activity will benefit from a new facility 
in Houma, Louisiana and the  
offshore growth.
UK and Europe
A doubling of rig activity in offshore UK 
combined with renewed and new supply 
contracts, Hunting is optimistic about 
year-over-year growth in this region. New 
facilities for fracking equipment and 
explosives bunkering are in place with 
steady inquiries resulting. Again, some 
product demand exceeds our ability to 
supply and efforts are underway to solve 
the issue.
Middle East and Asia Pacific
Both regions expect growth in rig count 
and both regions will be providing a 
larger complement of Hunting products. 
Fracking equipment and explosives 
distribution will be in place with 
manufacturing in China. Additional 
capacity has been placed in Singapore 
with new sales efforts in Australia, 
Indonesia, Pakistan and India.
The Board is mindful of the geopolitical 
and economic issues which can 
negatively impact our markets. Further, 
the ability to hire/train key personnel 
remains a difficult task inherent to all in 
the oil and gas industry . Clients change 
plans, projects are delayed and 
competition can become hungrier. 
Against a backdrop which is robust and 
where timings remain unclear, the Group 
is well positioned for further international 
expansion and business growth. Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012

Over the past five years, Hunting PL C has been transformed from 
a group of companies trading in diverse segments of the energy 
sector with local geographies and various brands. Fol lowing a 
programme of targeted divestment, acquisition and expansion, 
the Group has become a focused leader in the provision of 
equipment to the upstream energy industry , united under the 
Hunting brand.

Hunting Energy Services
Hunting Energy Services manufactures 
and distributes high quality precision 
engineered products and components 
that enable the extraction of oil and gas. 
Our customers include international 
energy companies, national oil 
companies and mid to large oil services 
groups. Hunting continues to position its 
technical expertise and operating 
footprint to meet the requirements of 
these customers who are developing 
increasingly complex energy resources 
and operating in ever increasingly 
challenging conditions and locations. 
During 201 2 Hunting Energy Services 
reported a 38% increase in revenue  
to £793.4m (201 1 – £57 4.6m) and a  
63% increase in underlying profit from 
continuing operations to £1 26.7m (201 1 – 
£77 .6m). Reported profit from continuing 
operations was £91 .0m (201 1 – £49.4m). 
This growth has been driven by a full 
year contribution from the acquisitions 
made in 201 1 , sustained onshore drilling 
activity in North America, increased 
drilling in the Gulf of Mexico where rig 
counts have now returned to pre-2010 
levels, and a general improvement in 
international rig counts particularly in the 
North Sea where rigs have recovered 
from the historic lows seen in 201 1.
Well Construction
Hunting’ s Well Construction division 
includes businesses that are positioned in 
the initial drilling and construction phase 
of the wellbore. This division reported 
revenue of £279.3m (201 1 – £1 94.5m), 
with underlying profit from continuing 
operations increasing in the year to 
£45.7m (201 1 – £28.5m). Reported profit 
from continuing operations was £40.6m 
(201 1 – £20.7m). 
The division operates globally and 
comprises six business areas: 
Premium Connections, Drilling T ools,  
Oil Country T ubular Goods (“OCTG”), 
T renchless, Advanced Manufacturing 
Group and Hunting Specialty .
Premium Connections
Hunting’s Premium Connections 
business has delivered an excellent result 
in the year, with demand supported  
by shale related activity and increasing 
global offshore drilling. Natural gas 
programmes in North America slowed 
during the year impacting demand  
in the Marcellus, Haynesville and  
East Texas gas-prone shale basins. The 
switch to liquids-focused drilling  
by many operators helped offset some of 
the decline in momentum, as projects 
continued within the Bakken, Eagle Ford 
and Williston shale areas. Further to this 
onshore activity , renewed drilling in the 
Gulf of Mexico also supported demand 
for Hunting’s connections product lines. 
In the year, sales of Hunting’s proprietary 
‘ Annular Pressure Release Systems’ 
increased compared to 201 1, with  
sales to customers globally.

Drilling Tools
While the Group’s Drilling Tools 
business has delivered its best result 
since 2008, the unit has experienced a 
volatile year, as the industry moved from 
gas to liquids-focused shale regions.  
As the effects of this shift across North 
America were realised, management 
responded by redeploying people and 
its mud motor fleet to the busier regions, 
which included the opening of a new 
facility in Williston, North Dakota, to 
service the demand from the Bakken  
oil shale play. Management have also 
initiated Lean Manufacturing protocols 
across a number of the unit’s facilities 
which will contribute to further 
efficiencies going forward. Hunting’s 
Drilling Tools are now recognised as 
industry leaders with equipment 
regularly being utilised to drill lateral 
sections of a wellbore in excess of 
10,000 feet during a single drilling cycle.
OCTG
Hunting’s OCTG business includes casing 
products and management services 
for customers. The Group has key 
relationships with steel manufacturers  
to facilitate just-in-time logistics.
Trenchless 
Hunting’ s T renchless business delivered a 
good result in the year , as sales benefited 
from a wider distribution network driving 
growth in demand for the unit’ s drill stems. 
The business is now planning further 
international expansion with South 
America and Africa identified as regions 
offering good sales opportunities for its 
products which includes drill stems, 
premium tubing threads and mud  
motor drilling components.
Advanced Manufacturing Group
The businesses within the Advanced 
Manufacturing Group have reported 
excellent results during 201 2, with Hunting 
Dearborn and Hunting Innova both 
delivering record results driven by strong 
demand for MWD/L WD tools. 
Hunting Innova manufactures and 
assembles printed circuit boards which are 
utilised in MWD/L WD measuring tools.  
In the year , Hunting Innova continued to 
attract new customers which helped 
deliver record revenues and income. 
Plans to develop new markets for the unit’ s 
MWD/L WD tools include the establishing 
of a sales and manufacturing presence in 
Asia Pacific in the coming year . 
Hunting Dearborn manufactures the 
precision engineered housings for MWD/
LWD tools. A programme to expand the 
facility was completed in the first half of 
the year which will see improved lead 
times for its specialist product lines.
In the year, the Advanced 
Manufacturing Group made good 
progress with its ‘sole supplier’ concept, 
combining the capabilities of Hunting 
Innova, Hunting Dearborn and Hunting 
Doffing. The concept has been well 
received by a number of major 
international service groups.
Hunting Specialty
Hunting Specialty manufactures 
precision machined MWD parts used 
in directional drilling markets, including 
steering tools and gyro systems and 
delivered an excellent result in the  
year, with the business operating at 
near-capacity. Hunting Specialty has 
focused its expansion plans on 
increasing sales in Canada during  
the year. In the future the business  
will be driving further international 
growth through Hunting’s regional 
manufacturing hubs.

Well Completion
Hunting’ s Well Completion division 
provides products to customers during the 
completion phase of an oil and gas well. 
The division reported revenue of £457 .4m 
in 201 2 (201 1 – £327 .2m) with underlying 
profit from operations totalling £7 4. 1 m 
(201 1 – £4 1 .2m). Reported profit from 
continuing operations was £44. 1 m (201 1 
– £21.4m). 
The division operates globally and 
comprises four business areas: Hunting 
Titan, Premium T ubing, Manufacturing 
and Accessories and Thread Protection.
Hunting Titan
Hunting Titan manufactures perforating 
gun systems, shaped charges and 
associated instrumentation for the global 
hydraulic fracturing market and operates 
through three business lines, Perforating, 
Energetics and Instrumentation. During 
2012, the unit’s results were impacted by 
the switch from natural gas to liquids 
drilling in North America and increased 
competition in the short perforating gun 
segment of its markets. While drilling in 
the oil focused regions offset some of this 
reduced demand, management adapted 
by shifting inventory to the busier shale 
regions. This strategy included the 
opening of two new distribution centres 
in the US, with a further two planned in 
Canada in the short-term. During 2012, 
Lean Manufacturing initiatives were 
introduced at a number of the unit’s 
facilities, which has improved production 
efficiencies. Development of Hunting 
Titan’s international markets made 
excellent progress in the year, as sales 
personnel were added throughout the 
Group’s international manufacturing 
hubs, and plans to produce key Hunting 
Titan products were progressed in 
Mexico, Canada and China. In 2012, 
Hunting Titan sold products to 52 
countries around the world, with 
management confident of generating 
additional sales from these regions  
going forward.
Premium Tubing
Hunting’s Premium Tubing unit, which 
machines and sells premium alloy pipe, 
reported a good result for 2012, despite 
increased volatility due to the shift from 
natural gas to liquids drilling. While the 
short-term outlook for the unit is softer 
when compared to 2012, with 
increased levels of inventory being held 
across the industry, Hunting remains a 
key just-in-time supplier of premium 
pipe product lines supporting increased 
activity in the Gulf of Mexico and the 
liquids-focused shales.
Manufacturing and Accessories
Hunting’s Manufacturing and Accessories 
unit has seen a record performance 
during 2012, with the majority of the 
unit’s facilities operating at capacity 
driven by the increase in offshore drilling 
in the Gulf of Mexico and other 
international drilling markets, including an 
improving North Sea. In the final quarter 
of the year, our deepwater-focused facility 
in Houma, Louisiana was commissioned 
which will primarily service clients in the 
Gulf of Mexico and warehouse a number 
of Hunting Titan product lines. 
Thread Protection
Hunting’s thread protection platform 
provides protection solutions including 
SealLube™ thread compound, Preserve-
A-Thread corrosion protection and 
CLEAR-RUN™, its environmentally 
friendly advanced tubular solution. The 
unit reported a good result in the year, 
driven by new product lines being 
introduced and qualified for use with a 
number of key customers.
Well Intervention
Hunting’s Well Intervention division 
supplies a range of products and  
services required throughout the life  
of a well to enhance and maintain 
production and in 2012 reported  
an underlying profit from operations  
of £6.9m (201 1 – £7 .9m). Reported  
profit from continuing operations was 
£6.3m (201 1 – £7 .3m).
The division operates globally and 
comprises two business areas: Hunting 
Subsea and Hunting Welltonic.
Hunting Subsea
Hunting Subsea manufactures and 
distributes precision engineered subsea 
valves, couplings and chemical injector 
systems. In 2012, the Subsea business 
continued to report mixed trading, as 
efforts to complete the recertification of 
the valves and chemical injector product 
lines for use in the Gulf of Mexico 
extended throughout the year. Looking 
forward, the Subsea business is poised 
for a year of good growth driven by 
increased offshore global rig counts.
Hunting Welltonic
Hunting Welltonic provides well 
intervention technologies, services and 
pressure control systems, to maintain and 
enhance the productivity of an oil and 
gas well. During 2012, the unit continued 
to grow its international revenue streams 
as North Sea drilling activity decreased in 
the early part of the year. The business 
has successfully entered markets in the 
US, where demand for Thru-T ubing and 
pressure control products has been 
identified across the various shale  
regions in the country . The business has 
established a presence at Hunting’s 
Conroe, Texas facility in the US and is 
now exploring sales growth opportunities 
in the Canadian market.

Other Operating Divisions
Exploration and Production
Hunting’ s Exploration and Production 
division has interests in the southern US 
and offshore Gulf of Mexico, holding equity 
interests in over 50 production properties. 
On a Net Equivalent Barrel (“NEB”) basis, 
production in the year was 1 3 1 ,000 NEB 
(201 1 – 252,000 NEB), with proven reserves 
at year end being 1 . 1 m NEB (201 1 – 1 .2m 
NEB). Due to disruptions in the region’ s  
gas pipeline system, primarily as a result  
of inspection and maintenance work, 
production volumes in the year were 
significantly reduced, leading to lower 
revenues and income. Additionally , the 
continuing depressed natural gas price in 
the US contributed to lower revenues. 
Based on these operating conditions, the 
business reported an underlying profit from 
operations of £0.5m (201 1 – £1 .7 m). The 
reported loss from continuing operations 
was £6.7 m (201 1 – £0.7 m profit). 
During 2012, the business participated in 
12 onshore wells and three offshore 
wells, with eight of the onshore wells and 
one offshore well finding reserves, 
contributing to the reserve base at year 
end. Costs of £2.0m associated with 
wells deemed to be uncommercial have 
been written off as dry hole costs.
Following a year end valuation of 
reserves, which requires individual oil 
and gas properties to be impaired when 
the realisable value is less than the book 
value based on future production and 
commodity prices, the business has 
taken an impairment charge of £5.2m 
reflecting lower gas prices.

Gibson Shipbrokers
Gibson continues to be one of the 
foremost global shipbroking businesses 
and now employs 1 65 personnel in the 
UK, Norway , Singapore and Hong Kong, 
an increase of 1 1 % compared to 201 1. 
During the year, despite continuing 
hostile trading conditions, good progress 
has been made across the business with 
fixing volumes increasing 18% year on 
year leading to an increase in revenue  
of 6% to £27 .5m (201 1 – £26.0m). 
Underlying profit from operations 
decreased 6% to £1.6m (201 1 – £1.7m).
The business continues to be a leading 
broker in crude oil, fuel oil and clean 
petroleum products. The gas division 
covers LNG and LPG broking. The 
specialised division focuses on smaller 
shipments of chemicals, biofuels,  
vegoil, palm oil and lubes. The dry  
bulk division focuses on Panamax and 
Cape liftings of iron ore, grain and coal. 
The offshore division has also grown  
its subsea, seismic and renewable 
energy broking activities and the sale 
and purchase division remains active 
covering newbuilds, resales, scrap and 
valuations. A world class consultancy 
department works closely with all the 
divisions and undertakes commission 
work for existing and new clients. Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012

Financial Review
Overview
The 2012 annual report reflects another 
year of strong earnings growth and 
improving margins underpinned by a full 
year contribution from the acquisitions 
completed during 201 1.
The Group’s balance sheet continues to 
strengthen, net assets are now in excess 
of £800m, providing a sound financial 
base from which to support further 
expansion through organic and 
acquisitive growth. Resolution of a 
legacy tax dispute during the year is of 
particular note providing a release of 
provisions and an inflow of cash which 
together with strong free cash flow from 
the Group’s global operations results in 
net debt improving to £163.8m from 
£218.4m at 31 December 201 1. The 
Group’s gearing has improved as a 
consequence and is now 20%.
Given the increased scale and 
geographic footprint of the Group and 
the ongoing programme of growth, the 
framework of internal and financial 
controls continues to be enhanced with 
appropriate investment in IT and central 
management resource.
Revenue
Group revenues increased 36%, or 
£21 7 .0m, to £825.8m in 2012 (201 1 – 
£608.8m). The year on year effect of the 
acquisitions made in the latter part of 
201 1 added £1 55.2m to revenue. The 
remaining £6 1.8m of revenue growth 
from existing businesses resulted from 
like-for-like growth of 1 1 %. 
Well Construction was the strongest 
performing division, with revenue up 
44% to £279.3m (201 1 – £1 94.5m). This 
division has benefited from a full year 
contribution from the Hunting Dearborn, 
Hunting Doffing and Hunting Specialty 
acquisitions which collectively added 
£49. 1m of revenue growth. Like-for-like 
growth in the division was 20%. Despite 
volatile conditions caused by the change 
in focus for onshore drilling from gas to 
oil, the Drilling Tools business performed 
very well supported by the opening of 
new facilities. The Premium Connections 
business faced similar challenges onshore, 
but was supported by increasing global 
offshore activity . The other key strong 
performer in this division was Hunting 
Innova which forms part of the Advanced 
Manufacturing Group.
Well Completion revenue was up 40% 
to £457 .4m (201 1 – £327 .2m) with the 
full year impact of the Hunting Titan 
acquisition adding £106.1m of revenue. 
The base businesses also performed 
well with like-for-like revenue up 9%.  
The Manufacturing and Accessories 
unit set a record performance driven  
by improving global offshore markets. 
The Well Intervention division has 
recovered to some extent after recent 
declines post-Macondo. Revenue grew 
by 7% to £56.7m (201 1 – £52.9m). Our 
Subsea business experienced modest 
year on year revenue growth in 2012 
with an improved outlook for 201 3 as  
the sector recovers and we benefit from 
the extension of our Stafford facility . 
The Hunting Welltonic businesses 
increased revenues by developing  
new markets in the US.
Revenue from other divisions fell by a 
net £1.8m. Exploration and Production 
revenues fell by £3.3m due to pricing and 
lower production volumes. This was 
partly offset by a £1.5m improvement 
from Gibson Shipbrokers on higher 
trading volumes. EBITDA

EBITDA from Continuing Operations
Underlying EBITDA increased to 
£154.3m for 2012 and was £51.8m 
ahead of 201 1 largely driven by the full 
year contribution from businesses 
acquired in 201 1.
Profit from Continuing Operations
Underlying profit from continuing 
operations increased by £47 .8m, from 
£81.0m in 201 1 to £128.8m in 2012 
with £35.2m resulting from the year 
on year effect of acquisitions made in 
201 1. Operating margins also increased 
from 13% to 16% as a result of the 
improved product mix following the 
201 1 acquisitions.
Well Construction’s underlying profit 
from operations was up 60% to £45.7m 
(201 1 – £28.5m) driven by the benefit 
of acquisitions and improved trading in 
Premium Connections, Drilling Tools 
and at Hunting Innova. The division’s 
operating margin also improved from 
15% in 201 1 to 16%.
In Well Completion, underlying profit 
from operations increased by 80% to 
£7 4. 1 m (201 1 – £41.2m) predominantly 
due to the full year contribution from 
Hunting Titan, which was acquired in 
September 201 1 , with the division’s 
margin improving from 1 3% in 201 1  
to 1 6% in 2012 as a result of this.
In Well Intervention, whilst there was a 
modest increase in revenue, underlying 
profit fell by £1.0m following the 
previously reported issues associated  
with the tighter regulations in the Gulf  
of Mexico which adversely affected the 
results of our Subsea operation.
Amortisation and Exceptional Items 
Intangible asset amortisation charges 
increased from £12.2m in 201 1 to £28. 1 m 
in 2012 due to the full year effect of the 
acquisitions made in 201 1.
The following exceptional charges  
arose in the year:
•	 Unwinding of the fair value uplift 
applied to inventory taken on with 
the 201 1 acquisitions has resulted in 
a £7 .6m charge reflecting acquired 
stock sold in the period. The 
remaining uplift of £2.6m is 
expected to be charged in 2013.
•	 The final charges under employee 
retention schemes put in place as 
part of the 201 1 acquisitions were 
incurred in 2012 and totalled £1. 1m. 
•	 The Exploration and Production 
division incurred charges of £7 .2m 
as a result of £5.2m of impairments  
to its oil and gas capitalised 
expenditures largely due to future 
commodity price expectations and 
dry hole costs of £2.0m.
•	 £1.1m has been credited to the 
income statement reflecting the 
release of amounts provided on the 
Hunting Doffing acquisition for profit 
related earn-outs. 
Reported profit from operations in 2012 
for the Group was £85.9m which was 
£44.9m better than 201 1. This increase 
was similar to the underlying improvement 
with amortisation and exceptional items 
relatively consistent year on year.
Taxation
The Group’s underlying tax rate for 2012 
has remained at 28% (201 1 – 28%), 
resulting in an underlying tax charge of 
£34.6m (201 1 – £22.5m). The tax rate 
reflects the weighting of profits in lower 
tax jurisdictions, together with a reduced 
UK corporate tax rate. The underlying 
tax rate for 2013 is currently expected to 
reduce to 27% as a result of reductions 
in global corporate tax rates in the 
countries where we operate, however, 
the actual rate will be dependent on the 
regional mix of profits.
Amortisation and exceptional items in  
the year attracted tax credits of £16.7m  
to give a net tax charge on continuing 
operations in 2012 of £17 .9m (201 1 – 
£7.3m).
Net Finance Costs
Net reported finance costs in 2012  
were £6.2m (201 1 – £3.2m) increasing  
in line with higher average levels of  
debt following the 201 1 acquisition 
programme.

Earnings per Share
Underlying diluted earnings per share  
for continuing operations increased  
49% or 18.8p over 201 1 to 57 .5p in 
2012. Reported diluted earnings per 
share for continuing operations at 40.0p 
was 19.7p above 201 1. 
The weighted average number of shares 
used in calculating the diluted earnings 
per share in 2012 was 149.5m 
compared to 140.1m in 201 1, with the 
increase mainly due to the full year 
effect of the 13.2m share placing 
completed in August 201 1.
disputes with the Canadian tax 
authorities. The larger of the two 
disputes has been settled resulting in  
the gain which comprises:
•	 The refund of tax payments from the 
tax authority totalling £1 7 .2m received 
in December 2012.
•	 The refund of related tax payments 
from provincial authorities totalling 
£8.7m, which was received on 28 
February 2013.
•	 The release of provisions totalling 
£30.7m (see note 1 3).
•	 Movements on other Gibson related 
provisions totalling £0.3m.
Provisions totalling £7 .7m have been 
retained relating to the smaller dispute. 
In addition a £1.4m gain was realised on 
the sale of Field Aviation Company Inc. 
in April 2012 (see note 1 3).
Cash Flow
The free cash flow generated in 2012 
was £86.5m compared to £38.9m in 
201 1. The underlying improvement in 
EBITDA from £102.5m to £1 54.3m was 
the key driver of this. Working capital 
movements absorbed £18.6m, with 
finance costs and taxation paid absorbing 
£5.2m and £1 5. 1m respectively .
Replacement capital spend increased 
from £12.8m to £27 .0m largely due to 
equipment replacement in the Drilling 
Tools business, general machine 
replacement projects across the Group, 
together with £5.5m (201 1 – £2.3m) 
spend within the Exploration and 
Production division.
Expansion capital expenditure in the 
year was £34.6m (201 1 – £45.2m). 
Facility expansion projects across the 
Group absorbed £15.7m, including key 
projects at Stafford, Houma and Hunting 
Dearborn. Total capital expenditure for 
2012 was £61.6m compared to £58.0m 
in 2011.
Payments of £2.2m were made in respect 
of final price adjustments and earn-out 
arrangements related to the acquisitions 
made in 201 1. Further payments of £1.2m 
are expected in 201 3 after which the 
potential liabilities will be extinguished.
As described above, a £1 7 .2m repayment 
of tax was received from the Canadian 
tax authorities on the resolution of a 
legacy tax dispute relating to our former 
subsidiary Gibson Energy .
Total dividends paid during the year 
were £24.1m (201 1 – £18.0m). 
Dividends paid to equity shareholders of 
£22.6m were 35% ahead of 201 1 and 
reflects the Board’s confidence in the 
strength of the Group.
Movements in foreign exchange rates, 
particularly the US$ against £-sterling, 
which moved from 1.55 at 31 December 
201 1 to 1.63 at 31 December 2012, 
benefited the cash flow by £9.4m  
(201 1 – £4.0m outflow). This is mainly 
attributable to the retranslation of the 
Group’s US$ borrowings at the year end.
Financial Review continued
Discontinued Operations
The reported profit for the year from 
discontinued operations was £69.2m 
(201 1 – £50.7m) and was entirely 
exceptional. The main feature of the 
profit was a £56.9m gain relating to the 
resolution of a legacy tax dispute in 
Canada. Following the sale of Gibson 
Energy in 2008, Hunting established 
provisions for tax indemnities given to 
the purchaser in respect of two tax  Business Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information Company Overview

Financial Capital Management
2012 was a year of integrating the 
acquisitions made in 201 1 into the 
Group and in making our final strategic 
disposal, being that of the Field Aviation 
business. This combined with the 
decision to cease investing in the 
Exploration and Production business 
leaves the Group a more focused 
supplier of products and services to  
the energy sector. 
The Group’s financial position remains 
robust, with total credit facilities of  
£416.2m in place (201 1 – £423.6m) of 
which £375.0m (201 1 – £375.0m) is 
committed. The committed facility  
is a £375.0m multi-currency revolving 
credit facility from a syndicate of 10 
banks which extends to August 2016. 
Further details regarding the facility  
can be found in note 30. 
Net debt has reduced significantly in  
the year with gearing falling to 20% at  
3 1 December 201 2 (201 1 – 30%) with  
an adequate level of headroom remaining 
compared to the Group’ s committed 
credit facilities providing management with 
ongoing financial flexibility . Our bank 
facility covenants (note 36) require EBITDA 
to cover relevant finance charges by a 
minimum of 4 times and net debt to 
adjusted EBITDA has a current maximum 
of 3.5 times. Both key bank covenant 
metrics at year end were well covered.
The maximum net debt to EBITDA 
permitted will reduce to 3 times in June 
201 3 and will remain at that level until 
the facility expires in 201 6. 
Return on average capital employed is a 
KPI management use to assess business 
unit performance. The Group’s return on 
average capital employed has fallen from 
the 1 5% reported in 201 1 to 1 4% for 
2012 due to the year on year impact  
of the 201 1 acquisitions. 
The Board considers each ordinary 
dividend proposed based on the merits 
of the information available to it at the 
time. Consideration is given to the 
financial projections of business 
performance and capital investment 
needs, together with feedback from 
shareholder discussions.
The Group operates a centralised 
treasury function with policies and 
procedures approved by the Board. 
These cover funding, banking 
relationships, foreign currency, interest 
rate exposures, cash management and 
the investment of surplus cash. Further 
detail on financial risks is provided 
within note 30.
The Group has significant foreign 
operations and hence results originate  
in a number of currencies, particularly  
in US dollars. As a result, the Group’s 
financial statements, which are reported 
in sterling, are subject to the effects of 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations with 
respect to currency conversions. 
Currency exposure on the balance sheet 
is, where practical, reduced by financing 
assets with borrowings in the same 
currency. Spot and forward foreign 
exchange contracts are used to cover 
the net exposure of purchases and sales 
in non-domestic currencies.
Balance Sheet
Whilst foreign exchange rates used in 
the translation of results have remained 
very similar between 201 1 and 2012, 
there has been a more significant 
change in the closing rates used for US 
dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
with 201 1 at US$1.55 and 2012 at 
US$1.63 to £1. 
Foreign exchange is the only reason for the 
movement in goodwill. Other intangible 
assets have also been impacted by foreign 
exchange but the principal movement is 
the amortisation charge of £28. 1 m 
reflected in the year (201 1 – £1 2.2m). 
Property , plant and equipment has 
increased by £1 7 .3m with £63.4m of 
additions, offset by £25.5m of depreciation, 
disposals of £6.8m, impairment of £5.2m  
in Exploration and Production assets and 
foreign exchange of £8.6m.
Working capital has increased by 
£10.6m reflecting increased activity 
levels including a year on year increase 
in the number of Group operational 
facilities – now at 66. Inventories at the 
year end include £2.6m of fair value 
uplift expected to be charged to the 
income statement in 2013. Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012
26
Provisions have reduced by £30.9m 
during the year following resolution of  
a Canadian tax dispute as described 
above. This settlement is also the major 
contributory factor to the increase in 
other net assets of £6.5m, which includes 
the £8.7m further tax repayments due 
from Canadian provincial authorities, 
received on 28 February 201 3.
Overall, capital employed in the Group 
has remained steady at £977 .6m (201 1 – 
£950.4m). 
Thanks to strong free cash generation, 
the overall cash inflow in 2012 of 
£54.6m has reduced net debt to 
£163.8m at 31 December 2012.
Net assets at 31 December 2012 were 
£813.8m which, after non-controlling 
interests of £18.3m, result in equity 
shareholders’ funds of £795.5m. This  
is an increase of £80.3m over 31 
December 201 1, which reflects the 
retained result for the year of £128.9m, 
exchange losses of £27 .3m, offset by 
£22.6m dividend payments together 
with other gains of £1.3m.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Group accounts are prepared using 
accounting policies in accordance with 
IFRS. The principal accounting policies 
are set out in note 45.
The preparation of these accounts 
requires the use of estimates, judgements 
and assumptions that affect the reported 
amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and 
expenses and the disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities. Directors’ estimates 
are based on historical experience, 
consultation with experts and other 
methods that they believe are reasonable 
and appropriate.
Amortisation and Exceptional Items
In addition to presenting reported IFRS 
GAAP results in its income statement, the 
Group discloses results on an underlying 
basis i.e. before amortisation and 
exceptional items. This is the basis on 
which the Directors assess the business in 
internal reporting. In the Directors’ view 
this is necessary to obtain a clear 
understanding of the underlying 
performance of the business. More details 
on amortisation and exceptional items 
can be found in note 7 .
Goodwill
The carrying value of goodwill held on 
the balance sheet is reviewed for 
impairment at least annually . The review 
compares the carrying value with the 
estimated future cash flows from the cash 
generating unit to which the goodwill 
relates. The cash flows are based on 
management’s view of future trading 
prospects. Any shortfall identified is 
treated as an impairment and written off.
Property, Plant and Equipment and 
Other Intangible Assets
The Group’s property , plant and 
equipment and other intangible assets are 
subject to annual rates of depreciation 
intended to spread the cost of the assets 
over their estimated service life. These 
rates are regularly reviewed. The rates 
currently in use are set out on page 1 12. 
In addition if, in management’s 
judgement, events or circumstances 
indicate a potential impairment may have 
occurred, then a review of the carrying 
value of the asset will be carried out.
Provisions
Provisions amounting to £29.6m are held 
on balance sheet at the year end. These 
are based on Directors’ estimates of the 
future cost of current obligations. The 
main element of provisions is in respect 
of onerous lease obligations on premises 
not occupied by Group entities where 
assessments have been made as to the 
period properties are likely to remain 
vacant and what market rents can be 
achieved upon occupancy .
Taxation 
The effective tax rate for the full year is 
28% and is the combined rate arising 
from the regional mix of Group results. 
The rate takes into account the estimated 
future utilisation of tax losses and the 
agreements with regional tax authorities 
of corporate tax computations.
Deferred Tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recorded within the financial statements 
at 31 December 2012 at £7 .2m and 
£25.7m respectively . These balances are 
derived from assumptions which include 
the future utilisation of trading losses and 
provisions at assumed tax rates and 
eligibility for offset within a tax 
jurisdiction.
Share-based Payments
The estimated cost of grants and awards 
of equity instruments to Group 
employees is spread evenly over the 
vesting period. The actuarial assumptions 
used in determining the charge to income 
are set out in note 38.
Retirement Benefits 
The Group operates a defined benefit 
pension scheme in the UK, which was 
closed to new entrants with effect from 31 
December 2002, as well as a number of 
defined contribution schemes within the 
Group. The defined benefit scheme is 
accounted for under IAS 1 9 and the main 
actuarial assumptions used are shown 
within note 32 and in the table below . 
Actuarial Assumptions:
2012 2011
Rate of inflation 3.1% 3.2%
Discount rate 4.3% 4.7%
Expected future lifetime

Review of Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The Group has an established risk 
management monitoring and review 
process described in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 40 to 43.  
The process requires all businesses  
to identify, evaluate and monitor risks 
and take steps to reduce, eliminate or 
manage the risk. Group risks are 
formally reviewed by the Board at least 
three times a year and are discussed at 
every Board meeting. The principal risks 
identified through this process that 
Hunting is exposed to, which could 
have a material adverse impact are listed 
below, together with the steps the 
Group has taken to mitigate against 
these risks. Some arise from the specific 
activities undertaken by the Group 
whereas others are common to many 
international manufacturing companies.
Risks Specific to the Nature of  
Hunting Group Businesses
Shale Drilling
The Group provides products to the oil 
and gas shale drilling industry. There 
may be considerable future resistance to 
further oil and gas shale exploration and 
development from significant sections of 
the public, and a drilling moratorium or 
new laws and regulations may 
unfavourably impact the industry.
The Board monitors public and political 
opinion and maintains an awareness of 
the potential for changes to legislation 
especially with regard to the US where 
the Group is mainly exposed.
Raw Material Commodity Prices
Although not under the Group’s control, 
a material movement in oil or gas 
commodity prices could impact demand 
for the Group’s products and services.
Working capital and in particular 
inventory levels are closely managed  
to mitigate against exposure to 
commodity price movement.
Acquisitions and Capital Investment
Acquisitions are an integral part of the 
continuing Group’s recent strategy of 
expansion and development. While 
recent acquisitions made by the Group 
have integrated well, the Board is 
conscious of the potential disruption to 
both the Group and acquiree, of an 
acquisition process and subsequent 
integration.
The Board is actively involved in 
monitoring, approving and assessing 
acquisitions through post acquisition 
appraisals to mitigate the risk of poor 
investment decisions. All acquisitions 
require Board approval prior to 
commitment.
The Group continues to seek 
opportunities for organic growth and 
maintains an active capital investment 
programme. The programme 
encompasses investments in new 
territories, buildings, production 
equipment, rental equipment and IT 
systems. There is a range of risks 
involved in such programmes, including 
poor financial returns, management 
distraction, facility disruption and risk 
of IT systems failure.
The Board and senior management 
follow a rigorous process of approving, 
managing and monitoring capital 
investments along with planning for 
contingencies. All capital expenditure 
above discretionary limits requires  
Board approval prior to commitment.
Relationships with Key Customers
The Group’ s success is defined by 
relationships with its key customers. A 
material reduction in orders from a major 
customer , whether through competitive 
action, contractual dispute, business 
consolidation or change in strategy could 
impact the Group’ s financial performance 
and prospects. The Group is also reliant 
upon the conduct of its customers, given 
its products are exported by those 
customers across the world and used in a 
range of environments, including deep 
sea exploration and production. Senior 
management maintains close relationships 
with key customers and seeks to maintain 
the highest level of service to preserve 
Hunting’ s reputation for quality .
Product Quality and Reliability
Product quality and reliability is critical to 
the Group’s reputation with its customers.
Quality assurance standards are 
monitored, measured and regulated 
within the Group under the authority of a 
Quality Assurance Director, who reports 
directly to the Chief Executive. Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012
28
Other Risks Common to International 
Manufacturing Businesses
Economics and Geopolitics
The economic and political environment 
in the geographic areas in which the 
Group operates impacts demand for 
energy and therefore the Group’s range 
of products and services.
Management and the Board closely 
monitor trading results, forecasts, political 
developments and projected economic 
trends in order to match capacity to 
demand and, where possible, minimise 
the impact of adverse trends on the 
Group. In addition overheads are 
monitored regularly to ensure the  
cost base is actively managed.
Key Executives
The Group is highly reliant on the 
continued service of its key executives 
and senior management, who possess 
commercial, engineering, technical and 
financial skills that are critical to the 
success of the Group. Remuneration 
packages are regularly reviewed to ensure 
they are remunerated in line with market 
rates. External consultants are engaged to 
provide guidance on best practice. 
Failure to retain suitably qualified 
individuals, or to attract and retain strong 
management and technical staff in the 
future, could have an adverse effect  
upon the Group and the results of its 
operations. Senior management 
regularly review the availability of the 
necessary skills within the Group and 
seeks to find suitable staff where they 
feel there is vulnerability.
Health, Safety and Environmental 
(“HS&E”)
The Group is subject to a number of 
HS&E laws and regulations that affect  
its operations, facilities and products in 
each of the jurisdictions in which it 
operates. The Group is committed to 
operating in compliance with all HS&E 
laws and regulations relating to its 
products, operations and business 
activities. However, there is a risk that  
it may have to incur unforeseen 
expenditures to cover HS&E liabilities,  
to maintain compliance with current or 
future HS&E laws and regulations or to 
undertake any necessary remediation.
It is difficult to estimate with any 
reasonable certainty the future impact  
of HS&E matters, including potential 
liabilities, due to a number of factors and 
especially the lengthy time intervals 
often involved in resolving them. There 
is regular HS&E compliance reporting to 
the Board.
 
Effective Control Over Subsidiaries
Group subsidiaries operate within a 
control framework with a degree of 
autonomy vested in local management. 
The control framework has been 
enhanced with additional central staff in 
areas such as finance and taxation, the 
introduction of new IT systems and 
stronger co-ordination of IT activities. The 
operations of subsidiaries are subject to 
regular checking by management through 
board and management meetings, regular 
reporting and contact together with 
external and internal audit.
Fluctuation in Currency  
Exchange Rates
The Group has significant overseas 
operations, hence results are 
denominated in a variety of currencies. 
As a result, the Group’s financial 
statements, which are reported in sterling, 
are subject to the effects of foreign 
exchange rate fluctuations with respect  
to currency conversions.
The Group maintains a strategy of 
financial hedging to mitigate such risk, 
subject to the availability of suitable 
products at the right cost.

positions from disabled persons and to 
their training and career advancement. 
Every effort is made to retain in 
employment those who become 
disabled while employed by the Group.
It is important for the Group to retain key 
employees, as well as attracting high 
quality individuals. This remains a major 
challenge for the oil and gas industry . 
Hunting has developed a supportive 
work environment that promotes 
development, learning and advancement 
to ensure that its employees realise their 
potential. Long service is a feature of the 
Group’s employees and recognition is 
given through service award programmes 
across the Group. Forty years’ service is 
not an uncommon attribute.
Hunting believes that employing the right 
people is only the start of the relationship 
between an employee and employer. 
The Group is committed to mutually 
developing an environment of honesty , 
integrity and respect for its staff and for 
those people and companies we work 
with daily . The Group is also committed 
to abiding by all international and local 
laws and regulations on employment and 
has a no child labour policy .
The Group encourages and promotes an 
awareness of the financial and economic 
factors affecting the performance of the 
Group and shares information on current 
activities through regular communication 
and consultation.

Through the Group’s Code of Conduct, 
published on the Company’s website, the 
Group sets out its equal opportunities 
policies and zero tolerance approach to 
harassment within the workplace. The 
Group’s gender diversity policy , which 
also seeks to promote fair and equal 
opportunities, is also published on the 
Company’s website.
The Group believes that providing 
additional benefits to staff encourages  
the best performance from our people. 
Therefore, most employees are offered 
participation in schemes which provide 
healthcare and post-retirement benefits 
and, in certain instances, participation in 
bonus arrangements when 
outperformance in terms of operational 
excellence has been achieved. Hunting 
has share award schemes in place as  
a longer term incentive whereby staff  
can participate in the ownership of  
the Company.
The Board has an established “whistle-
blowing” procedure in place for any 
employee wishing to raise, in confidence, 
any concerns they may have about 
possible financial improprieties, or other 
matters, with the Senior Independent 
Director. Details of the procedure are 
regularly communicated to all 
employees.
Health and Safety
The Group is committed to achieving 
and maintaining the highest standards  
of safety for its employees, customers, 
suppliers and the public. Hunting has  
a proven culture of aiming for best 
practice and employs rigorous health 
and safety practices. 
Health and Safety policies include:
•	 Regular audit and maintenance 
reviews of facilities, equipment, 
practices and procedures to ensure 
compliance with prevailing standards 
and legislation and a safe environment 
for all those who work within and 
around our facilities.
•	 Seeking accreditation and aligning 
long standing company programmes 
and procedures to internationally 
recognised Quality Assurance 
standards.
•	 Monitoring, which is a management 
task, is documented and reported at 
each Board meeting.
•	 Appropriate training and education  
of all staff.
The Group has published its combined 
policy on health, safety and 
environmental matters, which can  
be found on the Group’s website.
Hunting’s Director of Health, Safety and 
Environment reports directly to the Chief 
Executive and a report is considered by 
the Board of Directors at each meeting. 
The Group’s target is to achieve zero 
recordable incidents. Each local business 
is required to develop tailored policies 
to reflect its daily business. These 
incorporate the Group’s approach to 
putting safety first and, at a minimum,  
to comply with local regulatory 
requirements. Training is given to every 
employee, whether they are on the  
shop floor or working from a desk. 
During the year, there were no fatalities 
across the Group’s operations with 
82 recordable incidents. 
In 2012, the Group continued its 
programme to introduce Lean 
Manufacturing processes into global 
operations. This resulted in efficiency 
gains in a number of key business units.
Environment
The Group is committed to the 
protection of the environment and 
developing manufacturing processes 
and procedures, which ensure that any 
adverse effects on the environment are 
kept to a practicable minimum. We take 
the view that sustainable development is 
in the interests of all our stakeholders 
and include environmental issues in  
our planning and decision-making. 
The Group’s environmental policy  
is to look for opportunities and adopt 
practices that create a safer and cleaner 
environment. It is particularly sensitive to 
the challenges for the industry in which 
it operates. The Group has programmes 
in place to monitor the environmental 
impact from its operational activities  
and remains focused on ensuring 
environmental consideration is at the 
forefront of its business practices.

Key aspects of our environmental  
policies include:
•	 Keeping any adverse effects on  
the environment to a practicable 
minimum.
•	 Encouraging the reduction of waste 
and emissions and promoting 
awareness of recycled materials and 
use of renewable resources.
•	 Each operating unit developing and 
implementing their own procedures 
while conducting regular reviews to 
ensure that they are maintained and 
refined.
•	 Encouraging employees to pay special 
regard to environmental issues and 
requirements in the communities in 
which the Group operates.
•	 Incorporating health, safety and 
environment considerations into the 
design of new facilities.
With the aim of maintaining standards a 
number of the Group’ s operating facilities 
are ISO or API registered or subject to 
other similar registrations or industry 
qualifications. In 201 2, 7 facilities (201 1 
– 6) within the Group were ISO 1 4001 
compliant indicating a recognised 
environmental management system being 
in place and 2 facilities being ISO 1 8001 
compliant (201 1 – 1 ), indicating that health 
and safety systems have been reviewed 
and formally certified. More facilities 
across the Group are working towards 
these accreditations, continuing the 
Group’ s commitment to monitoring and 
reducing the environmental impact of its 
operations and increasing HSE standards.
The Group continues to monitor and 
collect data relating to its carbon 
emissions from across its operations. 
For 2012, each business unit across the 
Group has reported scope 1 and 2 
emissions to provide a consolidated total 
of each source of greenhouse gas 
emissions. Total emissions are then 
converted to a carbon dioxide equivalent 
figure, using conversion factors published 
by DEFRA at www.defra.gov.uk. The 
following table details Hunting’s scope 1 
and 2 emissions, excluding vehicle 
mileage and fuel consumption.

Total gross

The increase in carbon dioxide emissions 
between 201 1 and 201 2 is primarily 
attributed to the acquisitions completed in 
201 1 , where the operational scale of the 
Group materially increased. Including 
vehicle mileage and fuel consumption 
data, Hunting’ s 201 2 scope 1 emissions 
would be 9,06 1 tonnes of carbon dioxide, 
leading to a scope 1 and 2 total of 45,210 
tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.
Natural gas, electricity and mains water 
usage across the Group’s facilities are 
shown in the chart above. 
A number of Group facilities in the US 
are supplied by on-site wells – water 
sourced from these wells is not included 
in the data presented.
Operational Excellence and Research
The Group continues to develop its 
relationships with academic institutions 
and during 2012 Hunting collaborated 
with the University of Plymouth in the 
UK to research ways of improving safety 
and reliability during oil and gas extraction. 
The Group continuously strives to gain 
leadership in areas of technology relevant 
to the Group’s products and at the 
year-end had 350 active patents  
(201 1 – 31 6).
In order to promote its engagement 
within its industry sector, Group 
companies hold membership of the 
following organisations:
•	 American Petroleum Institute
•	 Society of Petroleum Engineers
•	 The Intervention and Coiled  
T ubing Association
•	 Leading Oil and Gas Industry

Substantial Interests
As at 31 December 2012, pursuant to the Disclosure and Transparency Directive, issued by the Financial Services Authority, 
the major shareholders of the Company are as follows: Business Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information Company Overview

charges, and (2) net debt should be no more than three-and-
a-half times adjusted EBITDA. In accordance with the terms 
of the facility agreement, the net debt covenant ratio changes 
to three times EBITDA in 2013. EBITDA, for covenant test 
purposes, is based on the previous rolling twelve month 
period, measured twice yearly at 30 June and 31 December. 
The Group has a broad range of products and services and a 
diverse, global customer and supplier base and meets its 
day-to-day working capital requirements through its cash and 
debt facilities. 
The Group continues to have limited exposure to the Euro 
zone or other regions that are perceived as high risk or 
exposed to the direct impact of austerity measures. The Group 
also retains limited exposure to credit risk as it has strong, 
well-developed relationships with its major customers and 
maintains insurance cover for 95% of its trade receivables.
The Group’s results are exposed to currency risk, as a major 
portion of earnings is generated in several currencies, in 
particular the US dollar, prior to translation into sterling at the 
period’s average exchange rate. Movements in these rates do 
affect the Group’s results and in response to this the currency 
impact on forecast results is monitored closely and certain 
derivatives are purchased to mitigate this risk.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that 
the Group is well placed to manage its business successfully 
in the current economic climate. Accordingly, the Directors, 
having made appropriate enquiries, are satisfied that the Group 
has adequate resources to meet the Group’s operational 
requirements for the foreseeable future and consequently 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing these consolidated financial statements.
Auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has indicated its willingness to 
continue in office as auditors. A resolution to reappoint them 
as auditors to the Group will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 17 April 2013.

Corporate Governance Report
“ It is with great pleasure that I introduce  
to you our Corporate Governance 
Report for 201 2 . During the year  
the Board appointed external 
facilitators to undertake its annual 
performance evaluation and in the 
final quarter of the year completed  
the exercise, with the feedback  
being considered by the Board  
at its December meeting. 
“ Hunting continues to comply with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and 
wherever possible seeks to enhance its 
governance practices and disclosures. 
As part of this ongoing development,  
I am pleased to highlight a report  
from the Audit Committee as 
recommended by the new Code. ”
Richard Hunting C.B.E., Chairman
UK Corporate Governance Code
This statement, which has been approved by the Board, 
reports on the Company’s compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) as issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) in 2010 and how the 
principles of the Code have been applied during the year. 
The Company was fully compliant with the Code’s provisions 
throughout the year.
Compliance with the principles relating to Directors’ 
remuneration is reported within the Remuneration 
Committee Report on pages 44 to 51 and the activities of the 
Audit Committee are reported on pages 52 and 53.
Board Composition and Committee Membership
The Board of Directors currently comprises the non-
executive Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director and 
three independent non-executive Directors. All independent 
non-executive Directors are appointed to the Company’s 
Nomination, Audit and Remuneration Committees.
This composition, with a separate Chairman and Chief 
Executive, ensures a balance of responsibilities and 
authorities. Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment 
include details of their duties and expected time 
commitments required. The Directors, together with brief 
biographical details, are identified on pages 34 and 35.
Excluding the Chairman, 60% of the Board is currently 
comprised of independent non-executive Directors. 
Mr Hunting, the Company’s non-executive Chairman, is not 
regarded as independent, given his former executive position 
since joining the Company in 1989. 
The Company has procedures in place to deal with potential 
conflicts of interest whereby actual and potential conflicts of 
interest are reviewed, and appropriate authorisation sought, 
prior to the appointment of any new Director or if a new 
conflict arises. In accordance with the Articles of Association, 
only non-conflicted Directors are involved in the 
authorisation process. The Board is of the view that these 
procedures operated effectively throughout the year. The 
Group operates a decentralised management structure to 
allow for rapid responses to business matters. A framework of 
controls with discretionary limits and powers for local 
management is contained within a group manual. 
Appointment and Replacement of Directors
Rules for the appointment and replacement of Directors are set 
out in the Company’s Articles of Association. Directors are 
appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution at a general 
meeting of Ordinary shareholders or by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee. The Company 
may also remove a Director. Additional details of the workings 
of the Nomination Committee are set out on pages 42 and 43.
Following the Code’s guidance on the election of Directors, all 
members of the Board submit themselves for re-election at 
each Annual General Meeting of the Company. Business Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information Company Overview
Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012
41
The non-executive Directors are initially appointed for a three 
year term with subsequent reappointment conditional upon an 
appraisal and review process. Letters of appointment for each 
of the independent non-executive Directors are available from 
the Company upon request and their terms of appointment are 
summarised on pages 47 and 48. Details of the executive 
Directors’ service contracts are set out on page 47 .
Prior to the appointment of a non-executive Director, the 
Nomination Committee undertakes an evaluation of the 
Board’s requirements to ensure the balance of skill and 
experience is maintained to fulfil the Group’s strategy. In the 
case of a non-executive Director being reappointed, the Code 
recommends a particularly rigorous evaluation with particular 
consideration being given to the need to regularly refresh the 
Board and to continued independence. On 29 August 2012 
John Hofmeister and John Nicholas were both reappointed as 
non-executive Directors of the Company for a second three 
year term of office, following an evaluation exercise and 
recommendation by the Nomination Committee. Neither Mr 
Hofmeister or Mr Nicholas participated in the evaluation or 
decision to propose their respective appointments to the 
Board. Both Mr Hofmeister and Mr Nicholas continue to 
remain independent in judgement and free from any conflicts 
of interest. Mr Hofmeister also continues his role as the 
Company’s Senior Independent Director and Mr Nicholas 
continues as Chairman of the Audit Committee.
On appointment to the Board, each Director receives 
comprehensive induction tailored to their experience and 
needs. All Directors have access to the Company Secretary 
and to independent professional advice, at the Company’s 
expense, in the furtherance of their duties. Directors are 
encouraged to maintain their skills and knowledge to best 
practice standards and, where appropriate, attend update 
training courses on relevant topics. During the year, the 
Chairman held meetings with the non-executive Directors 
without the executive Directors being present and also met 
each individual Director to discuss training and development 
requirements. The Company Secretary, through the Chairman, 
is responsible for keeping the Board informed of Corporate 
Governance developments and maintaining corporate 
awareness of legislative and regulatory changes. The 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a 
matter reserved for the Board.
Annual Performance Evaluation
During 2012, the Board appointed IDDAS (www.iddas.com), a 
specialist advisory practice as external facilitators to complete a 
performance evaluation exercise as recommended by the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. As part of the evaluation process, 
each individual Director completed a detailed governance and 
evaluation questionnaire and were interviewed by IDDAS, 
covering Board and subcommittee procedures.
 
IDDAS briefed the Chairman on the results of the evaluation 
who in turn provided feedback to the Board and to the 
individual Directors. IDDAS also submitted a final report on 
the process which was presented to the Board at the Meeting 
of Directors on 5 March 2013.
 
IDDAS has no connection with the Company other than being 
engaged to undertake this exercise.
 
This externally facilitated evaluation will be undertaken every 
three years with the exercise being conducted internally for the 
intervening years.
 
Separately to the above process, the performance of the 
Chairman was evaluated by the non-executive Directors in 
March 2013 as recommended by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Board and Committee Meetings
The Board normally holds six formal meetings each year, of 
which one is held in North America. Meeting dates are set a 
year in advance. Attendance by each of the Directors at 
Board or committee meetings is detailed below.
The duties and responsibilities of the Board and its 
subcommittees are formally agreed by the Board in writing. 
In addition, the division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and Chief Executive is set out in writing and 
agreed by the Board. Matters specifically reserved for the 
Board include, but are not limited to, the following:
•	 compliance with UK Company Law and the UKLA’s  
Listing Rules;
•	 review of the Group’s system of risk management, internal 
control and assess its effectiveness;
•	 approve all Stock Exchange announcements;
•	 approve the full and half year financial statements, 
including the declaration of dividends;

•	 consider the Group’s commercial strategy and approval of

Institutional Shareholders
The Company uses a number of processes for communicating 
with shareholders, including stock exchange announcements, 
the annual and half year reports, interim management 
statements issued twice a year, and the Annual General 
Meeting to which all shareholders are invited. In addition, the 
Chief Executive and Finance Director meet on a one-to-one 
basis with all principal shareholders at least twice a year, 
following the Group’s half and full year results, or when 
requested to update them on Group performance and strategy. 
The Board is in turn briefed by the Chief Executive, when 
appropriate, on matters raised by shareholders. 
During the year, the Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director met with a number of shareholders to discuss strategy, 
governance and other matters. Their comments were passed 
on to the Board by the Chairman. The non-executive Directors 
are also available to meet shareholders. 
The Company’s major shareholders are listed, together with the 
information required under the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules 7 .2.6, within the Report of the Directors on page 38.
Internal Control
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for monitoring the 
Group’s system of internal control, for reviewing its 
effectiveness and for compliance with the Turnbull guidance. 
The internal control system, which has been in place 
throughout 2012 and up to the date of approval of these 
accounts, is an on-going evolutionary process designed to 
identify, evaluate and manage the significant risks to which 
the Group is exposed. These systems of internal control are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate risks, therefore they 
only provide reasonable, but not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss in the financial statements and 
of meeting internal control objectives.
The Directors have reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control for the period covered by these 
financial statements, the key features of which are as follows:
Management Structure – within operational parameters set 
by the Board, management is delegated to the executive 
Directors. Subsidiaries operate within clearly defined policies 
and authorities contained within a group manual under a 
decentralised management structure. All senior management 
changes require the prior approval of the Chief Executive.
Reporting and Consolidation – all subsidiaries submit 
detailed financial information in accordance with a pre-set 
reporting timetable. This includes weekly, bi-monthly and 
quarterly treasury reports, monthly management accounts, 
annual budgets and two-year plans, together with half year 
and annual statutory reporting. The Group’s consolidation 
process is maintained and updated with regular communication, 
including distribution of a group manual to all reporting units. 
The Group monitors and reviews new UK Listing Rules, 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules, accounting standards, 
interpretations and amendments and legislation and other 
statutory requirements. Subsidiary reporting entities are 
supported by instruction from Group and structured training. 
All data is subject to review and assessment by management 
through the monitoring of key performance ratios and 
comparison to targets and budgets. The content and format of 
reporting is kept under review and periodically amended to 
ensure appropriate information is available.
Strategic Planning and Budgeting – strategic plans and 
annual budgets containing comprehensive financial projections 
are formally presented to the Board for adoption and approval 
and form the basis for monitoring performance. Clearly 
defined procedures exist for capital expenditure proposals  
and authorisation.
Quality Assurance – most of the business sectors within 
which the Group operates are highly regulated and subsidiaries 
are invariably required to be accredited, by the customer or an 
industry regulator, to national or international quality 
organisations. These organisations undertake regular audits  
and checks on subsidiary procedures and practices ensuring 
compliance with regulatory requirements.
Board Committees
The Board has three main committees to which it delegates 
responsibility and authority:
Nomination Committee
Members of the committee are Richard Hunting (committee 
chairman), Dennis Proctor and the independent non-executive 
Directors. The committee convened once during the year and 
has written terms of reference approved by the Board, which 
are published on the Group’s website. The role of the committee 
includes leading the process for Board appointments and 
determining the terms of new appointments. The committee 
also considers succession planning which takes into account 
the experience and skills required of Board members. 
On 28 August 2012 the committee met to consider the 
reappointment of John Hofmeister and John Nicholas and to 
approve new committee terms of reference. Following an 
evaluation exercise, both Mr Hofmeister and Mr Nicholas 
were each reappointed from 29 August 2012 for a second 
three year term of office. 
The Board has considered the recommendations of the Davies 
Report (Women on Boards) and in 2012 issued its gender 
diversity policy for Board appointments. Given the current size 
and balance of experience of Hunting’s Board and the recent 
refreshing of the Board’s independent non-executive Directors 
it is unlikely that Hunting will be compliant with the 
recommendations of the Davies Report in the short term. 
However, in line with the Davies Report’s recommendations, 
Hunting’s diversity policy commits the Group to:
•	 An embedded culture of equal opportunities for all 
employees, regardless of gender;
•	 Require external recruitment consultants to submit their 
diversity policies to the Group prior to appointment;
Corporate Governance Report continued Business Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information Company Overview
Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012
43
•	 Ensure that external consultants appointed by Hunting 
submit candidate shortlists comprising of an appropriate 
gender balance for consideration by the Nomination 
Committee;
•	 A target of at least one female Director of the Company 
when practicable;
•	 An annual review by the Nomination Committee of its 
progress complying with the Davies Report’s 
recommendations.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) comprises 
solely the independent non-executive Directors of the 
Company and is chaired by Andrew Szescila. Details of the 
Remuneration Committee’s activities are contained within its 
report on pages 44 to 51. 
The Committee convened four times during the year and has 
written terms of reference approved by the Board which are 
published on the Group’s website. During the year, the 
Committee reviewed its effectiveness and the Chairman 
reported these findings to the Board. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises exclusively of the 
independent non-executive Directors of the Company and is 
chaired by John Nicholas. Details of the Audit Committee’s 
activities are contained within its report on pages 52 and 53. 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Remuneration Committee Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
Company Law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the 
Directors have prepared the Group and parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union (“EU”). Under Company Law, the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU have 
been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Group’s and Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Group and the Company and to enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements and the Remuneration Committee 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. The Directors are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company and 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Group’s website, www.huntingplc.com. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Pursuant to the Financial Service Authority’s Listing Rules, 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, each of the Directors, whose names and 
responsibilities are listed on pages 34 and 35, confirm that, to 
the best of their knowledge and belief:
•	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group and of 
the Company; 
•	 the Business Review on pages 10 to 33 includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the Group’s 
operations and the position of the Group and the Company, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties they face.

Remuneration Committee Report
“ The work of the Remuneration 
Committee during 201 2 
included reviewing the 
remuneration structures within 
the Group; approving base 
salaries, cash bonuses and  
long-term incentive awards  
for the executive Directors;  
and determining awards  
to executives under the 
Performance Share Plan. ”
Andrew Szescila, Remuneration 
Committee Chairman
Introduction
Hunting operates in the international energy arena, supplying 
to global companies. Recruiting, retaining and appropriately 
incentivising our senior management remains a clear focus 
for the work of the Remuneration Committee. The following 
report summarises the Committee’s work and outlines 
forward policies for remuneration.
Compliance
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of 
the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Group (Accounts 
and Reports) 2008 and the relevant provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006. The report also satisfies the relevant requirements of 
the UKLA’s Listing Rules and describes how the Board has 
applied the principles relating to Directors’ remuneration in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. It has been approved by the 
Board and will be presented to shareholders for approval at the 
Annual General Meeting on 1 7 April 201 3.
Remuneration Committee
Role and Composition
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) is responsible 
for determining the remuneration of the non-executive 
Chairman and the executive Directors, including the setting of 
competitive salaries, annual performance targets and participation 
in the Company’s executive share-based incentive plans. The 
Committee also takes account of remuneration policy for the 
Group’s senior executives generally.
The constitution and operation of the Committee during the 
year has complied with the UK Corporate Governance Code’s 
guidance on Directors’ remuneration. The terms of reference 
of the Committee are published on the Group’s website and 
are available from the Company on request.
The Committee comprises the independent non-executive 
Directors of the Company Andrew Szescila (Committee 
Chairman), John Hofmeister and John Nicholas. 
The Committee met four times in 2012 with all members 
attending all meetings.
Work During the Year
The Committee’s principal activities during 2012 included:
•	 review of the remuneration structure vis-à-vis business needs;
•	 consideration and approval of executive Directors’ salaries, 
bonuses and awards under the Performance Share Plan 
(“PSP”);
•	 measurement of the performance conditions and 
determination of vesting levels in respect of awards under 
the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and the PSP;
•	 approval of grants under the PSP; and
•	 approval of the Remuneration Committee Report.
Advice
During the year, New Bridge Street (a trading name of AON 
Hewitt Limited), Pearl Meyer & Partners and Towers Watson 
provided advice and assistance on remuneration for Hunting’s 
Directors, executive incentive plans and share scheme matters. 
None of these advisers provided any other service to the 
Group during 2012. Business Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information Company Overview
Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012
45
The Committee also consulted with and received information 
from the executive Directors during the year but not in 
respect of their own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
The Group aims to ensure that remuneration, generally, and 
incentives in particular, provide a clear link between individual 
performance and shareholder interests. The policy is to 
provide competitive remuneration packages enabling the 
Group to attract, motivate and retain executives of high ability, 
experience and commitment.
The Committee’s on-going approach is to set base salaries 
within competitive market ranges, combined with realistic 
reward potential for performance that is outstanding. Executive 
Directors’ remuneration packages consist of an annual salary, 
health cover, car and fuel benefits, life and disability insurance, 
an annual performance-linked cash bonus plan, pension 
contributions, participation in performance linked share plans 
and a long-term incentive plan. Performance-related elements 
should form a significant proportion of total remuneration 
packages and performance targets are established to achieve 
consistency with the interests of shareholders, with an 
appropriate balance between long and short-term goals.
In setting the remuneration of individual Directors, the 
Committee takes account of their role, responsibilities, skills, 
performance and references credible and established market 
pay studies. The Committee reviews such studies with caution 
in view of the risk of an upward ratchet in remuneration levels. 
The Committee also has the discretion to take account of 
social and corporate governance issues when setting the 
remuneration of the executive Directors.
Consistent with policy on service contracts, executive 
Directors’ service contracts are subject to termination on one 
year’s notice by the Company or the executive.
The Committee believes an appropriate balance should be 
maintained between fixed and variable performance-related 
remuneration, with the current balance approximately 26% 
deriving from salary and benefits and 74% from variable 
incentives.
Set out below are the key elements of the policy, which will 
apply in 2013 and subsequent financial years. Whilst no major 
changes to policy are being implemented, the Committee 
considers that an effective policy needs to be kept under 
review in order to reflect future changes to business needs and 
the environment in which the Company operates and, 
therefore, the policy may be amended in future.
Base Salaries
Base salaries are reviewed annually. In considering appropriate 
salary levels, the Committee takes into account the remuneration 
paid by comparable companies in terms of asset size, revenues, 
profits, the number of employees, market capitalisation and the 
complexity and international spread of the Group’s operations, 
as well as applicable rates of inflation. The Company’s practice 
is to target base salaries at the mid-market level in the 
appropriate market for an executive position. In determining 
executive salaries, consideration is given to their experience 
and general personal performance. 
The Committee is also mindful of pay and conditions for the 
wider employee population when determining executive 
remuneration.
Annual Bonus
An annual performance-linked cash bonus plan is in  
place for the executive Directors. The plan, which is not 
pensionable, is designed to provide an incentive reward for 
performance and reflects the competitive markets in which  
the Group conducts its business.
Dennis Proctor and Peter Rose are eligible for a bonus under 
the scheme when 80% of the Group’s underlying budgeted 
profit before tax and budgeted return on capital employed is 
achieved. Below this level no bonus is payable. Further, the 
bonus is weighted with 70% to achieving the budgeted profit 
before tax and 30% to the budgeted return on capital 
employed. 
The amount payable under the scheme, when these budgeted 
targets are achieved, is 100% of base salary for Dennis Proctor 
and 75% of base salary for Peter Rose. When actual results 
achieve 120% of these performance targets Dennis Proctor and 
Peter Rose are entitled to a maximum cash bonus of 200% and 
1 50% of base salary respectively . The amount of bonus payable 
accrues on a straight-line basis when actual results achieved are 
between 80% and 120% of performance targets.
Bonus schemes are in place for the majority of the Group’s 
employees with the choice of performance metrics dependent 
on the individual roles.
Long-Term Performance Related Incentives
The Group operates three long-term plans all of which target 
to align the incentive package of executives with that of the 
long-term interests of shareholders.
1. Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
Awards under the PSP are granted annually and only vest if 
demanding performance conditions based on returns to 
shareholders are met. Awards granted under the PSP , which 
are subject to a three year vesting period, are based on the 
Group’s total shareholder return performance relative to the 
constituent members of the Dow Jones US Oil Equipment and 
Services and the DJ STOXX TM Oil Equipment and Services 
sector indices and if the Committee determines the Group’s 
financial performance to be satisfactory. These indices are 
considered by the Committee to be appropriate as they 
compare the Group’s performance against other companies 
in the oil and gas services sector.
Awards vest subject to the schedule outlined below:

of the members of the Comparator Group

The plan allows for a maximum of share-based awards with 
a face value at grant equal to 200% of annual salary. In 2012, 
awards to the value of 100% and 80% of base salary were 
granted to Dennis Proctor and Peter Rose respectively.
The PSP awards granted in 2009 were measured by Towers 
Watson against the performance target up to 28 April 2012. 
The results were a below median performance and 
accordingly none of the 2009 awards vested.
The PSP awards granted in 2010, were measured by New 
Bridge Street on 25 February 2013 and resulted in a partial 
vesting of 65.9% of the 2010 share awards granted.
2. Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
The LTIP is intended to link key executives’ remuneration to 
the long-term success and performance of the Group.
The LTIP is a performance-linked plan with an incentive pool, 
which is calculated using the sum of the Group’s after tax 
operating income after deducting a charge for the after tax cost 
of capital, which for 2012 is a rate of 7% on average 
shareholders’ funds. Determination of the incentive pool 
incorporates two components, the first being 2% of the 
absolute value added, and the second being 5% of the 
incremental value added. These performance conditions align 
the interests of the executives with those of the Group and its 
shareholders and will only produce value to the participants if 
value is created for the Group.
Awards are determined for each participant at the beginning of 
a three year performance cycle and are settled at the end of 
each cycle either in shares or in cash. The award for each 
participant is calculated as a percentage of the incentive pool 
resulting from the performance of the business over the 
performance cycle, as determined by the Committee.
The pool available for distribution was £5.7m at 31 
December 2012 compared to £1.4m at 31 December 201 1. 
The aggregate amount of the pool distributable to 
participants for 2012 was £3.8m (201 1 – £1.3m).
Following vesting, the amount payable under any single award 
may not exceed a certain multiple of the base annual salary of 
each participant. The maximum award levels under the LTIP 
rules as a multiple of base salaries are 3.5 times annual salary 
for Dennis Proctor and 1.75 times annual salary for Peter Rose. 
3. Executive Share Option Plan
The Group operated an Executive Share Option Plan 
(“ESOP”) between 2001 and 2008 to provide long-term 
incentives for executive Directors and executives of the 
Group. From 2009, executive Directors are granted share-
based awards under the PSP in place of grants under the 
ESOP . No further grants will be made under the ESOP .
Directors’ Shareholding Requirements
In order to align the interests of the executive Directors with 
that of shareholders, each executive Director is required to 
build up and maintain a holding in the Company’s shares  
with a market value equivalent to not less than one times  
their annual salary.

In the opinion of the Directors, the Dow Jones US Oil Equipment and Services and DJ Stoxx TM Oil Equipment, Services and 
Distribution indices are the most appropriate indices against which the shareholder return of the Company’s shares should be 
compared because they comprise other companies in the oil and gas services sector, in addition to being the comparator 
group for the Group’s Performance Share Plan.

Director Service Contracts
Executive Directors
The Company’s policy on executive Directors’ contracts is to comply with guidance contained in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
All Directors’ Service Contracts are rolling one year agreements and contain standard provisions allowing the Company to 
terminate summarily for cause, such as gross misconduct.
Dennis Proctor entered into an Employment Agreement with Hunting Energy Services Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the 
Group, on 7 February 2001. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the US State of Delaware. Under the terms of the 
Agreement both Hunting Energy Services Inc. and Dennis Proctor are required to give one year’s notice of termination.
The Agreement contains a pay in lieu of notice clause, which provides for payment of base salary, performance bonus and 
vacation pay based on an annual entitlement of four weeks. There are special provisions on a change of control. These 
provide for payment of one year’s base salary together with an amount equal to the average performance bonus paid of the 
previous two years. In addition, Dennis Proctor would be entitled to continue to participate in the Group insurance 
programmes for one year following the change of control and, unless otherwise provided in the relevant option agreement, all 
share-based awards granted to him will vest at the date of the change of control.
Peter Rose entered into a Service Agreement with the Company on 23 April 2008. Under the terms of the Service Agreement 
both the Company and the Director are required to give one year’s notice of termination. The Company reserves the right to 
pay Peter Rose in lieu of notice (whether given by the Company or by him) which comprises his salary and bonus. The 
Company also has the option to put Peter Rose on paid leave of absence following payment of a sum equivalent to salary and 
bonus (based on the previous twelve month period), subject to him complying with the terms of his Service Agreement. These 
conditions also apply on termination following a change of control. In addition, Peter Rose would be entitled to an acceleration 
of all share-based awards which would immediately vest at the date of the change of control.
The Company has authorised the executive Directors to undertake non-executive directorships outside of the Group provided 
these do not interfere with their primary duties. During the year neither Dennis Proctor nor Peter Rose held any external positions.
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors are initially appointed for a fixed term of three years and thereafter, subject to approval of the Board, 
for a further three year term. On 29 August 2012 John Hofmeister and John Nicholas were both reappointed for a second 
three year term, following a recommendation from the Nomination Committee.
In the event of early termination by the Company, the independent non-executive Directors are not entitled to receive 
compensation for loss of office. Their letters of appointment are available for inspection by shareholders during normal 
business hours at the Company’s registered office or at the Annual General Meeting.

Non-executive Director fees are determined by the Board as a whole on recommendation of the executive Directors following 
receipt of external salary information and an assessment of the time commitment and responsibilities involved. Fees are 
reviewed annually in December each year. The non-executive Directors do not participate in the Group’s share plans or 
receive any other benefits.

In 201 1, Richard Hunting, the Company’s Chairman, moved from an executive to a non-executive Director role. Mr Hunting was

commitments. As at 7 March 2013, Mr Hunting’s unexpired term was 1 7 months. The appointment can be terminated by the 
Company or Mr Hunting with either party giving three months’ notice. Mr Hunting’s remuneration was reviewed by the Board in 
December 2012 and, following advice from New Bridge Street, his annual fee from 1 January 2013 was unchanged at £193,500.

Under the PSP scheme rules, awards may be granted as share awards or share options. In 2012, Dennis Proctor was granted 
52,103 nil cost share awards and Peter Rose was granted 20,953 nil cost options. 
Dennis Proctor exercised 181,622 options on 8 March 2012. The share price on the date of exercise was 856p, representing a 
notional gain of £1,250,649.
In 2012 the awards under the PSP made to the executive Directors in 2009 failed to pass the plans’ performance conditions. 
Accordingly none of the 2009 PSP awards vested.
The measurement of the performance conditions for the PSP awards granted in 2010 resulted in a 65.9% partial vesting. On 7 
March 2013, 46,625 shares vested to Dennis Proctor and 19,196 shares vested to Peter Rose from the awards granted in 2010.

Executive Directors and some senior executives are invited to participate in the Company’s LTIP , with all awards subject to the 
performance conditions outlined on page 46. Awards are settled at the end of each performance cycle in cash or shares. The 
determination of whether to deliver benefits under the LTIP in cash or shares is not made until after the awards vest. This applied 
to the performance cycle that vested on 31 December 201 1 with Dennis Proctor receiving 63,706 shares and Peter Rose 
receiving 27 ,302 shares.
The mid-market price of an Ordinary share on 25 February 2010, the date of the award, for the cycle vested 31 December 2012 
was 579.5p and the price on the date of vesting, 31 December 2012, was 790.5p.
The mid-market price of an Ordinary share on the date of the most recent LTIP award, 8 March 2012, was 856.0p.
Pensions (audited)
Peter Rose and Richard Hunting are members of the Hunting Pension Scheme (the “Scheme”), which is a defined benefit pension 
scheme. The retirement age for the Directors under the Scheme is 60 and they are entitled to, subject to certain limits, a pension 
of up to two thirds of final salary. Pensionable salary is the annual salary less an amount equal to the State Lower Earnings Limit. 
Richard Hunting contributed 8.5% of his pensionable salary up until his Scheme retirement date of 31 July 2006. Peter Rose 
contributes a similar proportion of his salary to the Scheme. The Scheme provides all members a lump sum death in service 
benefit of four times base salary and a spouse’s pension of two thirds of the member’s pension on the member’s death. Bonuses 
and benefits do not qualify as pensionable salary. 
Dennis Proctor is a member of a deferred compensation scheme in the US, which is a defined benefit pension scheme. In 2012, 
the Company contributed £1 10,866 (201 1 – £91,622). He also participates in a US 401K Tax Deferred Savings Plan and in 2012 
the Company contributed £9,463 (201 1 – £9,162).

i. The total accrued pension shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement for life based on service to 31 December 2012. Peter Rose’s accrued pension at 
31 December 2012 includes a temporary pension of just over £5,000 per annum.
ii. The transfer values at 31 December 2012 have been based on estimated insurance company pricing terms, reflecting the fact that most of the benefits are covered by 
insurance policies.
iii. Richard Hunting’s normal retirement date was 31 July 2006. No further benefits have accrued to him since that date. The pension figure at 31 December 2012 shown 
above is his pension in payment. The year-end transfer value reflects only the value of the pension shown above and does not include the value of any benefits he 
received during the year.

can be found in his biographical summary set out on page 35.
The committee met four times during the year and operates 
under written terms of reference approved by the Board, 
which are published on the Company’s website. The 
committee normally meets in March, April (to coincide with 
the Annual General Meeting of the Company), August and 
December and the attendance of committee members 
during the year is noted on page 41. The Chairman, Chief 
Executive, Finance Director, internal and the external auditors

Training
During the year, the committee received presentations on 
accounting and governance developments pertinent to the 
Company’s listed status.
External Audit
The external auditors present reports at the March, April, 
August and December meetings for consideration by the 
committee. In March, a full year report is considered ahead  
of the publication of the Company’s annual results; in April an 
internal control report is presented following the year end 
audit; and in August an interim report is presented which 
includes the proposed full year audit scope and fee. The Audit 
Committee considers the reappointment of the auditors annually 
in August and makes a recommendation to the Board. The 
committee normally meets with the auditors without executive 
Directors present at the end of each formal meeting.
Audit Committee Report
“ The work of Hunting’ s Audit 
Committee follows best 
practice guidelines issued by 
the Financial Reporting 
Council and adopts an annual 
programme of work covering 
the recommended aspects  
of monitoring and review . 
During the year , the 
committee met four times, 
received and reviewed reports 
from management, met with 
the Company’ s external and 
internal auditors, reviewing 
detailed reports on their 
respective activities and 
monitored the internal controls 
active across the Group. ”
John Nicholas, Audit Committee 
Chairman Business Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information Company Overview
Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012

The external auditors’ full year report includes a statement on 
their independence, their ability to remain objective and to 
undertake an effective audit. The committee considers and 
assesses this independence statement on behalf of the Board 
taking into account the level of fees paid particularly for 
non-audit services. The committee considers the effectiveness 
of the audit by reviewing and taking account of Financial 
Reporting Council reports on the auditors; input from 
executive management; consideration of responses to 
questions from the audit committee and the audit findings 
reported to the committee. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and its predecessor firms  
have been the Group’s auditors for many years. The Audit 
Committee is satisfied with their effectiveness and their 
independence and has not considered it necessary to  
require an independent tender process. 
During the year, the Company engaged the services of Deloitte, 
KPMG and Ernst and Young to undertake non-audit assignments 
in order to reduce reliance on PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for 
the provision of non-audit services.
The committee closely monitors fees paid to the auditors in 
respect of non-audit services, which are analysed within note 
8 on page 70. In 2012, fees for non-audit services totalled 
£1.1m and included taxation services amounting to £0.9m 
and other services £0.2m. The scope and extent of non-audit 
work undertaken by the external auditor is monitored by, 
and, above certain thresholds, requires prior approval from 
the committee to ensure that the provision of such services 
does not impair their independence or objectivity. 
The Board received copies of all reports submitted to the  
Audit Committee.
Internal Audit
The Audit Committee receives reports from the Internal  
Audit department and reviews the internal audit process and 
effectiveness, as part of the Group’s internal audit and risk 
assessment programme. An annual programme of internal 
audit assignments is reviewed by the Audit Committee, in 
addition to progress on improving the control environment 
across the Group.
Internal Controls
The Group has established an internal control environment 
which was in operation throughout the year. The Audit 
Committee monitors these arrangements on behalf of the 
Board, which includes a report submitted three times a year on 
the principal risks facing the Group and the mitigating controls 
against those identified key risks. The Group level report is 
based on submissions from all subsidiaries of the Company. 
All subsidiaries undertake formal self-assessment risk reviews  
a minimum of three times a year on their internal control 
environment. These reviews are available to the Audit Committee 
and encompass the identification of the key business, financial, 
compliance and operational risks facing each unit, together 
with an assessment of the controls in place for managing and 
mitigating these risks. Additionally, risks are evaluated for their 
potential impact on the business. 
Bribery Act Compliance
In compliance with the UK Bribery Act, Hunting has procedures 
in place including the publication of Bribery and Corruption 
policies and detailed guidelines on interacting with customers, 
suppliers and agents, including specific policies for gifts, 
entertainment and hospitality. Senior managers across the 
Group are required to report their compliance activities 
including an evaluation of risk areas. The Group has completed 
a screening exercise to determine relevant employees who 
face a heightened risk of bribery with all relevant personnel 
completing a formal training and compliance course, in line 
with the Group’s procedures. The Audit Committee reviews 
the compliance procedures related to the Bribery Act at its 
April and December meetings, which incorporate a risk 
assessment completed by each business unit and gifts and 
entertainment disclosures made during the reporting period. 
The Group’s internal audit function reviews local compliance 
to the Bribery Act and provides recommendations to the Audit 
Committee where appropriate.
Code of Conduct
The Group’s Code of Conduct contains policies and 
procedures covering how the Group conducts business and 
maintains its relationships with business partners. The Code  
of Conduct is available on the Group’s website. 
Whistleblowing
The Senior Independent Director, John Hofmeister, is the 
primary point of contact for staff of the Company to raise,  
in confidence, concerns they may have over possible 
improprieties, financial or otherwise. All employees have 
been notified of this arrangement through the corporate 
magazine, Group notice boards and the Group’s website.

in Equity, Company Statement of Changes in Equity, 
Consolidated and Company Statement of Cash Flows and the 
related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”), as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the parent company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 43, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for 
no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.
Scope of the Audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion:
•	 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2012 and of the Group’s profit and Group’s 
and parent Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
•	 the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union;
•	 the parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted by 
the European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
•	 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation.
Opinion on Other Matters Prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion:
•	 the part of the Remuneration Committee Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
•	 the information given in the Report of the Directors for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on Which we are Required to Report by Exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Remuneration Committee Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
•	 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
•	 the Directors’ statement, set out on pages 38 and 39, in 
relation to going concern;
•	 the parts of the Corporate Governance Report relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; 
and
•	 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board 
on Directors’ remuneration.

Consolidated and Company Statement of Cash Flows
For the Y ear ended 31 December 2012  62
Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012
1. Basis of Preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and those International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union and IFRIC Interpretations. The financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available for sale 
financial assets and those financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss.
As permitted under IFRS 3, the balance sheet at 31 December 2011 has been restated to recognise additional goodwill of £1.4m 
and a reduction in inventories of £1.4m on the acquisition of Hunting Titan on 16 September 2011. The balance sheet at 
1 January 2011 has not been presented, as there was no impact on the previous year’s numbers from this adjustment.
The 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheet deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities have been restated to offset balances where 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset. The balance sheet at 1 January 2011 has not been presented as the figures previously 
reported for deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities do not require adjustment.
In addition, the current tax assets and current tax liabilities have been restated in the 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheet to reflect 
the underlying position within each tax jurisdiction. The balance sheet at 1 January 2011 has not been presented, as the figures 
previously reported for the current tax assets and current tax liabilities do not require adjustment.
Where a change in the presentational format between the prior year and current year financial statements has been made during 
the period, comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out in note 45. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
Adoption of New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations
There are no new IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2012 
that have a material impact on the Group’s financial performance or position.
The Group has early adopted the amendment to IAS 1 – Presentation of items of Other Comprehensive Income, issued June 
2011. The presentation of items in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income has been altered to show items which 
will or might potentially be reclassified from other comprehensive income into profit or loss separately from those for which 
reclassification is not permitted.
Standards, Amendments and Interpretations Effective Subsequent to the Year End
•	 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments*
•	 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
•	 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
•	 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
•	 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
•	 IAS 27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements
•	 IAS 28 (revised) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
•	 Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
•	 Amendment to IAS 32 – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
•	 Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits
•	 Improvements to IFRSs 2009-2011 (May 2012)*
* Not yet endorsed by the European Union.
New requirements contained within International Reporting Standards, referred to above, are not expected to significantly impact 
the Group’s results or financial position.

 Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012
Company Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information
2. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements and assumptions about the future, resulting in 
the use of accounting estimates. These will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results and adjustments will 
consequently be necessary. Estimates are continually evaluated, based on experience, consultation with experts and reasonable 
expectations of future events.
Accounting estimates are applied in determining the carrying amounts of the following significant assets and liabilities:
Asset/liability Nature of Estimates
Goodwill •	 The Group has capitalised goodwill of £304.5m at 31 December 2012 (2011 – £317 .9m), as 
shown in note 16.
•	 The Group uses the present value of future cash flows to determine value in use. In calculating 
the value in use, significant management judgement is required in forecasting relevant cash 
flows considering factors such as long-term growth rates, future margins, timing and quantum 
of future replacement capital expenditure, future tax rates and the selection of discount rates to 
reflect the risks involved.
•	 Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would 
cause the carrying value of any CGU to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
Other intangible assets •	 Other intangible assets include the Group’s aggregate amounts spent on the acquisition of 
customer relationships, patented and unpatented technology, trademarks and other intangibles. 
At 31 December 2012, intangible assets amounted to £185.2m (2011 – £220.8m), as shown in 
note 17 , and represented 23% (2011 – 30%) of the Group’s net assets.
•	 These assets have principally arisen from the Group’s acquisitions.
•	 The relative size of the Group’s other intangible assets makes the judgements regarding the 
initial recognition, useful economic lives and potential impairments significant to the Group’s 
financial position and performance. The fair value of these assets is determined by discounting 
estimated future net cash flows generated by the asset. The use of different assumptions for the 
expectations of future cash flows and the discount rate could change the valuation of the 
intangible assets.
•	 Management also utilises judgement in estimating the lives of these assets and in considering 
whether any indicators of impairment have arisen.
Provisions •	 The main components of the provisions relate to warranties, tax indemnities and onerous 
contracts, as shown in note 27 .
•	 On the sale of Gibson Energy in 2008, accounting estimates and judgements were applied in 
determining the amount of provisions held for tax indemnities. Following the favourable 
settlement of a legacy tax dispute by the relevant judicial and tax authorities in Canada, these 
provisions have significantly reduced during the year. The timing and amounts payable in 
respect of retained provisions remains uncertain.
•	 The Group has commitments in respect of leasehold properties, some of which are not used 
for Group trading purposes and are vacant or sub-let to third parties. The provision for onerous 
contracts reflects the uncertainty of future conditions in the sub-letting market.
•	 The Group uses the present value of future cash flows to determine the carrying value of 
provisions. Judgement is used in forecasting relevant cash flows.
Deferred tax •	 Deferred tax balances are derived from assumptions, which include the future utilisation of 
trading losses and provisions at assumed tax rates.
Share-based payments •	 A number of assumptions are made in determining the fair value of awards at the grant date 
and at each subsequent reporting date for LTIPs, as shown in note 38.
•	 In making these estimates and assumptions, management considers advice provided by 
external advisers.
Post-employment 
benefits
•	 The Group’s accounting policy for defined benefit pension schemes requires management to 
make judgements as to the nature of benefits provided by each scheme and thereby determine 
the classification of each scheme. For defined benefit schemes, management is required to 
make annual estimates and assumptions about future returns on classes of scheme assets, 
future remuneration changes, administration costs, changes in benefits, inflation rates, 
exchange rates, life expectancy and expected remaining periods of service of employees. The 
assumptions are shown in note 32. In making these estimates and assumptions, management 
considers advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries. Where actual experience 
differs to these estimates, actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.  64

3. Segmental Reporting
Group
The Group reports on seven operating segments, two of which are discontinued operations, in its internal management reports, 
which are used to make strategic decisions. The Group’s segments are strategic business units that offer different products and 
services to international oil and gas companies and the shipping sector.
The discontinued operations comprise Field Aviation, which was sold on 27 April 2012 and Gibson Energy, which was sold in 
2008. Gibson Energy continues to generate accounting entries due to sale related transactions and is required for reconciliation 
purposes.
The Well Construction segment provides products and services used by customers for the drilling phase of oil and gas wells, 
along with associated equipment used by the underground construction industry for telecommunication infrastructure build-out 
and precision machining services for the energy, aviation and power generation sectors.
The Well Completion segment provides products and services used by customers for the completion phase of oil and gas wells.
The Well Intervention segment provides products and services used by customers for the production, maintenance and 
restoration of existing oil and gas wells.
The Exploration and Production segment includes the Group’s oil and gas exploration and production activities in the Southern 
US and offshore Gulf of Mexico. The Board of Hunting has reviewed the strategic rationale of the Exploration and Production 
division and from 2013 will not be making any new capital investment, beyond where the division has contractual commitments. 
The division will in future focus on producing out its remaining reserves, with a view to winding down the operation. As a result, 
Exploration and Production is now presented within other operating divisions.
Gibson Shipbrokers is a global energy shipping broker headquartered in London. Crude oil, fuel oil and bio fuels are shipped 
along with dry bulk such as coal, iron ore and grain. Gibson Shipbrokers is also involved in the shipping of liquefied petroleum 
gas (“LPG”), petrochemicals and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”).
The following tables present the results of the operating segments on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes 
to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Group measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and profit from operations, before exceptional 
items and the amortisation of intangible assets. Accounting policies used for segment reporting reflect those used for the Group. 
Inter-segment sales are priced on an arm’s length basis. Costs and overheads incurred centrally are apportioned to the continuing 
operating segments on the basis of time attributed to those operations by senior executives.

Under IFRS, at acquisition, inventory values are adjusted from their carrying values (generally at cost of production) to a fair 
value, which includes profit attributable to the degree of completion of the inventory. This uplift is charged to the income 
statement as the inventory is sold, thereby reducing reported operating profits. In 2012, the charge was £7 .6m relating to the four 
acquisitions completed in the second half of 2011. 
The impairment charge of £5.2m (2011 – £1.0m) relates to the write down of oil and gas development expenditure, largely due to 
sustained low natural gas commodity prices during the year and forecast for the foreseeable future. The recoverable amount of oil 
and gas development expenditure is based on value in use. These calculations use discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based 
on estimated oil and gas reserves, future production and income attributable to such reserves. Cash flows are based on reserve 
production lives varying from one to fifteen years. Cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 10% (2011 – 10%). The prices of 
oil and natural gas are derived from published futures prices, with the long-term average oil price assumed to be US$98.13 bbl. 
(2011 – US$96.10 bbl.) and the long-term average gas price at US$4.35 mcf (2011 – US$4.07 mcf). Natural declines in well 
production rates, combined with low forecast product prices, materially decreased the present value of future cash flows and 
rendered development and production of certain older offshore wells uneconomical, resulting in the impairment charge of £5.2m.
Dry hole costs of £2.0m have been incurred during the year from our Exploration and Production activities.
A £1.1m charge for bonuses for key employee retention, relating to the 2011 acquisitions, has been recognised. All relevant 
employees have been paid their bonuses in the period and the liability has been discharged.
A credit of £1.1m has been recognised in the income statement for the Doffing contingent consideration arrangement, as the 
future payments are not likely to be required.

A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2012 Budget Statement, whereby from 
1 April 2012 the main rate of corporation tax was reduced to 24%. The impact of this change has been recognised in calculating 
the effective rate of tax for the year ended 31 December 2012. Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 
23% is included in the Finance Act 2012, which received Royal Assent on 17 July 2012. Further reductions to the main rate are 
proposed to reduce the rate by 2% per annum to 21% by 1 April 2014. The changes are not expected to have a material impact 
on the Group’s deferred tax balances.  74

Gibson Energy
The sale of Gibson Energy Inc., Hunting’s midstream services operation, was completed on 12 December 2008.
Following the sale of Gibson Energy, Hunting established provisions for tax indemnities given in respect of two tax disputes with 
the Canadian Tax Authorities (“CRA”). The CRA have now ended their enquiry into the larger of the two tax disputes and have 
dropped their challenge resulting in a gain to the income statement of £56.9m, comprising of a release of £30.7m provisions held 
in respect of the dispute, a refund of approximately £25.9m in cash, for payments which were made in response to corporation 
tax reassessments issued by the CRA in respect of this tax dispute and other movements on Gibson Energy related provisions in 
the year giving rise to a net credit of £0.3m. 
The refund of cash involves the Federal and Provincial tax authorities in Canada. Receipt of the Federal portion, amounting to 
£17 .2m was received in December 2012 and receipt of the Provincial portion, approximately £8.7m, was received on 28 
February 2013. 
On the sale of Gibson Energy in 2008, part of the consideration was deferred and held as a warrant until its receipt in full in 
2011. Upon receipt, the proceeds were treated as a taxable revenue item and taxed accordingly. In 2012, the UK tax authorities 
agreed that the underlying nature of the transaction is capital. The company has utilised capital tax losses to offset the capital 
gain arising on the warrant, resulting in a £nil tax charge on the warrant. The tax charge previously recognised, together with 
provisions, has been released.
Field Aviation
On 27 April 2012, the Group sold its aviation engineering services business, Hunting Canadian Airport Holdings Ltd and its 
subsidiaries, including Field Aviation Company Inc. (together referred to as “Field Aviation”). Field Aviation is considered to be a 
major operation of Hunting and as such the results have been presented as a discontinued operation.
Hunting Energy France
On 22 December 2009, the Group sold Hunting Energy France SA, its French-based business.

14. Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of outstanding Ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of 
all dilutive potential Ordinary shares. The dilution in respect of share options applies where the exercise price is less than the 
average market price of the Company’s Ordinary shares during the year and the possible issue of shares under the Group’s 
long-term incentive plans.

Oil and gas exploration and development includes expenditure on the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources, which 
is recognised at cost and is not depreciated until production commences, or is impaired if the exploration of the mineral 
resources is not commercially viable. The amount recognised in cost at 31 December 2012 is £0.2m (2011 – £0.1m), including 
additions during the year of £0.2m (2011 – £0.1m) and an impairment loss of £nil (2011 – £nil).
Included in the net book amount is expenditure relating to assets in the course of construction of £0.3m (2011 – £6.4m) for 
freehold land and buildings, £2.1m (2011 – £2.6m) for oil and gas exploration and development and £6.3m (2011 – £4.2m) for 
plant and machinery.
Group capital expenditure committed, for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, but not provided for in these financial 
statements amounted to £7 .9m (2011 – £10.9m).

As permitted under IFRS 3, goodwill for 2011 has been restated to recognise additional goodwill of £1.4m on the acquisition of 
Hunting Titan on 16 September 2011.
The net book amount at 1 January 2011 was £100.6m.
Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”), the individual business operations, as follows:
2012 
£m
Restated
2011 
£m
Innova 42.3 44.2

Hunting Stafford (formerly National Coupling Company) 20.1 21.0
Other cash generating units 38.2 39.7
At 31 December 304.5 317.9
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates. The calculations use discounted pre-tax cash flow projections 
based on the most recent financial budgets approved by management covering a two year period and are based on past 
experience and order books. Cash flows beyond the two year period are extrapolated using estimated nominal long-term growth 
rates of 6.8% and 8.0% and terminal growth rates of 2.7% and 3.0% for 2012 and 2011 respectively. The growth rate reflects the 
products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU operates and will incorporate, where relevant, projected rig counts 
and the expected profile of drilling.
Cash flows are discounted using nominal pre-tax rates between 10% and 15% (2011 – 11% and 15%). The cash flows for the 
Titan CGU have been discounted using a nominal pre-tax rate of 11% (2011 – 11%). The discount rate best reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money, the risks associated with the cash flows and the likely external rate of borrowing of the 
CGU. Consideration has also been given to other factors such as currency risk, operational risk and country risk.
The operations of Well Intervention have been combined with the operations of Welltonic and so goodwill relating to Well 
Intervention, which was previously disclosed separately, has been reallocated to the Welltonic CGU.
Sensitivities
Having performed a sensitivity analysis on the value in use calculations, management believes that no reasonably possible 
change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any CGU to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

The impairment charge of £3.8m (2011 – £0.6m) relates to a non-trading subsidiary that has incurred losses and which the 
directors do not expect to be recovered in the foreseeable future. The investment has therefore been written down to the 
subsidiary’s net asset value, being the directors’ estimate of the recoverable amount.
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost, which is the fair value of the consideration paid, less impairment. The Directors 
believe that the carrying value of the investments is supported by their underlying net assets.

20. Trade and Other Receivables continued
Group
Trade receivables that are not overdue and not impaired are expected to be fully recovered as there is no recent history of default 
or any indications that the customers will not meet their payment obligations. At the year-end there are no trade receivables 
(2011 – none) whose terms have been renegotiated and would otherwise be past due or impaired.
At 31 December 2012, trade receivables of £61.6m (2011 – £52.0m) were overdue but not impaired. The ageing of these 
receivables at the year-end is as follows:
Number of days overdue:
2012 
£m
2011 
£m
1–30 days 33.9 29.0
31–60 days 15.6 12.5
61–90 days 6.3 7 .0
91–120 days 4.6 2.5
more than 120 days 1.2 1.0
Receivables overdue not impaired 61.6 52.0
Receivables not overdue and not impaired 82.1 100.6
Receivables not overdue and impaired 1.1 1.0
Receivables overdue and impaired 1.2 1.2
Impairment (2.3) (2.2)
Net trade receivables 143.7 152.6
Receivables that are overdue but not impaired relate to customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
Impaired receivables mainly relate to debtors in financial difficulty where defaults in payments have occurred or concerns have 
been raised about the customer’s liquidity. Trade receivables are impaired when there is evidence that the Group will not be able 
to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of sale.
During the year, a provision of £1.4m (2011 – £1.3m) for the impairment of receivables was recognised, £0.6m (2011 – £0.3m) 
receivables were written off and £0.6m (2011 – £0.4m) unused provisions were released. After recognising foreign exchange 
gains of £0.1m (2011 – £0.1m gains), the provision for the impairment of trade receivables at the year end was £2.3m (2011 – 
£2.2m).
The other classes of financial assets within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s wide and unrelated customer base.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is the fair value of each class of receivable, as shown in note 29.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security and no assets have been acquired through the exercise of any collateral 
previously held.
Company
None (2011 – none) of the Company’s trade and other receivables were past due at the year end and the Company does not 
consider it necessary to provide for any impairments. The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is the fair value of each 
class of receivable, as shown in note 29. The Company does not hold any collateral as security and no assets have been acquired 
through the exercise of any collateral previously held.
Non-current receivables due from subsidiaries have no fixed term for repayment and are unsecured. Interest charged is 1% above 
UK Base Rate on sterling loans. Current receivables due from subsidiaries are unsecured, interest free and payable on demand.

Deferred tax assets of £2.0m (2011 – £2.0m) have been recognised as the Group has assessed that the realisation of the benefit is 
probable. Deferred tax assets of £7 .2m (2011 – £4.9m) are expected to be recovered after more than twelve months. Deferred tax 
liabilities of £25.7m (2011 – £19.7m) are expected to be released after more than twelve months.

Provisions are due as follows:
2012 
£m
2011 
£m
Current 12.5 42.3
Non-current 17.1 18.2
29.6 60.5
The Group has commitments in respect of leasehold properties, some of which are not used for Group trading purposes and are 
vacant or sub-let to third parties. The provision for onerous contracts reflects the uncertainty of future conditions in the sub-
letting market. It is expected that £2.1m of the provision will be utilised in 2013, £1.9m in 2014 and the remaining balance of 
£11.3m utilised from 2015 to 2023. Provision is made on a discounted basis, at a risk-free rate of between 0.25% and 1.8% pa, for 
the net rental deficit on these properties to the end of the lease term.
Asset decommissioning and remediation obligations relate to the Group’s obligation to dismantle, remove and restore items  
of property, plant and equipment. The provision reflects uncertainty in the timing and amounts of the costs expected to arise  
in meeting this obligation. Provision is made on a discounted basis and is expected to be utilised over a period of one to  
eighteen years.
Following the sale of Gibson Energy in 2008, Hunting established provisions for tax indemnities given in respect of two tax 
disputes with the Canadian Tax Authorities (“CRA”). The CRA have now ended their enquiry into the larger of the two tax 
disputes and have dropped their challenge resulting in the release of £30.7m provisions held in respect of the dispute. Other tax 
warranty provisions of £2.2m have also been released. This has been shown as part of discontinued operations (note 13). 
Provisions of £7 .7m continue to be retained in respect of the smaller tax dispute and are expected to be utilised in 2013.
28. Derivatives and Hedging
Group
(a) Currency Derivatives
The Group has used spot and forward foreign exchange contracts and average rate options to hedge its exposure to exchange 
rate movements during the year.
At 31 December 2012, the total notional amount of the Group’s outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts is £3.7m 
(2011 – £15.9m).
Gains and losses on contracts that are not designated in a hedge relationship are taken directly to the income statement. Changes 
in the fair value of currency derivatives not designated in a hedge relationship amounting to a £0.2m loss (2011 – £0.1m) have 
been recognised in the income statement during the year for continuing operations.
Certain highly probable forecast transactions have been designated in a cash flow hedge relationship and hedged using forward 
foreign exchange contracts. These forecast transactions are expected to occur at various dates during the next six months. Gains 
and losses recognised in the hedging reserve on forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2012 will be recognised in 
the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement.
Losses of £0.5m (2011 – £5.4m gain) were recognised in the hedging reserve (note 34) during the year. No gains or losses (2011 
– £6.3m gains) were removed from equity during the year, with no gains or losses (2011 – £0.8m gains included in revenue) 
included in the income statement. Ineffectiveness of £nil (2011 – £nil) arose on the cash flow hedges during the year.

The Group has US dollar denominated borrowings, which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its US 
subsidiaries. At 31 December 2012, the carrying amount of net US dollar borrowings was £215.7m (2011 – £244.1m).
At 31 December 2012, foreign exchange gains of £10.1m (2011 – £4.7m losses) on translation of the borrowings into sterling has 
been recognised in the cumulative translation reserve.  88

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by the deviation in future expected cash flows calculated by 
reference to the movement in market quoted exchange rates. The carrying values of available for sale unlisted investments are 
based on the Directors’ best estimate of fair value as there is no active market in which these are traded. The fair value of listed 
equities and mutual funds is based on their current bid prices in an active market. The fair values of the environmental escrow 
and the promissory note are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows. The fair values of non-sterling 
denominated financial instruments are translated into sterling using the year end exchange rate.

The inputs used to determine the fair value of unlisted equity investments and the environmental escrow are not based on 
observable market data and therefore their fair value measurements can be categorised in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The 
inputs used to determine the fair value of derivative financial instruments are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable 
and so the fair value measurement can be categorised in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of listed equity 
investments and mutual funds is based on quoted market prices and so the fair value measurement can be categorised in Level 1 
of the fair value hierarchy.

30. Financial Risk Management
The Group’s activities expose it to certain financial risks, namely market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest risk and 
cash flow interest risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s risk management strategy seeks to mitigate potential adverse 
effects on its financial performance. As part of its strategy, both primary and derivative financial instruments are used to hedge 
certain risk exposures.
There are clearly defined objectives and principles for managing financial risk established by the Board of Directors, with 
policies, parameters and procedures covering the specific areas of funding, banking relationships, foreign currency and interest 
rate exposures and cash management.
The Group’s treasury function is responsible for implementing the policies and providing a centralised service to the Group for 
funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and counterparty risk management. It is also responsible for identifying, 
evaluating and hedging financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating companies.
(a) Foreign Exchange Risk
The Group’s international base is exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating activities, 
particularly in respect of US dollars. Foreign exchange risks arise from future transactions and cash flows and from recognised 
monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Group’s local operations.
The Group’s material foreign exchange rates are:

(i) Transactional Risk
The exposure to exchange rate movements in significant future transactions and cash flows is hedged by using forward foreign 
exchange contracts and currency options. Certain forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging 
instruments of highly probable forecast transactions. Operating companies prepare quarterly rolling twelve month cash flow 
forecasts to enable working capital currency exposures to be identified. Currency exposures arise where the cash flows are not in 
the functional currency of the entity. Exposures arising from committed long-term projects beyond a twelve month period are 
also identified. The currency flows to be hedged are committed foreign currency transactions greater than £250,000 equivalent 
per month and/or currency flows that in aggregate exceed £500,000 equivalent per annum.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.
The table below shows the carrying values of the Group’s financial instruments at 31 December, including derivative financial 
instruments, on which exchange differences would potentially be recognised in the income statement in the following year. The 
table excludes available for sale financial assets, derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge, borrowings designated in a hedge of 
the net investment in its US subsidiaries and loans to subsidiaries that are considered to be part of the net investment in a foreign 
operation, as exchange differences arising on these are recognised in other comprehensive income.

(ii) Translational Risk
Foreign exchange risk also arises from the Group’s investments in foreign operations. Average rate options are used to reduce 
translation risk on the Group’s consolidated profit before tax by hedging the translation of approximately 50% of budgeted US 
dollar earnings into sterling. These derivatives are not designated as a hedge.
The foreign exposure to net investments in foreign operations is managed using borrowings denominated in the same functional 
currency as that of the hedged assets. The borrowings are designated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign operations. The 
foreign exchange exposure primarily arises from US dollar denominated net investments.
(b) Interest Rate Risk
Variable interest rates on cash at bank, deposits, overdrafts and borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest risk and fixed 
interest rates on loans and deposits expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The treasury function manages the Group’s 
exposure to interest rate risk and has used interest rate swaps and caps, when considered appropriate.
(c) Credit Risk
The Group’s credit risk arises from its available for sale financial assets, pension assets, cash and cash equivalents, investments, 
derivative financial instruments and outstanding receivables.
At the year end, the Group had credit risk exposures to a wide range of counterparties. Credit risk exposure is continually 
monitored and no individual exposure is considered to be significant in the context of the ordinary course of the Group’s 
activities.
Exposure limits are set for each approved counterparty, as well as the types of transactions that may be entered into. Approved 
institutions that the treasury function can invest surplus cash with all must have a minimum of an A1, P1 or F1 short-term rating 
from Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch rating agencies and AAA rating for Money Market Funds.
The majority of cash and cash equivalents, which total £101.7m (2011 – £68.8m) at the year end, and investments of £3.2m 
(2011 – £2.4m) have been deposited with banks with Fitch short-term ratings of F1 to F1+. All cash and cash equivalents and 
investments are expected to be fully recovered.
The credit risk of foreign exchange contracts is calculated before the contract is acquired and compared to the credit risk limit set 
for each counterparty. Credit risk is calculated as a fixed percentage of the nominal value of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables are continuously monitored. Credit account limits are primarily based on the credit quality of the 
customer and past experience through trading relationships. To reduce credit risk exposure from outstanding receivables, the 
Group has taken out credit insurance with an external insurer, subject to certain conditions.
The Company operates a pension scheme in the UK, which includes a funded defined benefit section with pension plan net 
assets of £6.0m (2011 – £4.8m). The majority of the Scheme’s defined benefits are now covered by insurance company annuity 
policies, meaning the pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated. The pension buy-in has been effected by using three 
insurers, so as to spread its credit risk. The credit rating of these insurers is monitored.
The Company also operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the US, which is unfunded. Contributions are paid into a 
separate investment vehicle and invested in a wide portfolio of US mutual funds that are recognised by the Company as non-
current investments. Investments at the year end amounted to £3.5m (2011 – £2.9m) and are expected to be fully recovered.
(d) Liquidity Risk
The Group needs to ensure that it has sufficient liquid funds available to support its working capital and capital expenditure 
requirements. All subsidiaries submit weekly and bi-monthly treasury reports to the treasury function to enable them to monitor 
the Group’s requirements.
The Group has sufficient credit facilities to meet both its long and short-term requirements.
The Group’s credit facilities are provided by a variety of funding sources and total £416.2m (2011 – £423.6m) at the year end. The 
facilities comprise £375.0m (2011 – £375.0m) of committed facilities and £41.2m (2011 – £48.6m) of uncommitted facilities. Of 
the uncommitted facilities, £0.2m (2011 – £0.4m) is secured on the machinery that the loan was used to purchase and £41.0m 
(2011 – £48.2m) is unsecured. The £375.0m committed facility is unsecured.
The committed facilities comprise the £375.0m multi-currency loan facility from a syndicate of ten banks. This facility expires on 
5 August 2016. A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn amount.  94

31. Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis
The following sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Group’s and 
Company’s financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders’ equity. Financial instruments affected 
by market risk include cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The sensitivity 
analysis relates to the position as at 31 December 2012.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of 
the cash and derivatives and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from the hedge 
designations in place at 31 December 2012.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement 
obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:
•	 Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Group’s results, that is, an increase in 
rates does not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
•	 For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to be 
outstanding for the whole year.
•	 Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this 
analysis.
•	 The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.  96
Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012
31. Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis continued
(i) Interest Rate Sensitivity
The sensitivity rate of 0.25% (2011 – 0.5%) for US interest rates represents managements’ assessment of a reasonably possible 
change, based on historical volatility and a review of analysts’ research and banks’ expectations of future interest rates.
Group
The table below shows the post-tax impact for the year on the Group’s profit for an increase and decrease in interest rates, with 
all other variables unchanged, at 31 December.

US interest rates +0.25% (2011: +0.5%) (0.3) (0.9)
US interest rates –0.25% (2011: –0.5%) 0.3 0.9
The movements in the income statement are mainly attributable to US dollar denominated borrowings. There is no impact on 
equity for a change in interest rates.
Company
The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December, for an increase of 0.25% 
(2011 – 0.25%) in the UK interest rate, is to reduce profits by £0.1m (2011 – £0.1m). If the UK interest rate were to decrease by 
0.25% (2011 – 0.25%), then the post-tax impact would be to increase profits by £0.1m (2011 – £0.1m). The movements arise on 
sterling loans from subsidiaries.
There is no impact on equity for a change in interest rates.
(ii) Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity
The sensitivity rate of 10% (2011 – 10%) for US dollar and Canadian dollar exchange rates represents managements’ assessment 
of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility and a review of analysts’ research and banks’ expectations of future 
foreign exchange rates.

Canadian dollar exchange rates –10% (2011: –10%) 0.3 1.4 (3.3) 1.5
The movements in the income statement arise from cash, borrowings, receivables and payables where the functional currency of 
the entity is different to the currency that the monetary items are denominated in.
The movements in equity arise from net US dollar borrowings designated in a hedge of net investments in US subsidiaries and 
Canadian and US dollar denominated loans that have been recognised as part of the Group’s net investment in foreign 
subsidiaries.

32. Post-Employment Benefits
Pensions
Within the UK, the Group operates a funded pension scheme, which includes a defined benefit section with benefits linked to 
final salary and a defined contribution section with benefits dependent on future investment returns. With effect from 
31 December 2002, the defined benefit section was closed to new UK employees who are offered membership of the defined 
contribution section. The majority of UK employees are members of one of these arrangements.
The majority of the Scheme’s defined benefits are covered by insurance policies, meaning that pensions-related risks have largely 
been eliminated. This is demonstrated by the stability of the pension asset from year to year. However, the obligation ultimately 
rests with the Group. During the year, the Trustees paid additional funds into the existing insurance policies to secure further 
benefits for members.
A valuation of the defined benefit section of the Scheme was produced and updated to 31 December 2012 by independent 
qualified actuaries.
The main assumptions used for IAS 19 purposes at 31 December were:
2012 2011
Annual rates
Rate of increase in salaries 5.1% 5.2%
Rate of increase in pensions 3.1% 3.2%
Discount rate 4.3% 4.7%
Inflation (RPI) 3.1% 3.2%
The post-employment mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in mortality. The mortality table implies that a 65 
year old male currently has an expected future lifetime of 24.5 years (2011 – 24.3 years) and an expected future lifetime of 27 .6 
years (2011 – 27 .4 years) for a male reaching 65 in 20 years’ time. The mortality table implies that a 65 year old female currently 
has an expected future lifetime of 25.9 years (2011 – 25.8 years) and an expected future lifetime of 27 .8 years (2011 – 27 .7 years) 
for a female reaching 65 in 20 years’ time. Based upon past experience, pension increases have been assumed to be in line with 
RPI inflation.
The expected rate of return on assets for the year ending 31 December 2012 was 4.6% pa based on financial conditions as at 
31 December 2011. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is generally determined as management’s best estimate of 
the long-term return on the major asset classes weighted by the actual allocation of assets at the measurement date. The 
expected rate of return on the insurance policies has been set equal to the discount rate.
Other Information
The defined contribution section of the Scheme held assets, equal to its liabilities, of £9.1m as at 31 December 2012 
(2011 – £6.6m).  98

Scheme Assets
The proportions of the total assets in the defined benefit section of the Scheme for each asset class and the contributions 
made were:
2012 2011
Insurance annuity policies 100% 98%
Cash – 2%
100% 100%
Employer contributions made during the year to the defined benefit section of the Scheme (£m) 4.0 3.2
In accordance with IAS19, the insurance annuity policies held to match the obligations in respect of pensioners and deferred 
pensioners of the Scheme have been valued by placing a value on them equal to the related obligations. In accordance with 
IAS19 and IFRS13, the insurance policy held to meet the obligations in respect of active members of the Scheme has been valued 
by discounting the expected future payments from the policy using assumptions that are consistent with the assumptions used to 
value the obligations for active members.
During the year to 31 December 2012, contributions by the Group of £1.3m (2011 – £1.1m) were also made to the UK defined 
contribution section of the Scheme. For 2013, the Group will pay estimated contributions of £3.8m to the defined benefit section 
of the Scheme. Contributions to the defined contribution section of the Scheme are in addition.

Contributions by employer 4.0 3.2
Benefits paid (10.8) (10.5)
Fair value of plan assets at the end of the year 254.8 238.0
For 2012, the actual return on the plan assets amounted to a gain of £23.2m (2011 – £21.0m). The gain arising as a result of the 
increase in the value placed on the insurance annuity policies is offset by a corresponding increase in the value placed on the 
corresponding liabilities. This effect is seen in the actuarial losses on the defined benefit obligations stated above.

Unfunded Defined Benefit Pension Scheme
The Group also operates a cash balance arrangement in the US for certain executives. Members build up benefits in this 
arrangement by way of notional contributions and notional investment returns. Actual contributions are paid into an entirely 
separate investment vehicle held by the Company, which is used to pay benefits due from the cash balance arrangement when 
the member retires.
Under IAS 19 the cash balance arrangement is accounted for as an unfunded defined benefit scheme. At 31 December 2012, 
total obligations arising from the scheme were £3.5m (2011 – £2.9m) and movements during the year comprised a service cost 
(equal to the notional contributions) of £0.1m (2011 – £0.1m), an interest cost of £0.1m (2011– £0.1m), an actuarial loss 
(representing the excess of notional investment returns over the interest cost) of £0.5m (2011 – £0.2m gain), benefits paid of £nil 
(2011 – £0.1m) and a foreign exchange gain of £0.1m (2011 – £0.1m loss).
Company
The Company has no employees and therefore does not participate in any of the above schemes, although it does guarantee the 
contributions due by the participating employers.  100

income statement and statement of comprehensive income. A profit of £21.7m (2011 – £4.1m loss) has been accounted for in the 
financial statements of the Company.
36. Capital Risk Management
The Group’s capital consists of equity and net debt.
2012 
£m
2011 
£m
Total equity 813.8 732.0
Net debt 163.8 218.4
Capital employed 977.6 950.4
Gearing 20% 30%
Capital employed is managed with the aim of maintaining an appropriate level of financing available for the Group’s activities. 
The balance of debt and equity, as reflected in the gearing ratio, which is net debt expressed as a percentage of total equity, is 
managed having due regard to the respective cost of funds and their availability.
The Group’s net debt is monitored on a daily basis and is managed by the control of working capital, dividend and capital 
expenditure payments and the purchase and disposal of assets and businesses. The level of net debt and related gearing ratio of 
20% at 31 December 2012 is considered comfortable, with adequate headroom remaining, giving management ongoing 
flexibility.
For debt funding, the Group ensures that banking and other borrowing covenants are complied with, and that appropriate 
forecast headroom exists, to ensure that borrowing facilities remain in place. The main financial covenants attached to the £375m 
committed bank facility require EBITDA to cover net finance charges by a minimum of 4 times and net debt to be no more than 
3.5 times adjusted EBITDA. The maximum net debt to EBITDA permitted will reduce to 3 times in June 2013 and will remain at 
that level until the facility expires in 2016. For bank covenant testing purposes, the Group’s EBITDA is adjusted to include the 
share of associates’ post-tax results and exclude the fair value charge for share awards. EBITDA, for covenant test purposes, is 
based on the previous rolling twelve month period, measured twice yearly at 30 June and 31 December. The covenants are 
monitored on a monthly basis and all external covenant requirements were met during the year. Both key bank covenant metrics 
at year end were well covered.
Return on average capital employed is a KPI management uses to assess business unit performance. The Group return on capital 
employed has fallen from 15% during 2011 to 14% in 2012 primarily due to the higher level of capital employed following the 
acquisition programme.
Changes in equity arise from the retention of earnings and, from time to time, issues of share capital. The Board considers each 
ordinary dividend proposed based on the merits of the information available to it at the time. Consideration is given to the 
financial projections of business performance and capital investment needs, together with feedback from shareholder discussions.

36. Capital Risk Management continued
The Group operates a centralised treasury function with policies and procedures approved by the Board. These cover funding, 
banking relationships, foreign currency, interest rate exposures, cash management and the investment of surplus cash. Further 
detail on financial risks is provided within note 30.
The Group has significant foreign operations and hence results originate in a number of currencies, particularly in US dollars. As 
a result, the Group’s financial statements, which are reported in sterling, are subject to the effects of foreign exchange rate 
fluctuations with respect to currency conversions. Currency options are used to reduce currency risk movements on the Group’s 
results, by hedging approximately 50% of each year’s budgeted US dollar earnings into sterling. Currency exposure on the 
balance sheet is, where practical, reduced by financing assets with borrowings in the same currency. Spot and forward foreign 
exchange contracts are used to cover the net exposure of purchases and sales in non-domestic currencies.

proposed final dividend is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 April 2013 
and has not been provided for in these financial statements.
38. Share-based Payments
Group and Company
(a) Executive Share Options
The Company used to operate an executive share option scheme, which granted options to eligible employees. Under this 
scheme, the final granting of options occurred on 4 March 2008 and the subsequent final vesting of options ocurred on 4 March 
2011. Vesting of options was subject to the achievement of performance targets over a three year period. Thereafter the 
employee, subject to continued employment, has seven years in which to exercise the option.
Options were valued using an option pricing model based on the binomial model, but adjusted for the particular features of the 
options. The assumptions used in calculating the charge to the income statement, which only related to options granted after 
November 2002 as permitted by IFRS 2, were as follows:
Date of grant 04.03.2008
Exercise price (p) 784.5
Share price at grant (p) 784.5
Expected volatility (% pa) 32
Dividend yield (% pa) 1.1
Risk-free interest rate (% pa) 4.3
Turnover rates (% pa) 5
Fair value at grant (p) 294.9
The expected volatility was calculated as the historic volatility of the Hunting PLC share return over the five years prior to each 
grant date.
The charge to the income statement attributable to Executive Share Options is £nil (2011 – £0.2m, recognised as part of  
operating expenses).  104

(b) Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
The Company continues to operate and grant share awards and options under its performance share plan. Under the PSP , annual 
conditional awards of shares and options may be made to executive Directors and senior employees. Awards and options are 
subject to performance conditions and continued employment during the vesting period. The PSP is a share award scheme and 
as such there is no exercise price.
The PSP awards made in the year will vest subject to total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance over a three year period from 
the date of grant, relative to comparator companies from the Dow Jones US Oil Equipment and Services sector index and the DJ 
STOXX TM Oil Equipment and Services sector index.
Details of the PSP awards and options movements during the year are set out below:

38. Share-based Payments continued
The fair value of the PSP awards and options granted in 2012 was calculated using the Stochastic pricing model (also known as 
the “Monte Carlo” model), which incorporates the effect of the TSR performance condition.
The assumptions used in the model were as follows:
2012 2011
Weighted average share price at grant 906.0p 774.5p
Expected volatility – Hunting PLC 35.3% 50.7%
Expected volatility – Comparator group (average) 44.2% 71.4%
Risk free rate 0.5% 1.9%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Fair value 604.97p 525.89p
The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility over three years prior to grant, equal in length to the 
performance period at the date of grant. The expected volatilities of each constituent of the comparator group are calculated on 
the same basis and input into the model individually and the average of these figures is shown in the table above.
The expected life of the award has been calculated as three years, commensurate with the vesting period. The risk free rate is 
based on the UK gilt rate commensurate with the vesting period prevailing at the date of grant.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent over the number of shares that make up their award. It is accumulated over the 
vesting period and released subject to the achievement of the performance condition. This is factored into the fair value 
calculation and as a result the dividend yield assumption is set to zero.
The initial accounting charge of the PSP incorporates an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse for those 
participants who cease employment during the vesting period. The estimate of the expected forfeiture rate is 2.5% per annum. 
The subsequent accounting charge for 2012 includes an adjustment to the initial accounting charge to allow for actual lapses 
rather than estimated lapses.
The charge to the income statement attributable to the PSP is £1.0m (2011 – £0.8m), which is recognised in operating expenses.
(c) Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”)
The Company continues to operate and grant share awards and options under its restricted share plan. Under the RSP , annual 
conditional awards of shares and options may be made to employees subject to continued employment during the vesting 
period. There are no performance conditions attached to these awards and options. The RSP is a share award scheme and as 
such there is no exercise price.
Details of the RSP awards and options movements during the year are set out below:
2012 
Number

Lapsed during the year (78,755) (28,269)
Outstanding at the end of the year 603,701 618,570
The weighted average share price at the date of vesting, for awards vesting during the year, was 951.0p (2011 – 700.3p).

38. Share-based Payments continued
The fair value of the RSP award granted in 2012 was calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The assumptions used in 
the model were as follows:
2012 2011
Weighted average share price at grant 906.0p 774.5p
Expected volatility 35.3% 50.7%
Risk free rate 0.5% 1.9%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Fair value 906.0p 774.5p
The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility over three years to grant, equal in length to the remaining 
portion of the performance period at the date of grant.
The expected life of the award has been calculated as three years, commensurate with the vesting period. The risk free rate is 
based on the UK gilt rate commensurate with the vesting period prevailing at the date of grant.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent over the number of shares which make up their award. It is accumulated over 
the vesting period and released subject to the employee remaining in employment. This is factored into the fair value calculation 
and as a result the dividend yield assumption is set to zero.
The initial accounting charge of the RSP incorporates an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse for those 
participants who cease employment during the vesting period. The estimate of the expected forfeiture rate is 2.5% per annum. 
The subsequent accounting charge for 2012 includes an adjustment to the initial accounting charge to allow for actual lapses 
rather than estimated lapses.
The charge to the income statement attributable to the RSP is £1.5m (2011 – £1.2m), which is recognised in operating expenses.
(d) Long-Term Incentive Plan
The Group operates a Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) for key executives. LTIP awards may be settled in shares or cash. Details 
of awards made under this plan are contained within the Remuneration Committee Report on page 46.
The fair value charge to the income statement attributable to the LTIP is £4.5m (2011 – £4.7m) and the liability in relation to the 
LTIP at the year-end is £8.1m (2011 – £4.9m).

owned by a consortium of North American investors assembled by the current management team of Field Aviation. The agreed 
selling price was £7 .5m (Can$12.0m), with £2.5m (Can$4.0m) placed into an environmental escrow account, £1.9m (Can$3.0m) 
deferred in the form of an interest-bearing promissory note and the remainder paid in cash. Following fair value adjustments, 
principally relating to amounts held in the environmental escrow, the fair value of the consideration was £5.0m.

charged at an effective rate of 10.8% per annum on the note.
Environmental escrow
Under the terms of the sale of Field Aviation, Hunting and the purchaser have agreed to establish an environmental escrow 
account to pay for any potential environmental matters which may arise relating to Field Aviation’s hangar facilities in Calgary. 
The escrow account will remain in place until the property lease expires in 2027 or until a time when such environmental 
matters have been satisfactorily resolved. The environmental escrow account was recognised at its fair value of £0.2m as an 
available for sale financial asset. No changes to the fair value have occurred since its initial recognition.  110

Company Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information
45. Principal Accounting Policies
The Group’s principal accounting policies are described below.
(1) Consolidation
•	 The Group accounts include the results of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with its share of associates.
•	 Uniform accounting policies have been adopted across the Group.
(2) Subsidiaries
•	 Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies irrespective of the 
percentage of voting rights owned.
•	 Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are de-consolidated from the date 
control ceases.
•	 The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Consequently the consideration is determined as 
the fair value of the net assets transferred to the vendor and includes an estimate of any contingent consideration. The net assets 
acquired are also measured at their respective fair values for initial recognition purposes on the acquisition date.
•	 Acquisition-related costs are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
(3) Discontinued Operations
•	 A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has either been disposed of or that is classified as held-for-sale, 
which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan 
to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
•	 Discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement and are shown net of tax.
(4) Revenue
•	 Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of goods or services in the 
ordinary course of business, taking into account trade discounts and volume rebates, and is stated net of sales taxes.
•	 Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the 
customer, which is normally on delivery of the products.
•	 Revenue from the sale of services is recognised when the services are rendered.
•	 Revenue from the rental of plant and equipment is recognised as the income is earned.
(5) Exceptional Items
•	 Exceptional items are regarded as items of income and expense, which should be separately disclosed by virtue of their 
significant size, incidence or nature to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. Exceptional items 
principally comprise profits or losses on the disposal of subsidiaries, the impairment of assets, dry hole costs, movements on 
provisions for warranties on the disposal of subsidiaries, refund from Canadian tax authorities, retention bonuses for 
management of acquired businesses, acquisition costs, unamortised loan facility fees written off on early termination of the 
facility, the charge to the income statement for the value uplift to inventories, provisions for onerous leases and the release of 
contingent consideration liabilities recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries.
(6) Interest
•	 Interest income and expense is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
(7) Foreign Currencies
(a) Individual Subsidiaries’ and Associates’ Accounts
•	 The financial statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries and associates are prepared using their functional currency.
•	 The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
•	 Transactions denoted in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
•	 Monetary assets and liabilities, except borrowings designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge, denoted in 
non-functional currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are 
taken to the income statement.
•	 Borrowings designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the 
balance sheet date and exchange differences are taken direct to equity.
(b) Group Consolidated Accounts
•	 The presentation currency of the Group is sterling.
•	 The net assets of non-sterling denominated subsidiaries and associates are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at 
the balance sheet date.
•	 The income statements of subsidiaries and associates are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange for the year.
•	 Exchange differences are recognised directly in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve, together with exchange 
differences arising on foreign currency loans used to finance foreign currency net investments.
•	 The foreign currency translation reserve commenced on 1 January 2004. Amounts arising prior to that date were re-set to zero.
•	 On the disposal of a business, the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised in the foreign currency translation 
reserve relating to that business are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.  112
Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012
45. Principal Accounting Policies continued
(8) Taxation
•	 The taxation charge in the income statement comprises current tax and deferred tax arising on the current year’s profit before 
tax and adjustments to tax arising on prior years’ profits.
•	 Current tax is the expected tax payable arising in the current year on the current year’s profit before tax, using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, plus adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years’ profits.
•	 Deferred tax is the expected tax payable on the current year’s profit before tax arising in a future year, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or 
the deferred tax liability is settled.
•	 Full provision is made for deferred taxation, using the liability method, on all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are recognised separately on the balance sheet and are reported as non-current assets in line with IAS 1.
•	 Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable. Deferred taxation on 
unremitted overseas earnings is provided for to the extent a tax charge is foreseeable.
•	 If items of income and expense are recognised in other comprehensive income, then the current and deferred tax relating to 
those items is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
(9) Segmental Reporting
•	 Financial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker is disclosed in the accounts.
•	 Operating segments are components of the Group that are engaged in providing related products.
•	 Geographical information is based on the location of where the sale originated and where the non-current assets are located.
(10) Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
(a) General
•	 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition and installation of the asset.
•	 Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their residual value, over their estimated useful lives.
•	 Land, pre-production oil and gas exploration costs and assets under construction are not depreciated.
•	 With the exception of oil and gas exploration and production equipment (see 10(b) below), assets are depreciated using the 
straight-line method at the following rates:
 – Freehold buildings – 2% to 10%
 – Leasehold buildings – life of lease
 – Plant, machinery and motor vehicles – 6% to 33
1
⁄3%
•	 The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
•	 Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any impairment in value and are included in the relevant asset 
category. Depreciation of these assets commences when they are ready for their intended use. In the case of a new 
manufacturing facility, it is when the facility has been commissioned. For larger facilities, this may occur in phases.
•	 Computer software integral to an item of machinery is capitalised as part of the hardware.
(b) Exploration Expenditure
•	 Oil and gas exploration and appraisal costs are initially capitalised pending determination of the existence of commercial 
reserves and are included in the asset category oil and gas exploration and development.
•	 Upon determination that commercially viable quantities of hydrocarbons are not found, the costs are charged immediately to 
the income statement.
•	 Depreciation of oil and gas expenditure commences when production commences. The costs are depreciated using the unit 
of production method.
(11) Goodwill
•	 Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration paid for a business exceeds the fair value of the Group’s share of the 
net assets acquired.
•	 Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
•	 Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to the cash-
generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the 
goodwill arose.
•	 On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that business that remains on the balance sheet at the date of disposal is 
included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued 113
 Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012
Company Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information
45. Principal Accounting Policies continued
(12) Other Intangible Assets
•	 Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses where applicable.
•	 These assets have a finite life and are amortised in accordance with the pattern of expected future economic benefits, 
or when this cannot be reliably estimated, by using the straight-line method.
•	 Intangible assets are amortised over the following periods:
 – Customer relationships – eight to ten years
 – Patents – ten to twelve years
 – Unpatented technology – ten years
 – Trademarks and domain names – one to five years
(13) Impairments
•	 The Group performs goodwill impairment reviews at least annually.
•	 The Group also assesses at least annually whether there have been any events or changes in circumstances that indicate that 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill may be impaired. An impairment review is carried 
out whenever the assessment indicates that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
•	 For the purposes of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash 
flows.
•	 Where impairment exists, the asset is written down to the higher of (a) its fair value minus costs to sell; and (b) its value in use. 
Impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
•	 An impairment to goodwill is never reversed. When applicable, an impairment of any other asset is reversed, but only to the 
extent that the consequent carrying value does not exceed what would have been the carrying value had the impairment not 
originally been made.
(14) Inventories
•	 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
•	 Cost is determined using the first-in-first-out method and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs of disposal 
in the ordinary course of business. The cost of inventories includes direct costs plus production overheads.
(15) Cash and Cash Equivalents
•	 Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of 
less than three months from the date of deposit that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash.
•	 Accrued interest is disclosed as part of the year-end balance.
•	 For cash flow statement purposes, cash and cash equivalents include bank overdrafts and short-term deposits with a maturity 
of less than three months from the date of deposit. In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in 
current liabilities.
(16) Financial Assets
•	 The Group classifies its financial assets principally into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss and loans and receivables. Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-
evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
•	 Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date which is normally the consideration paid, plus, in the case 
of financial assets that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.
•	 The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset is impaired and if necessary the carrying amount is 
reduced to the appropriate value. The loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
•	 Financial assets cease to be recognised when the right to receive cash flows has expired or the Group has transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
(17) Loans and Receivables
•	 The Group’s financial assets are principally loans and receivables, which comprise trade and other receivables and cash and 
cash equivalents.
•	 Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. If collection is expected in one year or 
less they are classified as current assets, otherwise they are presented as non-current assets.
•	 By virtue of the nature of the effective interest method, interest arising on loans carried at amortised cost is regarded as an 
integral part of the loan balance and is therefore included within the carrying amount of the loan. Consequently, interest 
receivable within twelve months on loans due after more than one year is recognised within non-current assets.  114
Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012
45. Principal Accounting Policies continued
(18) Financial Liabilities
•	 Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date which is normally the consideration received less, in 
the case of financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. The Group 
subsequently re-measures all of its non-derivative financial liabilities, including trade payables, at amortised cost.
•	 Payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year, otherwise they are presented as non-current 
liabilities.
•	 By virtue of the nature of the effective interest method, interest arising on loans that are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method is regarded as an integral part of the loan balance and is therefore included within the carrying 
amount of the loan. Consequently, interest payable within twelve months on loans due after more than one year is recognised 
in non-current borrowings.
(19) Debt Issue Costs
•	 When it is probable that some or all of a loan facility will be drawn down, transaction costs are capitalised and presented as a 
reduction to the borrowed amount and subsequently amortised through interest expense using an appropriate effective 
interest method.
•	 When it is not probable that some or all of the loan facility will be drawn down, the facility fee is capitalised as a prepayment 
for services and amortised over the period of the relevant facility on a straight-line basis.
•	 The amortisation charge is recognised in the income statement as an interest expense.
(20) Leases
•	 An operating lease is defined as a lease that is not a finance lease. A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee.
•	 The rental costs incurred on operating leases are charged to the income statement as incurred over the life of the lease on a 
straight-line basis.
•	 Operating lease income is recognised in the income statement within other income as it is earned.
(21) Provisions
•	 Provisions are liabilities for which the amount or timing of future expenditure is uncertain.
•	 Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.
•	 Whenever the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted to their present value.
(22) Post-employment Benefits
(a) Defined Contribution Retirement Schemes
•	 Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged to the income statement when they fall due.
(b) Defined Benefit Retirement Schemes
•	 Payments to defined benefit retirement schemes are recognised as increments to the assets of the schemes.
•	 The amount charged to the income statement with respect to these schemes, within profit from operations, is the increase in 
the retirement benefit obligation resulting from the additional service provided by the participating employees during the 
current year, which is measured using the Projected Unit method.
•	 Interest arising on the obligations and the expected return from the assets are also recognised in the income statement, net, 
within net finance costs.
•	 Actuarial gains and losses are recognised fully and immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
(23) Share-based Payments
•	 The Group issues share-based payments (LTIP awards), which can be settled in either cash or equity, to certain employees as 
consideration for services received from the employees. A liability is recognised equal to the current fair value of the services 
received, determined at each balance sheet date. The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each subsequent reporting date 
and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
•	 The fair value is measured as the present value of the expected future cash flows.
•	 The Group also issues equity-settled share-based payments (PSP and RSP awards) to certain employees as consideration for 
services received from the employees. The fair value of the employees’ services is recognised as an expense in the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of awards that will ultimately vest.
•	 The fair value of employees’ services is determined by an external valuer, using the Monte Carlo model for PSP awards and 
the Black-Scholes model for the RSP awards, with reference to the grant date fair value of the options granted. The fair value 
includes market performance conditions in respect of the performance based awards and excludes the impact of any service 
and non-market performance vesting conditions.
•	 The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date and at the vesting date, where the 
estimate is adjusted to reflect current expectations. The adjustment is included as part of the underlying expense recognised in 
the income statement. No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date.

(24) Share Capital
•	 The Company’s share capital comprises a single class of Ordinary shares, which are classified as equity.
•	 Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are charged to equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net 
of tax.
(25) Treasury Shares
•	 Treasury shares are stated at cost and presented as a deduction from the equity attributable to owners of the parent. 
Consideration received for the sale of these shares is also recognised directly in equity, with any difference between the 
proceeds from the sale and the original cost being taken directly to retained earnings.
(26) Dividend Distributions
•	 Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as liabilities in the Group’s financial statements in the 
period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders and are dealt with in the Statement of Changes in 
Equity.
•	 Interim dividends are recognised when paid.  116

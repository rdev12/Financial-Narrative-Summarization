have been made in all these areas.
> chairman’s statement
BTG’s results for the year to 31 March
2006 show a major improvement over
the prior year with the net result
being a profit before tax for the year
of £1.5m (04/05: loss of £34.8m).
Cash at the year end was £51.0m
(04/05: £34.5m net of overdraft) of
which some £44m is “free” cash.
Revenues of £50.2m (04/05: £38.3m)
generated net revenues after revenue
sharing 31% higher at £29.5m 
(04/05: £22.6m). Underlying royalty
revenues from marketed products
including BeneFIX
®
and the two-part
hip-cup grew strongly and the Group
generated non-recurring revenues of
£10.7m gross (04/05: £9.1m) including
the settlement with Zimmer over the
two-part hip cup patents. The sale of
investments and patents resulted in
net profits of £11.6m (04/05: £2.2m),
although disappointing progress in
two investee companies has resulted
in write-offs of £4.2m.
Investment in the development 
of Varisolve
®
reduced as expected 
to £4.5m (04/05: £9.2m). Investment
in the rest of BTG’s drug development
pipeline reduced to £3.6m 
(04/05: £6.6m) reflecting the clearer
focus on key products.
The significant restructuring costs
incurred last year set the scene 
for a 23% reduction in operating 
and administrative expenses to
£24.3m (04/05: £31.6m). Further
restructuring costs of £3.7m were
incurred to align operations with 
the new strategy and maintain 
cost control.
The directors do not recommend
payment of a dividend for the year.
Outlook
We have started the new financial
year with a much lower cost base, 
a strong cash position and a clear
focus. We expect that revenues from
royalties on marketed products will
cover operating and administrative
costs. The anticipated revenues from
future licensing deals, milestones and
the ongoing commercialisation of
non-core assets, together with strong
cash reserves, mean the Company is
well placed to continue to build value
by further developing our pipeline.
Discussions are progressing with
potential partners for Varisolve
®
, and
the Board continues to believe this
product is capable of achieving
significant sales and generating
future returns for BTG.
We thank our shareholders, employees
and business partners for their
continued support. The Board is
grateful to Malcolm Coster, who retires
at this year’s AGM after more than 
10 years as a non-executive director .
Sir Brian Fender

revenue growth,

operating costs

02 BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 This year has been all about delivering on the
strategy we set out last May. We are making
excellent progress against our targets.
> chief executive
officer’s review
Performance against strategic goals
During the past year we continued
our process of transforming BTG 
into a focused medical innovations
company. During a period of
considerable change, we have also
delivered strong financial results.
At the start of the year we set out 
our goals which were to:
> Position BTG for profitability and
sustainable growth
> Reduce costs 
> Realise value from the physical
sciences portfolio
> Progress the development and
partnering of Varisolve
®
> Continue to build value by
investing in the pipeline.
We achieved a pre-tax profit for the
year of £1.5m and, thanks to growing
recurring revenues and reduced
costs, we can build the business in 
a sustainable manner. Operating and
administrative costs reduced by 23%
from £31.6m to £24.3m and going
forward we anticipate these costs
will be below £21m. We have
realised value from several physical
sciences technologies including
WebNav, RFID, NQR and, at the end
of the year, Teleshuttle. This last
deal generated an immediate net
profit of £9.0m and also provides the
opportunity for additional significant
returns and brings to an end the
litigation activities around these
patents. We continued to invest 
in the pipeline, adding new
programmes and spending £9.1m 
on developing existing programmes,
including Varisolve
®
.
Building value in the pipeline
Six programmes were in-licensed
during the year, including a series 
of selective EP4 receptor antagonists
designed to treat pain in conditions
such as migraine headache. The 
lead compound, BGC20-1531, is 
in preclinical studies in preparation
for its first clinical study. Three
acquisitions were made for the 
Drug Repositioning portfolio, two
dermatology opportunities targeting
head lice and fungal infections, and 
a novel oral formulation for an
asthma product. Two earlier-stage
programmes were in-licensed for
the oncology portfolio.
Good progress was made in
developing existing programmes. 
In BTG’s pipeline, enrolment was
completed for the phase II part of the
phase I/II gastric cancer study 
of plevitrexed (BGC 9331), in which
19 additional patients are expected
to be dosed at the recommended
level for follow-on studies.
BGC20-1259 completed preclinical
development and commenced 
a phase I clinical study. To date, 
two cohorts of eight volunteers have
been treated with single ascending

doses. Dosing of the third cohort 
is expected to begin shortly, and
planning for a multiple ascending
dose study, which should begin
around mid-year, is under way.
BGC20-1259 is a unique
multifunctional compound designed
to act on the cognitive impairment,
associated psychiatric symptoms
such as depression and
neurodegenerative aspects of
Alzheimer’s disease.
A clinical proof of mechanism study
commenced with BGC20-0166, a
combination of two compounds shown
in preclinical studies to alleviate sleep
apnoea, a common condition in which
sleep is interrupted by cessation of
breathing and for which there is
currently no pharmacological
treatment. Ten patients have been
treated and all 36 planned patients
should have finished treatment by 
the end of the year .
In the current financial year we
anticipate the completion of the
plevitrexed phase I/II trial, phase I
for BGC20-1259 and the sleep
apnoea proof of mechanism study.
Several licensees made advances
with their development programmes.
Genzyme Corporation reported
positive interim efficacy results of 
a phase II trial comparing Campath
®
with interferon beta-1a in multiple
sclerosis. Genzyme anticipates
commencing phase III studies in MS
in the second half of 2006. 
TolerRx, Inc. showed in a phase II
trial in new-onset type-1 diabetes
that the monoclonal antibody TRX4
significantly reduced the trial
subjects’ requirements for insulin
over the 18 months of follow-up.
TRX4 was granted orphan drug
status for this indication, which
confers benefits including data
exclusivity if successfully approved. 
Cougar Biotechnology progressed 
its European phase I study of
abiraterone acetate, an inhibitor of
testosterone biosynthesis targeting
prostate cancer, and was granted
approval to commence clinical
studies in the US. Abiogen Pharma
completed phase I studies of ABIO
08-01 (BTG1640) and is currently
planning a phase II proof of concept
study in anxiety.
Varisolve
®
The IND for Varisolve
®
, BTG’s 
novel microfoam sclerosant
treatment for varicose veins, was
released from clinical hold and 
a phase II study protocol was
approved in the US in July 2005. 
BTG initiated new partnering
discussions from September with

and BGC20-0166 for 
sleep apnoea.
> Six programmes 
in-licensed targeting
migraine headache, cancer,
dermatology, fungal
infections and a new
asthma drug formulation.
BTG’s pipeline has progressed well in the year,
with six programmes in-licensed and two
products entering human clinical studies.
Significant progress has also been made by
several licensees of our drug programmes.
Chief Executive Officer’s Review continued BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006   05
a number of pharmaceutical,
specialist and medical device
companies. Discussions are
proceeding as expected.
In anticipation of securing a
commercialisation agreement and
following constructive dialogue with
the FDA, preparations for the agreed
phase II study have been progressed
so that it can start without delay to
the development timetable. Clinical
trial materials have been sourced
and eight varicose vein centres have
been identified to take part in the
study, which aims to show, using
sensitive MRI techniques, that the
presence of microbubbles in the
middle cerebral artery that may
result from treatment with Varisolve
®
does not cause subclinical damage. 
It is intended that a partner is signed
up prior to commencing the study
because there is a potential
regulatory pathway that allows 
phase II and phase III to overlap.
BTG has also continued to add value
to the Varisolve
®
programme through
further IP development, and patent
coverage now extends to 2024.
Capturing value from non-core assets
We are delighted with the progress
made over the year in monetising
some of the physical science assets
such as Teleshuttle, WebNav and
RFID. This work is ongoing and we are
seeking to sell or license a number of
other physical science technologies, in
fields such as telecommunications and
flash memory, over the medium term.
We will also continue to simplify the
portfolio and reduce costs by:
> Renegotiating terms on marginal
licences to reassign or return 
the IP
> Terminating contracts for 
non-viable assets 
> Managing our ventures
investments such that we can
maintain an economic and
management interest in key
assets while allowing dilution of
holdings in non-core assets.
Maintain cost control
Operating and administrative costs
reduced to £24.3m and we are
targeting ongoing costs of less than
£21m per annum. In achieving these
savings we incurred restructuring
charges of £3.7m this year. The
restructuring of the business is now
complete although focus remains 
on maintaining tight cost control
throughout the business.
Positioning BTG
In support of the new strategy and to
promote our capabilities to potential
partners we have increased our

presence at industry conferences
and partnering events. We moved
from the FTSE support services 
sub-sector to the biotechnology sub-
sector, and to help promote the new
strategy to a wider group of
international investors we appointed
Piper Jaffray as joint broker and
adviser alongside Credit Suisse.
Priorities for the year ahead
Our priorities for the year ahead
continue the work we have
commenced this year. The focus
continues to be to:
> Build value in the pipeline
through in-licensing and
development activities
> Secure a development and
commercialisation partner 
for Varisolve
®
> Capture full value from the
ongoing monetisation of 
non-core assets
> Maintain cost control across 
all areas of the business
> Further establish BTG within 
the industry as a credible and
preferred development and

> addressing core
strategic issues
You have focused the business and
reduced costs, but what is your
vision for BTG?
Louise Makin: We had to get the
business onto a solid financial footing
in the short term, so that we could
control our own destiny and provide
the platform on which we could build 
a sustainable, growing business. Our
strategic review clearly showed that
our future lay in developing and
commercialising medical innovations.
Our vision is to create a deep,
valuable pipeline of drugs and
medical technologies that meet
partners’ and patients’ needs. 
Christine Soden: Our strategy and
vision must continue to evolve in
response to innovation, competition
and changes in the regulatory and
economic spheres but I believe 
we are poised to capture significant
value and growth. 
This year’s financial results show
significant progress. Do you have
sufficient resources to realise 
your vision?
CS: We ended the year with a really
strong cash position and sound
business. Our clear goal is to create 
a growing operating surplus from 
our revenues, assets and reduced
cost levels to enable us to invest in 
developing our pipeline and building
future value. So our current cash and
future earnings potential mean we
have the resources to be a highly
competitive player in our field. Our
virtual development model means we
can scale activities without significant
strain on our cash reserves. 
LM: We believe we can build
substantial value from our current
portfolio and resources, but should
good opportunities arise to build
value more rapidly, for example by
acquiring portfolios of assets, we
would examine each on its merits
including the impact on resources.
Are you following the optimum
strategy for Varisolve
®
, which still
remains the focus for many
investors, and how confident are you
of securing a partner?
LM: It is natural that Varisolve
®
remains a focus because it is still one
of the largest and most advanced
programmes in our current portfolio.
It is pleasing, though, that most
investors now recognise that
Varisolve
®
is only part of the BTG story
and that we have a broad pipeline of
valuable assets in development at
BTG and by our partners.
Securing an agreement with a global
development and marketing partner is
the right strategy for Varisolve
®
. To
complete development and get the
product to market needs significant
financial and other resources, including
late-stage clinical trial and regulatory
and marketing expertise, which BTG
does not have. We were pleased by the
interest in Varisolve
®
from the industry
when we initiated contact with a range
of new companies towards the end of
last year . Since then, the process has
moved forward as anticipated and
discussions continue with a number of
potential partners.
CS: Varisolve
®
is not a classic
pharmaceutical product nor is it 
a straightforward medical device.
Regulatory hurdles remain and the
product is targeting an undeveloped
market, so it will take time to find the
right partner and secure the right
deal terms. That said, we remain
confident that Varisolve
®
has the
potential to become a significant
product and deliver good returns for
BTG and its shareholders. Moreover,
we believe the phase II and III studies
could overlap and this strengthens
our view that we should wait for a
partner to start these trials.
How will you replace the royalties
you will lose on major products such
as BeneFIX
®
around 2011 when the
patents expire?
CS: The key to replacing revenue
streams when they expire is to ensure
that there is a steady flow of good
assets into and through BTG’s
development pipeline. Of our current
marketed products, the two-part hip
cup revenues are steady and patent
coverage continues to 2019. New
technologies are being developed in
this area but we believe that these will BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006   09
increase the overall market rather
than reduce the hip replacement
market. Revenues from Campath
®
,
which is continuing to become
established in its current approved
indication of chronic lymphocytic
leukaemia, continue until 2017. 
It is also being developed for other
oncology indications and for multiple
sclerosis, and if development is
successful could be approved in these
indications before 2011. Several 
out-licensed developments could be
on the market and generating

has the potential
to be on the market in that timeframe.
Can you compete with
pharmaceutical and larger
biotechnology companies, which are
all trying to in-license high-quality
assets for development?
LM: Competition for good assets is
strong, as the larger companies are
in-licensing at an earlier stage than
they would have only a couple of
years ago. In a simple auction for a
phase II ready product, BTG is
unlikely to compete with large
pharma. But we can compete for
earlier-stage compounds that are
perhaps a year to 18 months from the
clinic. If there is a need to pay some
cash up front we have sufficient cash
reserves. We also compete by
proposing development and
commercialisation pathways that are
attractive to the source, giving them
comfort that the programme will be
important to BTG and will be
advanced quickly and effectively. 
Do you have sufficient expertise and
resource to conduct high-quality
development programmes on what is
still a large and diverse portfolio?
LM: As Christine mentioned earlier,
we aim to run our developments
through a series of outsourcing deals,
ensuring we cover key posts
internally. So we have built a highly
capable team of development
managers augmented by networks 
of experts and key opinion leaders.
We have scientific and business
expertise in-house in our chosen
focus areas, which we supplement
through our scientific advisory boards
of international experts. In addition,
we have recently added to our
development expertise by recruiting
specialist preclinical and early clinical
stage development managers from
other pharmaceutical companies. As
we move forward we will fill selected
additional posts in areas such as
medical, regulatory affairs, chemistry
and project management.
CS: Our strategy is to develop
programmes through preclinical
studies and up to proof of concept,
around phase IIa or equivalent. The
typical patient numbers and sorts 
of studies at these stages are fairly
predictable and so we are able to 
plan and manage expenditure.

increased revenues, reduced costs
and substantial cash resources,

Business, objectives & strategy
Business
BTG is focused on generating
revenues and returns from medical
innovations, principally in developing
new and improved drugs. Centred on
its main expertise of in-licensing
patents to key technologies, the
Company is building a strong
development group with the core skills
necessary to move products rapidly
from drug candidate selection to proof
of principle through a network of
outsourced contract research
organisations. BTG’s experience and
expertise in intellectual property
management adds significantly to the
marketability of its programmes and
revenue streams once assets are 
out-licensed and marketed.
Objectives
BTG’s objectives are to maximise:
> Net revenue streams from 
out-licensed assets
> Returns from assets ready for 
out-licensing
> The value of its drug development
pipeline
> Returns from investments in
existing start-up companies.
The aim is to create a focused pipeline
that remains sufficiently diverse to
allow a balanced risk profile. The
programmes cover therapeutics to
treat cancer, ageing diseases such as
Alzheimer’s disease, pain syndromes
such as migraine and a series of drug
repositioning programmes that offer
shorter, less-expensive routes to value.
Strategy
In order to secure the financial
headroom to move forward, BTG
undertook a significant reorganisation
and restructuring. In May 2005 the
decision was taken to no longer
pursue new ideas in the physical
sciences areas such as software
development, telecommunications or
semiconductors and to in-license and
develop programmes in the life
sciences area and medical devices
only. The decision was also taken that
BTG should seek to build a high-
quality pipeline of clinical-stage
assets rather than focusing on adding
small amounts of development value
to a larger number of early-stage
programmes. Furthermore it was
determined that areas such as
venture investing and royalty-auditing
services should be wound down,
since in value terms they did not offer
the same potential returns as drug or
device development.
There were several reasons behind
the decision to focus on medical
innovations. The attractions included
the facts that:
> The majority of BTG’s revenues
are derived from royalties on sales
of drugs and medical devices 
> The Company’s expertise and
contacts are focused in the
pharmaceutical, biotech and
medtech sectors
> The Company has invested
significantly in building an R&D
pipeline including the
development of Varisolve
®
> Clear increases in value arise as
development milestones are met
> IP and its value are established
early in the commercialisation of
the programme
> Market demand for new medical
products is strong.
Patents over physical science assets
on the other hand are more difficult 
to value and commercialise. The life of
patents in this space is limited, the
chances of “work-arounds”
significant, the ability to understand
which products infringe the patents
unclear and the chances of generating
royalty returns without resorting to
patent assertion or litigation slim.
This shift in strategy, away from 
a high-volume broad technology
licensing model to building a focused
pipeline of drug development projects,
involved significant reorganisation and
restructuring. The last 12 months
have seen a big reduction in costs and
a simplification in structures.
Performance & development 
during the year 
The year to 31 March 2006 saw a
major shift in BTG’s strategy and
financial results. Revenues grew
significantly, cash generation was
strong and costs were reduced. As a
result the difference in financial
performance from last year to this
was very pleasing, with the Company
moving from a loss after tax of
£35.0m in 04/05 to a profit after tax 
of £1.4m in 05/06. Whilst achieving
this result the Company continued 
to invest to build its pipeline of R&D
programmes set to generate future
earnings for the business.
Revenues and gains
BTG’s revenues fall into two main
categories: royalty revenues from
marketed products and the proceeds
of one-off deals, settlements 
or milestones.
Royalty revenues in 05/06 were
£39.5m (04/05: £29.2m) an increase
of 35%. Most of BTG’s intellectual
property is accessed on the basis that
BTG pays a proportion of the royalty
revenues it earns from the IP back to

increased capacity to

the licensor or source after deduction
of certain costs. These payments,
referred to as revenue sharing,
averaged 41% of royalty income in 
the year (04/05: 41%) although the
terms vary patent by patent and by
territory and technology from 10% to
around 70%. As BTG moves forward
and invests more significantly in the
R&D assets it acquires, these
revenue-sharing percentages should
reduce but the impact on the net
revenue “margin” will not be
apparent for some years.
Net royalty revenues after revenue
sharing increased from £17.8m in
04/05 to £23.0m this year, an increase
of 29%. This significant increase in
the year reflected the fact that
Zimmer is now paying royalties on its
sales of the artificial hip-cup design
over which BTG holds patents,
generating new net royalty income of
£1.7m. Without this income, the
increase would have been 20% on 
a like-for-like basis. Revenues were
also boosted by a particularly strong
performance from BeneFIX
®
(recombinant Factor IX sold by Wyeth
and Baxter) where royalties increased
by 23% in the year.
Net royalties have increased by an
average of around 10%-12% pa over
the previous five years. Forecasts for
06/07 show some sales growth
although shifts in revenue-sharing
agreements on BeneFIX
®
would
counteract likely sales increases on
that product. As such the aggregate
increase over the two years to 
31 March 2008 is likely to return to
the average range achieved in the
recent past. 
The royalties received on sales of the
two-part artificial hip patents
increased with the addition of royalties
from sales by Zimmer Corporation
supplementing those from earlier
licensees. Other key products include

of the product as a third-line
treatment for chronic lymphocytic
leukaemia (CLL) are growing steadily.
Future sales may be significant should
the Company’s development activities
allow for this product to be used in
second- and first-line CLL, other
cancers or in multiple sclerosis. BTG
also earns low-level royalties on
certain background antibody
humanisation patents commercialised
through the Medical Research Council.
These patents apply to a selected
range of monoclonal antibody
products now reaching market. BTG’s
royalties from these patents are
anticipated to increase gradually over
the coming years. The Company also
earns good royalties from sales of
artificial knee products and a range 
of other drug and device products. 
The patents underlying BTG’s royalties
provide coverage over periods from 
six to 15 years. See figure 1.
In addition, BTG earned significant
revenues and generated gains from
the licensing, sale or settlement of
certain assets and transactions. Within
licensing deals and settlements, BTG
generated revenues of £7.5m from the
settlement in May 2005 with Zimmer
with related revenue-sharing costs of
£3.4m. Milestone receipts and licences
granted on other patents generated a
further £3.2m gross and £2.4m net.
Each of these bore litigation costs that
are included within operating
expenses. See figure 2.
During the year BTG concluded the
sale of three sets of assets within the
physical sciences portfolio. Patents
relating to radio-frequency ID tagging
were sold to Zebra for gross proceeds
of £3.0m and a net gain of £1.6m. 
QRS took and exercised an option 
to acquire rights to an explosives
detection technology, NQR. The gross
proceeds for this transaction could
total $15m but given the long time
period over which these revenues
would be generated (12-14 years) 
and consequent uncertainty over
collecting such proceeds, only $2m
(£1.1m) has been recognised at this
time. The largest transaction
completed in the year was the sale 
of patents licensed from Teleshuttle 
to Twin Tech EU for gross proceeds of
£20.0m. Costs, being revenue sharing
and amounts due to advisers plus
writing off the net book value of the
assets, resulted in a net gain of £9.0m.
The other main one-off transaction
was the sale of shares held in a
private company, KuDOS, to
AstraZeneca for a gain of £0.7m.
Overall, one-off transactions in the
year generated net revenues and
gains of £18.1m with cash of some
£20m generated once all liabilities
are settled.
These revenues and gains were
pleasing in that they demonstrated the
Company’s ability to exit in an orderly
and profitable way from the physical
science assets. Further exits are
anticipated in the next 12-24 months.
Cost containment & restructuring
BTG’s costs in 04/05 were high and
included a significant expense
relating to reorganising and
restructuring decisions taken during
that year. In particular the results
included an expense of £6.6m in
respect of uneconomic leases.
Further reorganisation costs were
incurred during 05/06 following the
decision to stop investing in new
technologies in the physical sciences
arena and a decision to outsource 
a number of administrative and IT
functions. Costs relating to the
salaries of those declared redundant
in the current year were around
£4.6m, including certain incentive
packages to ensure an orderly wind-
down of the asset realisation. Sub-
letting of certain of the Company’s
unoccupied property allowed some
£0.9m of provisions made in 04/05 
to be written back, giving an overall
charge of £3.7m for the year.
These changes should lead to
significantly lower running rates for
administrative costs in future years.
Operating expenses, being patent 
and litigation costs, were at a similar
level to 04/05 with patent renewal
fees slightly down, higher litigation
costs relating to actions on the
Zimmer, WebNav and Teleshuttle
deals which have now settled and 
a high amortisation charge following
a full assessment of the likely values
achievable from the patents in line
with the new strategy. 
Looking forward, litigation expenses
are not expected to be material 
in the coming year, although
circumstances may cause this to
change. Amortisation charges should
reduce considerably following the
sale or write-down of certain assets
in the year and as such operating
expenses for 06/07 are targeted to 
be significantly lower than the £7.5m
in the current year.
Administrative expenses at £18.3m
are £5.1m or 22% below the levels 
of the prior year and savings 
achieved through the reorganisation
mean that 06/07 operating and
administrative expenses should fall
below £21m, some £3m below 
05/06 levels.
An exchange gain of £1.5m was
achieved in the year on the
conversion of certain foreign-
currency denominated receipts into
sterling. In the prior year exchange
losses of £0.2m were incurred. The
level of such gains and losses is
difficult to forecast and the effect 
may well be neutral in future years.
Research & development
R&D costs for the BTG group as 
a whole were £9.1m of which £4.5m 14 BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
related to Varisolve
®
, £3.3m to BTG
directed projects, and £0.3m and
£1.0m to the operations of BTG’s
subsidiary and associate companies
respectively. This compares to £16.8m
in the prior year (£9.2m Varisolve
®
,
£6.3m BTG directed and £1.3m in
subsidiaries and associates). In the
case of Varisolve
®
and the other
subsidiary and associate companies
these represent the entire costs of the
operations, which are dedicated to
research and development. In the case
of BTG directed projects, this
represents the external R&D costs
paid to clinical research organisations
and similar .
The expenditure of £4.5m on Varisolve
®
in the year related to costs incurred 
in securing the manufacturing supply
chain, including a one-off payment to
the landlords of our Wrexham
secondary-manufacturing site for profit
mark-ups foregone on contract
manufacturing. Activities were also
centred on completing work required
by the FDA and preparing for the
upcoming phase II safety study. The
costs of running Varisolve
®
activities in
the 06/07 year excluding the phase II
trial are likely to be around half of the
05/06 levels.
Progress in BTG’s pipeline has been
pleasing. The expenditure of £3.3m 
is in line with budget and the
decrease over last year reflects 
a focusing down into a core portfolio
rather than investing small amounts
in large numbers of activities. BTG’s
strategy, as announced in May 05, 
was to move this R&D investment 
to £10m pa over the coming three
years as high-value opportunities are
recognised and accessed, and 
plans are in place to be in line with
this objective.
Costs within BTG’s subsidiaries 
and associates are monitored actively
and carefully through the
arrangements put in place through
our investment agreements. 
Carrying value of investments
Regrettably, charges of £4.2m arose 
in the year upon the impairment in
value of two investments. The
majority of this arose upon the loan
creditors of SAMSys Inc calling in
their debt. The assets of that
company are being sold but the
expectation is that after payment of
liabilities there will be no return to
shareholders. Accordingly the fair
value of this investment of £3.7m was
expensed in the year. The balance
relates to an investment in a private
company, Ignios Limited, in which
BTG has decided not to invest further.
Financial income & tax
BTG’s cash balances are invested in
short-term and call deposits. Interest
earned on deposits averaged 4.5% in
the year.
The tax charge relates to certain
withholding taxes on royalty income
that are not relievable under double-
taxation treaties.
Profit for the year and earnings 
per share
Overall BTG achieved a profit for the
year of £1.4m, an improvement of
£36.4m over the previous year’s loss 
of £35.0m. Reductions in costs,
increases in royalty income and gains
from licences and sales of assets in
the year have combined to generate
this turnaround. 
These profits represent earnings per
share of 1.0p compared to a loss per
share in 04/05 of 23.8p based on an
average of 146.6m shares in issue
(04/05:145.5m).
These results include a number 
of charges that arise under IFRS
rather than UK GAAP although the
charges in the 05/06 year are broadly
comparable to those in the restated
04/05 accounts.
Position at the year end
At 31 March 2006 BTG’s net assets
were £42.2m, an improvement of
£3.2m in the year.
Non-current assets
The value of BTG’s non-current assets
fell by some £10m in the year to
£24.6m. Intangible assets stood at
£7.1m with additions of £2.3m being
offset by disposals of £2.2m and
amortisation charges of £3.9m. The
intangible assets held, mostly patents,
are written off over the remaining life
of the patent or their useful economic
life if shorter and are subject to
regular impairment reviews. 
The net book value of the Group’s
fixed assets reduced by £1.1m to
£9.6m through depreciation and
currency movements. The major
asset held is the Wrexham
secondary-manufacturing plant for
Varisolve
®
which is still in the course
of construction and as such is not 
yet depreciated.
The investment in associates reduced
from £3.6m to £2.7m, reflecting losses
incurred in those companies plus
additions and impairment charges.
The associates are private companies
engaged in research and development.
Mesophotonics Ltd is developing
technologies in photonic crystal nano
devices, Protez Pharmaceuticals is
developing new antibiotics to
overcome drug resistance and Senexis
Ltd is developing small molecule
drugs in the CNS space. Other
investments represent holdings in
companies where BTG owns under
20% of the share capital and
investments in a number of venture
capital funds. The largest individual
investment is in Xention Discovery
Limited, a drug discovery company
focused on ion channels. In total BTG
invested £1.8m in these companies
and funds during the year (04/05:
£2.7m). Commitments to follow-on
funding of the investment portfolio
stood at £2.9m as at 31 March 2006.

Current assets, current & 
non-current liabilities
The trade and other receivables were
£10.1m at 31 March 2006 compared
to £7.4m at the prior year end, with
the increase broadly in line with
increased revenues.
Current liabilities at £30.6m were 
in line with those at the previous 
year end of £28.9m although trade
payables include some £7m in
respect of unpaid costs on the
Teleshuttle deal concluded near the
year end.
Non-current liabilities at £12.9m
include £9.6m in respect of the net
deficit on the Company’s defined
benefit pension plan, together with
provisions largely against future lease
liabilities on onerous leases. A deficit
repair schedule has been agreed 
with the trustees of the pension 
plan to pay down the deficit over the
next six years.
Cash
BTG’s net cash and cash equivalents
as at 31 March 2006 were £51.0m.
This cash balance was reduced
shortly after the year end in settling
the £7m of unpaid liabilities on the
Teleshuttle deal mentioned above.
Accordingly the “free cash” balance
was around £44m, up some £9m in
the year from £34.5m.
The Company’s profit for the year of
£1.5m included non-cash charges 
of £3.9m for amortisation, £0.9m for
depreciation, £2.0m of non-cash
charges in reaching the profit on
sales of assets, £5.2m in reducing the
value of associates and investments
and around £0.8m in respect of
charges for share options. £4.3m 
was also generated from the exercise
of share options. The Group invested
£2.3m in acquiring intangible assets
and £1.8m in additional investments,
spent £2m in reducing the pension
scheme deficit and reduced
provisions by £3m. These items, 
with adjustments for working capital
changes, account for the £9m of 
cash generation.
Trends affecting development &
performance
The healthcare market
BTG’s performance is and will be
impacted by trends in the healthcare
sector generally, where there are 
a number of contrasting factors. 
An ageing, health- and appearance-
conscious population that is
becoming increasingly obese is
driving demand for effective products
with lower side effects, lower-risk
profiles, more targeted treatment,
improved delivery methods and
reduced hospitalisation times.
Greater patient awareness through
direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising
and internet access means that the
product pull comes increasingly from
the patient rather than prescribing
doctors. These factors result in an
increasing demand for appropriate
medicines and products.
Countering this demand is the
difficulty most world economies face
in paying for healthcare. Government
agencies and programmes (such as
the US Medicaid and Medicare and
UK NICE) seek to restrain the levels
at which drugs are reimbursed. In the
US market, the major healthcare
insurers also bring pressure to bear
on prices and drug supply.
BTG is well aware of the market and
believes its business model is suited to
maximising opportunities in this space.
Its Varisolve
®
product targets the
treatment of varicose veins and,
potentially, leg ulcers, and this is an
area where DTC advertising can
create a great customer pull for a
non-invasive, out-patient clinic
treatment for a condition affecting an
increasing number of people,
particularly in today’s health- and
image-conscious society.

BTG’s other development
programmes are targeting diseases
of ageing, such as Alzheimer’s
disease, and also areas where obesity
is driving the rate of increase in
conditions such as sleep apnoea,
where BTG’s BGC20-0166 has
potential to take a leading position.
Our drug repositioning programmes
address the need to create cost-
effective drugs for supply through the
speciality pharma market. These
programmes seek to find new uses or
benefits from reformulating or
combining existing drugs. These
products can be delivered more
cheaply since development times are
rapid and less expensive. By their
nature they use drugs that are tried
and tested but can be delivered in a
safer, more effective or more
convenient regime.
In terms of revenues from existing
sources, BTG’s royalties from sales 
of BeneFIX
®
or recombinant Factor IX,
used in treating haemophilia B, have
increased. The markets for artificial
hips and knees continues to grow with
the ageing population and BTG earns
significant royalties from products in
these markets. New methods and
products are being developed but
market uptake tends to be slow in the
orthopaedic area and as such we hope
to earn significant income for the
remaining lives of the patents.
Developing drugs
The development of new drugs
remains highly regulated. Greater
safety consciousness leads to
increasingly rigorous development
programmes, but the development of
more and more early predictors of
safety and efficacy in silico and in
vitro mean that BTG can apply a 
“fail-early” strategy in order to avoid
wasted costs on large late-stage
clinical trials. BTG aims to be highly
effective in drug development, moving
lead drug candidates through 
pre-clinical development to proof of
concept in an average of three years.
BTG’s “virtual” development model,
working through a series of contract
research and manufacturing
organisations, the supply of which
increases constantly, means that the
Company can access the right
expertise when required from the
most cost-effective providers but not
be burdened with the overhead of
building the skills in house.
Intellectual property
The laws surrounding intellectual
property change constantly but
maintaining a strong patent skill 
base in-house means that BTG is 
well connected amongst key opinion
leaders and able to act effectively to
maximise patent life on its
programmes. The most significant
change currently on the horizon
relates to USPTO rules which in
future will allow only one continuation
of an application for a given invention.
This places much more emphasis on
doing things properly at the start.
Competition
The number of pharmaceutical and
biotech companies chasing good 
in-licensing opportunities is rising
and, with the need to fill their
development pipelines and a shortage
of good late-stage opportunities, they
are seeking to access programmes
earlier and earlier.
This bodes well for BTG’s out-
licensing efforts but does make 
in-licensing earlier-stage
programmes more competitive.
However, as BTG’s development skills
increase and given the Company’s
strong cash position, we believe the
Company is able to compete in
accessing key programmes.

Risks & uncertainties
Development risk
The development of drug and 
medical products is inherently
uncertain and the timelines and costs
to approval may vary significantly
from budget or expectation. The drug
may not demonstrate the expected
efficacy or safety benefits and may
not be approved by the regulatory
bodies, such as the US Food and 
Drug Administration. 
Regulatory
The pharmaceutical industry is 
highly regulated. Compliance with
such regulations, including
demonstrating compliance with GMP
and GCP standards, can be time-
consuming and expensive and
alterations to the regulations may
result in delays or even non-approval
of a product in development.
Moreover, failure by a BTG partner
company to comply with regulations
may result in a product being
withdrawn from market with a
subsequent loss of revenues to BTG.
Competition & reimbursement
Competition to a product on which
BTG currently earns revenues or
from which it hopes to earn revenues
once on the market may adversely
impact future revenues. The failure of
a product to qualify for government
or health-insurance reimbursement
or changes to the environment for
reimbursement could both adversely
impact revenues.
Intellectual property
Failure by BTG to maintain or renew
key patents might lead to losses of
earnings and liability to suit from both
the licensee and licensor. BTG seeks
to minimise this risk through robust
internal processes backed up by
external agents’ systems.
The patents on BTG’s biggest-earning
product, BeneFIX
®
, could start to
expire from 2011. It will be important
to replace these earnings streams
with other income.
BTG’s patents may be subject to
challenge for infringement which
might result in litigation costs and/or
loss of earnings. BTG might be
obliged to sue third parties for their
infringement of its patents.
Currency & treasury
Many of BTG’s revenues and receipts
are denominated in US$ and
movements in foreign exchange rates
could adversely impact results. 
BTG actively manages its exchange
risks where feasible, using short-
term hedging transactions guided 
by market expectations and economic
forecasts.
Resources
BTG’s principal resources are its
employees, external relationships,
pipeline, intellectual property assets
and cash and investments.
Hiring, motivating and retaining key
members of staff is critical to BTG’s
success. The Company’s
remuneration policy is set out on
pages 30 to 38. Increasingly BTG
employees are moving from a skill
base in licensing, litigation and IP to
place a greater emphasis on medical
innovations, with more members of
staff being recruited from biotech and
pharmaceutical companies.
Maintaining and building relationships
with key opinion leaders in our areas 
of expertise, and being acknowledged
as a significant player in drug
development, is important for BTG. 
We operate a network of scientific
advisers from leading academic,
medical and pharmaceutical
companies worldwide to bring 
ideas and constructive criticism 
to our strategy and tactics.
Relationships with researchers, 
be they in academic, charitable or
commercial organisations, remain
key to accessing promising new
development programmes.
BTG’s pipeline of development
programmes represents the
opportunity to create future value.
The aim is to develop programmes
through points of value inflection
such that BTG can out-license at the
clinical stage of phase II or later
when development partners typically
pay significant sums to access good
prospects, usually through access
payments, milestones and royalties.
BTG owns value in products being
marketed by licensing partners but
also has significant potential income
from products being developed by
development partners. BTG’s estate
of patents represents key assets
underlying current and future
revenue generation. Certain of them
are out-licensed while others fall into 
two categories: those on which
development is underway within 
BTG and those which will not be
developed further but for which 
a commercialisation deal will be
sought over the coming 12-24 months.
BTG is in a strong cash position, and
is well placed to use current cash
resources and realisations from its
portfolio of investments to access
additional high-potential assets for
development by the Group.
Adoption of International Financial
Reporting and Accounting Standards
(IFRS)
This is the first set of consolidated
financial statements prepared and
produced by BTG in accordance with
IFRS. The adoption of IFRS potentially
creates some volatility in the
presentation of the results and assets
and reserves of the Company. The 
key differences between the results
for the year as reported under IFRS
and UK GAAP are set out in note 33
on pages 69 to 74. 18 BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
The Group is committed to regularly
reviewing its social, ethical and
environmental policies, to improving
and extending them where
appropriate and to reporting on them.
BTG believes that having empowered
and responsible employees who
display sound judgement and
awareness of the consequences of
their decisions or actions, and who
act in an ethical and responsible way,
is key to the success of the business. 
BTG has an Ethics and Policy Guide,
which provides guidance for
employees on BTG’s policies on 
a variety of CSR-related topics
including employment practices and
ethics, law and compliance, and
environmental practices.
A CSR Committee has been formally
appointed with responsibility for
reviewing BTG’s CSR-related policies
and practices, and recommending
operating and policy changes as
appropriate. Matters relating to
corporate, social, ethical and
environmental policies are reviewed
regularly and progress is reported to
the Board on a regular basis. Sir
Brian Fender is the Board member
with specific responsibility for CSR.
BTG is a member of the FTSE4Good
index and participates in various
benchmarking exercises focusing on
CSR, to enable disclosure of its CSR
policies and performance. Through
consultation and engagement BTG
observes and adheres to international
standards including the ABI
disclosure guidelines.
Equal opportunities policy
BTG is committed to achieving equality
of opportunity in all its employment
practices, policies and procedures.
Employees are highly valued and their
rights and dignity are respected. BTG
does not tolerate any harassment of,
or discrimination against, its staff. BTG
practises equal treatment of all
employees or potential employees
irrespective of their race, creed,
colour, sexual orientation, nationality,
ethnic origin, religion, disability, age,
gender or marital status.
Ethical dealings
The Group also endeavours to be
honest and fair in its relationships
with customers and suppliers, and 
to be a good corporate citizen
respecting the laws of countries in
which it operates. In choosing
suppliers and partners, BTG extends
its own values to those of its
contractors, including obligations to
meet the highest standards of quality,
ethical and fair practices.
Family-friendly employment
policies and careers
The paternity and maternity leave and
maternity pay policies meet, and in
part exceed, the statutory minimum.
Flexible approaches to return to work
after maternity leave and part-time or 
non-standard hours and work
patterns are adopted where viable.
Employment of people with
disabilities
BTG ensures that people with
disabilities are supported and
encouraged to apply for employment
with the Group and progress within it.
If job applicants or employees are
disabled, they will have an equal
opportunity to be selected, trained and
promoted in their career development.
BTG makes every reasonable effort 
to retain disabled persons in the
employment of the Group.
Employee communication and

arrangements for employee
consultation on the Company’s

the Group regularly through monthly
communication sessions, the intranet
and emails.
Environment
BTG is committed to complying with
environmental legislation and
minimising the impact of its activities
on the environment. BTG considers
that since it operates only in office
environments, its direct activities have
a low environmental impact. Moreover,
as BTG occupies only parts of larger
office buildings, it is difficult to
manage or control overall building
emissions, energy usage or waste. 
A manufacturing facility is under
construction for the Varisolve
®
product
and environmental considerations
were taken into account in its design.
The Group is committed to minimising
any adverse environmental impact of
this facility and will comply with
environmental legislation. Once the
facility is commissioned, an
assessment will be carried out and
steps taken to monitor and reduce
energy usage and emissions.
An environmental action plan has
been put in place in the UK through
various initiatives, including recycling,
and sourcing recycled consumables.
Policies are in place to source energy-
efficient IT equipment and there is the
facility to recycle printer cartridges
and batteries. BTG will also continue
to review working with suppliers to
improve environmental management
along the supply chain, including the
introduction of a policy to source fair-
trade products and consumables.
Similar policies, where possible, are
being implemented in the US. 
The Group measures and compiles
data on energy use for business
travel, energy and water consumption.
Provision of video and telephone
conferencing in both offices provides
an alternative to international travel,
where appropriate.
Health and safety
Whilst the Group is considered to
operate in a low-risk industry with
regard to Health and Safety (H&S) 
it continues to consider H&S to be 
a priority in all its workplaces
worldwide. Continual improvement is
achieved by regular risk assessment.
Trained teams of H&S staff, fire
wardens and first-aiders cover all
offices. The Group has an excellent
safety record and there have been 
no incidents or accidents to report 
to the Health and Safety Executive in
the UK or to the Operational Health
and Safety Administration in the US 
in the past year.
Political and charitable
contributions
BTG’s policy is that it does not donate
money, services or facilities to
political parties. However, BTG may
campaign for or against proposed
changes in legislation or regulations
that might affect its business or the
environment in which it does
business. Officers or employees may,
with BTG’s approval, participate in
government advisory committees 
or non-governmental organisations
that are relevant to the business. 
No political contributions were 
made during the current or prior
financial years. 
BTG encourages employee
involvement in charitable causes in a
number of ways. In the UK, BTG
operates and promotes a Give As You
Earn Scheme, whereby employees
can make a regular donation to any
registered charity, or other
recognised body of their choice, from
their monthly pay. In addition, BTG
will match other donations made by
employees up to a fixed amount that
is set annually based on the previous
year’s donations. BTG strives to work
with charities and organisations that
are either in some way local, or of
interest to BTG employees. Each year,
in the UK, BTG also selects a charity
to sponsor, which is chosen by an
annual ballot of employees.
Employees are encouraged to
organise money-raising activities for
the charity throughout the year;
reasonable use of BTG time and
facilities is allowed. 
In the US, BTG operates a matching
gift plan to support the interests and
concerns of employees, and to
recognise and encourage active
community involvement. Cash
donations made by full-time
employees to qualified charitable,
educational and other non-profit
organisations are matched by BTG 
up to a limit of $500 per employee,
per year.
Charitable contributions made by the
Group during the year amounted to
£2,971 (04/05: £4,461). 20 BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006

Information & training, 
performance evaluation and 
re-election of directors
The board should be supplied in 
a timely manner with information in 
a form and of a quality appropriate to
enable it to discharge its duties. 
All directors should receive induction
on joining the board and should
regularly update and refresh their
skills and knowledge. The board
should undertake a formal and
rigorous annual evaluation of its own
performance and that of its
committees. All directors should be
submitted for re-election 
at regular intervals, subject to
continued satisfactory performance.
The board should ensure planned and
progressive refreshing of the board.
The directors are sent an agenda and
a full set of papers for each item to
be discussed, in advance of each
Board or committee meeting. The
executive directors provide a regular
operating and financial update to the
Board in the months where there is
no meeting. Additional information is
provided as appropriate and senior
executives regularly make
presentations at Board meetings on
the results and strategies in their
areas of responsibility.
Upon joining BTG each director
receives a comprehensive induction
package, including both written
information and opportunities to 
meet key and relevant members of
staff. All directors refresh their
knowledge regularly through
publications and conferences and
through information provided by the
Company and its advisers.
The Board has evaluated its own
effectiveness, and of its committees,
both through measuring performance
against annual objectives and through
an individual appraisal process. The

The Board of BTG recognises that
good corporate governance is
essential to running a successful
company and is committed to
ensuring that high levels of corporate
governance are maintained that
underpin the management of the
Company’s affairs. UK-listed
companies are required by the
Financial Services Authority to report
on their governance practices and
the extent to which they comply with
Section 1 of the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance (the “Code”),
published in July 2003 by the
Financial Reporting Council (FRC).
This is the third year that we have
reported on our corporate
governance under the provisions 
of the Code and the Board considers
that the Company complied with all
its provisions throughout the year to 
31 March 2006. More information on
the Code can be found on the FRC
website, www.frc.org.uk.
The information set out below
explains how we comply with the
Code’s main principles and detailed
provisions. 
Board composition, responsibilities
and balance
Each company should be headed 
by an effective board which is
collectively responsible for the success
of the company. There should be a
clear division of responsibilities
between the running of the board and
executive responsibility for the running
of the company’s business. The board
should include a balance of executive
and non-executive directors (and in
particular independent non-executive
directors) such that no individual or
group of individuals may dominate the
board’s decision-making.
The BTG Board currently comprises a
non-executive Chairman; two
executive directors, the Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief
Financial Officer (CFO); together with
a further five independent non-
executive directors (including a
Senior Independent Director). Their
names, together with brief
biographical details, are set out on
pages 20 to 21. The table on page 25
details the composition of the Board
and its committees, together with
their attendance at meetings and the
Company’s assessment of the
independence of the directors.
Whilst the executive and non-executive
directors are collectively responsible
for the success of the Company and
have fiduciary duties towards
shareholders, their roles are strictly
delineated. The executive directors
have direct responsibility for the
business operations of the Company;
the non-executive directors have 
a responsibility to bring independent
and objective judgement to Board
decisions; and the Chairman’s primary
responsibility is for the effective
running of the Board. The non-
executives’ duties include helping to
develop the Company’s strategy and
constructively challenging the
executive directors where they
consider it appropriate. 
The Board as a whole monitors
operating performance, the
performance of management,
succession planning, health, safety
and environmental performance and
standards of ethical and social
behaviour and is responsible for
developing robust corporate
governance and risk management
procedures aimed at safeguarding the
Company’s reputation and 
assets and the integrity of its financial
information.
Matters specifically reserved to the
Board for decision or approval include
the approval of the interim and
annual financial statements, setting
strategic direction, budgets and long-
term plans, major investments and
disposals, major capital expenditure,
major litigation, significant financing,
dividend policy and senior executive
remuneration and appointments. 
There is an agreed procedure for
directors to take independent
professional advice, if necessary, at
the Company’s expense. Directors
have direct access to the advice and
the services of the Company

ensuring that Board procedures are BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006   25

Board with identified areas for 
future action. Those identified in the
March 2005 review were followed up
during the current year to ensure
they were enacted.
The CEO is responsible for appraising
the performance of the CFO and 
the Chairman and non-executive
directors review the performance 
of the CEO. The Chairman asked each
director to complete a questionnaire
comprising both qualitative and
quantitative responses and then
interviewed each director separately
to discuss individual performance 
as a director over the past year 
and the effectiveness of the
committees and the Board as 
a whole, and how it might improve its
monitoring of the business. A number
of recommendations were put
forward, discussed by the Board and
acted upon. The Senior Independent
Director chaired a meeting of the
non-executive directors, in the
absence of the Chairman, to review
his performance against personal
targets. The non-executive directors
meet at least once a year without 
the executive directors in order to
discuss their performance and any
concerns over their management of
the Company’s affairs.
All directors are required to be 
re-elected at least once every three
years, with the Chairman offering
himself for re-election annually. 
At the AGM in July 2005, seven of the
nine directors stood for re-election.
The Board reviews its constitution
regularly and has established a clear
plan for refreshing its members.
During the year ended 31 March 2005
two directors retired and were
replaced by Alison Wood, a non-
executive director, and Louise Makin,
the CEO. During the year ended 
31 March 2006 Sir George Radda
retired as a non-executive director
and Rusi Kathoke retired, being
replaced as CFO by Christine Soden.
Malcolm Coster will retire at the AGM
in July 2006 and the Board intends to
appoint a new non-executive director
in the coming months.
Financing, reporting and 
internal control
The board should present a balanced
and understandable view of the
company’s position and prospects 
and should maintain a sound system
of internal control to safeguard
shareholders’ investment and the
company’s assets.
The statement of directors’
responsibilities in relation to the
preparation of the financial
statements is set out on page 29 and
the auditors’ statement on the
respective responsibilities of directors
and auditors is included within their
report set out on page 39. 
Communications with shareholders,
be they results announcements,
interim reports, annual reports or
AGM and trading updates, are
reviewed carefully and approved 
by the Board or a sub-committee
thereof in order to ensure they are
transparent and balanced in the view
they give of the Company’s progress
and prospects. 26 BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
> corporate governance
continued
The Board has overall responsibility
for ensuring that the Group maintains
an adequate system of internal
control and risk management and for
reviewing its effectiveness. The Audit
Committee on behalf of the Board
undertakes the detailed monitoring 
of the controls and reports to the
Board on its findings. The Board has
reviewed the system of internal
controls including financial controls
for the year under review and up to
the date of approval of this annual
report and accounts. Such a system 
is designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve
business objectives, and can only
provide reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The criteria applied by the directors 
in judging the effectiveness of these
controls are that they allow the
maximisation of shareholder value 
by exploiting business opportunities
whilst ensuring that risks are properly
identified and managed. The controls
are regularly reviewed to ensure that
they enable the proper management
of business risks without so restricting
efficiency and entrepreneurial nature
that they inhibit proper running of 
the business. 
BTG has a management structure
with clear lines of responsibility 
and accountability, staffed by
appropriate personnel. The Board is
responsible for setting the overall
strategy and reviewing the
performance of the Group. 
The day-to-day running of BTG’s
operations has been managed by the
Company’s Leadership Team, chaired
by the CEO, and includes the CFO and
senior staff members from the
business. This team is also responsible
for the recommendation to the Board
of the Company’s strategy and its
implementation and for ensuring that
appropriate internal controls are in
place to manage and assess risk and
that they are fully complied with.
The review of risk and risk
management is embedded throughout
the Group. A risk team is responsible
for identifying and evaluating risks
which may impact on the Group’s
strategic and business objectives and
for monitoring the progress of actions
designed to mitigate such risks. The
risk team reviews regular reports
prepared by the business units which
are then categorised and prioritised in
the form of a risk management plan.
The risk management plan identifies
the key risks, assesses the probability
of those risks occurring and the
impact should they occur, and the
actions and individuals responsible for
managing the risks. The risk team
discusses the plan with the
Leadership Team twice yearly, and
reports its findings through the Audit
Committee to the Board. 
There are a number of areas of risk
inherent in the Company’s business,
particularly in relation to the
development of early-stage
technologies. BTG endeavours to
reduce these risks by having a
broadly-based portfolio within the
area of medical innovations covering
a number of therapeutic areas and
stages of development.
The fundamental elements of the
Group’s internal control and risk
management framework are
described below.
Structure and reporting
Under the operating guidance 
of the Leadership Team, BTG is
organised into a number of business
and operating units and within these
there are defined management
structures and processes for
acquisition, assessment and
evaluation of technology opportunities,
and development and execution 
of commercialisation strategies. 
The drug development pipeline is
monitored and reviewed through a
Development Management Committee
that calls on the expertise of various
internal and external experts to
ensure the programmes are developed
effectively and meet commercial and
market needs. These teams work with
the in-house patent attorneys, lawyers
and other experts and also make use
of outside expertise when necessary.
BTG actively monitors its revenue
streams from partnered products and
from time to time audits its major
licensees to ensure compliance with
the terms of agreements. BTG also has
a system for supporting the protection
and maintenance of patents.
The Leadership Team meets formally
at least once each month to review
business performance measured
against annual budgets and longer-
term plans and an agreed set of
objectives and performance criteria 
for each business unit. Forecasts are
reset quarterly on the basis of detailed
reviews of progress and prospects.
Reporting to the Board is based on
these monthly and quarterly
assessments. The reports include
non-financial as well as financial
information and a review of technology
progress within the portfolio. 
Approval procedures
There is a delegated authority
structure within BTG that ensures
that decisions are taken at an
appropriate level, with an appropriate
level of input by internal and external
expert advisers. The delegated
authority structure prescribes
financial limits of approval at each
level and requires decisions with
significant financial, legal or
reputational impact for BTG to be
approved by the Board. 
Corporate policies, values 
and compliance
A statement of corporate values 
and a guidance booklet on ethics,
business practices and compliance
are distributed throughout the 
Group. Relevant employees meet
regularly to discuss external changes
in the regulatory, legal and financial
environments in which BTG operates
to ensure it remains fully compliant
with new legislation and best practice.
The Board, through the Audit
Committee, has reviewed the
effectiveness of the internal controls
of the Group. The controls described
above operate and are embedded
within the day-to-day business. There
is an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing significant
risks faced by the Company. A
reporting structure has been in place
throughout the year and up to the date
of approval of the financial statements
and is regularly reviewed by the
directors in accordance with the Code. BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006   27
As required by the Code, the Board
has considered whether it would be
appropriate to have an internal audit
function within the Group and has
concluded that, taking into account its
relatively small size, and the way the
business is run, this is not
appropriate at present. This decision
will be reviewed on an annual basis.
On the basis of current financial
projections and cash resources and
facilities available, and after making
enquiries, the directors believe that
the Company has adequate resources
to continue to operate for the
foreseeable future. For this reason
they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.
Relations with shareholders and
constructive use of the Annual
General Meeting (AGM)
There should be a dialogue with
shareholders based on the mutual
understanding of objectives. The
board as a whole has responsibility
for ensuring that a satisfactory
dialogue with shareholders takes
place. The board should use the AGM
to communicate with investors and
encourage their participation.
BTG endeavours to maintain good
communications with shareholders
through formal and informal
dialogue. The Company formally
reports its results twice a year with
full-year results announced in May
and interim results in November. 
The CEO and CFO give presentations
of these results to the Company’s
institutional shareholders, analysts
and the media. The presentations are
broadcast live on the web for the
information of shareholders and are
available thereafter as an archive. 
The directors receive an investor
relations briefing at each Board
meeting giving information on the
changes in shareholdings and any
feedback from the Company’s brokers
and investors. Following the twice-
yearly results announcements,
detailed feedback is obtained from
external advisers and brokers and
reported to the Board detailing the
views and reactions of investors and
analysts. The opportunity for
shareholders to meet the Chairman
or Senior Independent Director,
separately from the executive
directors, is available on request.
The annual report contains a full
business review and the interim
report gives an update at the half
year. Extensive information, including
annual reports and all press
releases, is published on the Group’s
website (www.btgplc.com) for access
by all shareholders. In addition,
through the website, individuals can
register to receive electronic copies
of all company announcements on
the day they are issued. 
The AGM is the principal opportunity
for private shareholders to meet 
and discuss the Group’s business 
with the directors and other senior
management. A full business
presentation is given and there is 
an open question and answer session
during which shareholders may 
ask questions both about the
resolutions being proposed and the
business in general.
Notice of the AGM, which will be 
held at 10.30 a.m. on 26 July 2006, 
at BTG’s offices, 10 Fleet Place,
Limeburner Lane, London EC4M 7SB,
is included with this report. The
notice of the AGM is sent to all
shareholders at least 20 working days
before the meeting. The Directors’
Report on pages 22 to 23 includes
details of the resolutions and
explanatory notes thereon and a
proxy form is enclosed with this
report for use by those members 
of the Company unable to attend.
Crest members may send their 
proxy votes to the Company’s
Registrars electronically. 
At the AGM the number of proxy votes
cast for each resolution will be
disclosed and subsequently published
on the Company’s website. The
Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration
and Nomination Committees will be
present at the AGM to answer
shareholders’ questions.
Audit Committee and auditors
The board should establish 
formal and transparent
arrangements for considering 
how it should apply the financial
reporting and internal control
principles and for maintaining 
an appropriate relationship with the
company’s auditors.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT FOR
THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2006
BTG has an established Audit
Committee with the principal
responsibilities of overseeing financial
reporting and internal control matters
and maintaining appropriate relations
with the Company’s auditors.
Details of the members of the 
Audit Committee, all of whom are
considered by the Company to be
independent non-executive directors,
plus information on attendance, is set
out in the table on page 25. The terms
of reference of the Audit Committee
can be found on the Group’s website
www.btgplc.com or requested from the
Company. These terms of reference
reflect the recommendations of the
“Smith Guidance”. At the invitation of
the Chairman of the Audit Committee,
the CEO, CFO, Chairman and external
auditors attend part or all of its
meetings. The Company Secretary or
her deputy acts as secretary for the
Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee is chaired by
Fred Weiss who, given his experience
and background, is considered by the
Board to have significant recent and
relevant financial experience. Fred
receives additional remuneration 
to compensate him for his
responsibilities as Committee
Chairman, as set out on page 33.  28 BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
> corporate governance
continued
The Committee met five times during
the year to 31 March 2006 and dealt
with the following agenda items:
> Review of the Group’s full-year
results to 31 March 2005, half-year
and estimated full-year results for
the year to 31 March 2006
> Review of the statement on the
impact of the transition to
International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS)
> Review of accounting policies
adopted under IFRS
> Review of the reports from the
external auditor on the 31 March
2005 audit and interim review for
2005/06
> Review of the scope, nature,
resource planning and fee
estimate for the full-year audit
> Review of the engagement letter
with the external auditors 
> Review of the audit representation
letters signed by management
> Review of the Committee’s terms
of reference
> Review of trading updates issued by
the Group and amendments thereto
> Assessment of the going 
concern basis
> Review of risk management
systems, internal controls and
fraud procedures
> Review of the disclosures relating
to material risks in the OFR 
> Assessment of the need for an
internal audit function
> Review of reorganisation expense
charges and provisions for
impairment in property leases
> Valuation of the Company’s equity
portfolio
> Review of policies on whistle-
blowing, use of the external
auditors for non-audit work and
employment of former employees
of the external auditor
> Review of non-audit fees in
relation to auditor independence.
A key role of the Committee is to
undertake detailed monitoring of 
the interim and annual financial
statements. As part of this review 
it discusses the audit findings and
auditors’ report with management and
the external auditors and considers
significant judgements and issues
contained in them, and whether the
financial statements comply fully with
the relevant statutes and accounting
standards and present a balanced
assessment of the Company’s financial
position and prospects. Following this
discussion the Chairman of the Audit
Committee reports the results of the
Committee’s review to the full Board.
The external auditor has also attended
the Board meeting at which the full-
year results are discussed. 
The Committee reviews the
effectiveness of internal controls and
risk management systems. It also
reviews the scope and results of the
external audit and the independence
and objectivity of the auditors. The
Company currently has no internal
audit function and the Committee
reviews on an annual basis whether
this remains appropriate. 
The Audit Committee reviews the
overall performance of the auditors
annually and approves their terms of
engagement and remuneration. The
Committee discussed the auditors’
proposed work plan prior to the
commencement of the audit of the
results for the year to 31 March 2006
and also reviews the non-audit work
carried out by KPMG Audit Plc 
(KPMG) to ensure that such services
do not impair their independence or
objectivity. KPMG may not be
appointed to undertake any non-audit
work without the approval of the
Committee if the cost of the work is
expected to exceed £50,000. 
The auditors are appointed by the
shareholders at the AGM to ensure
their independence. The lead audit
partner for the audit changed in the
year ended 31 March 2005. The Audit
Committee regularly discusses the
independence of the auditors and
whether there is a need to rotate
audit firms. Given the fact that the
lead audit partner is changed on a
regular basis and given the relative
size of BTG to that of KPMG, the Audit
Committee is presently satisfied that
KPMG is independent in its reporting
on the audit of the Group and rotation
of firms is not necessary.
At least twice a year, the Audit
Committee meets with the auditors in
the absence of the executive directors
and management.

Appointments to the Board
There should be a formal, rigorous
and transparent procedure for 
the appointment of new directors 
to the board.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE 
REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 
31 MARCH 2006
The Nomination Committee is chaired
by Sir Brian Fender and the
membership of the Committee and
their attendance at meetings is set
out in the table on page 25. The terms
of reference are available from the
Company or may be seen on the
Company’s website at
www.btgplc.com. 
The prime responsibilities of the
Nomination Committee are reviewing
the size and composition of the
Board; making recommendations 
to the Board on the appointment 
of executive and non-executive
directors, and their re-appointment
following retirement by rotation; and
for ensuring that succession planning
is in place. The Committee also
advises the Board on matters
generally relating to Board
appointments and meets as required
but at least twice a year. 
During the past year the Committee
has been involved in the appointment
of Christine Soden as CFO due to the
retirement of Rusi Kathoke in June
2005. Recently the Committee
commenced the search for a new
non-executive director since Malcolm
Coster will retire at the upcoming
AGM. In addition, the Committee has
evaluated the skills, knowledge and
experience of those on the Board in
light of the Group’s present and
planned strategic direction.
The Committee has employed 
external consultants to assist it 
in making the appointments. Prior 
to any appointments being made, 
the Committee prepares a full
description of the role, desired skills
and capabilities required for the
appointment. It interviews candidates
and produces a shortlist for 
a subsequent interview by all 
Board members. Following their
appointment the Committee ensures
that all new directors receive a full BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006   29

for the financial statements
The directors are responsible for
keeping proper accounting records
that disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Parent Company and
enable them to ensure that its
financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They have
general responsibility for taking such
steps as are reasonably open to them
to safeguard the assets of the Group
and to prevent and detect fraud and
other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the
maintenance and integrity of the
corporate and financial information
included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the UK governing the
preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors are responsible for
preparing the Directors’ Report and
the Group and Parent Company
financial statements, in accordance
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors
to prepare Group and Parent
Company financial statements for
each financial year. Under that law
the directors have elected to prepare
the Group financial statements in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by
the EU and have elected to prepare
the Parent Company financial
statements in accordance with UK
Accounting Standards. 
The Group financial statements are
required by law and IFRSs as adopted
by the EU to present fairly the financial
position and the performance of the
Group; the Companies Act 1985
provides in relation to such financial
statements that references in the
relevant part of that Act to financial
statements giving a true and fair 
view are references to their achieving
a fair presentation. 
The Parent Company financial
statements are required by law to
give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the Parent Company. 
In preparing each of the Group and
Parent Company financial statements,
the directors are required to: 
> Select suitable accounting policies
and then apply them consistently 
> Make judgements and estimates
that are reasonable and prudent 
> For the Group financial
statements, state whether they
have been prepared in accordance
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
> For the Parent Company financial
statements, state whether
applicable UK Accounting
Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the
Parent Company financial
statements 
> Prepare the financial statements
on the going concern basis unless
it is inappropriate to presume that
the Group and the Parent Company
will continue in business.

also made for the director to meet
with the heads of the various business
units for an in-depth briefing on the
areas in which the Company is
involved. A briefing on corporate
governance and directors’
responsibilities may be given and the
opportunity to attend external courses
is also available if required.
The CEO and CFO each have service
contracts containing a notice period of
one year . Non-executive directors
receive a letter of appointment for an
initial period of three years but, as with

Introduction and compliance
This report has been prepared by the
Remuneration Committee on behalf
of the Board in accordance with the
requirements of the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations
2002, and explains how the Company
has applied the principles of the
Combined Code in respect of
directors’ remuneration. 
In accordance with the regulations, 
a resolution inviting shareholders to
approve the report will be put to the
Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 
26 July 2006.
The following sections have been
subject to audit: directors’
emoluments, shareholdings, share
awards, long-term incentive schemes
and pensions.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the
“Committee”) has been established
by the Board, which has responsibility
for executive remuneration. The
Committee is chaired by Consuelo
Brooke and is comprised of
independent non-executive directors.
The membership of the Committee
and attendance at meetings is
detailed in the table on page 25. The
Committee’s full terms of reference
are available on the Group’s website
at www.btgplc.com or from the
Company on request.
The Chairman, CEO and CFO were
invited to attend parts of some
meetings and provide input as
required and the Company Secretary
or her deputy serves as secretary 
to the Committee.
The Committee’s principal terms of
reference are summarised as follows:
> To make recommendations to, and
determine on behalf of the Board,
remuneration packages for the
Chairman and each of the
executive directors in accordance
with current best practice
> To give advice and make
recommendations on the
framework and broad policy for 
all aspects of the remuneration 
of senior management who report
directly to the executive directors
and on the overall policy for 
total compensation for all 
other employees
> To determine policy and advise on
equity participation schemes,
employee share trust matters,
pensions and other benefits. 
Consultants to the Committee
The Committee has authority to
appoint such advisers as it sees fit.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP
advises the Committee on its
employee share schemes, long-term
incentive arrangements and market
levels of remuneration in comparator
companies. The firm also assists with
the total shareholder return (TSR)
performance measurement. The
Committee has also used Mercer
Human Resource Consulting for
executive remuneration advice. Other
than for the provision of advice as
detailed below, the firms do not have
any other connections with the Group.
The Committee has not formally
appointed any US advisers.
The Company also uses New Bridge
Street Consultants and Mercer to
advise on other matters including
employee share schemes and
pensions. In particular, Mercer has
provided extensive advice to the
Company during the year on pension
issues relating to the triennial
valuation of the defined benefit pension
scheme being carried out by Hewitt
Bacon & Woodrow, advisers to the
Scheme trustees. The Company also
uses Smart & Associates, specialist
US-based remuneration consultants,
for matters specific to the US
employment market. The Committee
believes that it is appropriate to use the
same advisers as the Company in most
circumstances to avoid duplication of
effort, and where appropriate ensures
independence through a review of their
recommendations.
A summary of matters considered 
at the Committee meetings since 
1 April 2005 and actions taken is: 
> Considering and setting the terms
of the remuneration package and
share awards, including the
special share award, for Christine
Soden on joining BTG as CFO BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006   31
> Reviewing total remuneration
packages for the CEO and CFO with
advice from external consultants
and putting forward proposals for
changes to the 2006 AGM
> Reviewing the structure and
setting the parameters and
objectives for the 2006/07 bonus
and LTIP awards for employees to
be applied from June 2006.
Remuneration policy
The policy for remuneration is that
the package offered should be
sufficient to attract, retain and
motivate executive directors and staff
of the quality and experience
required, but not more than is
necessary for this purpose. The
Company operates an annual bonus
scheme and long-term incentives,
both subject to demanding
performance conditions, to ensure
that variable pay comprises a
significant proportion of total
remuneration, particularly for more
senior employees. The Committee
considers that the targets set for the
different elements of performance-
related remuneration are appropriate
and demanding in the context of the
Company’s trading environment and
the business challenges it faces.
However the Committee keeps such
targets under regular review in order
to ensure they remain appropriate. 
Remuneration is reviewed annually
and seeks to target reward packages
around the median level for
companies of the size, market
capitalisation and sectors in which
the Company operates. There are
very few companies whose activities
are directly comparable to BTG’s so
the Committee and its advisers use a
number of surveys of the employment
market from which to obtain data. 
The remuneration package
The remuneration package comprises
fixed elements, being the base salary
and pension and other benefits, and
variable elements, being the annual
bonus and long-term incentive
arrangements. Employees of the
Group (including executive directors
but excluding non-executive
directors) are remunerated using the
policy described below. The
remuneration policy is established by
the Board on the recommendation of
the Committee. The intent will be to
move executive directors’
remuneration to being around 60%
fixed (base salary, benefits, pension)
and 40% variable.
Base salary: Base salary takes into
account the areas and level of
responsibility together with the
performance of the individual,
benchmarked against information
from independent sources and
consultants on market levels.
Salaries are reviewed annually by the
Committee and any increase for
directors has effect from 1 April in
each year. Effective from 1 April 2006,
Louise Makin’s salary will be
£339,048 and Christine Soden’s will
be £207,000. In addition to
considering external data, the
Committee also takes account of
general pay and employment
conditions elsewhere in the Group. 
Benefits and pension: Benefits
mainly comprise the provision of a car
allowance, medical benefits and
permanent health insurance. Louise
Makin also received a relocation
package, following her appointment,
to take account of her move from
Switzerland to the UK.
The Company closed its defined
benefit final salary pension scheme
on 31 May 2004. Subsequent to this
date, new employees may join at the
request of the Company. The scheme
enables members to retire at 60 (or
65 under certain instances) with a
maximum pension of two-thirds of
the average of the last three years’
base salary after 40 years service. For
benefits accrued up to 31 May 2004,
the pension is based on the final
year’s base salary. The Scheme also
offers lump sum death benefits equal
to four times base salary and
dependants’ pensions. 
The Company makes contributions 
to the Scheme based on the
recommendations of the Scheme
actuary. In the year to 31 March 2006
the Company made contributions of
18% of pensionable salary. Following
the triennial valuation this is expected
to reduce to 16.8%, as a result of
changes to benefit levels. Bonuses
payable to executive directors or
other staff are not pensionable. 
Following the simplification provisions
of the Finance Act 2004, as from 
1 April 2006 the Company and pension
fund trustees have decided to institute
a similar earnings cap to that
previously in place under HM Revenue
and Customs rules, based on the
current limit of £105,600, to be
increased annually by inflation (the
“BTG Cap”). It has also been agreed
that the Company will not compensate
executives for any additional tax
burden they suffer . Both the CEO and
CFO are members of the defined
benefit pension scheme but the
Company further contributes a fixed
percentage of each director’s salary
above the BTG Cap to alternative
pension arrangements of their choice.
The Company offers a group personal
pension scheme to new employees
and members of the existing final
salary scheme may elect to transfer
to this scheme. The Company
contributes a minimum of 3% and up
to 10% of base salary up to the BTG
Cap, depending on seniority and
levels of employee contributions 
to the scheme. The US subsidiary
runs a defined contribution scheme
for its staff.
Annual bonuses: The annual
incentive scheme applies to all
members of staff, including executive
directors. The intention of this bonus
is to link incentives more closely to
Group performance over the short to
medium-term. Bonuses are
calculated based on personal and
business performance. For the year
ended 31 March 2006 bonuses were
not allowed to exceed 50% of base
salary although, as described below,
the maximum award under the bonus
plans for the executive directors will
be increased to 100% of salary in 
the future. Half of the bonus earned
in the future will be deferred into
shares to be held for three years
which may be subject to forfeiture on
a time-prorated basis for directors
who leave the Company. The
Committee feels that the increase  32 BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
> remuneration report
continued
in bonus opportunity aligned with the
deferral into shares and forfeiture
provisions will provide a better
balance in the package for the
executive directors, and in conjunction
with the proposal for changes to 
long-term incentives will enable 
a market-competitive package to be
delivered to an executive team that
has now established its credentials
within BTG.
Bonuses for both Louise Makin 
and Christine Soden are payable 75%
for the achievement of business
performance and 25% for personal
performance. The level of bonus
payable is dependent on the 
degree to which the threshold 
target is exceeded. 
Objectives for Louise Makin in 
the year to 31 March 2006 included
the achievement of net revenue
targets (target: £29.5m; achieved:
£41.1m), further cost savings 
(target: £2.0m; achieved: £5.1m) 
and the implementation of the new
business strategy. Following the
appointment of Christine Soden in
July, objectives were set for her
which included the achievement of
the same revenue and cost savings
targets, setting and facilitating a
suitable commercialisation strategy
for Varisolve
®
, assisting in the 
Group strategy implementation and
securing and maintaining sound
financial practices and risk
management systems.
Following a review of personal and
Company performance during the year
the Committee decided that business
targets were exceeded and personal
targets met. A bonus of 50% of basic
salary will therefore be payable to each
executive director for the year ended
31 March 2006, the bonus for Christine
Soden will be prorated to reflect her
period of employment during the
financial year . Objectives for the
executive directors for 2007 include
targets around revenue achievement,
cost containment, strengthening the
pipeline and Varisolve
®
development.
Other employees and senior
managers were also eligible to
receive annual bonuses for the year
to 31 March 2006, ranging to a
maximum of 10% to 30% of base
salary dependent on seniority, and
subject to the achievement of both
business performance and personal
performance targets.
Long-term incentive arrangements:
Executive directors and senior
managers, together with all other
employees, are entitled to participate
in the Company’s share option and
sharesave schemes as operated from
time to time. The Company also
offered incentive plans with medium-
term targets for employees below
board level in both shares and cash.
During the year the Company has
been reviewing, with the help of its
advisers, short-, medium- and long-
term incentive arrangements for
executive directors and senior
management. This is to ensure that
the various elements contain the
correct balance between short-term
and long-term incentive
arrangements and also to align the
long-term interests of executive
directors and senior staff with those
of shareholders. 
Future incentive arrangements
The bonus and medium-term
incentive arrangements for employees
have been reviewed, with the aim of
delivering valuable incentives at 
a manageable cost to the Company.
The Committee approved the
proposals and the Company will
introduce the revised arrangements 
at the same time as the results of the
salary review in June 2006.
The Committee has given
consideration to the appropriateness
of the incentive schemes available for
the executive directors. The
Committee has taken advice on the
revised proposals for the long-term
incentives to be offered to the
executive directors, together with
proposed targets for their
shareholding levels, and proposals
will be put to the upcoming AGM, full
details of which are included with the
AGM notice. In summary the proposal
provides for a new Performance
Share Plan under which executive
directors may receive annual awards
of shares with a face value of up to
100% of base salary. Vesting of these
awards will be governed by
performance measured over three
years in relation to two performance
conditions. Vesting of 50% of the total
award will be dependent on the
Company’s TSR performance relative
to the FTSE SmallCap (excl.
Investment Trusts) index (the “Index”)
and 50% will be dependent on the
achievement of levels of cumulative
pre-tax profit, excluding R&D
investment (the “Profit”), each
measured over a three-year period
from grant.
(i) Performance against the Index
> No award will be paid if TSR
performance is below the Index
> 15% of the total award will vest 
if the TSR performance equals 
the Index
> 50% of the total award will vest 
for TSR performance equal to 30%
absolute out-performance of 
the Index
> Vesting between these points will
occur on a straight-line basis.
(ii) Cumulative Profit target
> No award will be paid if the Profit
is less than £30m
> 15% of the total award will vest 
if the Profit equals £30m
> 50% of the total award will vest 
if the Profit equals £60m  
> Vesting between these points will
occur on a straight-line basis.
These performance conditions have
been chosen as they take account of
the Company’s relative performance
as well as its strategic objectives. 
A final award of share options will be
made to reflect the critical nature of
the next three years in delivering the
Company’s new business strategy.
The maximum level of award will be
100% of salary. The awards to
executive directors under the Share
Option schemes will be subject to the
same performance conditions as the
Performance Share Plan. Awards
under the plans will be sourced by
purchasing shares in the market or
using new issued shares in the case
of options. BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006   33
External appointments
The Board believes that it may be beneficial to the Company for executive directors to hold non-executive directorships
outside the Group. Any such appointments are subject to approval by the Board and the director may retain any fees
payable. Louise Makin does not hold any outside directorships. Christine Soden was a non-executive director of Provalis
plc until she resigned from the Board on 30 November 2005. She received fees of £10,833 for the period from 1 July 2005.
Service contracts
The Company’s policy on directors’ service contracts is that, in line with the best practice provisions of the Code, they
should be terminable by the Company on a maximum of one year’s notice and contracts do not provide for predetermined
compensation in the event of termination. The Company may terminate the contracts of the executive directors with
immediate effect by making a payment in lieu of notice. Any payments made would be determined by reference to normal
contractual principles with mitigation being applied whenever relevant or appropriate.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts, but have letters of appointment for an initial period of three
years, which may be renewed by mutual agreement, normally for a maximum of two further three-year terms. The terms
of appointment do not contain any contractual provisions regarding a notice period or the right to receive compensation in
the event of early termination.
Details of the directors’ contracts and letters of appointment are as set out below.

Non-executive directors’ fees
The Chairman, in consultation with the executive directors, is responsible for proposing changes to the non-executive
directors’ fees. In proposing such fees, account is taken of similar fees paid to non-executive directors in listed companies
within the Group’s listing sector and of similar size. The decision on fee changes is taken by the Board as a whole.
Individual non-executive directors do not take part in discussions on their remuneration. 
Non-executive directors’ fees are designed to align fees to the amount of work carried out by each person. Fees payable
are as follows:
> The Chairman’s fee is £75,000 pa
> Other non-executive directors receive the following:
> An annual fee of £17,000
> An attendance allowance of £2,000 per meeting for an expected seven meetings per annum, each of up to two days
duration. This allowance also covers all committee meetings and special sub-committees of the Board to review
individual projects within that two-day period
> An attendance allowance of £1,000 per meeting of the Audit, Remuneration, Nomination Committees and any
special sub-committees, for members of those committees if they take place outside the two-day time period set
aside for Board meetings
> An annual fee of £6,000 for the chairman of the Audit Committee and the Senior Independent Director.
Non-executive directors do not receive benefits or pension contributions from the Group and do not participate in any
Group incentive scheme.  34 BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006

Rusi Kathoke left the Scheme on 14 December 2004. He transferred part of his accrued benefits out of the Fund. The
disclosures above relate to the deferred benefits remaining in the Fund. No benefits accrued in the Fund during the year .
(3)
The increase in the pension figures equals the benefits as at 31 March 2006 less the equivalent benefits as at 
31 March 2005 disclosed in the 2005 Annual Report and Accounts.
(4)
This is the transfer value as at 31 March 2006 less the transfer value as at 31 March 2005 less the contributions paid
by the director.
(5)
This is the transfer value as at 31 March 2006 of the increase in the benefits (excluding inflation) during the year less
the contributions paid by the director in the year.
The Group makes payments to the defined benefit final salary pension scheme on the advice of actuaries. At the request
of the Company, Christine Soden was invited to join the Scheme on her appointment and, as with Louise Makin and most
other UK members of the Scheme, currently makes an employee contribution of 7% of pensionable earnings.
Pensionable earnings comprise only base salary. 
The directors are affected by the Inland Revenue imposed “Earnings Cap” and, after 6 April 2006, the BTG Cap
equivalent. As part of her arrangements, Louise Makin is making additional pension contributions to a separate
Executive Pension Scheme to which the Company made employer contributions of £13,436 during the year (04/05:
£8,393). As stated above, the Company also made a further cash contribution of £30,960 (04/05: £13,836) to bring its total
contribution to 20% of salary above the Earnings Cap. As part of her arrangements, Christine Soden is to make
additional pension contributions to a SIPP to which the Company will make employer contributions of £7,080 for the year
under review, being equal to a contribution of 10% of salary above the Earnings Cap.

During the year Louise Makin purchased a further 5,031 shares, Christine Soden purchased 7,300 shares and Consuelo
Brooke purchased 22,500 shares.
Louise Makin and Christine Soden have a beneficial interest in ordinary shares of the Company by direct holdings and by
virtue of their entitlements in the Company’s employee share option schemes. As employees of the Group, they also have
an interest in any unallocated shares held on behalf of all employees in the BTG Employee Share Trust. The non-executive
directors are not entitled to participate in any of the Company’s employee share schemes.
Company share schemes
The Company has a number of share schemes open to all eligible employees of the Group, including the executive
directors. It also has an employee share trust, the BTG Employee Share Trust, which holds shares for the general benefit
of all employees, including executive directors, who will eventually become legally entitled to them. 
Share option schemes
These schemes are open to all employees, including executive directors, whether based in the UK or overseas. All the
options are exercisable between three and ten years from grant as long as certain performance criteria have been met. 
No payment is made for the grant of an option. All options are granted at an exercise price equal to the closing 
mid-market price on the date of issue. 
For awards prior to September 2001, the main exercise criteria were that the Company’s share price had grown faster
than the FTSE SmallCap Index of companies over a period of at least three years since the grant of the option and 
that there had been an improvement in the earnings of the Company over a period of at least three years beginning with
the year in which the option was granted. There are a number of grants outstanding at exercise prices in the range 254.4
pence to 1,142.7 pence per share with these exercise criteria. 
For awards made on or after September 2001, the main exercise criteria are that the Company’s share price has grown
faster than the average of the FTSE techMARK All-share Index and BTG’s total receipts (revenues and equity realisations)
in a relevant period are at least 130% of those for the financial year prior to the date of grant. If both criteria have not 
been met at the vesting date, the options will lapse. The Committee, with advice from New Bridge Street Consultants, 
is responsible for assessing whether the relevant performance conditions have been achieved. There are a number of
grants outstanding under this scheme at exercise prices in the range 90.0 pence to 620.3 pence per share with these
exercise criteria. The FTSE SmallCap Index may be used as a performance measure for future awards.
The Company also operates a UK tax-unapproved share option scheme that is capable of being operated to grant options
over issued shares to any employees, other than executive directors. The performance conditions are similar to those for
awards made after September 2001 referred to above. There are a number of grants outstanding under this scheme at
exercise prices in the range 75.4 pence to 136.5 pence per share.
Although previously retesting was permitted for option grants, no retesting has been allowed for grants of options made
after 1 June 2005 under any share option plan. If a director or other employee should leave the Company but be deemed 
a ‘good leaver’ under the share scheme rules, all options granted after 1 June 2005 are subject to a pro-rata reduction
based on the number of months employed compared with the three-year vesting period for the option.
The maximum value of grant under the Company share option schemes, in any one year, may not exceed 300% of salary. 
Restricted share scheme
The Company has established a restricted share scheme for the purpose of making conditional awards to selected
employees below Board level. Awards have been granted under this scheme at the discretion of the Board on the
recommendation of the Committee. As with share options, all awards granted after 1 June 2005 are subject to a pro-rata
reduction based on the number of months employed compared with the vesting period for the award.
Sharesave scheme
The Company operates Inland Revenue-approved save as you earn schemes, open to all eligible UK employees, including
executive directors, who open an approved savings contract to enable them to purchase shares in the Company. The options
are exercisable after three years at a price not less than 80% of the market value of the shares at the date of grant. BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006   37
Stock purchase plan
The Company operates a US-style stock purchase plan for its US employees, open to all US employees who open an
approved savings contract to enable them to purchase shares in the Company. The options are exercisable after two years
at a price not less than 85% of the market value of the shares at the date of grant.

The executive directors are entitled to participate in the Company’s share schemes on the same basis as all other
employees of the Group. The performance conditions to which directors’ entitlements to share options are subject are
summarised on page 36. The same performance conditions apply for each director. The performance conditions were
chosen in order to further align the interests of option holders with shareholders. The Committee, with advice from New
Bridge Street Consultants, is responsible for assessing whether the relevant performance conditions have been achieved. 
Further to the share awards shown above, as part of their compensation at the time of joining the Company, it was agreed
that Louise Makin and Christine Soden should receive special awards under section 9.4.2(2) of the UK Listing Authority
Listing Rules, which permits awards under such circumstances. The awards and performance conditions are set out below:
Name Date of award Number of shares Performance conditions
Louise Makin 26 May 2005 125,000 > 50,000 released on third anniversary of appointment if still
employed by the Group
> 75,000 released if the Group achieves a profit before tax in 
the two years ended 31 March 2008. The average share price 
in six months to 31 March 2008 must also exceed 150p. The full
award is released only if the average price in that six month
period exceeds 300p.
Christine Soden 1 July 2005 75,000 > Shares released if the Group achieves a profit before tax in the
two years ended 31 March 2008. The average share price in six
months to 31 March 2008 must also exceed 150p. The full
award is released only if the average price in that six month
period exceeds 300p.
The Committee will not make amendments to the arrangements established for either of these awards that are to directors’
advantage without seeking the consent of shareholders. No payment under this long-term incentive scheme is pensionable.
The middle-market price of an ordinary share on 31 March 2006 was 205.5p. During the year the share price ranged from 
a low of 95.5p to a high of 231.25p. 38 BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
Total shareholder return
The performance of the Company’s ordinary shares compared with the FTSE SmallCap Index (the “Index”) for the five-year
period ended on 31 March 2006 is shown in the graph below.
This graph shows the value at 31 March 2006 of £100 invested in BTG plc on 31 March 2001 compared with the value 
of £100 invested in the FTSE SmallCap (excl. Investment Trusts) Index. The other points plotted are the values at
intervening financial year ends.
The Company operates in a rather unusual market so it is not easy to find a specific index for comparison. However, 
the Board has chosen the Index as a comparator for future awards under its share option scheme as it believes that it gives
shareholders a reasonable comparison with the total shareholder return (TSR) of other equity investments in companies 
of a broadly similar size across all sectors. The TSR performance has been measured by New Bridge Street Consultants.

We have audited the Group and
parent company financial statements
(the ‘‘financial statements’’) of BTG
plc for the year ended 31 March 2006
which comprise the Group Income
Statement, the Group and Parent
Company Balance Sheets, the Group
Cash Flow Statement, the Group
Statement of Recognised Income and
Expense and the related notes. These
financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also
audited the information in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report that
is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the
Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might
state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditor’s report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other
than the Company and the Company’s
members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the
opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of
directors and auditors 
The directors’ responsibilities for
preparing the Annual Report and the
Group financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
EU, and for preparing the parent
company financial statements and the
Directors’ Remuneration Report in
accordance with applicable law and UK
Accounting Standards (UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set
out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities on page 29.
Our responsibility is to audit the
financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to
be audited in accordance with relevant
legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to
whether the financial statements give
a true and fair view and whether the
financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and, as regards
the Group financial statements, Article
4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report
to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the Directors’
Report is consistent with the financial
statements. The information given in
the Directors’ Report includes that
specific information presented in the
Operating and Financial Review that is
cross referenced from the Business
Review section of the Directors’
Report. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the Company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit,
or if information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate
Governance Statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the nine
provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined
Code specified for our review by the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider
whether the Board’s statements on
internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures. 
We read the other information
contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with
the audited financial statements. We
consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial
statements. Our responsibilities do
not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance
with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued 
by the Auditing Practices Board. An

1 General information
BTG plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The
consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2006 comprise the results of the Company and its subsidiaries
(together referred to as the “Group”) and the Group’s interest in associates and jointly controlled entities.
The financial statements were approved for issue by the Board on 24 May 2006.
2 Significant accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation and statement of compliance
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”). The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance
with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 75 to 78.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group 
financial statements and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2004 for the purposes of the transition to Adopted IFRSs.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 32.
The Group has applied the following optional exemptions provided by IFRS 1 from full retrospective application of IFRS accounting policies:
(i) Business combinations – the provisions of IFRS 3 have been applied from 1 April 2004. The net carrying value of goodwill at 31 March 2004
under the previous accounting policies has been deemed to be the cost at 1 April 2004.
(ii) Property, plant and equipment – where assets have previously been revalued, the revalued amount at 1 April 2004 has been deemed to be
the cost at 1 April 2004.
(iii) Cumulative translation differences arising on consolidation of overseas subsidiaries are required to be held in a separate reserve. This
reserve has been deemed to be nil at 1 April 2004.
(iv) Share-based payments – the provisions of IFRS 2 have been applied to all share option grants made since 7 November 2002 that had not
vested as at 1 January 2005.
An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Group 
is provided in note 33, which also includes the balance sheet at 31 March 2005 showing the impact of the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 in 2005.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for investments classified as available-for-sale, pensions and 
share-based payments.
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies approved by the Board and described below.
(b) Basis of preparation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are
exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements
from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006   45
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
(b) Basis of preparation (continued)
(ii) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. The
consolidated financial statements include the Group’s proportionate share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity-
accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of
losses exceeds the carrying value of its interest in an associate, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and no further losses are recognised
except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate.
(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in
preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are
eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to
the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
(c) Foreign currency
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date the
fair value was determined.
(ii) Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling
at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at rates
approximating to the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are
recognised directly in the translation reserve.
(iii) Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to the translation reserve. They are
released into the income statement upon disposal of the investment.
(d) Property, plant & equipment
(i) Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses (see accounting policy 2 (i)). 
(ii) Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis to write assets down to their residual value at the following annual rates:
Leasehold improvements 10-50% Furniture and equipment 10-20%
Computers 33% 
Depreciation is not charged until the asset is brought into use. The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually. 
(iii) Assets in the course of construction
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until brought into use. 46 BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
> notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
(e) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on the acquisition 
of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. Goodwill arising prior to 1 April 2004 is recognised at deemed cost. In respect of business
acquisitions that have occurred since 1 April 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value 
of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for
impairment (see accounting policy 2 (i)). In respect of associates, the carrying value of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the
investment in the associate.
(ii) Research and development
Research and development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. Development expenditure 
is capitalised when the criteria for recognising an asset are met, usually when a regulatory filing has been made in a major market and
approval is considered highly probable. Property, plant and equipment used for research and development is depreciated in accordance with 
the Group’s policy.
(iii) Intangible assets – patents and other intellectual property rights
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses (see accounting policy 2 (i)). Cost includes the cost of
obtaining patent protection for intellectual property rights (IPR), the acquisition of patents and the costs of the internal patent attorney specific
to obtaining patent protection. Income from patents is derived through licensing and other agreements.
Expenditure on IPR is amortised in a manner calculated to write off the cost, on a straight-line basis, over the effective life of the underlying
patent or other IPR, usually about 20 years. In the event that a patent is abandoned or is considered to have suffered impairment in value
before the expiry of its granted life, the balance of unamortised expenditure is written off immediately.
Expenditure subsequent to the initial acquisition of intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits
embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
(iv) Intangible assets – computer software
Computer software is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses (see accounting policy 2 (i)). 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over three years to write the assets down to their residual value.
(f) Investments
Investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group, classified as being available-for-sale, are stated at fair value, with any resultant
gain or loss being recognised directly in equity, except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items such as debt securities,
foreign exchange gains and losses which are taken to the income statement. When these investments are no longer recognised as assets, the
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in the income statement. Where these investments are interest-
bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement.
(g) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at cost less impairment losses (see accounting policy 2 (i)).
(h) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part
of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006   47
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
(i) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than deferred tax assets (see accounting policy 2 (o)), are reviewed at each balance sheet
date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment in value. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is
estimated (see accounting policy 2 (i)).
For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is
estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. In the
case of investments, an impairment is deemed to arise when any diminution is considered permanent. Impairment losses are recognised in the
income statement.
Goodwill was tested for impairment at 1 April 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, even though no indication of impairment existed.
Intangible assets are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date. Such assets are also tested for impairment whenever there are
indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Any impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale asset has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective evidence that the
asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in equity is recognised in the income statement. The amount of the
cumulative loss that is recognised in the income statement is the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any
impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale is not reversed through the income
statement. If the fair value of an investment classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event
occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement, the impairment loss shall be reversed, with the amount of the
reversal recognised in the income statement.
In respect of other assets, impairment losses are not reversed.
(j) Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with in the same manner as payments to defined contribution
schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
(ii) Defined benefit plan
For the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with
actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. The assumptions used to determine the valuation are shown in note 22.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside the income statement and
presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits have already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line
basis over the average period until the benefits vest.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, reduced by the
fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds
and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Assets of the pension scheme are held separately from the Group’s assets.  48 BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006

2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
(j) Employee benefits (continued)
(iii) Share-based payments
The Group applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ from 1 April 2004 (transition date). In accordance with the transition
provisions of IFRS 1, IFRS 2 has been applied to all share-based grants made to employees after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as of 
1 January 2005.
The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company, subject to certain criteria. The fair value of options
granted is recognised as an expense of employment in the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is
measured at the date of grant and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair
value of the options granted is measured using a binomial lattice model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options
were granted. The amount recognised as an expense in any year is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest. However 
if share options fail to vest due to share prices not achieving the designated performance threshold for vesting, no such adjustment takes place.
(k) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
A charge for restructuring costs is taken to the income statement for restructuring when the Group has approved a detailed and formal
restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
(l) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
(m) Revenue recognition
Revenue from licence agreements is credited to the income statement on an accruals basis based on royalty periods completed in the financial
year. Up-front, non-refundable licence down payments where the Group has met all its obligations are credited to the income statement on
signature of the relevant agreement. Other conditional payments are credited to the income statement as the Group becomes entitled to them,
usually on the achievement of specific technical or regulatory milestones stipulated in the agreement.
A “paid-up” licence typically involves a fixed one-off payment by the licensee for freedom from suit by BTG rather than ongoing milestone or
royalty payments. Where there is no ongoing obligation on the Group, the receipt is credited to income when the Group becomes entitled to it. 
If the Group has continuing obligations, such as to maintain the patents, revenue is recognised in line with the ongoing performance obligation.
Outright sales or assignments of IPR are treated as disposals of non-current assets.
(n) Expenses
(i) Revenue sharing
Revenue sharing costs represent amounts due to licensors or assignees of technology upon recognition by BTG of amounts due from a
licensee. They are recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the individual agreements held with respect to the relevant technology in
line with revenue recognition.
(ii) Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease
incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
(iii) Financing costs
Financing costs comprise interest income less interest payable during the year, calculated using the effective interest rate method. BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006   49
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
(o) Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided
for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of
deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying value of assets and liabilities, using tax rates
enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can
be utilised.
(p) Segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing particular products or services (business segment),
or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment (geographical segment), which is subject to risks and rewards
that are different from those of other segments.
(q) BTG Employee Share Trust
The results of the Group include the costs of the BTG Employee Share Trust, which are expensed within the financial statements of the Trust 
as incurred.
(r) Accounting standards issued but not adopted
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ was issued in August 2005. It revises and enhances previous disclosures required by IAS 32 and 
IAS 30 ‘Disclosures in the Financial Statements of Banks and similar Financial Institutions’. It is effective for annual periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2007. The adoption of IFRS 7 will have no impact upon the results of BTG.
3 Business and geographical segments
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s business and geographical segments with the primary format, business segments,
being based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable
basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly income-earning assets and revenue, interest-bearing loans, borrowings and expenses, and corporate
assets and expenses.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than
one period.
Business segments
The Group comprises the following main business segments:
> Medical innovation – The acquisition, development and commercialisation of pharmaceutical and other medical technologies.
> Technology commercialisation – The acquisition and licensing of early-stage technology outside the medical area. 50 BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
> notes to the consolidated financial statements

3 Business and geographical segments (continued)
Geographical segments
Medical innovations and technology commercialisation segments are managed on a worldwide basis, but operate with customers in four
principal geographical areas, being US, UK, Europe (excluding UK) and other regions.
In presenting information on the basis of geographical segments, segment revenue is based on the geographical location of customers.
Segment assets are based on the geographical location of the assets.

Other investments comprise non-current equity investments which are available-for-sale that are recorded at fair value at each balance sheet
date. For investments traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by reference to the relevant stock exchange price. The fair value
of unlisted investments is estimated to be the lower of cost and the valuation following the latest round of equity funding.
Where the fair value of an available-for-sale asset is impaired, the impairment charge is recognised in the income statement together with any
amounts recycled from the fair value reserve (see note 21). These impairments initially arise from the prolonged or significant declines in the
fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent to which any further declines in fair value are immediately taken to the
income statement.

21 Capital and reserves (continued)
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations
that are not integral to the operations of the Company.
Fair value reserve
The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments. If an investment suffers impairment
due to a prolonged or significant decline in the fair value below acquisition cost, its share of the reserve is recycled to the income statement and
any further declines in fair value of that investment are no longer charged to the reserve but immediately taken to the income statement.
22 Retirement benefit schemes
Defined benefit scheme
A funded defined benefit final salary pension scheme is in operation for all eligible staff of the Group. Scheme funds are administered by
trustees independently of the Group. Under the scheme employees are entitled to retirement benefits accruing at the rate of one-sixtieth or
one-eightieth of salary dependent on the employee’s personal level of contribution, with a maximum of 40 years’ service. No other post-
retirement benefits are provided.
Due to the fall in equity markets, lower returns and higher longevity in the past few years, the financial position of the scheme had weakened. 
As a consequence of this, the defined benefit scheme was closed to new entrants as from 1 June 2004, although under certain conditions new
employees may still join at the request of the Company. A new defined contribution scheme was offered to employees who joined the Company
after 1 June 2004 which has now been replaced by a group personal pension plan. At the same time, a review of benefits was carried out.
Following this review, employees were offered the opportunity to increase their contributions to 7% in order to retain the previous accrual rate of a
sixtieth or to maintain their contribution rate at 5%, which will result in their future accrual rate reducing to an eightieth. The pension payable is
calculated on the average of the last three years’ salary rather than final year’s salary as previously. Past benefits are unaffected by this change.
A full independent actuarial valuation of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation scheme is carried out every
three years by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method. The most recent valuation was carried out as at 1 April 2005 by Sarah
Kenyon, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries. This valuation is updated annually using similar criteria and the present value of the defined
benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost are calculated.
During the year ended 31 March 2006 the Group made a special funding contribution of £2m to the defined benefit pension scheme. The Group
has agreed with the trustees of the pension fund that further special contributions will be made over the next six years of approximately 
£2.2m pa in order to eliminate the deficit on an IAS 19 basis.

Expected return on plan assets (3.7) (3.9)
Past service cost – 0.1
Curtailment cost (0.6) (0.9)
Settlement cost – (0.2)
0.9 0.9
The cost has been included in administrative expenses. Actuarial losses of £1.6m (04/05: £0.3m gain) have been reported in the statement of
recognised income and expense. Cumulative actuarial losses from 1 April 2004 reported in the statement of recognised income and expense
are £1.3m (04/05: £0.3m gain).
The overall expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average based on the actual plan assets held and the respective expected return on
separate asset classes. The expected rate of return on equities is based on the expected median return over the long-term. The expected rate
of return on bonds is measured directly from actual market yields for UK gilts and corporate bonds. Other assets include cash balances and
net current assets. The expected rate of return on these assets is measured directly from short-term market interest rates.
The actual return on scheme assets for the year was £8.4m (04/05: £4.7m).

23 Share-based payments
Share options
The Group makes awards under an equity-settled share option plan that entitles employees to purchase shares in the Company. Grants have
been made to employees on a number of occasions under the current plan since it was set up in 1998, subject to amendments made to the plan
in 2001 and 2005. In accordance with these grants options are exercisable at the market price of the shares on the date of grant but may only
be exercised upon the attainment of certain performance criteria. The vesting period is generally three years. If the options remain unexercised
after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before
the options vest, unless the conditions under which they leave are such that they are considered to be a ‘good leaver’; in which case their
options remain exercisable for a limited period of time. For further details see the Remuneration Report on pages 30 to 38.
Option pricing
For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the share-based compensation charge, a binomial lattice option pricing model has been used.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows:
31 March 31 March
2006 2005
Risk-free interest rate 3.7%-5.1% 3.7%-5.1%
Dividend yield Nil Nil
Volatility 59%-85% 59%-85%

– Share option schemes 5 years 5 years
– Sharesave schemes 3.25 years 3.25 years
– Stock purchase plan 2.25 years 2.25 years
– Restricted share awards 2 years 2 years
– Section 13.13A awards 3 years 3 years
Weighted average fair value for option grants in the year 88.6p 63.8p
Weighted average fair value for sharesave grants in the year 118.0p 61.4p
Weighted average fair value for stock purchase plan grants in the year 120.9p 58.4p
Weighted average fair value for restricted share grants in the year 151.4p 100.9p
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility (calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options or
restricted shares), adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
Share options are granted under a service condition, a non-market condition and a market condition. Such conditions are not taken into account
in the grant date fair value measurement of the services received. 
Restricted shares are awarded to certain key management under a service condition and a non-market performance condition. There are no
market conditions related to the restricted share awards.
The movement in options to subscribe for shares under the Group’s share plans is shown in the tables below.

Restricted share awards
The Company established a restricted share scheme for the purpose of making awards to selected members of senior management below
Board level. The vesting period is generally two years. Awards are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the awards vest, unless the
conditions under which they leave are such that they are considered to be a ‘good leaver’; in which case their award is released following their
departure. For further details see the Remuneration Report on pages 30 to 38. BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006   65

24 BTG Employee Share Trust
The Group includes an employee share trust, the BTG Employee Share Trust (the Trust), which was established in Guernsey in 1992. It holds shares
for the general benefit of all employees who will eventually become legally entitled to them. At 31 March 2006 the Trust held 1,505,966 shares in
BTG plc and a further 12,596 shares in Torotrak plc. The Trust may distribute these shares to employees of the Group on the recommendation of
the Company. These distributions may be as a result of awards under the Restricted Share Scheme or the 2003 Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
In the past the Trust has also distributed shares in the form of bonuses and under the Group’s old profit-sharing scheme.
At 31 March 2006 the Trust has 445,000 shares set aside under the Restricted Share Scheme and a further 381,443 awarded under the 2003
Unapproved Share Option Scheme. The balance of the shares are being used to cover options issued under the Company’s other share 
option schemes.

27 Financial instruments
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, short-term deposits and various items such as trade debtors and creditors which arise
directly from operations. In addition a number of debt and equity investments, both quoted and unquoted as shown in notes 16 and 17, are held
in technology-based companies.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, investment risk and foreign currency risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to place surplus cash resources on fixed-term deposits, for varying periods ranging from one to six months, to the extent
that cash flow can be reasonably predicted. This policy has not changed during the financial year and no change is anticipated.
Investment risk
It is, on occasion, deemed appropriate to take equity stakes in early-stage companies utilising BTG technology as part of the overall licensing
arrangement and small loans may be granted to these companies to further technology development. These investments will be realised at an
appropriate time in the development cycle. Regular reports are made to the Board on the status of investments. These investments form part
of BTG’s overall technology portfolio and do not materially affect liquidity.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has two overseas subsidiaries, the revenues and the expenses of which are denominated in US dollars. As a result the Group’s
sterling income statement and balance sheet may be affected by movements in US dollar: sterling exchange rates.
Approximately 85% of the Group’s revenue is denominated in US dollars with the remainder split between sterling, euros, yen and other
currency. The majority of the Group’s operating expenses are in sterling. Where possible, anticipated foreign currency operating expenses 
are matched to foreign currency revenues. The excess exposure over and above this natural hedge, to the extent that cash flows are
predictable, is managed for all foreign currencies using forward contracts.
Fair values
The fair values, together with the carrying values shown in the balance sheet, are as follows:
Carrying Carrying

27 Financial instruments (continued)
Estimation of fair values
The following summarises the methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table.
Investments in associates
These are recorded in the balance sheet as the Group’s share of total recognised gains and losses on an equity-accounted basis for the period
the entity was an associate. This value is considered to be a fair approximation to fair value.
Other investments
These comprise both listed and unlisted investments available for sale. The figure recorded in the balance sheet is considered to be the fair value.
Trade receivables, trade payables, cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts
Trade payables and receivables have a remaining life of less than one year so their value recorded in the balance sheet is considered to be 
a fair approximation of fair value. The bank overdrafts are short-term and so the balance sheet value is considered to be equivalent to fair value.
28 Operating leases
Total non-cancellable operating lease rentals on leases terminating in the following periods are payable as follows:
31 March 31 March
2006 2005
£m £m
Within one year – 0.1
Between two and five years 8.2 7.8
After five years 0.7 4.4
8.9 12.3
The Group leases offices in both the UK and USA. The UK head office lease runs until 2013 with a break in 2009. Lease rentals are reviewed
every five years to reflect market rentals. The US lease runs until 2011 with no interim rent reviews.
During the year the Group surrendered its lease on its offices in Denham and signed a revised lease on its manufacturing site at Wrexham, UK.
Under the new agreement the Group may terminate this lease with a maximum payment of 12 months’ rent.
29 Other financial commitments
The Group has entered into agreements with a number of early-stage companies and funds. At 31 March 2006 the Group is committed to invest
£2.9m under these agreements.
As with any business whose core assets are intellectual property, the Group will from time to time resort to litigation or threats of litigation, 
or other legal processes, to defend its rights. Litigation costs are regarded as a cost of doing business and will vary from year to year. In the
current year the Group incurred £2.9m in litigation costs (04/05: £2.6m).
The Company has entered into an agreement to guarantee payments under the lease of its US subsidiary.
30 Related parties
Identity of related parties
The Group had a related-party relationship with its subsidiaries (see note 2 (b)), its associates (see note 2 (b)) and its directors. During the year 
the Group invested a further £0.7m in its associated companies (see note 16). No dividends were received from associates in the years ended 
31 March 2005 or 2006.
Key management personnel are considered to be the directors and their remuneration is disclosed within the Remuneration Report on 
pages 30 to 38. 68 BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006

32 Accounting estimates and judgements
Management and the Audit Committee discussed and agreed the selection, application and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting policies
and the estimates used in the preparation of the accounts.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Note 27 explains the basis for estimating the fair value of listed and unlisted investments. 
Carrying value of assets in the course of construction
Assets in the course of construction comprise a manufacturing site in Wrexham, UK, for the Group’s Varisolve
®
product. This asset is held at
cost and will not be depreciated until brought into use.
Pension assumptions
Note 22 details the key actuarial assumptions used to establish the pension funding position. These are the best estimates chosen based on
historic experience and future expectations. Should the discount rate used to establish scheme liabilities or the long-term expected rate of
return on investment vary significantly then the pension fund valuation would be impacted.
Carrying value of patents and other IPR
Patents and other IPR with a carrying value of £6.6m are included in the accounts. BTG carries out bi-annual portfolio reviews to establish the
economic value of each technology in the patent portfolio. If the economic value of a technology is believed to lower than the carrying value, the
carrying value is reduced accordingly. The economic value is based on estimated future income potential, taking into account technical and
commercial risks. The tests require an estimation of future marketability or value-in-use. There is a risk that should these estimations require
significant downward revision, there would be a material adverse impact on the income statement in any one year. BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006   69
33 Explanation of transition to IFRS
As stated in note 2 (a), these are the Group’s first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The accounting policies set out in note 2 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006, the
comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005 and in the preparation of an opening IFRS
balance sheet as at 1 April 2004 (the Group’s date of transition).
In preparing its opening balance sheet, the Group has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance
with its old basis of accounting (UK GAAP). An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the Group’s financial
position, financial performance and cash flows is set out in the following tables and the notes that accompany the tables.

33 Explanation of transition to IFRS (continued)
Summary and description of significant IFRS adjustments
The Group has made a number of changes to the presentation of the accounts, in accordance with IAS 1, in addition to transition changes to the
financial results. Presentational changes include a different analysis of provisions and the separation of reserve adjustments for foreign
exchange and the fair value of investments.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with existing Group accounting policies with certain amendments required 
in order to comply with the requirements of IFRS. The existing policies are as published in the annual accounts of the Group for the year 
ended 31 March 2005. The principal adjustments made in order to transition the Group’s financial statements from UK GAAP to IFRS are
explained below.
1) Scope of consolidation of subsidiaries
The Group now consolidates all investments where its holding exceeds 50% as required by IAS 27. In the past the Company has elected to apply
a true and fair override and treat certain such holdings as investments held exclusively with a view for subsequent resale. 
2) Accounting for associates
The Group equity accounts all investments where the Group’s holding is between 20% and 50%, recognising the Group’s share of profits and
losses and net assets within the Group accounts, in accordance with IAS 28. Under UK GAAP, BTG applied a true and fair override and
accounted for investments in a number of early-stage companies at cost or impaired value in the balance sheet on the basis that they were part
of a venture capital portfolio. 
3) Other investments
The Company has elected to treat investments where the Group owns less than 20% of the investee company’s share capital as available for
sale. In accordance with IAS 39, such investments are adjusted to fair value at each balance sheet date and any movement in value taken
through the statement of recognised income and expense. Where an impairment of value has occurred, the difference between cost and fair
value will be reflected in the income statement. On disposal, the difference between sale proceeds and carrying amount will be reflected in the
income statement and the cumulative change in fair value recycled from reserves through the income statement. 
4) Business combinations and goodwill
IFRS 3 prohibits the amortisation of goodwill generated from business combinations. The standard requires that goodwill should be carried at
cost subject to annual impairment reviews. Under the transitional arrangements, IFRS 1 permits the Company to apply IFRS 3 from the date of
transition and does not require the restatement of all previous business combinations. The Company has taken advantage of this option.
In accordance with IFRS 3, negative goodwill on consolidation is credited to reserves and is no longer reflected in a capital reserve. 74 BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
33 Explanation of transition to IFRS (continued)
Summary and description of significant IFRS adjustments (continued)
5) Employee benefits
Under IAS 19, the Company is required to recognise the surplus or deficit and cost of its defined benefit pension scheme within the balance
sheet and income statement rather than just in the notes to the accounts. The Company has elected to recognise any actuarial gains and losses
in full immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense, as allowed by IAS 19 “Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and
Disclosures”, as amended and subsequently endorsed by the EU after the transition date.
Under UK GAAP, the charge to the profit and loss account for the defined benefit pension scheme was based on an actuarial calculation and
represents a regular cost, allowing for any actuarial surplus or deficit, so as to allocate pension costs of employees over their expected future
working lifetime. 
The actuarial valuation of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme at 31 March 2005 produced a deficit of £10.1m (1 April 2004: £10.9m). 
As a result of the Group’s transition to IFRS, the net impact on reserves with respect to employee benefit arrangements was a reduction of
£10.1m at 31 March 2005 (1 April 2004: £10.5m). 
6) Share-based payments
The share option and restricted share schemes allow Group employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of options granted and
restricted shares awarded are recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant
or award date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to them. The fair value of the options
and awards granted is measured using a binomial lattice model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options and
awards were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options and awards that vest,
except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the Company has recognised a charge to income representing the fair value of outstanding employee share options
and restricted share awards. The fair value has been calculated using the binomial lattice model and is charged to income over the relevant
option vesting periods, adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of vesting. The charge includes all options and awards granted since 
7 November 2002, but not vested at 1 January 2005, in accordance with IFRS 2.
7) Income taxes
IAS 12 requires the separate disclosure of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the Group’s balance sheet. Deferred tax assets are only
recognised to the extent to which they are expected to be utilised in the near future. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on the fair value of
equity adjustments.
8) Computer software
Under IAS 38, computer software should be capitalised under intangible assets unless it is part of the actual operating system. Certain assets
have been reclassified accordingly.

as at 31 March 2006 76 BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
1 Basis of preparation
BTG plc’s Company balance sheet has been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
applicable UK accounting standards. The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are
considered material in relation to the Company’s balance sheet.
As permitted by s 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Company is not presented in this Annual Report. As
permitted by FRS 1 ‘Cash Flow Statements’ no cash flow statement for the Company has been included on the grounds that the Group includes
the Company in its own published consolidated financial statements. As permitted by FRS 8 no related-party disclosures for the Company have
been included.
2 Accounting policies
In these financial statements, the following new standards have been adopted for the first time: FRS 20 ‘Share-based Payments’ and FRS 21
‘Events after the balance sheet date’. The effect of the adoption of FRS 20 is set out in note 10. The adoption of FRS 21 had no effect on the
Company’s profit or assets.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 25 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ not to prepare a financial
instruments note as the information is available in the published financial statements of the Group. The adoption of FRS 25 had no effect on the
Company’s profit or assets.
FRS 26 ‘Financial Instruments: Measurement’ sets out the requirements for measurement recognition and derecognition of financial
instruments. The adoption of FRS 26 has had no effect on the Company’s profit or net assets. Where the Company enters into financial
guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance
arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such
time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
a) Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are reported at cost less any provision for impairment.
b) ESOP trust
The cost of shares held indirectly is deducted from shareholders’ funds.
c) Share-based payments
The Company operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The total expected expense, based on the fair value of options and
other share-based incentives using a valuation model, is calculated at the date of grant and spread over the expected vesting period.
d) Taxation
Provision for taxation is made at the current rate and for deferred taxation at the projected rate on all timing differences which have originated
but not reversed at the balance sheet date. 
e) Pensions
The Company’s employees belong to the BTG International Ltd defined benefit pension scheme. As the Company is unable to identify its share
of the scheme assets and liabilities on a reasonable and consistent basis, the Company treats all contributions as if they were to a defined
contribution scheme in accordance with the exemptions permitted by FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’.

£216m Revenue £179m Revenue The last three financial years have been transformational for
Anite with the current management team delivering increased
strategic momentum, enhanced by their being able to focus
wholly on Anite’s core businesses and growth strategy
following the resolution of various historic issues which had
affected the Group.
Two acquisitions and three disposals, one since the year end,
were further milestones in Anite’s continuing transformation
into a leading global software business with a stronger focus
on wireless telecoms, from a UK-centric, public sector and IT
consulting and services business.
Acquisitions and disposals
In the second half of the financial year we made two important
acquisitions, our first for some years. The first and larger of the
two was Nemo Technologies Limited, a leading Finland-based,
global provider of specialist systems and software for mobile
phone network testing. The second acquisition was of Invenova
Corporation, a California-based provider of software and
systems for WiMAX* (wireless broadband) device testing.
These acquisitions represent important further steps in the
development of Anite’s Wireless business, which we have put
firmly at the heart of the Group. Both acquisitions were in 
line with our strategy of entering adjacent telecoms markets
through either internal investment or acquisition, whilst
enhancing customer penetration and global presence.
Following these acquisitions, our Wireless business as a whole
now represents around 40% of Group revenue and 65% of
Group underlying operating profit on an annualised basis. 
* “WiMAX” is a trademark of the WiMAX Forum®.
We also successfully disposed of two small non-core
businesses, respectively based in Germany (GMO Management
Consulting) and Italy (Anite Opentur). Since the year end we
have also disposed of our remaining German IT services
business, Anite Deutschland. 
We will continue to review selective acquisition opportunities
that would help achieve our aim of being number one or two
in our chosen markets and to dispose of businesses for which
we see little prospect of achieving critical mass in the short to
medium term. Our overriding objective in all cases is to create
shareholder value.
Divisional overview
We made good progress in all our businesses during the year. 
A full account of the Group’s activities is included later on in
this report, but I set out some highlights of the year below.
Wireless, which holds many leading global positions in its
chosen fields, had another successful year, continuing to invest
in research and development whilst maintaining its leading
market position. The acquisitions of Nemo and Invenova, which
operate in adjacent and complementary areas of the wireless
telecoms markets, add new products to our existing portfolio,
deepen our customer relationships and broaden our
geographical reach.
Our market leading Travel division had an excellent year. 
We invested further in its exciting new reservation system,
@comRes, which is at the forefront of helping its tour 
operator customers meet the challenges of internet-based
competition. It has a record order book boosted by significant
international growth.

Chairman Overview
Chairman’s statement

Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Our Public Sector division, which is a market leader in a
number of its key activities, reported improved overall results. 
A good performance by Secure Information Solutions (SIS) 
and a reduction in Pericles losses helped counterbalance the
continued softness in the Local Government market.
Group results
Underlying profit before tax from continuing operations was
£27.9m (2006: £25.8m), giving basic earnings per share of 
5.8p (2006: 5.3p). Underlying Group revenue amounted to
£171.7m (2006: £166.2m). 
Nemo contributed £6.9m of revenue and £2.0m of underlying
profit. Revenues and profits were also impacted by significantly
lower third party hardware revenues (down £14.9m), and the
weakness of the US dollar. The currency impact affected
Wireless in particular, and reduced revenues by £2.6m and
profits by £2.0m on a constant currency basis. Group
development spending in the period rose to £18.0m 
(2006: £14.5m), of which increase £2.8m was in the Wireless
division; net capitalised development was £3.0m (2006: £2.1m).
Good cost control and a better mix benefited underlying
operating margins, which were 16.7% (2006: 15.2%) in the
period. Unallocated Group corporate costs increased by £1.1m,
including £0.5m of additional share-based payments, additional
professional fees, interim Finance Director costs and the impact
of having established a central project management resource
overseeing major contract bids and project governance.
Group profit after tax including discontinued operations was
£20.3m (2006: £8.9m), with basic earnings per share of 5.8p
(2006: 2.5p), and diluted earnings per share of 5.7p (2006: 2.5p).
Pericles losses reduced substantially during the period and
there has been no addition to the related contract provisions.
All outstanding customer disputes have now been either
agreed or settled within the provision.
Dividend and share buyback 
Following the resumption of dividend payments last year with
the first dividend since 2000, the Board adopted a progressive
dividend policy with an intended split of approximately one
third at the half year and two thirds at the full year. 
For 2007 the Board is recommending a final dividend of 
0.55p per share (2006: 0.5p) which, together with the interim
dividend paid of 0.25p per share, makes a total dividend
payable for the year of 0.80p (2006: 0.5p). The final dividend
will be payable on 16 November 2007 to shareholders on 
the register on 19 October 2007. 
A resolution to renew the authority to buy back shares was
approved at the Group’s AGM held on 3 October 2006. 
During the year 0.8m shares were bought back for cancellation
at a cost of £0.6m and an average price of 71.5p per share.
People
We were pleased to welcome Christopher Humphrey, our
Group Finance Director, back to the business in January, 
having taken a leave of absence on health grounds. We thank
Geoff Bicknell who stood in as Interim Group Finance Director
in Chris’s absence.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all employees 
for their contribution, hard work and support during the year.
Change of name
In order to recognise the changing nature of the Group and 
to enable simplified marketing, shareholders will be asked 
to approve a resolution to change the name of the Company 
to “Anite plc” at the AGM to be held on 3 October 2007.
Conclusion 
Over the course of the last year the transformation of the Group
through investment, acquisitions and disposals has continued. 
The Board is cautiously optimistic about Anite’s prospects and
progress for the current financial year.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Anite Group plc Review
Chief Executive’s review
A combination of investing in our products, making acquisitions
to strengthen our position, and disposals to sharpen our focus,
enabled us to make considerable progress in achieving our
ambition to be the leading supplier of industry-specific IT
solutions in the sectors in which we operate. We intend to
continue transforming Anite into a software-based company. 
As part of that, we will maintain our focus on our existing
markets, expand the products and services we offer our customers
and seek to grow our geographic footprint and customer base. 
Objectives
The key elements of our strategy to enable us to deliver
long-term shareholder value are to:
> realign the business to put the Wireless business at its heart;
> deliver organic growth in all our operations;
> continue to focus on revenue and earnings growth,
maintaining and improving margins, and maintaining 
strong operational cash flow;
> improve the quality of our business by increasing the
proportion of long-term recurring revenue; and 
> continue to look for businesses to acquire in our core
markets to enable us to increase our geographic coverage,
range of products and technology offers.
Strategic progress
The two acquisitions in our Wireless division are the first 
we have made for many years. They are an indication of how
central the Wireless business is to the company as a whole, 
and of our determination to continue to be a market leader.
In November 2006, we bought Nemo, a Finland-based
company which provides specialist systems and software for
testing mobile phone networks. Nemo originated within Nokia
in the 1990s. Nokia continues to be a key partner for both
technology, and sales and marketing. Adding network testing 
to our existing handset testing capability, has enabled us to
enter a market which is complementary to our existing
Wireless business. Where we had previously sold our
technology to mobile phone manufacturers and their suppliers,
to enable them to test the viability of new products, we now
also sell a range of solutions to the world’s leading mobile
phone operators. The introduction of new technologies creates
increasing complexity in the way mobile phones communicate
with cellular base stations; now we are able to supply the
software which enables operators to measure and analyse 
the quality of the interface between the mobile devices they
are developing and the radio access infrastructure. 
In January 2007, we made an additional positive step in our
Wireless business when we acquired Invenova. This small, 
but fast-growing, company was chosen by the WiMAX Forum 
– the industry body which promotes and certifies mobile
equipment for this wireless broadband technology – as the 
first certified protocol conformance test provider for the new
mobile WiMAX standard. The acquisition of Invenova created
the opportunity to establish Anite in the wireless broadband
test systems market, to diversify its product portfolio across 
a range of wireless technologies, and to add all the major
WiMAX developers to its customer base.
We believe there will be further opportunities to acquire
businesses to strengthen our wireless test business to the
benefit of our customers and our shareholders.

Accelerating time-to-market for WiMAX mobile products
During 2007, Anite entered into a collaboration with
Beceem Communications, the leading provider of
semiconductor solutions for the wireless broadband market,
to enable customers to use their respective products more
effectively. Beceem – the first company to make terminal
chipsets for the IEEE 802.16e Mobile WiMAX standard
commercially available – was already using Anite solutions
to verify its reference designs.
In addition to collaborating on the WiMAX standard, 
the two companies are introducing a customer support
programme to give Beceem customers working with 
its chipset products, access to configuration information 
and testing tools which are proven to work with the 
latest versions of its software and firmware. CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED

Cost-effective analysis of early product designs
Anite has been working with InterDigital – which designs,
develops and provides advanced wireless technologies 
and products that drive voice and data communications –
for several years. InterDigital, a leading contributor to 
global wireless standards, licenses its technologies to
manufacturers of 2G, 2.5G, 3G and 802 products
worldwide. 
Anite’s wireless test solutions have enabled InterDigital to
analyse product designs early in the development process
and to resolve issues before they become problems. 
Our innovative software and collaborative approach help
InterDigital to prove that its architecture meets the
demands of real-world users. We, in turn, benefit from
gaining valuable insights into the wireless product
development process, enabling us to continue to improve
our best-in-class tools for the development, conformance
and inter-operability markets. Review

Annual Report and Accounts 2007
International expansion
Another important part of our strategy is to expand
internationally – to increase our geographic reach – to respond
to the nature of our core markets and the needs of our
customers. Our Wireless business has, for many years, been
increasing its international presence, but our Travel business
has been predominantly UK based.
For the past three years we have been developing a new travel
reservation system in internet-based technologies and, as a
result, have created a product that can be sold internationally.
We can now offer the global tour operator industry a full
enterprise solution, from booking hotels and airlines to posting
booked holidays to the sales ledger. As a result, our Travel
division has not only had a record year for orders, having won
very large international clients, but is also confident that it 
will be the market leader for the future.
There is no doubt that the larger opportunities for Travel 
are outside the UK. Our strategy is to increase the division’s
international sales, in a similar way to the Wireless division,
which now earns around 90% of its revenue from outside
the UK.
Our markets
Anite operates in three clearly-defined markets: Wireless, 
Travel and Public Sector.
Wireless Anite provides specialist systems and software for
testing mobile phone handsets and networks. Over the past
three years, we have increased our share of the wireless testing
market which, according to industry analysts, is expected 
to continue to grow at 12% a year. The drivers for this are
constant innovation and the multitude of wireless standards 
– many of which are incorporated into a single device – the
frequency with which mobile users change their devices and the
effect developing markets will have on the industry as a whole.
The pressure on manufacturers to bring devices to market
faster and cheaper, and for network operators to retain the
loyalty of their subscribers, provides further opportunities 
for growth. Our customers are:
> mobile technology developers who use our systems 
to test new chipsets and protocol software at a 
pre- and post-silicon stage of their development process;
> mobile phone manufacturers who use our systems 
to test newly-developed handsets before they go
into production;
> test houses who carry out formal “type approval” tests 
on phones and devices that have similar technology; and
> mobile phone operators who are concerned about
validating new technologies, such as HSDPA, and which 
use our air interface testing solutions.
The opportunities for our Wireless business emanate from 
a number of factors in what is a fast-evolving industry:
> continuing growth in worldwide mobile telephone sales;
> improved geographic coverage of our sales operations;
> roll-out of new technologies, such as 3G, HSPA, WiMAX
and the long-term evolution of 3G;
> continuing development spend to stay at the forefront 
of changes in technology;
> increased proliferation of wireless devices; and
> increased demand from operators to improve the quality
and efficiency of the network.
Our Wireless division already holds many leading positions 
in its chosen fields, worldwide, but we will continue to invest 
in research and development to ensure that it maintains, and
improves, its market position. The acquisitions of Nemo and
Invenova have added new products to our portfolio, and will
enable us to strengthen our customer relationships and expand
our geographic reach.
Travel Anite is a leading provider of travel technology solutions
for tour operators, air fare consolidators, and cruise, ferry, motor
and rail inclusive operators in the UK and Europe. We are
developing our products to help our customers adapt to the
increasing effect the internet is having on their markets. 
Our customers can license our products, and operate the
system themselves, or buy a complete managed service
package, under which we run the service – including looking
after hardware and software – at one of our data centres.
Depending on the size of their operations, we have the 
ability to tailor our service to meet customers’ specific needs.
Our flexible pricing model enables smaller customers 
to pay on a per-transaction basis.
The travel market has changed dramatically in recent years: 
the majority of the growth is now in short breaks and specialist
holidays, for which customers go on-line to build their own
packages of flights, hotels and car hire. Consolidation in the 
UK market has resulted in the top four tour operators merging
into two larger competing companies. 
The principal factors which will affect the development of our
Travel business are:
> market consolidation in the UK;
> growing demand for short-breaks and specialist holidays
is increasing the size of the market; CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED

AND SERVICES WE OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS.”
> the internet providing a do-it-yourself approach, which 
is changing the nature of holiday booking, and has resulted
in an increased demand for tailor-made travel booked
on-line. Our browser-based @comRes solution combines
content management, reservations and customer
relationship management systems for direct on-line
bookings, call centre reservations, fast-search facilities, 
and improved marketing activity – which can all be
supported by a 24x7 managed service; and
> recent world events, such as unrest in the Middle East,
avian flu and terrorism, have affected the pattern of
customer demand for holidays.
During the year, we increased our investment in our @comRes
reservation system, the scaleability of which was proved by a
successful benchmarking test, and secured orders from leading
UK and international companies. Enabling users of legacy
systems to migrate to our internet-based technology will help
us to maintain our market-leading position while, at the same
time, enabling us to increase our international sales efforts. 
Public Sector Anite is a market leader in software and
solutions to key parts of local government, including local tax
collection, benefits payments, housing management and social
care solutions – as well as an important supplier of Secure
Information Solutions (SIS) to the criminal justice markets.
More than 400 public sector organisations, including all UK
police forces and 75% of local authorities use our solutions.
Our customers are:
> local authorities who use our workflow, tax, social care,
benefits and housing solutions;
> central Government and criminal justice agencies who
use our surveillance, intelligence gathering, recognition,
biometric, security and fraud solutions.
Our public sector customers are affected by a number
of imperatives:
> the need to improve efficiency and effectiveness as the
result of legislative and political drivers. These continue to
put pressure on public sector organisations to make cost
savings year-on-year and to improve return on investment;
> the call for increased accessibility and transparency from
the Government, which is focused on transforming citizen
services and improving corporate performance; and
> the ability to share information by working together 
to protect vulnerable people and provide cleaner and 
safer streets.
Many shareholders will be familiar with the multi-year
programme of work on the Pericles product and the associated
legacy customer contracts. I am delighted to report that our
Pericles customers are all now successfully using the software
in a live environment and that all contracted customer
implementations for all Pericles modules are complete. 
This enables us to bid for new contracts with confidence.
The investment we have made in developing new products; 
in document management; in our integrated children’s and
adults’ systems; and in addressing the changing housing
market, will contribute positively to our business in the current
year. While we believe this market will continue to be tough,
we anticipate further improvement in our operating margins.
Outlook
We will continue to focus investment in our growth markets 
to respond to customer demand and to maximise opportunities
from advances in technology. This will be evidenced in a further
increase in development spending this year, principally
in Wireless.
Our Wireless division, which now includes Nemo and Invenova,
will continue to take advantage of growth in its underlying
markets, in emerging regions and new technologies. We expect
increased investment in development, combined with currency
movements, however, to temper the rate of profit growth
despite rising revenues.
We expect our Travel division to benefit from delivering 
its significant order book. It will continue to invest in the
transition to @comRes and in international opportunities. 
As the leading UK supplier, we intend to take advantage of 
the rapidly consolidating UK tour operating market.
Public Sector’s markets will be adjusting to the recent changes
in the Government, at a time of generally tight control of
public spending and strong competition between suppliers.
Demand in Local Government has stabilised and there are
good sales opportunities in some of the niche markets we
address, and we continue to see good opportunities in SIS.
Although public spending pressures will undoubtedly continue,
we are well placed to capitalise on the opening up of new
markets for the services that SIS offers. 
We have had a satisfactory start to the current financial year,
when our customary seasonality is taken into account, and look
ahead with cautious optimism about our progress and prospects.

A new route to creating holiday packages
Anite’s browser-based @comRes solution is proving to be 
a hit with travel operators. It combines Content Management
(CMS), and reservation and customer-relationship management
systems for on-line and call centre bookings, with faster-
searching facilities and improved marketing facilities.
Suntours, Finnair’s leisure travel division, is one of the many 
UK and European companies to adopt @comRes. The Finnish
operation has enhanced its investment by implementing
Anite’s dynamic cache, which enables users to create and find
holiday packages quickly without increasing the load on the
system. Four branded websites will run off the new system,
where the sites will be configured, built and implemented 
by Anite. The systems will be then hosted and managed by
Anite at its secure data centre in Berkshire. FINANCIAL REVIEW
Anite Group plc Review
Financial review
The Group’s strong financial performance in 2006/2007 continued the progressive improvement of recent years. It enabled 
us to invest in opportunities for growth while, at the same time, withstanding the cash costs relating to Pericles and SoV.
As part of the continuing transformation of the Group, we sold two small, non-strategic businesses – GMO Management
Consulting and Anite Opentur, during the year, and one – Anite Deutschland, after the year end. This completed the programme 
of disposals of international IT services businesses, none of which had Anite-owned software at their core.
Group KPIs
The Group uses a variety of key performance indicators (KPIs) across its various businesses and at a Group level. The most
important of these at Group level for continuing operations (excluding disposed businesses and SoV) are:

non-quantitative in nature.

Wireless reported good results, continuing its strong progress of recent years with orders, revenues and profits up and increasing
software licences representing 57% (2006: 46%) and recurring revenues representing 22% (2006: 22%), of divisional revenues.
This performance, which was affected by a reduced proportion of hardware platform sales, included a five-month trading
contribution from Nemo (acquired 30 November 2006) and three months from Invenova (acquired 29 January 2007). Nemo
contributed £6.9m in revenues and £2.0m in operating profit after one-off integration costs of £0.5m. Negative currency
movements, principally in the US dollar, had a £2.6m impact on revenue and a £2.0m impact on profits on a constant currency
basis (2007 results restated at 2006 exchange rates).
Performance in the Americas, Europe and India was excellent, although there were tougher conditions in the Far East. The division
also increased its total development spending, as anticipated, by £2.8m. This continuing investment in software product
development and new hardware platform helps maintain market and technology leadership in our core segments, enabling us to
be first-to-market with new technologies, while reducing hardware costs. To boost our leadership further, we have initiated plans
to increase our investment in our offshore development capabilities in India.
Market developments during the year included continued global growth in mobile handset sales; the ongoing adoption of 3G, 
HSDPA, HSUPA and WiMAX; and the proliferation of new wireless devices, services and standards. These were partly balanced by
the continuing decline of demand for older 2G technologies, the impact of consolidation among customers and more aggressive
pricing tactics by competitors.

Travel had an excellent year, ahead of our original expectations. It reported good revenue and profits growth and strong orders
with good growth overseas. This, combined with the sale of the small lower-margin Opentur business based in Italy, resulted in
improved margins. Once again, substantial recurring software maintenance and managed services revenues from the division’s
installed customer base delivered more than 43% (2006: 45%) of divisional revenues. Software licence revenue represented 3%
(2006: 2%) of divisional revenues.
As expected, the year was a transitional one for the business as it steadily increased development spending on @comRes, our new
reservation system, with £0.5m (2005: £0.1m) invested in the year. @comRes’s scaleability, which is critical to its customer standing,
was also successfully tested and proved with a benchmark test. @comRes opens the door to a migration path for legacy product
users whilst boosting Anite’s international sales push and helping us maintain our market leading position in the UK.

During the year, major UK and international orders were received from Condor Ferries, Finnair, First Choice, TUI (UK and Germany)
and XL Leisure Group and a managed service order from Norwich Union, a non-travel customer. As a result, the divisional order
book now stands at record levels. These new orders combine an attractive mix of software licence, implementation and long-term
managed services, and demonstrate the successful introduction of @comRes to the market.

Public Sector’s overall performance improved markedly, despite the widely-diverging performances of the constituent businesses:
there was a strong performance by SIS and a significant reduction in Pericles losses, but revenue and profit fell in the remainder 
of the local government business. 
Overall, divisional software licences represented 12% (2006: 13%), and recurring revenues increased to 38% (2006: 29%), of
divisional revenues and there was a substantial reduction in third-party revenues. 
We entered the year anticipating that there would be a significant slow down in the demand for our local government software
applications. Despite a fall in orders and revenues, cost reductions and tight operational management enabled us to increase the
profitability of our local government business overall. 
Many of you will be familiar with the multi-year programme of work on the Pericles product and the associated legacy customer
contracts and we are now able to report that all of our Pericles customers are now successfully using the software in live
operation. In addition, all contracted customer implementations for all Pericles modules are complete. We are now in a position
to confidently bid for new contracts and focus on making our Revenue & Benefits product business, of which Pericles is a key
component, profitable as soon as possible. 
Our Secure Information Solutions (SIS) business, which primarily addresses the UK police and criminal justice market, made
progress with good growth in its software and services revenue, focused on margin enhancement and a reduction in lower 
margin sales. As a result, profitability of this unit grew. Strong customer relationships have enabled us to make progress against 
a backdrop of tight budgets across the sector.
International division
International comprised solely Anite’s German consultancy business, which was profitable in the year and which was disposed 
of after the year end.

Revenue
Revenue for continuing businesses, excluding disposed businesses and SoV, increased by 3.3% to £171.7m and is analysed by type
in the table below.
One of the Group’s financial objectives is to improve the quality of its earnings by increasing the proportion of revenue that
comes from recurring business, such as managed services and software maintenance, both of which are longer term in nature,
together with software licence revenue which is derived from the Group’s internally developed IPR and know-how.

Underlying operating profit for the year was £28.7m (2006: £25.2m). Group profit after tax for the year was £20.3m (2006: £8.9m).
Overhead costs
Divisional performances are stated before unallocated Group corporate costs. Unallocated Group corporate costs include head
office staff costs, Directors’ remuneration, professional and office costs, and non-operational costs. During the period unallocated
Group corporate costs totalled £1.9m (2006: £1.3m). Unallocated share-based payments totalled £0.9m (2006: £0.4m). 
Group corporate costs increased as a result of the establishment of a central project management resource, the appointment 
of an Interim Finance Director and professional advisory fees, some of which are one-off in nature.
Non-operational property costs in the period of £0.4m (2006: £0.4m), principally arose from the settlement of an onerous
long-term lease. We continue to manage an orderly run-down of this portfolio which comprises legacy properties previously
occupied by Group businesses.

including amortisation of £3.0m (2006: £1.5m). Development spending largely focused on Wireless and Public Sector. Total

Anite Group plc Review
Financial review
Group finance costs
Following the acquisition of Nemo and Invenova the Group had a net debt position on 30 April 2007 of £22.5m. As a result net
finance costs of £0.8m were incurred in the year compared with net finance income of £0.6m in the previous year. Full details 
are given in Note 4 to the accounts.
T axation
The tax rate for the continuing operations for the year was 28.2% (2006: 27.8%). The charge for the year amounted to £7.0m
(2006: £6.9m). The cash payment for the year amounted to £2.5m (2006: £4.9m). The tax rate increased as expected, as a result
of the increase in profits from countries where tax rates are higher than the UK, principally in Anite Wireless’s US operation.
As Wireless continues to widen its geographic spread of profits in higher tax regimes, the Group tax rate is expected to continue
to rise modestly, excluding the benefit of de-risking. 
Further progress was made during the year with respect of de-risking the Group’s tax provision and this has led to a £3.8m
exceptional tax credit (2006: £3.2m) arising from the reassessment of provisions established in the past for taxation attributable
to discontinued activities.
Shareholder returns and dividends
> Underlying basic earnings per share increased to 5.8p.
> The Board has proposed a final dividend of 0.55p per share (2006: 0.5p) making a total for the year of 0.80p (2006: 0.5p) 
– covered seven times by underlying earnings.
> Retained earnings to equity holders increased to £20.3m (2006: £8.9m) for the year.
The number of shares in issue increased in the period under review to 352.75m at 30 April 2007 from 351.36m at 30 April 2006.
In total, 0.86m shares were bought back and cancelled at an average price of 71.5p per share and a total cost of £0.6m; 2.25m
new shares were issued to settle SAYE and option maturities. The weighted average number of shares in issue used to calculate
basic earnings per share was, therefore, 350.16m (30 April 2006: 349.48m). This does not include the dilutive effect of share
option and SAYE schemes.
The number of executive share awards and options vested but not yet exercised was 8.1m and the number issued but not yet
vested was 10.5m.
Disposals
The disposals of GMO Management Consulting GmbH (part of the International division) for a gross consideration of £0.1m, 
and Anite Opentur Srl (part of the Travel Division) for a gross consideration of £0.1m, were completed within the financial year.
Since the year end we have also disposed of our remaining German IT services business, Anite Deutschland Management GmbH
and its subsidiaries. 
Cash management
As expected the conversion of operating profits to cash during the year improved from the previous year, despite payments 
at the beginning of the year to settle the SoV contract (£11.4m) and a payment to settle a legacy onerous property lease
(£2.2m), as the result of a number of anticipated factors, including:
> reduced losses from Pericles contracts;
> lower income taxes paid;
> improved management of working capital; and
> reduced capital expenditure.
18
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Review
Financial review
Anite Group plc
Other factors that influenced cash flow during the year were:
> the acquisitions of Nemo and Invenova;
> the purchase of own shares; and
> the first dividend payment since the year 2000.
Capital expenditure, which totalled £3.7m (2006: £6.3m), fell as a result of the non-recurrence of significant expenditures incurred
last year on Wireless development and demonstration equipment. 
Balance sheet and cash
The Group generated strong operating cash flow during the period. In conjunction with the acquisition financing in relation to
Nemo and Invenova and other opportunities, our existing banking facilities were renegotiated and increased during the period.

Nemo (£60.5m) and Invenova (£3.2m).
The Group’s syndicated banking facility has recently been renegotiated to a total facility of £90m and is not due to be reviewed
again until 30 November 2011. In addition, the Group retains a £10m overdraft facility, renewable annually. We believe these
facilities are appropriate for our expected future requirements. 
Managing business risks
The Board continues to develop processes for the identification, assessment and management of the principal risks to which the
Group is exposed.
The principal risks that may affect the Group are the control of business assets; and political, project delivery, strategic, operational
and financial risks. These are not all within the Group’s control and factors other than those listed may also have an effect. Further
details concerning these and other risks, and the actions being taken to mitigate them, are in the report on corporate governance
from page 25. 
Post-Balance sheet event
On 9 July 2007, the Group disposed of Anite Deutschland Management GmbH (“Anite Deutschland”) and its subsidiaries to 
Vega Group plc, for a total consideration of £8.0m payable in cash on completion.
At 30 April 2007, the Directors considered that the sale was not highly probable and, therefore, did not qualify as a held-for-sale
disposal group nor as a discontinued operation. Anite Deutschland’s results were the only results in the International Consulting
division and will be presented as a discontinued operation in the 2008 financial statements.

The Directors present their report on the affairs of the Group, together with the audited financial statements, for the year ended
30 April 2007.
Principal activities
The Group is a leading worldwide provider of IT solutions, software, systems integration and managed services within its core
markets of Wireless, Travel and Public Sector.
Analyses of turnover, profit on ordinary activities and net assets are given in note 2 on pages 52 to 55.
Business review and future developments
The review of the year’s operations, key risks, trading outlook and future developments is contained in the Chairman’s statement
on page 4, the Chief Executive’s review on page 6, the financial review on page 12 and report on corporate governance on page 25.
Where the Annual Report contains forward-looking statements, these are made by the Directors in good faith based on the
information available to them at the time of their approval of this report. Consequently, such statements should be treated with
caution due to the inherent uncertainties, including both economic and business risk factors, underlying such forward-looking
statements or information.
Results 
The audited accounts of the Group for the year ended 30 April 2007 are set out on pages 40 to 80. The Group profit for the year,
after taxation, was £20.3m (2006: £8.9m). 
Dividends 
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 0.55p (2006: 0.5p) per ordinary share which, if approved by shareholders at the 
2007 AGM will be due for payment on 16 November 2007 to holders of ordinary shares on the register at the close of business 
on 19 October 2007. This, together with the interim dividend of 0.25p per share paid on 16 May 2007, will make a total dividend 
for the year of 0.80p per share. 
Research and development
The total expenditure in the year was £18.0m (2006: £14.5m) of which £15.0m was expensed in the income statement

and enhancement.
Acquisitions and disposals
On 3 November 2006, the Company entered into a conditional agreement to acquire the entire issued share capital of Nemo
Technologies Ltd and Elektrobit Group Pte Ltd and certain other related assets. The Company’s shareholders approved this
transaction at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company on 29 November 2006. The acquisition was completed 
on 30 November 2006 for an initial cash consideration of £57.4m (185.0m), a net adjustment of £0.5m (10.9m), acquisition 
costs of £2.6m and up to a further £8.2m (112.0m) payable upon the achievement of certain financial performance targets.

(US$6.0m) payable upon the achievement of certain financial performance targets.

Corporate social responsibility
Environmental policy
The Company supports the protection of a sustainable environment. The Group’s activities do not produce harmful waste or
emissions and the Ethical Investment Research Service grades Anite as “low impact”. Whilst our operations are, by their nature,
of minimal impact on the environment, we do recognise our responsibilities in this respect.
Anite is therefore committed to:
> Complying with the relevant environmental legislation, regulations and industry standards of the countries in which it
conducts business.
> Reducing the output of emissions that may adversely impact on the environment.
> Minimising the consumption of energy and water used in its facilities.
> Reducing waste and, wherever practicable, re-using and recycling consumables (e.g. paper, toner cartridges and computer
equipment) and disposing of non-recyclable items in an environmentally acceptable manner.
> Where practicable, purchasing environmentally-sound goods and services.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Company is building awareness and promoting initiatives to encourage employees 
to become fully engaged. The Directors regularly review the environmental policy.
Corporate governance
A report on corporate governance is contained on pages 25 to 31.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS CONTINUED
Anite Group plc Management and governance
Report of the Directors
Post balance sheet event
On 9 July 2007, the Group completed the sale of Anite Deutschland Management GmbH (“Anite Deutschland”) and its
subsidiaries for a total consideration of £8.0m payable in cash on completion.
At 30 April 2007, the Directors considered that the sale was not highly probable and therefore did not qualify as a held for sale
disposal group, or as a discontinued operation.
Employees
The energy, commitment and passion of our employees are vital to our business. The Company strives to create a working
environment which encourages people to be individuals and develop their full potential within a framework of shared values 
and goals. To achieve this, Anite is committed to a policy which provides all employees and potential employees with equality 
of opportunity for selection and development regardless of age, gender, nationality, race, creed, disability or sexuality.
In the event of employees becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the Company continues
and that appropriate training is arranged for them.
Employees are provided with information through Myanite, the Group’s global intranet, roadshows and other internal
communications. The views and ideas of employees are sought through discussion, line management and focus groups.
The Company operates a range of employee share schemes for Executive Directors and a small number of senior executives, 
and they are more fully described in the remuneration report contained on pages 32 to 36.
Since August 2005, the Company has offered employees an enhanced Share Incentive Plan, which currently matches on a
one-for-one basis the number of shares purchased monthly by employees.
The Company also has Save As You Earn (SAYE) schemes, both in the UK and overseas. No options were granted under these
schemes during the year, and it is not anticipated that any further grants will be made.
Payment of suppliers
It is the Group’s policy to agree with all suppliers, where practicable, appropriate terms of trade and to operate within those terms.
Trade creditors at 30 April 2007 represented on average 43 days’ credit (2006: 46 days) for the Group and 40 days’ credit for the
Company (2006: 40 days).
Going concern
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, consider that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Therefore, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the financial statements.
Disclosure of information to auditors
In the case of each of the persons who were Directors of the Company at the date when this report was approved:
> so far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are not aware;
and
> each of the Directors has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
Re-election of auditors
The Board has considered and recommends the re-appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors.
Deloitte & Touche LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors, and a resolution proposing their
re-appointment will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at 12pm on Wednesday 3 October 2007 at 353 Buckingham Avenue,
Slough, Berkshire SL1 4PF. The Notice setting out details of the business to be considered at the meeting is sent to shareholders
separately with this Annual Report.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Management and governance
Corporate governance report
Anite Group plc
The Company is committed to the principles of good corporate governance contained in the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance adopted by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 (the “Combined Code”). This report sets out the Company’s
compliance with the Code.
Statement of compliance with the Combined Code
The Company has complied with the provisions set out in the Combined Code throughout the year ended 30 April 2007 with the
exception that during the year, the Company decided to take advantage of the relaxations to the Combined Code to be permitted
under the updated Combined Code on Corporate Governance that was issued in June 2006. Accordingly, Clay Brendish, who was
considered independent at the time of his appointment as Chairman of the Board in October 2005, became a member of the
Remuneration Committee with effect from 26 April 2007.
The Board
The Board of Directors is the body responsible for corporate governance, for establishing policies and objectives and for the
stewardship of the Group’s resources. It is the Group’s policy that the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate, with
their roles and responsibilities clearly divided and recorded. The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, ensuring 
its effectiveness and setting its agenda. He also ensures that communication with shareholders is effective and facilitates the
contribution of the Non-Executive Directors. The Chief Executive is responsible for implementing the strategy agreed by the Board
as a whole and for managing the Group. Currently, the Board is made up of the Non-Executive Chairman, two Executive Directors
and two Non-Executive Directors. Peter Bertram is the Senior Independent Director. The biographies of the Directors as at the date
of this report are given on pages 20 and 21.
It is the opinion of the Board that the Chairman and the two Non-Executive Directors are independent of management and have
no business or other relationship which could interfere materially with the exercise of their judgement in relation to the business
of the Company or the Group.
The Directors believe it is essential that the Company has an effective Board. The Board operates formally through regular Board
meetings and there is also frequent communication between the Directors. During the period under review the Board met 
15 times. Details of attendance at these meetings are given in the table on page 27. During the year the Board also received
detailed strategy presentations from the divisional Managing Directors.
The Board is responsible to the Company’s shareholders for the management and control of the Group’s activities, its strategic
objectives, governance, internal controls, and the stewardship of its resources. The regular and timely provision of information 
to the Board is ensured through the monthly preparation and circulation to all Board members of the Chief Executive’s report,
which reports on operational matters; the Group Finance Director’s report, which provides the monthly management accounts
and other relevant financial information; and the Company Secretary’s report, which covers corporate governance, corporate 
social responsibility, and matters concerning the Company’s shares, share schemes and shareholders. Other matters are tabled 
on a regular basis at Board meetings or are reported to the Board as appropriate.
The Board has a regular schedule of meetings together with further meetings when required. In addition, directors meet as
members of relevant committees. The Board has delegated the normal operational management of the Company to the Executive
Directors, who have direct responsibility for all operations and activities. They are supported in this by an Executive Team which
comprises, in addition to the Executive Directors, the Managing Directors of each division, plus the Group Human Resources
Director and the Company Secretary. The Board has agreed a formal schedule of matters reserved specifically for its decision
which include: 
> strategy and objectives;
> business plans and budgets;
> changes in capital and corporate structure;
> accounting policies and financial reporting;
> internal controls;
> major contracts;
> capital projects;
> acquisitions and disposals;
> communications with shareholders; and
> Board membership
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors meet without the Executive Directors present at least annually.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board
procedures and applicable rules and regulations are observed. There is an agreed procedure for Directors to obtain independent
professional advice, paid for by the Company.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, one third of the Board is required to retire by rotation each year and
each Director must offer himself for re-election once every three years. In addition, any Director appointed during the year will
stand for election at the next General Meeting, ensuring that each Board member faces re-election at regular intervals. Details
of the Directors due to retire at the 2007 Annual General Meeting are shown on page 23.

Terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are normally appointed for a term of three years. The terms and conditions of the appointment of the
Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection by any person at the registered office of the Company during normal business
hours and at the Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Board performance evaluation and training
The Board, as part of its commitment to ensure its effectiveness and evaluate its performance, completed a full evaluation of its
performance and that of its Directors during the year. This evaluation consisted of a questionnaire being completed by all Board
members. In addition, questionnaires were completed by members of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee 
in connection with a formal evaluation of each Committee’s assessment of its performance and effectiveness.
The Non-Executive Directors have met alone to appraise the Chairman’s performance.
The evaluation of Board performance will continue to be conducted annually and the Company will engage external help from
time to time to ensure that the process is robust.
Induction and development of Directors
All new Directors receive a comprehensive induction to the Company. The Company has a continuing professional approach 
to assist the Chairman, Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors in discharging their responsibilities effectively. 
Non-Executive Directors meet regularly with Executive Directors and members of the Executive Team and also receive 
regular business updates via scheduled presentations.
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
The Group uses a range of performance measures to measure and manage the businesses within the Group. In addition, the
divisions have established their own performance indicators that are specific to their individual businesses.
The Group KPIs monitor order intake (net and gross), revenues, margins (gross and net), overhead costs, projects, cash flow, 
capital and development expenditure and headcount. In addition to these Group KPIs, other measures indicating specific 
divisional measures such as product development, loss making projects, manpower utilisation, customer requests and working
capital are used.
The Group changes and refines the KPIs on a regular basis dependent on the major issues that are identified in the businesses.
Internal control and risk
The Directors have overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a sound system of internal control to provide 
them with reasonable assurance that all information used within the business and for external publication is adequate, including
financial, operational and compliance control and risk management, and for ensuring that assets are safeguarded and therefore
that shareholders’ investment is protected. There are limitations in any system of internal control and, accordingly, even the most
effective system can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Group continues to enhance its project management procedures to ensure that good practice is applied consistently across
the Group.
In line with past practice, the Board has reviewed the internal control system in place during the year and until the date of the
approval of this report to ensure that it remains effective. Where significant weaknesses are identified as a result of the reviews,
new procedures are put in place to strengthen controls.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
Anite Group plc Management and governance
Corporate governance report
The Group settled its dispute with the Office of Housing in respect of the onerous State of Victoria Contract on 30 June 2006. 
A payment was made of £10.5m (A$26.0m including GST) in full and final settlement of all past and future obligations in respect
of the performance of the contract to the Office of Housing.
The Group continued to de-risk Pericles in line with its expectations and considerable progress was made during the year with all
contracted sites now live. Three disputes, previously notified, have been resolved or settled.
The Board has in place risk assessment processes within all the Group’s divisions, and procedures have been established to
implement best practice. There is an ongoing process for identifying, managing and reviewing any changes in the risks faced by 
the business. This process has been in place throughout the year under review, and continues. It operates under the direction 
of the Board and is reviewed by the Audit Committee.
The key procedures that the Board has established and which are designed to provide effective internal control for the Group are:
> The Board sets out the Group authority procedures, which are adopted by all the subsidiary companies.
> The issue of a Group accounting and procedures manual which sets out the Group’s accounting practices, revenue recognition
rules, accounting under IFRS and bid approval processes.
> The Board continues to review the progress of all major fixed-price contracts monthly and in particular the status of the
Pericles contracts within the Public Sector division.
> The Director of Projects and Programmes oversees the introduction of project management standards and procedures across
the Group and the education of all divisional project managers in best practice for the management of bids and the execution
and status reporting of projects.
> The application of a rigorous annual budgeting process following a detailed divisional and Group strategy review. All budgets
are subject to approval at Board level.
> The Executive Team is responsible for reviewing the operational results, communicating and applying Group-wide polices and
procedures, and strategy on operational matters which is communicated both to the Board and to the operating units. 
> The formal monthly operational review by the Executive Directors together with the divisional management teams to assess
the financial and operating performance and discuss the ongoing development of each business unit and the comparison of
detailed monthly management reports against budgets, forecasts and prior years. In addition, the Chief Executive and Group
Finance Director prepare a monthly report for the Board on key developments, performance and issues in the business.
> The maintenance of local operating boards and divisional management teams, enabling the Board to delegate appropriate 
levels of authority to a small number of subsidiary company directors and managers, all of whom are directly accountable 
to the Board.
> The identification and mitigation of major business risks is the responsibility of operating company management. Each operating
company maintains internal controls and procedures appropriate to its structure and business environment, whist complying
with Group policies, standards and guidelines. The Managing Director and Finance Director of each business unit are required 
to complete a self assessment checklist half yearly. This provides assurance that the business unit has complied with internal
controls, financial controls and reporting requirements of the Group and has brought to the attention of Group management
any instances of fraud or other matters relating to their business.
> Insurance cover is maintained for all the major risk areas of the Group based on the scale of the risk and the availability 
of cover in the external market.
> The use of external professional advisers to carry out due diligence reviews of potential acquisitions.
> The operation of a small internal review function to carry out internal control reviews of all the operating divisions at least
annually, reporting to the Audit Committee.
> The periodic detailed objective review of each business and its future direction by management and the Audit Committee.
The Board, with the advice and recommendations of the Audit Committee, will continue to review the effectiveness of all internal
systems of control through independent reports where appropriate, and by internal formal monthly review meetings in all main
operating companies and divisions to test the validity of the internal reporting process.
Internal review function
The Board has established a Group internal review function which reports to the Audit Committee.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Management and governance
Corporate governance report
Anite Group plc
Risk management
Anite has undergone significant change over the last few years. The Group operates in a number of fast-changing markets within
wireless, public sector, local government and central government, and travel industry enterprise software. These markets provide
significant challenges as well as rewards and following the lessons learnt over the last few years the management have
progressively improved the Group’s approach to risk management.
The combination of robust and well-defined central direction, strong divisional management and effective processes and controls
will enable the Group to identify and deal with key risks at the earliest opportunity. 
The Group operates rigorous processes and controls to ensure that for each division there is a detailed annual operating plan and
budget with a monthly operational review by senior management to ensure the businesses are making progress against those
plans, taking the appropriate corrective actions throughout the course of the year should issues arise. The progress of each division
is reported regularly to the main Board meetings.
The principal risk factors that may affect Anite Group’s business are outlined below. These are not all within the Group’s control;
other factors beside those listed may also affect the Group.
Business asset risk
The Group increasingly operates in global markets and failure to manage its portfolio of businesses effectively could have a serious
impact. The Group conducts regular reviews of its business portfolio; it may, however, still be exposed to risks such as increased
taxation, regulations and threats to its market leadership.
Political climate risk
The Group recognises that in some countries in which it operates, specific country risks exist that could have an effect on its
business and such risks may include volatility of national currencies, unexpected changes in local laws, regulations or standards
and changes in local customs and business practices.
Project delivery risk
The successes of many of the Group businesses are dependent on the successful completion of development projects within
budget, cost and specifications. The delivery of these projects is subject to certain technical, commercial, legal, contractor and
economic risks.
Strategic and operational risks
Within Wireless
> The highly technical and fast-changing nature of the market place.
> The need to keep products at the forefront of changes in technology. 
Within Travel
> The changing nature of the customer market resulting from increasing use of the internet.
> The need to keep products at the forefront of changes in technology.
> Delivery of projects and contracts to our clients within agreed budgets and timescales.
> Ensuring the business is flexible enough to accommodate the changing structure of the travel industry.
> Ensuring that the division has common robust systems and back-up processes in place to mitigate problems of external
infrastructure failures that might have an impact on the division’s performance.
Within Public Sector
> The nature and speed of the market changes occurring as the result of the Government’s agenda for increased efficiency 
and effectiveness in local government.
> All contracts and product developments are managed with respect to the Board’s approach to risk.
> Delivery of projects and contracts to our customers within agreed budgets and timescales.
> The division continues to invest in products which are driven by regulation and market changes. 
> The market moves toward customer services, shared management services and efficiency in order to remain competitive.

mitigation techniques.

> To mitigate the increase in the Group’s tax rate as sales and profits expand in higher tax areas.

debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from, and finance, operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments
shall be undertaken, although it considers utilising financial instruments for specific transactions where required. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit
risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and they are summarised below. These policies are reviewed
on a regular basis. The Group’s head office finance function is responsible for ensuring that the policies approved by the Board 
are adopted throughout the Group. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group is subject to some cross-border transactional currency exposure in respect of trading outside each operating company’s
functional currency. Where possible, currency receivables and payables are matched creating a natural hedge. Any surplus
cross-border transactional exposure is not hedged. The policy is that any surplus foreign denominated currency is converted into
sterling at the earliest opportunity.
The Group has overseas subsidiaries which operate mainly in North America, Northern Europe and Asia Pacific and whose
revenues and expenses are denominated in their local currencies. The Group currently partly hedges its investment in overseas
subsidiaries through financial instruments and natural hedges.
The Group’s net investment in significant overseas subsidiaries is hedged where the revaluation of such investments is likely 
to have a material impact on the financial covenants under the Group’s banking arrangements.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations and acquisitions through a mixture of retained reserves and bank borrowings. The Group seeks
to minimise overall net interest expense, and where there are surplus funds to obtain a fair market rate of return. The Group
operates a cash pooling arrangement for all its UK operating companies, and endeavours to balance liquidity requirements with
achieving a market rate of return on cash through the use of short-term money market deposits or other term deposits.
Appropriate financial instruments are used to mitigate the impact of changes in interest payable in respect of significant
borrowings. Further details are set out in note 25 on page 74.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to maintain a balance of available facilities to fund the Group’s liquidity requirements, further details of which
are set out in note 25 on page 75.
The Group has strong operating cash inflows and has focused efforts on managing its working capital.
Credit risk
The Group’s policy on credit risk is set out in note 25 on page 75.

Accounts in July. Additionally, as required under Article 6 of the Transparency Directive, the Company will issue an interim
management statement during each half year. These reports are posted on www.anite.com.
The Company makes other announcements from time to time, which can also be found on www.anite.com.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 REMUNERATION REPORT
Anite Group plc Management and governance
Remuneration report
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 as inserted by the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (“the Regulations”) and meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the AGM 
of the Company at which the financial statements will be presented for approval.
The Regulations require the independent auditors to report to the Company’s shareholders and the report has been split into
separate sections for the unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board and is comprised of Non-Executive Directors who are independent 
of management and free from any business or other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their independent
judgement.
Chairmanship of the Committee passed to David Hurst-Brown, from Peter Bertram, on 26 April 2007. Mr Brendish was also
appointed as a member of the Committee on 26 April 2007, in line with the revision to the Combined Code.
During the year, membership of the Committee was as follows:
David Hurst-Brown (appointed as Chairman 26 April 2007)
Peter Bertram
Clay Brendish (appointed 26 April 2007)
Peter Bertram, David Hurst-Brown and Clay Brendish are considered by the Board to be independent. Mr Bertram is the Senior
Independent Non-Executive Director.
The Committee invites the Executive Directors and other senior managers to attend its meetings as appropriate. The Committee
met eight times during the year. Details of attendance at the meetings are shown in the table in the corporate governance report
on page 27.
The principal function of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration policy for Executive
Directors. It is also responsible for setting the individual remuneration packages for the Chairman, the Executive Directors and 
the Chief Executive’s direct reports, and for monitoring and approving all share-based incentive arrangements. The Committee 
also determines the terms and conditions of employment of the executive directors.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference, which are posted on the Company’s website.
Advice and assistance
The Committee uses New Bridge Street Consultants LLP as its professional advisers on executive remuneration and employee
share schemes. New Bridge Street Consultants provide no other services to the Company. During the year, the Company also
requested Deloitte & Touche LLP to provide a market analysis of the range of available incentive arrangements.
The Company Secretary (who is also the Secretary to the Committee) and the Group Human Resources Director provide the
Committee with information and assistance. The Chief Executive regularly attends Committee meetings to provide his own
insights on business objectives and the individual performance of his direct reports. No Director or senior manager is present
when their own remuneration is being discussed.
Remuneration policy
Main principles
The Company’s objective is to attract, retain and incentivise high-calibre executives who can drive the business forward and
increase shareholder value. To meet this objective, the Company follows three key principles:
> Total rewards are designed to be competitive, with the remuneration package of each Executive Director benchmarked
regularly against the market.
> Incentive-based rewards are seen as an important part of each Executive Director’s total remuneration and are designed 
to drive and reward exceptional performance.
> Long-term incentive arrangements are designed to align the interests of the Executive Directors and senior managers with
those of the shareholders and to support the Company’s business strategy.
Reward structure
The Executive Directors’ total remuneration packages consist of:
> Base salary.
> Annual performance bonus.
> Long-term incentive arrangements.
> Other benefits and allowances.
32
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Management and governance
Remuneration report
Anite Group plc
The Executive Directors make their own pension arrangements and the Group makes no payment in this respect.
Base salary
Base salary is set with reference to salary levels for similar roles in other comparable companies in the software and computer
services sector and the market generally. The factors for comparability are based on market sector, size and business complexity.
Annual performance bonus
The Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus plan. If stretching targets are achieved, participants receive a cash bonus of
up to 75% of salary. For exceptional performance (as determined by the Remuneration Committee), payment of a further 25% of
base salary may be made. The targets used for determining the amount of bonus payable are a combination of stretching business
performance targets and the assessment of an individual’s performance during the year. Details of bonus plan awards for the year
ended 30 April 2007 are included in the table of Directors emoluments on page 35.
The Company intends to implement a new annual bonus plan for Executive Directors with effect from 1 May 2007. The terms 
of the new bonus plan are currently being finalised and full disclosure will be made in the Committee’s report in 2008.
Long-term incentive arrangements
The Company operates the following two long-term share-based incentive plans both of which were approved by shareholders 
in 2005:
> The Performance Share Plan (“PSP”).
> The Share Matching Plan (“SMP”).
Under the PSP an individual may receive an award of shares worth up to 100% of salary per annum (although in exceptional
circumstances an award of up to 200% of salary may be made). The awards are made as conditional awards of free shares.
The Executive Directors and a small number of the most senior executives are also able to participate in the SMP. This currently
allows them to lodge in the SMP shares worth up to 30% per annum of base salary, which are then matched on a two for one
(gross) basis.
The awards are subject to three-year performance conditions. The awards made so far under the plans have been subject to 
a total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance condition which measures the Company’s TSR performance against a comparator
group comprising the constituents of the FTSE All-Share software and computer services sector over a single three-year
performance period commencing on the first day of the financial year in which the award is made. 25% of the award will vest 
if the Company is ranked at the median at the end of the performance period, with 100% of the award vesting if the Company 
is at or above the upper quartile (with straight-line vesting in between). However, before any awards vest, the Committee must
have satisfied itself that the Company’s underlying financial performance over the performance period warrants the level of
vesting determined by reference to the TSR performance condition.
The extent to which the performance condition is satisfied will be calculated by external consultants to ensure the appropriate
level of third-party verification.
To provide a further alignment of interest with shareholders, the Executive Directors and others participating in the SMP are
required to retain in shares an amount equal in value to 50% of the after-tax gain made on the vesting of awards until they 
have built up a shareholding equal to 100% of base salary.
The Committee has recently reviewed the operation of the PSP and SMP and is proposing to make several changes to these plans.
Details of these changes are contained in the AGM Notice that has been circulated to shareholders.
The Executive Directors also participate in the Savings Related Share Option Scheme and the Share Incentive Plan. 
The use of new issue or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under the share plans is subject to a 15% dilution limit in any
ten-year period. The current potential dilution is below this level. The Committee, aware of shareholders’ views in connection with
this issue, continues to take active steps to control the dilutive affect of the Company’s share incentives and is currently working
under an informal dilution limit of 13%.

Other benefits and allowances
Executive Directors are entitled to a car allowance, fuel, medical insurance, death-in-service and permanent health insurance,
together with reasonable business expenses.
Other share plans
Following the acquisition of Anite Finland Limited (formerly Nemo Technologies Ltd) on 30 November 2006, the Company
introduced a Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”) for key employees. The MIP is not available to Executive Directors and all awards
are settled using market purchase shares or a cash equivalent. Further details of the MIP are contained in note 7 on page 60.
Service contracts
The Committee’s policy is that all Executive Directors’ service contracts will be rolling contracts of one year’s duration. Other than
in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct, the provisions of service contracts will be honoured in full. Information regarding the
Executive Directors’ service contracts is summarised in the table below.
Executive Director Date of contract Notice period
Christopher Humphrey 3 February 2003 12 months
Steve Rowley 3 November 2003 12 months
Executive Directors are not permitted to hold external non-executive directorships or offices without the approval of the Board.
No Executive Director received any fees in respect of any external non-executive directorship that they have held during the year.
The table below sets out the rights the Company has to pay Executive Directors in lieu of notice together with the contractual
compensation payable if the Company terminates the contract (other than for cause) without notice.

1 Contractual benefits include the annual performance bonus the Executive Director would have received had he continued to be employed from the date of termination
until the expiry of the notice period.
2 Payments cease, in effect, if the executive director commences employment with a new employer during the payment period.
Furthermore, for a period of six months following a change of control in the Company, Steve Rowley may terminate his employment
on 28 days’ notice at which point he will be entitled to the same payments as set out in the table above (which, as can be seen,
shall not exceed 12 months’ remuneration).
The Company is aware of the provisions in the Combined Code which state that compensation payments should reflect a departing
Director’s obligation to mitigate his loss. However, the Company has adopted the above described approach to determining 
the compensation that is payable in the event that an Executive Director’s service contract is terminated as it believes that 
it is in shareholders’ interests that the obligations of each party in such circumstances are transparent and agreed in advance
to provide certainty.

Remuneration report
Anite Group plc
If the Company terminates an Executive Director’s employment without cause, the Remuneration Committee will be asked to
exercise any discretion it has under the terms of any share incentive plans in favour of the departing Executive Director. If the
Remuneration Committee determines not to follow this recommendation, the departing Executive Director shall be entitled
to damages.
Non-Executive Directors
Clay Brendish has a three-year term of office with six months’ notice of termination required by either party. Peter Bertram and
David Hurst-Brown each have a three-year term of office with no notice period or provision for compensation for loss of office.
The Board reviews the Independent Non-Executive Directors’ fees annually, in the course of which it compares fees paid 
to Non-Executive Directors of comparable companies. Fees recognise the additional responsibilities undertaken by the
Non-Executive Directors in chairing the Board and its Committees. In addition to their fees, the Non-Executive Directors 
are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
The Chairman’s fees are set by the Remuneration Committee. He is not present at any discussion of his own remuneration.

Report of the Audit Committee
Anite Group plc
Membership
The Audit Committee is a committee of the Board and comprises the Non-Executive Directors who are independent 
of management and free from any business or other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their
independent judgement.
During the year, membership of the Committee was as follows:
Peter Bertram (Chairman)
Clay Brendish
David Hurst-Brown
Both Peter Bertram and David Hurst-Brown are considered by the Board to be “independent” as defined by Provision A.3.1 of 
the Combined Code. Clay Brendish was considered to meet the independence criteria on his appointment as Chairman of the
Company on 4 October 2005. Mr Bertram is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
The Board considers that Mr Bertram has recent and relevant financial experience.
The Group provides an induction programme and ongoing training for Audit Committee members.
The Committee invites others, including the external auditors, the Group Finance Director and the Financial Controller, to attend
its meetings as appropriate. The Company Secretary is the Secretary to the Committee.
Meetings 
During the period under review the Committee met four times. Details of attendance at each meeting are shown in the table 
in the corporate governance report on page 27.
The Committee meets with the external auditors without any executive directors present whenever this is considered appropriate.
Role, responsibilities and terms of reference
The Committee’s role is to assist the Board in the effective discharge of its responsibilities for financial reporting and
internal review.
The Committee’s responsibilities include:
> reviewing the annual and interim financial statements and results announcements of the Company, and any other formal
announcements relating to the Company’s financial performance;
> reviewing the Company’s accounting policies;
> monitoring and reviewing the Company’s systems of internal control and risk management;
> monitoring and reviewing the Company’s “whistleblowing” procedures;
> monitoring and reviewing the requirement for an internal audit function;
> considering the appointment of the Company’s external auditors, overseeing the process for their selection and making
recommendations to the Board in relation to their appointment; and
> overseeing the relationship with the external auditor, including approval of their remuneration, agreeing the scope of the audit
engagement, assessing their independence, monitoring the provision of non-audit services, and considering their reports on the
Company’s financial statements and systems of internal control and risk management.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference, which can be found on the Company’s website.
Internal audit
The Committee agreed in July 2006 to create an internal review function, headed by a member of the Group finance team, who,
under the control of the Audit Committee, carries out a plan of detailed reviews throughout the operating companies. Where
additional resource is required, this is sourced either from an external professional firm or by selecting divisional staff who carry
out peer reviews in divisions other than their own. This internal review function does not represent an independent internal audit
function as defined by professional internal audit standards, but has been a significant enhancement in the Group’s internal
control framework.
Independence of external auditors
The Committee keeps under review the relationship with the external auditors including:
> the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, taking into account the relevant UK professional and regulatory
requirements and the relationship with the auditors as a whole, including the provision of non-audit and consulting services; and
> the consideration of audit fees and any fees for non-audit and consulting services.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
Anite Group plc Financial statements
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The Directors are required by the IAS
Regulation to prepare the Group financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the
European Union and have also elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by
the European Union. The financial statements are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions,
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses
set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s “Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial
statements”. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. 
However, Directors are also required to:
> properly select and apply accounting policies;
> present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and 
> provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial
performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
to the members of Anite Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
We have audited the Group financial statements of Anite Group plc for the year ended 30 April 2007 which comprise the consolidated
Group income statement, the consolidated Group balance sheet, the consolidated Group cash flow statement, the consolidated Group
statement of changes in equity and the related notes 1 to 33. These Group financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial statements of Anite Group plc for the year ended 30 April 2007. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ remuneration report and the Group financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European
Union are set out in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, whether the Group financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and
whether the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report is
consistent with the Group financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ report includes that specific information
presented in the Chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5, the Chief Executive’s review on pages 6 to 10, the financial review on
pages 12 to 19 and the report on corporate governance on pages 25 to 31, that is cross referred from the business review section 
of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit,
or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
2003 Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does 
not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described in the contents section and consider whether it is consistent
with the audited Group financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the
Directors’ remuneration report, and the corporate governance statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not
extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity
or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the
state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 April 2007 and of its profit for the year then ended;
> the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation; 
> the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985; and
> the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the Group financial statements.

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT
for the year ended 30 April 2007
Financial statements
Consolidated cash flow statement
Anite Group plc NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
1 Statement of accounting policies
a) General information
Anite Group plc is a company incorporated in United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The consolidated financial
statements of the Company for the year ended 30 April 2007 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to 
as the “Group”). The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are described in note 13. The financial statements
were authorised for issue by the Directors on 9 July 2007. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because 
that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
b) Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
adopted by the European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations and those
parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. Therefore the Group financial statements comply
with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulations.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain
financial instruments. 
i) Critical accounting assumptions and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting assumptions. It also
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas requiring 
a higher degree of judgement, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements,
are discussed in the relevant accounting policies under the following headings:
1 Goodwill (note 1(e))
2 Intangible assets (note 1(f)(ii and iii))
3 Revenue recognition (note 1(k))
4 Taxation (note 1(l))
5 Employee benefits – share-based compensation (note1(m))
6 Provisions (note 1(p))
ii) IFRIC Interpretations and amendments/new IFRS
The IFRIC interpretations and amendments to published standards that are effective in 2007 and those that are not yet effective
are discussed in note 1(t).
The accounting policies set out herein have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial
statements.The transition date for the application of IFRS for the Group was 1 May 2004. 
c) Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company, 
all of which are made up to 30 April each year. The results of companies acquired or sold during the year are consolidated for the
periods from or to the date on which control passed. Control is achieved where the Company has the power, directly or indirectly,
to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control,
potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. Acquisitions are accounted for under
the acquisition method.
The results of subsidiaries disposed in the year are included in the consolidated income statement up to the effective date
of disposal.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date 
of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised 
as goodwill. Any deficit in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on
acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into 
line with those used by the Group. All inter-company transactions and balances between Group enterprises are eliminated
on consolidation.
d) Foreign currency
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of
the transaction. At each balance sheet date monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet
date, are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that
are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
The exchange differences arising on retranslation are taken to the income statement, except for exchange differences arising on
non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.

Notes to the accounts
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 1 Statement of accounting policies continued
d) Foreign currency continued
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at
the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of
overseas operations and on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the Group’s investment in such operations,
are recognised directly in the hedging and translation reserve account (“other reserves”).
The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS 
as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
e) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in
the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal or closure of a previously acquired business, the attributable amount of goodwill previously written off to reserves 
is included in determining the profit or loss on disposal or closure.
Goodwill arising prior to the transition to IFRS has been recognised and measured in accordance with UK GAAP.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the value in use of the
cash-generating units (“CGU”) to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation includes estimates about the
future financial performance of the cash-generating units, including management’s estimates of long-term operating margins 
and long-term growth rates. The carrying amount of goodwill and the key assumptions used in the calculation of value in use 
of CGUs to which goodwill is attributed are disclosed in note 10.
f) Intangible assets
i) Software licences
Software licences are initially measured at cost. Cost includes the purchase price of the assets and the directly attributable costs
of bringing the asset into its intended use. After initial recognition, the intangible asset is carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation less any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is charged evenly over the assets’ estimated useful life.
ii) Separately identifiable intangible assets arising on business combinations
Separately identifiable intangible assets such as customer relations, technology and in process R&D are recognised only when the
assets meet the following conditions: 
a) meet the separately identifiable criteria below;
b) are controlled by the acquiring company;
c) provide a probable source of future economic benefits; and
d) the fair value can be measured reliably.
The criteria to be separately identifiable are met when the intangible asset:
i) is capable of being separated from the acquired business; and
ii) arises from contractual or legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the acquired
company or other rights and obligations.
The amortisation period ranges from five to ten years and is based on equal annual instalments over the assets’ estimated useful life.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The assessment of the future economic benefits generated by these separately identifiable intangible assets and the
determination of its amortisation profile involve a significant degree of judgement based on management estimation of future
potential revenue and profit and the useful life of the assets. Reviews are performed regularly to ensure the recoverability of these
intangible assets.
iii) Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities as defined in IFRS is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on internally-generated intangible assets arising from the Group’s development activities is recognised only when
both the identification and recognition criteria as defined in IAS38 for an intangible asset and the following six criteria are met:
45
Financial statements
Notes to the accounts
Anite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED
1 Statement of accounting policies continued
iii) Research and development expenditure continued
1 the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it will be available for use has been achieved;
2 the Group has the intention to complete the asset and use or sell it;
3 the Group has the ability to use or sell the asset;
4 it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;
5 adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to complete the development and to use or sell the asset; and
6 the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
If these conditions are not met, such development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
The qualifying expenditure capitalised represents costs directly attributable to the development of the asset. This expenditure is
capitalised from the point at which the above criteria are met up to the point at which the product is in use. Internally-generated
intangible assets including capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which
management estimate to be no more than three years.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The assessment that the internally generated assets will generate future economic benefits rely on the management’s estimation 
of future cash flow streams of these assets. The technical feasibility of the assets involves a degree of management’s judgement
when this is achieved.
Management assessment regarding the useful lives of capitalised development costs is based upon the typical product life cycle
for similar assets in the market adjusted by the risks associated with each capitalised development project.
g) Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
Land and buildings, office equipment and fixtures and fittings, computer equipment and vehicles are stated at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets and freehold properties, at rates calculated to write off the cost over the
estimated useful lives, on a straight-line basis, as follows:
Freehold properties 2% per annum of cost excluding land
Short leasehold properties Length of lease
Office equipment and fixtures and fittings 10% to 50% per annum of cost
Vehicles 25% per annum of cost
Computer equipment 33% per annum of cost
Costs relating to short leasehold properties, office equipment and fixtures and fittings and motor vehicles are included in the
“plant, fixtures, equipment and motor vehicles” category (see note 12).
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
h) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which
the asset belongs. Any tangible or intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever
there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an
expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated 
as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. 
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, 
in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.

i) Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
j) Inventories and work in progress
Inventories and short-term work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs include materials and,
where relevant, direct labour and appropriate overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories and work in progress
to their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of
completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
k) Revenue recognition
Revenue from sale of software relates mainly to perpetual licences, which provide the customer with the right to use the Group’s
products. Where any associated services are not essential to the functionality of the software then the software revenue is
recognised when the following conditions are met:
> persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists;
> the Company’s fee is fixed or determinable; and
> collection is probable.
Revenue is recognised on delivery with a retention to be recognised on acceptance or otherwise as performance is defined in the
relevant customer contract.
Revenue generated from fixed-priced contracts, including relevant licence fees where service essential to the functionality of the
software is being performed, is recognised on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the contract. Provision is made for
any expected losses on uncompleted contracts. Amounts recoverable on fixed priced contracts, which are included in debtors, are
stated at the net sales value of the work done less amounts received as progress payments on account. Excess progress payments
are included in creditors as payments on account. Cumulative costs incurred, net of amounts transferred to cost of sales, less
provisions for contingencies and anticipated future losses on contracts, are included as fixed-priced contract balances in work
in progress. All bid costs are expensed.
Contracts which meet the definition of construction contract, are disclosed separately as “amount due from construction customers”
in “trade and other receivables” or “amount due to construction customers” in “trade and other payables”, as required under
IAS 11 “Construction Contracts”. See note 22 for more details.
Revenue generated from time and material contracts is recognised in line with when the work is performed.
Maintenance revenue is generally recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the related agreement, taking into account
any free maintenance periods.
Managed services revenue is recognised over the life of the contract. Costs incurred on a contract from third parties, which are
directly related to the contract, are capitalised and recognised over the life of the contract. Contract profitability is regularly
reviewed and if necessary provision for any forecast loss arising is made. Sales, operational and administrative costs are written 
off as incurred.
All finance income is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it arises.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The revenue and profit of fixed price contracts is recognised on a percentage of completion basis when the outcome of a contract
can be estimated reliably. Management exercises judgement in determining whether a contract’s outcome can be estimated
reliably. Management also makes estimates of the total cost of professional services, or in some instances total contract costs,
which are used in determining the value of amounts recoverable on contracts and any related provisions required for onerous
contracts. Estimates are continually revised based on changes in the facts relating to each contract.
Management has exercised a degree of judgement in formulating a set of criteria used for determining when revenue that
involves several elements should be recognised on a bundled or unbundled basis.
l) T axation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible. The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Anite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED
1 Statement of accounting policies continued
l) T axation continued
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither 
the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity,
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
In recognising income tax assets and liabilities, management makes estimates of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities
on transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain. Where the final outcome of such matters is different,
or expected to be different, from previous assessments made by management, a change to the carrying value of income tax assets
and liabilities will be recorded in the period in which such a determination is made. The carrying values of current tax and deferred
tax assets and liabilities are disclosed separately in the consolidated balance sheet.
m) Employee benefits
i) Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to
state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s
obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme. The Group 
has no defined benefit schemes.
ii) Share-based compensation
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payments”. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2
has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group operates several equity-settled share-based payments plans for its employees. The fair value of shares determined at the
grant date of the equity-settled share-based payment is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group operates an Inland Revenue approved employee share option scheme (“SAYE scheme”), which allows employees the
ability to purchase the Group’s ordinary shares at a discount of the current market value. The Group records an expense, based on
its best estimate of the fair value of the discount related to shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group has granted executive options, which include approved option plans and long-term incentive plans. The grant price 
is normally equal to the average quoted market price of the Group shares on the date of grant. The vesting period is generally
three to ten years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest, unless the employee meets certain
“good leaver” conditions.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The fair value of the SAYE scheme and executive option scheme is measured by using the Black-Scholes and a stochastic model,
namely the Monte-Carlo pricing model, respectively. The total amount of this fair value to be expensed rateably over the vesting
period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options at the grant date, excluding the impact of any non-market
vesting conditions (such as profit targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of
options that are expected to become exercisable or the number of shares that the employee will ultimately receive. This estimate
is revised at each balance sheet date and the difference is charged or credited to the income statement, with a corresponding
adjustment to equity.
Market vesting conditions such as TSR targets are factored into the fair value of the option and therefore no subsequent
adjustments will be made if performance conditions are not met. The proceeds received on exercise of the options, net of 
any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to equity. For more details on the assumptions made in the valuation,
see note 7.

n) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
i) Trade and other debtors
Trade and other debtors do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
ii) Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade-date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract
whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially
measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Investments are classified as either held-for-trading or available-for-sale, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss
for the period.
For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the
security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity
is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
iii) Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
iv) Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges,
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the
income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent 
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
v) Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
vi) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
o) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts and all such instruments, if used by the Group are for hedging
purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure to the Group in line with the Group’s risk management policies.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, 
at the forward contract rate. At the balance sheet date unhedged monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at that date.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written
principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Cash flow hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments (note 24) that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash
flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash
flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the
asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are
included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a
liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects
net profit or loss.
Fair value hedge
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable
to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in profit or loss. Gains or losses from remeasuring the derivative, or for
non-derivatives the foreign currency component of its carrying amount, are recognised in profit or loss. Changes in the fair value
of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
49
Financial statements
Notes to the accounts
Anite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED
1 Statement of accounting policies continued
Discontinued hedge accounting
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in
equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain 
or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges (note 24). Any gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve; 
the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Gains or losses deferred in the
foreign currency translation reserve are recognised immediately in profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation.
In accordance with IAS 39, where hedging instruments are designated into hedging relationships, the recognition of the
instruments as current or non-current will follow that of the hedged item.
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks
and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with
unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
p) Provisions
Provisions for warranties, onerous contracts, vacant properties with outstanding leases to settle, restructuring costs and legal
claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events. This is where, 
in management’s view, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the
amount has been reliably estimated. Restructuring provisions comprise unexpired future lease payments, employee termination
payments and removal costs. Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for 
the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Deferred consideration provision is management’s best estimate of the contingent consideration payable to vendors, which may
be subject to change as this is dependent on the fulfilment of certain performance targets of the businesses acquired.
Provision is established on a property-by-property basis to meet the estimated liabilities, including dilapidations. The provision
covers all ongoing unavoidable costs net of rental income. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
q) Operating profit from continuing operations
Operating profit from continuing operations is stated after charging restructuring costs but before finance income or charges 
and before gains or losses relating to disposed businesses.
r) Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in
the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the
lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged
directly against income, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance
with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs (see above).
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the
lease term.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

Anite Group plc Financial statements
Notes to the accounts
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 1 Statement of accounting policies continued
s) Assets and disposal groups held for sale
Assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset 
(or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within 
one year from the date of classification.
Assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the assets’ previous carrying amount and 
fair value less costs to sell.
t) Adoption of IFRIC Interpretations, new and amendments to IFRS
– Applicable for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006:
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards, interpretations and amendments thereto were
issued that are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006. Management assessed the

† Expected life for other share-based payments are 100% of options are exercised after three years if a gain of 10% is available. If this gain is not available, options
are held until such a gain can be made. Any remaining options are exercised at maturity providing that they are “in the money”. For LTIP – profit element only, 
5% per annum leavers in the first three years was assumed.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the following periods
(expected life) up to grant date: Other share-based schemes – three years and SAYE three, four and five years for three, four and
five year contracts respectively. The period of exceptional volatility for the period from 30 September 1999 to 24 July 2002 was
removed from the volatility calculations. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability,
exercise restrictions and behavioural consideration. The employers’ NIC liability on the outstanding awards at 30 April 2007 was
£422,000 (2006: £259,000) which is fully provided for in the accounts.
The Group recognised total expenses of £1,916,000 (2006: £1,208,000) related to equity-settled share-based payment
transactions during the year. The share-based liability on the MIP scheme is £30,000 (2006: £nil).

Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units (CGU) are determined from value in use calculations or management’s
review of the recoverable amount. The CGU is typically the combination of a group of assets acquired which cannot be separately
identified, within each primary segment of the Group. The key assumptions for these calculations are as follows:
1 Discount rate – the pre-tax rate used to discount the operating profit projections was 10%, which reflects the current market
assessments of the risk of the CGU.
2 Operating profit projections are derived from recently approved budgets, three year plans, management’s view of the
recoverable amount based on observable market prices for the CGU and have assumed the terminal growth rate to be zero.
The impairment loss in the year ended 30 April 2006 related to GMO Management Consulting GmbH, which was disposed 
of during the current year (note 3(b)).

3 Deferred consideration accrued is the Company’s best estimate of the contingent consideration payable to vendors, which may subject to change as this is
dependent on the fulfilment of certain performance targets of the businesses acquired. This amount was discounted to its current value in accordance with 
IFRS3 – Business Combinations.
There were no acquisitions in 2006.
Nemo Technologies Ltd (renamed Anite Finland Ltd)
Nemo contributed £6.9m (110.3m) to Group revenue and £2.0m (12.9m) to Group profit before tax for the period between
1 December 2006 and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of Nemo business had been completed on the first day of the financial year, its contribution to revenues and
operating profit (excluding amortisation of acquired intangible assets and financing costs) for the 12 months to 30 April 2007
would have been £14.5m (121.4m) and £4.4m (16.5m) respectively.
Invenova Corporation
Invenova contributed £1.0m (US$2.0m) revenue for the period between 30 January 2007 and the balance sheet date and £2.0m
(US$4.0m) for the 12 months to 30 April 2007. It is not practical to identify the profit before tax for this business for the post
acquisition period or for the 12 months ended 30 April 2007 as it was fully integrated within the Wireless businesses from the
date of acquisition.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. The trade receivables
do not include any advances or retentions at 30 April 2007 (2006: £nil).
The Group’s credit risk on trade and other receivables is primarily attributable to trade debtors, accrued income and amounts
recoverable on contracts.
The amounts presented in the table above are net of allowances for doubtful recoverability and foreseeable losses. The Group 
has no significant concentrations of credit risk since the risk is spread over a large number of unrelated counterparties.

Cash deposit held in escrow 8,197 –
This cash deposit of £8.2m (112.0m) is held in an escrow account was for the purpose of meeting the maximum contingent
consideration payable to the vendors of the Nemo business purchased during the year, upon the satisfaction of certain 
contingent consideration conditions as set out in the sale and purchase agreement. The contingent consideration period ends 
on 31 December 2007 and the consideration amount is payable within 90 days from this date. This euro denominated cash 
was invested on a floating-rate basis at market rate and is therefore subject to cash flow interest and foreign currency risks.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of the cash deposit held in escrow approximates its fair value.

The current and non-current bank loans comprise a £50.0m (2006: £nil) fixed-term loan and £0.561m of unamortised issue costs
being amortised over the period of the loan.
The loan was taken out on 30 November 2006 under a borrowing facility (see note 25 for more details). Repayment commences
on 30 November 2007 and will continue until 30 November 2011, being the date of maturity. This loan is secured by a fixed and
floating charge on the Group’s assets. This loan carries a weighted average floating interest rate of 6.2% and exposes the Group to
cash flow interest rate risk. This interest rate risk was partly hedged by the Group using derivative financial instruments (note 24).
The bank loans are initially measured at fair value and, net of transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The average effective
interest rates for this loan was 6.71%.

Cash flow hedges – interest rate swaps and caps
The Group uses interest rate swaps and caps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
At 30 April 2007, the interest rate swaps with notional principal amounts totalling £20.0m (2006: £nil) have fixed interest rate
payments at an average rate of 5.535% and have floating interest receipts at LIBOR rate for periods up until 31 October 2011.
At 30 April 2007, the details of the interest rate caps contracts were as follow:
i) notional principal amount £7.5m (2006: £nil) and interest rates are capped at 6.25% for periods up until 31 January 2008; and
ii) notional principal amount £5.0m (2006: £nil) and interest rates are capped at 6.25% for periods up until 31 January 2009.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps and caps as shown above are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the
balance sheet date. All these interest rate swaps and caps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value
thereof has been deferred in equity. The net amount of the swaps and caps that has been expensed against hedged interest
payments made in the period is less than £300.
Net investment hedges – cross currency swaps
The Group has overseas subsidiaries which operate mainly in North America, Northern Europe and Asia Pacific and whose
revenues and expenses are denominated in their local currencies. The Group has hedged part of its net investment in overseas
subsidiaries through natural hedges and utilisation of cross currency swaps.
At the balance sheet date, the currency split of the mark-to-market values of cross currency swaps, including the exchange 
of principals was 1138.4m (£94.6m) (2006: £nil) and £92.8m (2006: £nil). The fixed interest rates on these cross currency swaps,
range from 3.83% to 5.22% and the floating interest rates are based on LIBOR (sterling) and EURIBOR (euro).
The fair value change on the cross currency swaps which is 100% effective against the hedged item is recognised in the foreign
currency/hedging reserve.

25 Financial risk management
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities mainly comprise bank borrowings, some cash and liquid resources, derivative financial
instruments, deferred consideration for acquisitions and various items, such as trade receivables and payables that arise directly
from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and foreign currency
risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
i) Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations and acquisitions through a mixture of reserves and bank borrowings and this policy is reviewed
from time to time. The Group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and manages the interest rate risk by
selectively using interest rate swaps and caps. Any surplus cash is converted into sterling and is invested in short-term money
market and bank deposits at the prevailing rates of interest in order to achieve the market rate of return.
Maturity profile
The maturity profile based on the timing of the cash flow of financial assets and liabilities is presented below:
Other financial instruments of the Group, that are not included in the table are non-interest bearing.

The UK companies are part of a Group set off arrangement with Lloyds TSB Bank Plc. The interest rate is based on 1% per annum
over the bank’s base rate for its sterling accounts and 1% per annum over the bank’s relevant short-term offered rate for any
other currency accounts. The weighted average floating interest rate of sterling financial liabilities in 2007 was linked to LIBOR
plus 80 basis points for bank loans. The basis points vary (between 0.60 points and 1.05 points) dependent on the ratio of net
debt to EBITDA, reviewed annually.
All vendor loan notes were repaid during the year. The weighted average interest rate on these loan notes was 5.5% (2006: 5.5%).
There were no outstanding finance lease transactions at the year end. The fixed interest rates on finance leases repaid in the year
was £nil (2006: range from 6.2% to 14%). Just after Nemo was acquired, the business settled its finance lease with its previous
parent company.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from the book value recorded at 30 April 2007 and 2006.

Anite Group plc Financial statements
Notes to the accounts
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 25 Financial risk management continued
Credit risk
The Group’s policy is to ensure that all credit customers are subject to credit verification procedures and receivables are
monitored closely on a regular basis so that the Group is exposed to minimum level of bad debts.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk on the other financial assets including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and derivatives
instruments arises only from default of the counterparties, i.e. the financial institutions.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance and continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and
bank syndicated facilities.
The Group’s UK overdraft facility was renewed during the year and agreed at £10.0m (net). The amount drawn down under this
facility at 30 April 2007 was £nil (2006: £0.5m). The next scheduled review date is 31 January 2008.
The Group had a committed syndicated revolving credit facility agreement with two UK banks of £20.0m which expired on 
31 August 2006.
In preparation for the acquisition of Nemo Technologies, the Group entered into a new five-year syndicated facility on 31 October
2006 which was underwritten in full by Lloyds TSB Bank Plc. This facility consists of a Term loan of £50.0m repayable at £5.0m 
per annum until 30 November 2010, with the balance due on 30 November 2011, and a revolving credit facility of £40.0m. 
The amount of undrawn facilities, at 30 April 2007 was £40.0m and total undrawn facilities including the overdraft facility was
£50.0m. The revolving credit facility incurs commitment fees at market rates.
This facility is available to be drawn to support the general corporate purposes for the Group including working capital
requirements.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has overseas subsidiaries which operate mainly in North America, Northern Europe and Asia Pacific and whose
revenues and expenses are denominated in their local currencies. The Group currently partly hedges its investment in overseas
subsidiaries through financial instruments and natural hedges.
The table below shows the Group’s currency exposures arising from those transactional (or non-structural) exposures that give
rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets
and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved. As at
30 April 2007 these exposures were as follows:

Deferred tax assets in respect of future goodwill amortisation and losses carried forward in certain companies have not been
recognised because at present it is not envisaged that there will be sufficient taxable profits in those companies from which future
reversal of these reliefs can be deducted. The unutilised reliefs may be carried forward indefinitely.

£000 £000
Temporary differences in respect of which no deferred tax has been recognised
Undistributed earnings of subsidiaries 9,863 4,192
Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted
earnings of certain overseas subsidiaries. No provision is required since the Group is in a position to control the timing of the
reversal of these differences and either it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future or no tax 
is payable on the reversal.
No provision has been made for taxation of £983,000 (2006: £983,000) in respect of chargeable gains rolled over because at
present there is no commitment to dispose of the replacement assets.

The provision for deferred consideration represents the Group’s best estimate of the potential liability for cash contingent
consideration payments in respect of the Nemo (£5.4m) and Invenova (£3.0m) businesses acquired during the year (note 14).
The warranty provision has been made to cover any potential claims made by disposed businesses during the contractual 
warranty period. The release of warranty provision of £1.1m was in respect of a previously disposed business no longer required.
The amount established of £1.46m represented the Company’s best estimate of a claim in respect of a previously disposed
business. The net charge of £0.36m is included in the “loss on disposal of previously disposed businesses” in note 3b –
discontinued operations.
The Group disposed of Cray Communications Inc on 4 September 1996. The transaction also involved the disposal of a pension
plan which may now be underfunded. The Group agreed to retain certain obligations for the plan for five years from the date 
of disposal and, following expiry of the warranty period brought action to seek a declaratory judgement that it has no further
obligations to fund the plan and also to release monies held in escrow of US$0.5m. In March 2007 the Group’s action, originally
filed in July 2005, was reinstated and the defendants have applied to the court to stay discovery pending a final determination
of liability from the Pension Board Guarantee Corporation (PBGC). The Group has received legal advice that has confirmed that
the Group has no liability for the deficit. However, final determination by the PBGC has not yet been made. Based on the legal
advice received, no provision has been made for any liability under the scheme. The escrow contingent asset will only be recognised
once final confirmation of the release has been received.
The property provision is in respect of all properties surplus to business requirements and dilapidation provisions for properties
currently in use. The provision is calculated in accordance with IAS 37 as disclosed in note 1 to the accounts. The dilapidation
provisions for properties established during the year were £1.0m which were capitalised in “property, plant and equipment” 
and will be charged to income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the relevant property lease.
The onerous contract provision was provided in 2004 and 2005 in respect of the Pericles and State of Victoria (“SoV”) contractual
commitments. A further £12.0m provision was made in 2006 to cover the costs of settlement with the customer and restructuring
costs of SoV. In the year, £0.4m (2006: £0.5m) and £11.4m (2006: £5.0m) was utilised in respect of the Pericles and SoV contracts
respectively. 
Other provisions included a provision of £0.3m disposed as part of the disposal of the assets and liabilities of Anite Opentur S.r.l
(note 3(a)).

An interim dividend of 0.25p per share was paid on 16 May 2007.

31 Contingent liabilities
There are contingent Group liabilities that arise in the normal course of business in respect of indemnities, warranties, guarantees
and legal claims. However, the Directors consider that none of these claims is expected to result in a material gain or loss to
the Group.
32 Related party transactions
a) Key management personnel
The details of key management remuneration are disclosed in the remuneration report.
b) Related party transactions
The Board is not aware of any related party transactions that should be disclosed apart from the details below:
i) On 6 November 2006, Anite Holding GmbH (a subsidiary undertaking of Anite Group plc) sold its shareholding in GMO
Management Consulting GmbH (“GMO MC”), the smallest of its two IT consultancy businesses based in Germany, to 
Dr K Spiller, the managing director of GMO MC, for a cash consideration of £0.1m. Prior to completion the capital reserve 
of £0.7m was paid to Anite. See note 3(c) for more details.
ii) On 29 March 2007, Reilrop BV (a subsidiary undertaking of Anite Group plc) sold its shareholding in Anite Opentur S.r.l.
(“Opentur”) based in Italy to Enzo Ghirardi, the managing director of Opentur for a cash consideration of £92,700 (1136,500),
before disposal expenses of £33,900 (150,000), including the purchase of a £1.585m (12.335m) inter-company balance owed
to another Group company.
iii) No guarantees have been provided to any related parties (other than between Anite Group plc and its subsidiaries, which are
related parties).
iv) Transactions between Anite Group plc and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation.
33 Post balance sheet event
On 9 July 2007, the Group disposed of Anite Deutschland Management GmbH (“Anite Deutschland”) and its subsidiaries to 
Vega Group plc for a total consideration of £8.0m payable in cash on completion. At 30 April 2007, the Directors considered that
the sale was not highly probable and therefore did not qualify as a held for sale disposal group or as a discontinued operation. 
The results of Anite Deutschland were the only results in the International Consulting segment shown in note 2.3. The results 
will be presented as a discontinued operation in the 2008 financial statements.

Five-year summary
Anite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
FIVE-YEAR SUMMARY INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
to the members of Anite Group plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Anite Group plc for the year ended 30 April 2007 which comprise
the balance sheet, the cash flow statement, the statement of changes in equity and the related notes 1 to 16. These parent
company financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Anite Group plc for the year ended 30 April 2007 and on the
information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the parent company financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the
statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the
parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report 
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the parent company financial
statements. The information given in the Directors’ report includes that specific information presented in the Chairman’s statement
on pages 4 and 5, the Chief Executive’s review on pages 6 to10, the financial review on pages 12 to 19 and the report on
corporate governance on pages 25 to 31, that is cross referred from the business review section of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described in the contents section and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited parent company financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ report, 
the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s operational review and the financial review. We consider the implications for 
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent company financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company
financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the
preparation of the parent company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union
as applied in accordance with provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 30 April 2007;
> the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
> the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the parent company financial statements.

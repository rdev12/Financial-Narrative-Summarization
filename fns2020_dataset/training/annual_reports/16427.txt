Performance
We are pleased to have 
delivered another year of 
good performance in what 
remains a difficult economic 
environment for customers 
in the North West of 
England. Underpinning all we 
do is our vision of becoming 
a leading North West service 
provider and one of the best 
UK water and wastewater 
companies and we have 
made progress against this 
objective on a broad front.
High levels of customer satisfaction 
remain our core objective. We have 
again delivered a year of improvement 
as measured by our regulator, Ofwat’s, 
Service Incentive Mechanism (SIM). 
This places us as one of the most 
improved companies for customer 
satisfaction over the last three years. 
Whilst comparison with other 
water and sewerage companies is 
an important benchmark for us, we 
recognise that customer expectations 
are often set by standards of service 
delivered by other companies 
operating in the North West. So 
we conduct a brand tracker survey 
and we are happy to ﬁnd ourselves 
consistently ranked third out of ten 
leading companies, just behind the 
respected brands of John Lewis  
and Marks & Spencer. 
Even so, we don’t always get it right, 
and customer satisfaction will remain 
an area of focus for us – reducing 
service failure beneﬁts both customers 
and shareholders.  
Targeted investment in our people, 
assets and processes is delivering 
results and we are ahead of 
schedule in delivering our regulatory 
outperformance targets.
Asset serviceability has again been 
stable or improving over the last twelve 
months and we have met our leakage 
target for the eighth consecutive year. 
Water quality over the year reﬂects our 
best performance for many years. The 
Environment Agency assessed us as 
an  upper quartile company in 2012/13, 
and we have made more progress over 
the last twelve months.
Much of our capital programme of over 
£3.5 billion for the period 2010–15 
supports renewal and upgrade of our 
asset base to maintain serviceability 
but a signiﬁcant proportion also 
delivers our capability to meet 
new environmental standards. We 
delivered our largest annual capital 
programme for a decade, investing 
£836 million – £49 million more than 
the previous year – in areas that 
included contributions to river and 
bathing water quality and inspecting 
the Haweswater aqueduct for the 
ﬁrst time since it was built in the mid 
1900s. We measure the effectiveness 
of our investment using our Time, Cost 
and Quality index, TCQi, and we scored 
98 per cent for the year – ahead of our 
targets and a signiﬁcant improvement 
on our performance of three years ago.
Our good performance in this ﬁve-
year regulatory period, AMP5, has 
created the ability for us to re-invest. 
We are investing around £200 million 
of capital savings into projects which 
improve service to customers or 
beneﬁt the environment. 
Around £40 million of our ﬁnancing 
outperformance is supporting our 
private sewer network and we have 
committed a £75 million cash tax 
refund from HMRC to assist customers 
struggling to return to regular 
payment. We believe that this reﬂects 
a responsible approach to sharing the 
beneﬁts of outperformance between 
customers and shareholders. 
The North West remains a region 
with the highest proportion of 
disadvantaged households in England 
and reducing customer indebtedness 
continues to be a major challenge 
for us. Our collection teams have 
worked hard in another difﬁcult year 
to hold bad debt levels at 2.2 per 
cent of revenue, with over 30,000 
customers taking advantage of our 
many assistance schemes. Containing 
bad debt at this level will remain a 
challenge as beneﬁt reforms continue 
to roll out across our region.  
“ Our good performance 
in this ﬁve-year 
regulatory period has 
created the ability for 
us to reinvest. ”
We were ranked
3rd
out of 10 leading North 
West service providers, 
behind only John Lewis 
and Marks & Spencer

Shareholder information Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Strategic report > Business overview > Chairman’s and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s statement We are grasping the opportunities 
presented by reform of water 
regulation. We welcome the opening of 
the competitive business retail market 
for water and United Utilities Scotland 
has rapidly secured a proﬁtable 
position as the largest new-entrant 
business retailer in Scotland, second 
only to the incumbent, Business 
Stream. The lessons learned in 
Scotland will be applied in the English 
market, delivering better customer 
service in the run-up to market opening 
in 2017 and beyond. In mid 2013 we 
launched a range of on-site water and 
wastewater services to add value to 
non-household customers in our region.
Strategy
During the last year, we updated our 
Strategic Direction Statement, ‘Playing 
our part to support the North West’ , 
and this document reﬂects extensive 
consultation with customers and other 
stakeholders to generate our best view 
of what the next 25 years holds for the 
region. This includes economic, social 
and environmental developments such 
as the increasing impact of climate 
change.
Our business plan, published in 
December 2013, sets out our plans for 
the 2015-20 period. We sought the 
views of over 27,000 customers, as 
well as consulting with our regulators, 
to deliver a plan which we believe 
strikes the right balance for all our 
stakeholders. 
The North West is home to some of the 
most beautiful rural areas of the UK, 
supporting a diverse and productive 
agricultural sector. These areas of 
natural beauty, combined with a long 
coastline, mean that tourism is an 
important sector in the regional 
economy, contributing some £3.2 
billion per annum. The EU’s Water 
Framework and Bathing Water 
Directives target the protection and 
enhancement of this environment and 
our plans set an appropriate pace for 
implementation of new environmental 
legislation, balanced against the size 
of bill that customers are prepared to 
pay.  
Our plans recognise that as a lone 
agent United Utilities could not deliver 
the scale of required environmental 
improvement at an acceptable level 
of cost. Instead, we are committing 
to partnering with others who can 
support the achievement of the 
required outcomes. This includes 
our ‘Turning Tides’ partnership with 
the Environment Agency, Local 
Authorities, the Marine Conservation 
Society and others to improve bathing 
waters in the North West. 
Our updated Water Resources 
Management Plan describes the 
expected pattern of water resource 
availability in our region until 2040.  
The majority of the North West 
is in surplus, beneﬁtting from an 
integrated network that supports 
movement of water across the region 
to accommodate its changing supply 
and demand balance. Our business 
plan focuses on maintaining existing 
levels of service across the region, 
whilst acting to improve the security of 
supply to West Cumbria by connecting 
it to our integrated network. This is 
necessary because the need to protect 
the local environment puts West 
Cumbria’s future supply and demand 
balance at risk.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 A fair deal for customers
We have continued to invest heavily 
in schemes designed to mitigate the 
risk of ﬂooding of our customers’ 
homes. This includes incidence based 
targeting on areas more likely to 
experience ﬂooding and more use of 
CCTV sewer surveys to identify issues. 
For 2015–20 we are targeting a further 
reduction in the risk of sewer ﬂooding 
inside customers’ properties, seeking 
opportunities to work in partnership 
with others to deliver cost-effective 
joint schemes and promoting the use 
of more sustainable drainage systems. 
Our wastewater network will continue 
to beneﬁt from signiﬁcant investment 
going forward as we adapt to weather 
patterns likely to result from climate 
change. 
We are developing a new business 
operating model for our wholesale 
business area, embracing innovation 
in control technology and work 
processes. Delivery of this business 
model is critical to our future ability 
to offset the growth in bills arising 
from new environmental regulation 
whilst continuing to deliver our target 
return for shareholders.  Our progress 
over the current regulatory period, 
combined with our plans for further 
improvements in the next ﬁve years, 
will mean average household bills will 
have grown by less than inﬂation in the 
decade to 2020.
Attractive deal for shareholders
Good underlying operational 
performance, effective capital 
programme delivery and improving 
levels of customer satisfaction are 
delivering value for our shareholders. 
Revenue increased by 4.2 per cent to 
£1.70 billion and underlying operating 
proﬁt was up 6.1 per cent to £641 
million in continued difﬁcult economic 
conditions. Underlying earnings per 
share increased by 16 per cent to 44.7 
pence. We remain on track to deliver 
operating expenditure outperformance 
and to meet Ofwat’s allowance on our 
capital programme, after reinvesting 
our outperformance.   
We plan to continue with high levels 
of investment for 2014/15. This 
includes bringing forward some of our 
scheduled 2015-20 spend to ensure 
a smoother investment proﬁle. We 
have now invested over £2.9 billion in 
the ﬁrst four years of the 2010–15 
regulatory period, and we remain on 
track to deliver our planned ﬁve-year 
investment programme.
We intend to continue with our 
dividend policy of targeting growth of 
RPI+2 per cent per annum through to at 
least 2015 while delivering signiﬁcant 
improvements for customers and the 
environment. In line with this policy, 
the board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend 
of 24.03 pence per ordinary share 
making a total of 36.04 pence per 
share for the 2013/14 ﬁnancial year. 
This represents an increase of 5.0 
per cent compared with last year. The 
ﬁnal dividend is expected to be paid to 
shareholders on 1 August 2014. 
Responsible business 
We continue to listen to the views of 
all our stakeholders and endeavour 
to develop, manage and operate 
in an environmentally sustainable, 
economically beneﬁcial and socially 
responsible manner. In recognition 
of the company’s continued focus on 
responsible business, we retained both 
our ‘World Class’ rating, as measured 
by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index 
and our ‘Platinum Big Tick’ ranking in 
Business in the Community Corporate 
Responsibility Index. We are proud 
that we are one of only seven FTSE 
100 companies (and the only water 
company) to hold both accolades.
The communities where we operate 
are where our customers and 
employees live and work and are vital 
to our business.  We have continued to 
support these North West communities 
both ﬁnancially and in terms of 
employee time through volunteering.  
For example, our ‘Beachcare’ employee 
volunteering scheme, working in 
partnership with the Environment 
Agency and others, helps to keep our 
region’s beaches tidy.
Through our role as a major employer, 
training provider and wealth creator, 
we help to keep the North West’s 
economy turning. Between 2010 and 
2015, our activities will generate an 
estimated £7 billion for the region’s 
economy, supporting 9,000 jobs, and 
securing a legacy for the future.

Strategic report > Business overview > Chairman’s and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s statement Our employees
The people in United Utilities are key 
to the delivery of the highest levels 
of service to our customers and we 
would like again to thank them for 
their dedication and continued hard 
work during the year. Notwithstanding 
the amount of change our business is 
undertaking, employee engagement 
sits at 79 per cent, well above the  
UK transitional norm and close to the 
norm for high performing companies 
in the UK.  
We strive to continuously improve 
our safety culture and we have 
implemented a number of initiatives 
throughout the year. We launched a 
managers’ guide for health and safety 
responsibilities and our transformation 
project, covering 13 key areas of focus 
across our business, is progressing 
well. These initiatives helped reduce 
the number of employee accidents 
in 2013/14 and this will remain a 
signiﬁcant area of focus for us.
A committed, capable and motivated 
workforce is central to delivering our 
vision and we remain fully focused on 
maintaining high levels of employee 
development and engagement.  We 
are always on the lookout for the 
best and brightest talent and we 
recruited a further 24 graduates and 
32 apprentices in 2013/14 and we 
have plans to recruit a similar number 
in 2014/15.
Our board
As a board we are responsible to our 
shareholders, customers and other 
stakeholders for the performance and 
long-term success of our company. The 
way in which we operate, we believe, 
already reﬂects the highest standards 
of corporate governance. Our plc 
structure and governance standards 
ensure that our board and non-
executive directors continue to provide 
sound and prudent governance in full 
compliance with the principles of the 
UK Corporate Governance Codes.

On behalf of the board, we say thank 
you and farewell to Nick Salmon, who 
will stand down at this year’s annual 
general meeting after over nine years 
as a non-executive director. We wish 
Nick all the best for the future. We 
are pleased to welcome Mark Clare to 
the board following his appointment 
last November as a non-executive 
director. Mark is a member of the 
audit committee and the nomination 
committee and will replace Nick as 
senior independent director. Mark 
is Group Chief Executive at Barratt 
Developments PLC and his expertise 
will be an asset to the board.
Outlook
We believe that our sustained focus on 
operational performance, combined 
with continued substantial investment 
in our assets, is delivering beneﬁts 
for customers, shareholders and 
the environment. We are on track to 
exceed our regulatory outperformance 
targets, with substantial ﬁnancing and 
operating outperformance already 
secured. Our capital structure remains 
robust and we intend to continue with 
our dividend policy of targeting real 
growth through to at least 2015.  
Looking ahead, our focus remains 
centred on driving further customer 
satisfaction, alongside operational and 
environmental improvements and we 
believe there is still plenty of scope to 
achieve this. We have now submitted 
our business plan for the 2015–20 
period, as we aim to strike the right 
balance between all our stakeholders. 
We will continue constructive 
engagement with our regulators, ahead 
of the draft and ﬁnal determinations 
from Ofwat later this year.

Achieving 
our vision
Our vision is to become a leading North West service provider and 
one of the best UK water and wastewater companies
The water industry is an 
important sector which 
makes a wide ranging 
contribution, from the health 
of the environment to the 
strength of the economy.
In the next 25 years, we will face many 
challenges and opportunities including: 
• climate change and its implications 
for water resources and ﬂooding;
• the emergence of a more open, 
competitive UK water market;
• more rigorous environmental 
regulations; and
• the ever-present need to combine 
affordable bills with a modern, 
responsive water and wastewater 
service.
By anticipating these changes and 
balancing them against our customers’ 
priorities, we can meet the future with 
conﬁdence.

Strategic report >  Our highlights 2013/14 How we create value
A long-term 
approach 
is essential to 
creating value
Longer-term 
Today we beneﬁt from 
the strategic decisions 
and work delivered by 
our predecessors over 
the previous 150 years to 
provide the North West with 
good quality water and to 
reduce the environmental 
impact of the wastewater we 
treat. The work we do today 
will help to ensure customers 
of the North West continue 
to enjoy an effective, 
efﬁcient service for many 
generations to come.
Employees
We can increase long-term value 
generation through the strategic 
direction and decisions we take 
and through the hard work of our 
employees. It is important that we 
create and retain an engaged and 
talented team in order to deliver this 
and we place a strong emphasis on 
providing comprehensive training 
and development opportunities. 
Management has a range of incentives 
which focus on performance over 
a number of years, rather than the 
current year in isolation, to encourage 
a longer-term approach.
Capital investment
Our ﬁxed assets have a replacement 
cost of around £80 billion i.e. the 
estimated amount it would cost for 
another party to build competing 
assets and networks. This means that 
we are a natural regional monopoly. 
However, it is not the replacement 
cost of our assets upon which we are 
allowed to earn a return, through our 
revenues. We earn a return on our 
Regulatory Capital Value (RCV), which 
is currently close to £10 billion, so 
it is this asset value which is more 
important economically. 
Many of our assets are long-term in 
nature: for example, our impounding 
reservoirs have a useful economic 
life of around 200 years with some 
sewers having a life of up to 300 years. 
By carefully reviewing our potential 
capital projects, considering the most 
efﬁcient long-term solutions, we can 
save future operating costs, also 
helping to reduce future customer bills.
Since privatisation in 1989, total 
capital investment of over £13 billion 
has provided substantial beneﬁts 
to our customers and our region’s 
environment. Disciplined investment, 
along with RPI inﬂation, also grows our 
RCV, increasing future revenues. 
We need to continue with a substantial 
investment programme for the 
foreseeable future in order to meet 
ever more stringent environmental 
standards and to maintain and improve 
the current standards of our assets 
and services. 
However, in deciding on our investment 
strategy, we also have to be mindful 
of the impact on our customers’ bills, 
and this is why, for example, we are 
spreading some of our currently 
required environmental spend over the 
next 15 years.
Regulatory Capital 
Value (RCV) close to
£10bn
Average life of our  
term-debt of around
25 
years
14
United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Capital structure
It is important that we continue to 
attract equity investors to support 
a robust and responsible capital 
structure, which enables us to raise 
new debt. Capital investment is largely 
ﬁnanced through a mix of debt and 
cash generated from our operations. 
The average life of our term-debt is 
around 25 years with our ﬁnal maturity 
out as far as 2057. By efﬁciently 
raising debt at the best possible rates 
we can help keep our ﬁnance costs 
as low as possible and potentially 
outperform the industry allowed cost 
of debt, set by Ofwat every ﬁve years. 
Regulatory environment
Over a long time frame the regulatory 
environment can change signiﬁcantly. 
In the 25 years since the water 
industry was privatised we have seen 
substantial improvements in the 
regional standards of water quality 
and wastewater treatment and the 
cleanliness of rivers and bathing 
waters. We have also recently seen 
the progressive implementation of 
competition for business customers, 
with full market opening expected in 
2017. 
Maintaining a good reputation 
is important to enable positive 
participation in regulatory discussions. 
By positively engaging and utilising 
our industry knowledge, we can help 
inﬂuence future policy with the aim 
of achieving the best outcome for our 
customers, shareholders and other 
stakeholders. We can also help ensure 
we are well prepared for any changes 
to the regulatory landscape.
Natural environment
Our region’s natural environment is also 
changing. Climate change is bringing 
more extreme weather patterns 
and we have a long-term strategy 
to help ensure we have sufﬁcient 
water resources and are able to meet 
increased demand on our sewerage 
network. A phased, long-term approach 
ensures that the necessary work can be 
delivered and does not place too much 
pressure on customer bills.

PROVIDING 
DEBT SUPPORT  
AT GRASSROOTS 
LEVEL
Our region has one of the highest concentrations of 
economically-deprived households in the UK. 
This is why we are committed to 
ﬁnding new ways to help our most 
disadvantaged customers. As well 
as continuing to ﬁnancially support 
an independent trust fund to help 
those most in need, we link in with 
many organisations such as Citizens 
Advice Bureau, housing associations, 
carers groups, Age UK and credit 
unions to promote our range of 
support schemes to their own 
advisors. This helps to give us a
better understanding of the issues 
being faced in local communities. It 
also ensures that people who turn 
to these organisations for advice 
around debt-related issues ﬁnd 
out about the schemes we have 
available to help them pay their 
water bill. It’s been an effective 
strategy to help us get the right 
support to the right people at a 
time when they most need it.

Shorter-term (up to ﬁve years)
Ofwat, our economic regulator, 
determines the prices we can charge 
our customers to provide them with 
water and wastewater services.
Read more in Regulatory environment 
on page 23
Ofwat sets our regulatory contract 
following the receipt of our ﬁve-year 
plan proposals. 
By submitting a robust, balanced 
plan, we can help ensure we receive 
a contract that allows for an 
optimal outcome for our customers, 
shareholders and the environment. 
Once each ﬁve-year regulatory 
contract is set we create value 
principally by delivering or 
outperforming it, by providing the best 
service to customers, at the lowest 
sustainable cost and in a responsible 
manner. Some of the key ways we 
create value over this shorter time 
frame are by:
• improving customer service will, in 
turn, improve efﬁciency and reduce 
costs.  It will also reduce potential 
penalties/increase rewards from 
Ofwat, under its SIM incentive 
mechanism, maximising future 
revenues;
• delivering our regulatory 
commitments helps ensure we 
meet high customer service and 
environmental standards and avoid 
potential ﬁnancial penalties;
• embracing innovation in our use of 
technology and work processes helps 
to make our service better, faster or 
cheaper;
• raising low cost ﬁnance helps us 
outperform the ﬁnance costs 
allowed in our regulatory contract;
16
United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 • implementing our hedging 
strategies, such as ﬁxing medium-
term interest rates and power costs, 
reduce the volatility of our costs, 
helping us to meet our regulatory 
contract;
• minimising operating costs on a 
sustainable basis, such as on power, 
materials and property rates, helps 
us to meet or outperform operating 
costs allowed in our regulatory 
contract;
• enhancing our debt collection 
activities will reduce our retail 
costs. Alongside this, we continue 
to provide support for customers 
struggling to pay;
• meeting our economic leakage 
target provides water resource 
and customer supply beneﬁts and 
avoids any unfunded expenditure 
requirements from our regulators; 
• increasing our production of 
renewable energy from waste helps 
protect us from rising energy costs 
and reduces our carbon footprint.
Over the current 2010–15 regulatory 
period, outperformance is generated 
mainly through efﬁciency savings on 
operating costs, capital expenditure 
and ﬁnancing costs. Ofwat’s SIM 
incentive mechanism also rewards 
companies who perform well on 
customer service, or penalises 
companies who perform badly, relative 
to other water companies. Our current 
KPIs are reﬂective of these potential 
areas for outperformance. 
Read more in Performance
on pages 32-45 
Ofwat is evolving the regulatory 
framework so that, over the 2015–20 
period, the way we can add value is 
changing. Operating costs and capital 
investment will no longer be separately 
assessed as they will be combined 
into a new ‘Totex’ methodology. There 
will be additional rewards or penalties 
based on performance as measured 
through a range of Outcome Delivery 
Incentives (ODIs). Ofwat is intending 
to continue with its SIM assessment 
for household customers and this is 
likely to provide a similar incentive 
and penalty framework. Companies 
will still be incentivised to outperform 
in the area of ﬁnancing costs. The 
progressive opening up of the retail 
market for business customers will 
also provide additional opportunities 
to acquire further customers and earn 
higher returns. We will remain focused 
on improving our service to business 
customers to both help us win more out 
of area customers and, importantly, to 
retain our existing customers.
Economic environment
Changes in the economy, such 
as inﬂation, interest rates, or 
unemployment levels, can inﬂuence 
our ability to create value. 
Read more in The economic 
environment on page 26 
External risk factors
Given the complex legal and 
regulatory environment in which we 
operate there are also a range of 
risks to which we are exposed.

Strategic report > How we create value Our approach to doing business
We believe that responsible 
business should be 
embedded within everything 
we do and this should be 
evident across all of our 
activities. 
We are committed to delivering our 
services in a responsible way and our 
approach to responsible business 
practice is set out in our Business 
Principles document. This states that 
for United Utilities, being a responsible 
business means:
Providing a great service to 
our customers
Working to protect and enhance 
our environment
Actively supporting our local 
communities
Supporting our employees to 
achieve their full potential in a 
safe workplace
Delivering good value to our 
stakeholders and manage our 
supply chain fairly
We’ve explained these in more detail 
below:
Customers: Our aim is to protect public 
health and provide excellent services 
to our customers. This means removing 
the need for customers to contact us 
unnecessarily to taking ownership of 
queries, satisfactorily resolving them 
as quickly as possible and keeping our 
customers informed along the way. 
We aim to provide bills that represent 
good value for money.
Environment: Whether it’s treating 
and delivering drinking water for 
our customers, or returning treated 
wastewater to rivers and the sea, we’re 
acutely aware of our responsibility to 
the environment. We continue to invest 
to protect and, where appropriate, 
enhance the natural environment 
of the North West. We continue to 
consider the impacts of climate change 
on the services we deliver and adapt 
accordingly. Our greenhouse gas 
disclosures can be found on page 99.
Communities: The communities 
in which we operate are of great 
importance to our business – it is 
where our customers and employees 
live and work. We continue to invest in 
our local communities both ﬁnancially 
and through employee volunteering. 
We recognise the effect that our 
operations can have on the community 
and invest in programmes that support 
affected areas or help tackle current 
social issues.
Employees: Health and safety is 
paramount and we strongly focus on 
our health and safety performance. 
High employee engagement is a key 
contributor to our performance and we 
place signiﬁcant emphasis
on maintaining and strengthening 
levels of engagement. Our policies 
on maternity, paternity, adoption, 
personal and special leave go beyond 
the minimum required by law. For 
disabled applicants and existing 
employees, we are committed to 
fulﬁlling our obligations in accordance 
with the relevant legislation. 
Applicants with disabilities are given 
equal consideration in the application 
process. Disabled colleagues have 
equipment and working practices 
modiﬁed for them as far as possible 
and wherever it is safe and practical 
to do so. We value diversity, providing 
equality of opportunity and recruiting 
and promoting on merit. A breakdown 
of male: female directors, senior 
managers and staff can be found in the 
table below.
Delivering good value: We are 
committed to honouring our 
responsibility to our shareholders, 
credit investors and those who provide 
us with goods and services. We aim 
to operate as effectively as possible 
at the lowest sustainable cost and 
to retain a robust and sustainable 
ﬁnancial proﬁle to provide enduring 
shareholder value. More detail on 
the regulatory environment in which 
we operate is provided on pages 23 
to 24. This annual report provides 
a comprehensive ﬁnancial and 
operational review to help inform our 
investors of our performance. We 
work with suppliers whose business 
principles, conduct, and standards align 
with our own. Our key suppliers have 
committed to our Sustainable Supply 
Chain Charter, supporting us in the 
delivery of wider social, economic and 
environmental beneﬁts.

with the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. 
Given the long life of our 
infrastructure, we take a long-term 
view of our operations and key to the

goal to operate in a more sustainable 
manner. Sustainability is fundamental 
to the manner in which we undertake 
our business and the group has, 
for many years, included corporate 
responsibility (CR) factors as a 
strategic consideration in its decision 
making. Our board-level CR committee 
(see page 76) develops and oversees 
our CR strategy and this continuing

BUSINESS FIT FOR A  
CHANGING CLIMATE
In order to ensure our services and assets are fit for a 
changing climate we need to take action now.
As the UK climate continues to 
change, with severe dry periods 
becoming increasingly common, 
we must ensure we continue to 
have resilient water resources 
and an infrastructure capable of 
moving water efﬁciently around the 
region. This will enable taps to keep 
ﬂowing and businesses running. The 
potential effect of climate change 
on our future water resources 
is included in our 25-year Water 
Resource Management Plan.
We must also seek to tackle 
ﬂooding incidents caused by the 
intensive bursts of rainfall, which 
are becoming more frequent due 
to changing weather patterns. We 
will work with local authorities 
and developers throughout local 
planning processes to ensure we 
can meet future demand on our 
sewerage network.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Our industry and market
Every day, over 50 million 
household and business 
consumers in England and 
Wales receive water and 
wastewater services. There 
are currently 10 licensed 
companies which provide 
both water and wastewater 
services to consumers in 
their respective regions. 
Additionally, there are licensed 
companies which provide water-only 
services and tend to be smaller in size. 
As each company in the water sector 
operates as a regional monopoly 
for its services, they are subject to 
regulation in terms of both price and 
performance.
The privatisation of the industry over 
two decades ago has been widely 
perceived as a success, making a 
signiﬁcant contribution to public 
health. It has led to improvements 
in the quality of services provided 
to customers, higher environmental 
standards and superior quality drinking 
water at lower estimated costs to 
customers than if the water sector was 
still owned by the UK Government. The 
water industry currently invests around 
£80 million a week in maintaining and 
improving assets and services.
Our customers
United Utilities Water holds licences to 
provide water and wastewater services 
to a population of approximately 
seven million people in the North West 
of England. We provide services to 
approximately three million households 
in our region and this generates around 
two thirds of our total revenues. We 
also serve approximately 200,000 
businesses, ranging in size from large 
manufacturing companies down to 
small shops. Our focus over recent 
years has been on improving  customer 
satisfaction.
For our business customers we have  
been extending the range of value-
added services we offer, including 
our on-site engineering solutions 
and water efﬁciency advice.  By 
offering value for money, as well as 
the increased range of services, we 
have also been winning customers 
out of area. More details on how we 
are winning customers in the Scottish 
market, which offers attractive 
margins, can be seen in the business 
insight on page 26.
Our households pay just over £1 per 
day on average for the combined water 
and wastewater services we provide. 
Our business plan for the 2015–20 
period also means that customers 
would beneﬁt from below inﬂation 
increases to average household 
bills for the decade to 2020. Our 
objective is to continue to provide our 
customers with high quality drinking 
water to meet all their daily needs 
and environmentally responsible 
wastewater collection and treatment 
at a price to customers that represents 
good value for money.
We are continuing to invest heavily 
for our customers. During the ﬁve-
year period to 2015, we have a capital 
investment programme of over  
£3.5 billion as we continue to improve 
our asset base, delivering further 
beneﬁts for customers. 
Capital investment is expected to be 
around this level again for the 2015–20 
period and to remain high beyond 2020 
as we continue to:
• upgrade our region’s water and 
wastewater networks; 
• maintain our ageing assets;
• deliver a cleaner environment;
• provide high quality water to our 
customers; and
• improve our customers’ experience.

customers pay just over

water supplies manager.
Investing to reduce sewer 
ﬂooding
Flooding of homes and gardens with 
sewage is one of the most serious 
incidents that our customers can 
experience. Across the 2010-15 
period, we will spend over £200 
million to halve the number of 
properties that are affected. 
However, we do recognise that our 
performance at that point will still 
need to improve further. Therefore, 
over the next ﬁve years to 2019/20, 
we will continue to invest, spending 
almost £160 million to reduce 
ﬂooding of homes by around 
40 per cent.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Our regulatory environment
Economic regulation
The water industry currently operates 
within ﬁve-year planning cycles known 
as Asset Management Plan (AMP) 
periods. Prior to the start of each 
ﬁve-year period, companies submit 
their business plans which include their 
projected capital expenditure costs 
to enhance and maintain their network 
and operating costs to maintain or 
improve their services. Following 
review of these plans, Ofwat sets 
the prices each company can charge 
their customers across the period. 
Price limits for the current 2010–15 
(AMP5) period were set in November 
2009, when Ofwat published their Final 
Determination. 
Ofwat assesses companies’ 
performance across a wide range 
of measures, including some of our 
key performance indicators such as 
Service Incentive Mechanism (SIM), 
Serviceability and Leakage (see page 
31). Where performance falls short 
of expectations, Ofwat can take 
actions, such as enforcement actions 
or ﬁnes, in order to protect customers’ 
interests.
Ofwat (The Water Services 
Regulation Authority) is the 
economic regulator of the water and 
sewerage sectors in England and 
Wales, responsible for ensuring the 
companies provide customers with 
a good-quality, efﬁcient service at a 
fair price. 
www.ofwat.gov.uk
Our current price limits (published in November 2009) 
UUW’s proﬁle of price limits for the current ﬁve-year period 1 April 2010 
to 31 March 2015 is set out below:
Y ear 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15
K factor* -4.3% -0.2% +0.6% +1.0% +1.2%**
*  Added to annual RPI inﬂation to determine average price change.
**  We are applying a one-off special discount so that, on average, customer bills will rise by no more than RPI inﬂation for 
2014/15.
Ofwat review 2015–20
Ofwat is introducing a number of 
important changes for the 2015–20 
(AMP6) price review, with the aim of 
evolving the sector in order to meet 
future challenges and placing greater 
focus on customers’ needs. 
Moving away from one single price 
control, there will be four separate 
price controls:
• wholesale water, covering the 
physical supply of water;
• wholesale wastewater, covering 
the removal and treatment of 
wastewater;
• household retail, covering 
customer-facing activities 
(principally customer contact, 
billing, meter reading and 
cash collection) for household 
customers; and
• non-household retail, covering 
customer-facing activities for 
business customers.
Separate retail price controls should 
provide retail businesses with greater 
incentives and focus on delivering 
more efﬁcient service to business 
customers as competition expands, 
and also to household customers under 
a new average cost to serve approach.
This proposed retail household model 
allows water companies only to charge 
its customers an amount based on 
the average costs of the industry 
plus any allowed company-speciﬁc 
adjustments. 
• The way companies’ operating and 
capital costs are assessed is being 
modiﬁed to encourage companies 
to utilise the most efﬁcient, 
sustainable solutions under a new 
‘totex’ model. 
• There is a move to a more outcomes-
based approach, with greater 
emphasis being placed on customer 
engagement to agree the outcomes. 
We submitted our business plan to 
Ofwat on 2 December 2013 and the 
key features of this plan are set out on 
pages 46 -47. 
Ofwat provided an initial view on our 
plan through its pre qualiﬁcation 
decisions publication in March 2014 
and subsequently shared detailed 
feedback with the company, which we 
are currently assessing. In line with 
our expectations and consistent with 
the company speciﬁc adjustments 
we highlighted when we submitted 
our initial business plan in December, 
two key areas we are focusing on 
are wastewater total expenditure 
(totex) and retail average cost 
to serve. Ofwat’s initial view on 
wastewater totex indicated a £1.1 
billion difference, compared with 
our business plan submission.  In our 
submission, we asked for around 
£1 billion of wastewater totex to 
be given speciﬁc consideration. We 
are in detailed dialogue with Ofwat 
to understand this difference and 
provide any further evidence required 
to support our submission. We are 
also revising our outcome delivery 
incentives to include more symmetrical 
reward/penalty mechanisms. In 
addition, we are focusing on a number 
of adjustments relating to the 2010-15 
period. These adjustments include a 
range of economic, performance and 
scope differences, compared with the 
assumptions made at the 2009 price 
review.
The next steps in the price review 
process are shown on page 47.

Environmental and quality regulation
The water and wastewater industry in the UK is subject to substantial domestic 
and European Union regulation, placing signiﬁcant statutory obligations on water 
and wastewater companies with regard to, amongst other factors, the quality of 
drinking water supplied, wastewater treatment and the effects of their activities 
on the natural environment. 
The Environment Agency controls how much water 
can be drawn from the environment and the quality of 
water returned to rivers and the sea. The EA produces 
an assessment of water and wastewater companies’ 
annual performance, and we include this as one of 
our KPIs, see page 31. www.gov.uk/government/
organisations/environment-agency
The Drinking Water Inspectorate is responsible for 
ensuring compliance with the drinking water quality 
regulations. 
www.dwi.gov.uk
The Consumer Council for Water represents 
customers’ interests relating to price, service and 
value for money. It also investigates customer 
complaints about water quality. 
www.ccwater.org.uk
Natural England is responsible for the protection of 
designated sites for nature conservation, e.g. Sites of 
Speciﬁc Scientiﬁc Interest. Companies are required 
to manage these sites and to protect and enhance 
biodiversity. 
www.naturalengland.org.uk
Defra is the UK Government department responsible 
for water policy and regulations in England and Wales; 
it also sets drinking water quality and environmental 
standards (many based on European law) which water 
companies must meet. 
www.gov.uk/defra
Regulatory risks
Given the complex legal and regulatory environment within which we operate, 
there is a range of risks to which we are exposed. Risks can be in the form of 
possible non-compliance with existing laws or regulations or failure to meet the 
terms of our current 2010–15 regulatory contract. We also face risks in relation 
to potential future changes in legislation or regulation, particularly with regard to 
the 2015–20 price review period. See pages 48 - 51 for more details in respect of 
these risks.
Impact of environmental legislation 
European Union environmental 
legislation will require us and 
other UK water companies to incur 
additional capital investment to 
ensure compliance with more stringent 
standards. We do, however, recognise 
that in our region we cannot achieve 
this alone and we are committing to 
partnering with others who also have 
a role to play, such as the Environment 
Agency and Local Authorities and local 
interest groups.
• The revised Bathing Water Directive, 
effective from 2015, sets higher 
standards for bathing waters. Under 
the current standards North West 
beaches achieve over 90 per cent 
bathing water compliance. The 
new standards are likely to prove 
very challenging to meet. As one 
of many contributors to bathing 
water quality we have included 
investment in our AMP6 business 
plan  to help ensure compliance with 
the higher standards. We will work in 
partnership with other organisations 
to ensure investment is as efﬁcient 
as possible.
• The Water Framework Directive sets 
an objective that European member 
states should achieve ‘good’ status 
for all surface water beyond 2027. 
Considerable capital investment 
is required to meet this and we are 
spreading this investment over 
the next three regulatory periods, 
balancing the needs of current and 
future customers.
• The Habitats Directive requires 
member states to maintain 
biodiversity by protecting natural 
habitats and certain wild species. To 
protect England’s largest population 
of fresh water mussels in West 
Cumbria, in future we will have to 
extract less water, raising long-
term supply and demand balance 
issues for the local population. 
To address this we are proposing 
work over AMP6 to connect our 
West Cumbrian supply network to 
our main integrated supply zone, 
which has surplus capacity. This 
proposed project is subject to the 
outcome of an independent Planning 
Inspectorate decision.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Our competitive environment
Comparative competition
Our main competitors to benchmark 
our performance against are the other 
nine water and wastewater companies 
(WaSCs) across England and Wales. We 
are the second largest WaSC based on 
the size of our asset base, as measured 
by Regulatory Capital Value (RCV). We, 
along with these other nine companies, 
comprise the vast majority of the 
total water and wastewater sector, as 
depicted on the pie chart on the right.
Although their relative sizes are 
generally far smaller than the water 
and wastewater companies, the 
remaining water-only companies 
are also important competitors as 
their relative performances are 
also included in Ofwat’s published 
comparative information. 
Away from the water sector, in line with 
our vision to be a leading North West 
service provider, we also benchmark 
our customer service performance 
against other leading service providers 
in our region. In addition, as a publicly 
listed FTSE 100 company, the other 
UK and worldwide listed utilities are 
competitors from an investment 
perspective.
Direct competition
Water supply competition was opened 
up in December 2005, when very 
large business customers (those with 
an annual consumption of over 50 
megalitres per year at each site) were 
allowed to choose their water supplier. 
Under this arrangement, the new water 
supplier would buy water directly from 
the regional water company and be 
allowed to use their network for this 
water supply. 
In December 2011, this market was 
opened up further, with the threshold 
being reduced to ﬁve megalitres a 
year. To date very few customers 
have switched supplier in England and 
Wales. 
Looking ahead, under the new Water 
Act, introduced in May 2014, the 
water supply threshold will be reduced 
further to zero for non-household 
customers and also be expanded to 
include sewerage as well as water 
services, with a target date of 2017 at 
the earliest. This will effectively open 
up retail competition for all business 
customers. The UK Government has 
not expressed any intention to expand 
competition to include household 
customers.
We are exploiting the opportunity 
presented by the expansion of retail 
competition for business customers. 
Despite only obtaining a licence 
to trade in Scotland, a market that 
already offers full business retail 
competition, as recently as October 
2012, we have quickly become the 
second largest water retailer there, 
behind only the incumbent provider. 
As well as winning new business, this 
is also helping us to learn about what 
we need to offer to win out of area 
customers and this is important in the 
run-up to the English market opening 
in 2017. 
The Water Act also paves the way for 
the future introduction of competition 
for certain parts of the wholesale, 
or upstream, business (for example 
the input of raw or treated water into 
a water company’s network or the 
removal of wastewater for treatment), 
although any upstream reforms are not 
expected until 2020 at the earliest.

The economic environment
UK gross domestic product has picked 
up over the last year as developed 
world economies look ﬁnally to recover 
from the 2008/09 global ﬁnancial 
crisis, although UK output has still not 
recovered to its 2008 level. 
The North West of England continues 
to face a particularly tough 
economic environment. The North 
West unemployment rate has not 
recovered as quickly as the national 
rate and remains well above the 
national average, at 7.7 per cent 
for the quarter ending March 2014, 
compared to 6.8 per cent nationally. A 
report ‘Department for Communities 
and Local Government, Indices of 
Deprivation 2010’ , published in March 
2011, highlighted that the North West 
had more of the most deprived areas in 
England than any other region. 
Commercial volumes have shown a 
downward trend over recent years, 
impacted by the tough economic 
climate, and although volumes 
stabilised across 2013/14 it is too 
early to conclude that this is part 
of a sustained recovery. Bad debt 
remains a risk to which we are exposed, 
although Ofwat currently recognises 
this through a special factor allowance. 
Debt management continues to be 
a signiﬁcant area of focus for us 
as we seek to use best practice in 
the recovery of debt and in helping 
customers back into making regular 
payment through use of manageable 
payment plans.
Whilst interest rates have increased 
somewhat during the year, they still 
remain below the long-term trend and 
our recently agreed £500 million loan 
should beneﬁt from this as we draw it 
down. Comparatively low interest rates 
have also been beneﬁcial to our future 
cost of debt as we continue with our 
interest rate hedging strategy. 
Business Insight
WINNING BUSINESS 
IN SCOTLAND
We were granted a Scottish licence in October 2012, 
following a successful application.  Since then, we 
have focused on developing a range of value-added 
services and improving levels of customer satisfaction, 
combined with competitive pricing, in order to win 
business customers.
Working in partnership with 
customers, we can help them to 
save money by providing water 
efﬁciency advice and through 
consumption monitoring. Our 
on-site surveys can identify 
unnecessary waste across a range 
of areas including the production 
process, plumbing systems and 
heating networks. Smart metering 
enables customers to monitor their 
water usage by providing regular, 
detailed consumption data. This can 
demonstrate unusual or unexpected 
water consumption which can help 
identify leaks on their premises or 
changes in practices on-site.
We tailor our services to the needs 
of each customer. For example, 
we offer ﬂexible billing options, 
so customers can choose the 
frequency and timing of bills and 
we also offer consolidated billing 
options for multi-site customers.
In addition, we offer and are 
continuing to develop a broad range 
of value-added services for business 
customers.  These include waste 
to energy consultancy, engineering 
advice on the design, build and 
operation of on-site treatment 
plants and advice on rainwater 
harvesting and greywater recycling.
Our strategy in Scotland is 
working and we have already won 
customers covering around 2,000 
sites; including some well-known 
nationals. We are now the second 
largest water retailer in Scotland 
as well as having a healthy pipeline 
of potential new deals. Competing 
in the Scottish market is also 
helping to build our knowledge 
ahead of the full opening of the 
English business market in 2017.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 RPI inﬂation has fallen away from the 
very high levels seen over 2011 and 
2012 (around ﬁve per cent), ending 
2013/14 at 2.5 per cent). The prices we 
charge our customers (and therefore 
revenues), as well as our asset base, 
are linked to RPI inﬂation, so lower 
RPI will mean slightly lower growth 
on these measures. However, we also 
have a large quantity of index-linked 
debt which means our ﬁnance costs 
decrease as inﬂation falls, providing 
a partial economic offset to revenue 
(although not a perfect hedge as 
changes to revenue and index-linked 
ﬁnance costs are based on differing 
lagged measures of inﬂation). Our 
pension liabilities are also linked 
to inﬂation, which also provides an 
additional economic offset against our 
asset base.
United Utilities’ total contribution 
to the regional economy over 2010-
15 is estimated at £7 billion. Direct 
economic contributions from our 
activities include the purchase of 
goods and services and providing 
extensive employment. There is also 
an  indirect economic contribution, for 
example when our suppliers, in turn, 
make purchases from their suppliers 
and when people whose jobs are 
supported by United Utilities spend 
their personal incomes.

Our focus on improving 
customer service
Great customer service relies on 
understanding what our customers 
need, anticipating problems, resolving 
complaints quickly and courteously and 
developing new, innovative services 
that ﬁt into people’s busy lifestyles. 
We want our customers to trust us and

establishing a new management team 
at the beginning of 2011, we have 
demonstrated signiﬁcant progress 
against our customer-centric strategy. 
We have developed new services and 
introduced a ‘right ﬁrst time’ culture 
across our business. Improvements 
have included:
• the return of all contact centres 
back to the North West and a system 
that allows customers to speak to 
an advisor promptly, rather than 
navigating lengthy automated 
menus;
• a more sophisticated online service 
to allow customers to manage their 
water accounts;
• clearer, plain English bills; 
• a welcome pack for home movers; 
and
• a specialist Careline team which 
supports customers who may 
need extra help, for example those 
suffering ill health, a bereavement, 
or with mental health issues.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 The introduction of the Service Incentive Mechanism (SIM) as a measure of 
customer satisfaction over this regulatory period has provided us with a strong 
benchmark of water industry comparative performance. SIM results sit alongside 
our other, ongoing, research on customer expectations and satisfaction.
Key achievements to date include:
• The most improved water and wastewater company as measured under SIM in 
each of 2011/12 and 2012/13
• 42 per cent reduction in customer complaints to the Consumer Council for 
Water (CCW) from 2010/11 to 2013/14
• Complaints warranting CCW investigation reduced from 63 in 2010/11 to 
zero in 2012/13 and 2013/14
• Consistently third behind only John Lewis and Marks & Spencer on the 
customer service brand tracker measure out of ten leading service providers 
in the North West
• Awarded ‘Best Utility’ in the Top 50 Contact Centre Awards 2013
• Becoming the second largest water retailer in Scotland within one year of 
entering the market

schemes contributing to water quality 
and environmental improvement. In 
May 2014, however, we were ﬁned 
£200,000 for each of two breaches 
of environmental permit conditions 
following an escape of 50,000 cubic 
metres of biogas at Stockport Waste 
Water Treatment Works in October 
2011. The judge acknowledged our

Strategic report > Our performance Our performance
Operational 
performance
United Utilities (UU) aims to deliver 
long-term shareholder value by 
providing:
The best service to customers
At the lowest sustainable cost
In a responsible manner
Best service to customers
Customer service – our continuing 
strong focus on dealing effectively 
with customer enquiries has helped us 
deliver further improvements in our 
performance, as measured by Ofwat’s 
service incentive mechanism (SIM). 
This is also reﬂected in a reduction in 
the number of customer complaints 
received, which has contributed to 
improvements in opex efﬁciency. In 
addition, the number of customer 
complaints made to the Consumer 
Council for Water (CCW) in 2013/14 
has reduced by a further 11 per cent, 
compared with 2012/13. We are 
pleased to report that the total number 
of escalated complaints assessed by 
the CCW was again zero in 2013/14. 
This has helped us improve our SIM 
performance further, as detailed in 
the KPIs section to the right. We were 
particularly encouraged with our 
qualitative SIM performance for the 
fourth quarter of 2013/14, where we 
achieved fourth position out of the 
19 water companies. We believe that 
our improvements should move the 
company to a neutral position on the 
SIM incentive mechanism, the outcome 
of which will be assessed by Ofwat 
based on performance across the 
2011/12 to 2013/14 period.
Leading North West service provider 
– we were pleased to have been 
consistently ranked third out of ten 
leading organisations in the North 
West, through an independent brand 
tracker survey which is undertaken 
quarterly. We are behind only Marks 
& Spencer and John Lewis, but ahead 
of seven other major organisations 
covering utilities, telecoms, media and 
banking services. 
Robust water supply – our customers 
continue to beneﬁt from our robust 
water supply and demand balance, 
along with high levels of water supply 
reliability. In addition, we continue to 
supply a high level of water quality, 
with mean zonal compliance continuing 
to be over 99.9 per cent. 
Mitigating sewer ﬂooding – we have 
continued to invest heavily in schemes 
designed to mitigate the risk of 
ﬂooding of our customers’ homes, 
including incidence based targeting 
on areas more likely to experience 
ﬂooding and defect identiﬁcation 
through CCTV sewer surveys. Our 
wastewater network will continue to 
beneﬁt from signiﬁcant investment 
going forward as we adapt to weather 
patterns likely to result from climate 
change.
Asset serviceability – we have a 
range of actions to help support the 
serviceability of our assets. We are 
improving the robustness of our water 
treatment processes, refurbishing 
service reservoir assets, continuing 
with our comprehensive mains cleaning 
programme and optimising water 
treatment to reduce discoloured water 
events. 
Extending our presence in the retail 
water market for business customers 
– we have been building our capability 
and experience over the last two 
years to help ensure we are in a strong 
position as the competitive business 
retail market evolves and are very 
active in this expanding market.  After 
obtaining a Scottish water supply 
licence in 2012 we have already won 
around 150 customers, covering 
around 2,000 sites and representing 
annual revenue in 2014/15 of around 
£10 million.  We are the largest new 
entrant and have now established a 
position as the second largest water 
retailer in Scotland.  We also have a 
signiﬁcant pipeline of opportunities 
and are continuing to offer and develop 
our range of value-added services.
Improving customer service remains a 
signiﬁcant area of management focus 
and we see opportunities to deliver 
further beneﬁts for our customers.
Key performance indicators:
Serviceability – Long-term 
stewardship of assets is critical 
and Ofwat measures this through 
its serviceability assessment 
(Ofwat deﬁnes serviceability 
as the capability of a system of 
assets to deliver a reference 
level of service to customers 
and to the environment now and 
in the future). We are currently 
assessed as ‘improving’ for our 
wastewater non-infrastructure 
assets and ‘stable’ for our water 
infrastructure, water non-
infrastructure and wastewater 
infrastructure assets. The aim is to 
continue to hold at least a ‘stable’ 
rating for all four asset classes, 
which aligns with Ofwat’s target.
Service incentive mechanism 
(SIM) – UU continued its progress 
on Ofwat’s combined (qualitative 
and quantitative) SIM assessment 
for 2012/13, moving up a further 
three places to joint 13th of the 
21 water companies, compared 
with 2011/12. Further progress 
has continued in 2013/14, with 
a quantitative SIM score (which 
measures customer contacts) 
of 135 points, representing a 
further 25 per cent improvement 
compared with 2012/13. On 
the qualitative measure (which 
measures customers’ satisfaction 
in respect of how their enquiries 
were handled), UU has improved 
its 2013/14 average score by 0.13 
points to 4.56 points, signiﬁcantly 
closing the gap to the top 
performers. From 2013/14, Ofwat 
assesses SIM out of 19 water 
companies and UU’s qualitative 
SIM improvement moves it to joint 
seventh position. Our continued 
progress is encouraging.

MISSION IMPOSSIBLE? 
NOT FOR OUR AQUANAUTS
Construction commenced on the 
Haweswater aqueduct in 1933.  This huge 
90km pipe is driven by gravity and is 
capable of delivering 570 million litres of 
fresh, clean drinking water per day and is 
hundreds of feet below ground in places. 
Since the ﬁrst water from Haweswater arrived in 
Manchester in 1955, this amazing feat of engineering 
has stood the test of time and still supplies water to 
around two million of our customers. To make sure it 
continues to serve a key role in supplying water long 
into the future, a challenging structural analysis was 
required.
Sending a team of specialist engineers dubbed 
‘aquanauts’ into the aqueduct to carry out the survey 
required many years of careful planning.  The 80 
carefully selected aquanauts went through a series of 
ﬁtness and psychological training to ensure they could 
cope underground for long periods.  To transport the 
aquanauts through this pipeline, we used 16 specialist 
vehicles, dubbed ‘pipe-mobiles’ .  Our international 
research led us to a specially designed vehicle, built in 
Canada, which was ideally suited to the job. 
A 120 metre plastic replica version of the tunnel 
was constructed to ensure all team members were 
fully trained to operate effectively and safely in this 
environment. 
We built 22 access points along the route, all manned 
with 24-hour security and paramedics during the 
shutdown, just in case the team got into difﬁculty.
In support, there were also 200 special tunnel units 
equipped with specialist equipment and materials in 
case we found any areas along the aqueduct in need of 
structural help. 
To ensure that we kept the water ﬂowing despite 
shutting down our biggest supply of water for over three 
weeks whilst inspections were carried out, the ﬂow at 
39 water treatment works was temporarily increased, 
through a carefully planned, co-ordinated operation.  On 
27 September 2013, the drain down of the aqueduct 
commenced, which itself took around three days to 
complete.  We then had only two weeks for our army of 
specially trained staff to complete the inspections and 
all internal work.  The aqueduct was then recharged and 
ﬂushed along its length, before services were gradually 
returned to normal from 20 to 30 October.
During this entire operation there were zero accidents 
and incidents and there were no customer complaints. 
The fact that this project was completed successfully, 
without affecting our customers’ water supply, was 
testament to the meticulous planning as well as the 
innovative approach we adopted.

Strategic report > Our performance Our performance
Lowest sustainable cost
Power and chemicals – our asset 
optimisation programme continues 
to provide the beneﬁts of increased 
and more effective use of operational 
site management to optimise power 
and chemical use and the development 
of more combined heat and power 
assets to generate renewable energy.  
We have substantially locked in the 
cost of our power requirements 
through to 2015, via hedging, securing 
outperformance across the 2010–15 
period.
Proactive network management – we 
are implementing a more proactive 
approach to asset and network 
management, with the aim of improving 
our modelling and forecasting to 
enable us to address more asset and 
network problems before they affect 
customers, thereby reducing the 
level of reactive work and improving 
efﬁciency.
Debt collection – we are continuing 
to enhance our proactive approach to 
debt collection and are implementing 
a detailed action plan. We recognise 
the ﬁnancial difﬁculties facing many 
of our customers and provide a range 
of options to help those who are 
struggling to pay their bills, including 
our charitable trust, which have helped 
many customers back onto manageable 
payment plans. We have again 
delivered a good performance and have 
sustained bad debts at 2.2 per cent 
of regulated revenue for 2013/14, 
consistent with the 2012/13 full year 
position, mitigating the impact of 
recent beneﬁt changes on customers’ 
ability to pay.
Pensions – UU placed its pension 
provision on a more sustainable footing 
in 2010 and has subsequently taken 
additional steps to de-risk the pension 
scheme further. Further details on the 
group’s pension provision are provided 
in the pensions section on page 43.
Capital delivery and regulatory 
commitments – the business is strongly 
focused on delivering its commitments 
efﬁciently and on time and has a robust 
commercial capital delivery framework 
in place. Regulatory capital investment 
in the year, including £165 million of 
infrastructure renewals expenditure, 
was £836 million. Including transitional 
spend of around £40 million, we 
would expect to deliver a similar 
level of investment for 2014/15. 
Following our rapid increase in our 
internal Time: Cost: Quality index 
(TCQi) score from around 50 per cent 
in 2010/11 to approximately 90 per 
cent in 2012/13, we have further 
improved our score to 98 per cent for 
2013/14. This has already exceeded 
our internal target of 95 per cent, 
which we were aiming to achive by 
the end of this regulatory period 
in 2015. We received a shortfalling 
revenue penalty of over £80 million 
at the last price review in 2009 but, 
with our improved TCQi performance, 
we expect to signiﬁcantly reduce 
the penalty risk at the 2014 price 
review. We remain on track to deliver 
the ﬁve-year programme within the 
regulatory allowance of around £3.6 
billion (excluding costs associated 
with private sewers, transitional and 
non-regulated investment) and we are 
reinvesting capex outperformance to 
deliver further customer beneﬁts. 
Private sewers – in 2013/14, private 
sewers opex was £8 million, IRE was 
£15 million and enhancement capex 
was £16 million. This brings cumulative 
private sewers spend since they were 
transferred in October 2011 to £22 
million for opex, £35 million for IRE and 
£37 million for enhancement capex, 
at the lower end of our estimates. As 
such, our total spend is now expected 
to be moderately below our 2011–15 
total cost estimate of £160 million.
Key performance indicators:
Financing outperformance – UU 
has secured over £300 million 
of ﬁnancing outperformance 
across the 2010–15 period, when 
compared with Ofwat’s allowed 
cost of debt of 3.6 per cent real, 
based on an average RPI inﬂation 
rate of 2.5 per cent per annum. 
As outlined previously, we expect 
to reinvest around £40 million of 
our ﬁnancing outperformance in 
private sewers costs which were 
not reﬂected in price limits for the 
current period.
Operating expenditure 
outperformance – The business 
is targeting total operating 
expenditure outperformance over 
the 2010–15 period of at least 
£50 million, or approximately 
two per cent, compared with the 
regulatory allowance. This is in 
addition to the base operating 
expenditure efﬁciency targets set 
by Ofwat, which equate to a total 
of approximately £150 million 
over the ﬁve years. We are ahead 
of schedule and expect to deliver 
cumulative operating expenditure 
outperformance of over £50 million 
across the 2010–15 period. 
Capital expenditure 
outperformance – UU is continuing 
to deliver signiﬁcant efﬁciencies 
in the area of capital expenditure 
and expects to meet Ofwat’s 
allowance after adjusting, through 
the regulatory methodology, for 
the impact of lower construction 
output prices. As outlined 
previously, we expect to reinvest 
around £200 million of capital 
expenditure outperformance for 
the beneﬁt of our customers and 
the environment.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Responsible manner
Acting responsibly is fundamental to 
the manner in which we undertake our 
business and the group has for many 
years included corporate responsibility 
factors in its strategic decision making. 
Leakage – our strong, year round, 
operational focus on leakage and 
the implementation of a range of 
initiatives, such as active pressure 
management, enabled us to again beat 
our leakage target for 2013/14. Our 
leakage performance, alongside the 
network resilience improvements we 
are making, is helping us to maintain 
a robust water supply and demand 
balance and deliver high levels of 
reliability for our customers.
Environmental performance – this is a 
high priority for UU and we are pleased 
to be an upper quartile company in 
the Environment Agency’s 2012/13 
performance metrics (the latest 
available), as described in the KPIs 
section below. 
Carbon footprint – we are committed 
to reducing our carbon footprint 
and increasing our generation of 
renewable energy. In 2013/14, our 
carbon footprint totalled 449,042 
tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, 
a reduction of 11 per cent compared 
with the previous year. We set a target 
of achieving at least a 21 per cent 
reduction in carbon emissions by 2015, 
measured from a 2005/06 baseline, 
and we were encouraged with our 
performance in 2013/14 which was 23 
per cent below the baseline. A detailed 
breakdown of our emissions can be 
found in the Directors’ report on page 
99.

INNOVATIVE RECYCLING  
CENTRE AT DA YHULME UP  
AND RUNNING
We recently completed a new sludge 
recycling centre at our 100-year old 
Davyhulme wastewater treatment 
works.  This site, near Manchester, 
is one of the largest wastewater 
treatment works in Europe.  
We have employed a ground-
breaking conﬁguration of thermal 
hydrolysis to maximise energy 
generation from sludge by advanced 
digestion.  We were pleased that 
this project recently won the Annual 
Institution of Chemical Engineers 
award for innovation.  
This year, we generated over 
50GWhs of renewable energy 
at this site, contributing to our 
highest ever renewable energy 
production.
Energy represents a signiﬁcant 
cost for UU and such projects 
provide beneﬁts not only for 
customers and shareholders, but 
also the environment. 
PHOTOGRAPH: Davyhulme wastewater treatment works.
The recently completed Davyhulme 
wastewater site (see business insight 
above) has contributed to our highest 
ever renewable energy production in 
2013/14 of 133 GWh. This represents 
c17 per cent of our total electricity 
consumption, up from c13 per cent last 
year, and has helped us avoid energy 
purchase costs of around £10 million, as 
well as attracting renewable incentives 
of around £5 million. In addition, we 
have plans in place to further increase 
renewable energy production over the 
next few years.

Employees – a committed, capable 
and motivated workforce is central 
to delivering our vision and we 
remain strongly focused on high 
levels of employee development 
and engagement. In our most recent 
employee opinion survey, we achieved 
an engagement score of 79 per 
cent, which is close to the UK high 
performing norm even at a time of 
signiﬁcant change. We continue 
to be successful in attracting and

24 graduates and 32 apprentices 
in 2013/14 and with plans to add a 
similar number in 2014/15. As part 
of our health and safety improvement 
programme, we implemented a number 
of initiatives throughout the year. We 
launched a managers’ guide for health 
and safety responsibilities and our 
transformation project, covering 13 
key areas of focus across the business, 
is progressing well. These initiatives 
helped reduce the employee accident 
frequency rate to 0.137 accidents 
per 100,000 hours, compared with a 
rate of 0.188 last year. However, we 
recognise we have more to do and 
health and safety will continue to be a

for continuous improvement.
Sharing beneﬁts with customers and shareholders
• Reinvesting c£200 million of capex outperformance for customer and 
environmental beneﬁts, which will earn a return through the regulated asset 
base
• Reinvesting c£40 million of ﬁnancing outperformance in private sewers
• c£20 million special customer discount; offsetting allowed real price 
increase for 2014/15
• c£17 million of further support for customers struggling to pay
• Customer bills in 2015-2020 to beneﬁt from c£90 million of tax savings
Communities – we continue to support 
partnerships, both ﬁnancially and 
in terms of employee time through 
volunteering, with other organisations 
across the North  West that share 
our objectives. This year we set up 
Catchment Wise, our new approach to 
tackling water quality issues in lakes, 
rivers and coastal waters across the 
North West. As a ﬁrst step, we have 
provided matched funding to all of 
the Defra Catchment partnerships 
in our region and a further £500,000 
has been made available as part of 
a competitive improvement fund to 
make a difference on the catchments. 
Our ‘Beachcare’ employee volunteering 
scheme, working in partnership with 
the Environment Agency, Keep Britain 
Tidy and the Local Authority, helps 
to keep our region’s beaches tidy and 
this is just one example of over 26,000 
hours of volunteering time. We also 
contributed approximately £2 million, 
to support local communities through 
schemes such as providing debt 
advisory services and our Community 
Fund, offering grants to local groups 
impacted by our capital investment 
programme.
Key performance indicators:
Leakage – UU met its economic 
level of leakage rolling target for 
the eighth consecutive year in 
2013/14, with a performance of 
452 megalitres per day versus 
the regulatory target of 463 
megalitres per day. The aim is 
to meet our regulatory leakage 
target each year.
Environmental performance – On 
the Environment Agency’s latest 
assessment (2012/13 draft 
report), which covers a broad 
range of operational metrics, UU 
is an upper quartile company.  
Based on our performance across 
the range of metrics, this would 
indicate joint second position 
among the ten water and sewerage 
companies. This represents 
another step up on the previous 
year when UU was in third position 
and aligns with our medium-term 
goal of being a ﬁrst quartile 
company on a consistent basis.
Corporate responsibility – UU 
has a strong focus on operating in 
a responsible manner and is the 
only UK water company to have a 
‘World Class’ rating as measured 
by the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Index. The group has retained its 
‘World Class’ rating and aims to 
retain this rating each year.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Financial performance
Revenue
UU has delivered a good set of 
ﬁnancial results for the year ended  
31 March 2014. Revenue increased 
by £69 million to £1,705 million, 
principally reﬂecting a 4.0 per cent 
nominal (1.0 per cent real price 
increase plus 3.0 per cent RPI inﬂation) 
allowed regulated price increase. 
Operating proﬁt
Underlying operating proﬁt increased 
by 6 per cent to £641 million, primarily 
as a result of an increase in revenue 
and beneﬁtting from tight cost control 
with operating costs up at a lower 
rate than revenue. Reported operating 
proﬁt similarly increased by 6 per cent 
to £637 million.
Investment income and  
ﬁnance expense
The underlying net ﬁnance expense 
of £252 million was broadly in line 
with the prior year. The indexation of 
the principal on our index-linked debt 
amounted to a net charge in the income 
statement of £83 million, compared 
with a net charge of £86 million last 
year. The group had approximately £2.9 
billion of index-linked debt as at 31 
March 2014. The lower RPI inﬂation 
charge contributed to the group’s 
average underlying interest rate of 4.6 
per cent being lower than the rate of 
4.9 per cent for the prior year.
Reported investment income and 
ﬁnance expense of £92 million was 
signiﬁcantly lower than the £290 
million expense in 2012/13. This 
£198 million reduction principally 
reﬂects a change in the fair value gains 
and losses on debt and derivative 
instruments, from a £42 million loss 
last year to a £129 million gain in 
2013/14. The £129 million fair value 
gain in 2013/14 is largely due to gains 
on the regulatory swap portfolio, 
resulting from a signiﬁcant increase in 
medium-term sterling interest rates 
during the period and the unwinding 
of the opening liability position. The 
group uses these swaps to ﬁx interest 
rates on a substantial proportion of 
its debt to better match the ﬁnancing 
cash ﬂows allowed by the regulator 
at each price review. The group ﬁxed 
the majority of its non index-linked 
debt for the 2010–15 ﬁnancial period, 
providing a net effective nominal 
interest rate of approximately ﬁve per 
cent.
Proﬁt before tax
Underlying proﬁt before tax was £390 
million, £38 million higher than last 
year, due to the £37 million increase 
in underlying operating proﬁt and 
the £1 million decrease in underlying 
net ﬁnance expense. This underlying 
measure adjusts for the impact 
of one-off items, principally from 
restructuring within the business, 
and other items such as fair value 
movements in respect of debt and 
derivative instruments. Reported 
proﬁt before tax increased by £233 
million to £545 million. 
Taxation 
Consistent with our wider business 
objectives, we are committed to acting 
in a responsible manner in relation to 
our tax affairs.
Our tax policies and objectives, which 
are approved by the board on a regular 
basis, ensure that we:
• only engage in reasonable tax 
planning aligned with our commercial 
activities and we always comply with 
what we believe to be both the letter 
and the spirit of the law;
• do not engage in aggressive or 
abusive tax avoidance;
• are committed to an open, 
transparent and professional 
relationship with HMRC based 
on mutual trust and collaborative 
working.
Under the regulatory framework 
the company operates within, the 
majority of any beneﬁt from reduced 
tax payments will typically not be 
retained by the company but will pass 
to customers via reduced bills. For 
2013/14, the company has agreed, over 
and above the normal regulatory rules, 
to voluntarily share with customers the 
one-off net cash beneﬁt of £75 million 
due to the company, following the 
industry-wide agreement with HMRC 
in relation to the abolition of industrial 
buildings allowances in 2008.
In any given year, the company’s 
effective cash tax rate may ﬂuctuate 
from the standard UK rate due to the 
available tax deductions on pension 
contributions and capital investment. 
These deductions are achieved as a 
result of utilising tax incentives, which 
have been explicitly put in place by 
successive governments precisely 
to encourage such investment. This 
reﬂects responsible corporate 
behaviour in relation to taxation.
The company’s effective cash tax 
rate may also ﬂuctuate from the 
standard UK rate due to unrealised 
proﬁts or losses in relation to treasury 
derivatives where the corresponding 
proﬁts or losses are only taxed when 
realised. These movements are purely 
timing differences and HMRC are now 
reviewing the relevant tax rules with 
the stated aim of achieving greater 
accounting and tax alignment. However, 
any changes are not expected to affect 
the UU group before year ended 31 
March 2017.
The group’s principal subsidiary, United 
Utilities Water, operates solely in the 
UK and its customers are based here. 
All of the group’s proﬁts are taxable in 
the UK (other than around £1 million 
Estonian tax paid in relation to the 
group’s 35 per cent holding in T allinn 
Water).

Strategic report > Our performance Our performance
For 2013/14, we paid corporation tax 
of £65 million which represents an 
effective cash tax rate of 12 per cent, 
11 per cent lower than the mainstream 
rate of corporation tax of 23 per cent. 
For 2012/13, we paid corporation tax 
of £55 million (18 per cent), six per

reconciling items to the respective 
mainstream rates were tax deductions 
on capital investment and pension 
contributions and timing differences in 
relation to certain unrealised proﬁts/
losses on treasury derivatives, where 
the corresponding proﬁts or losses are 
only taxed when realised. 
For 2013/14, the company also 
received an exceptional cash tax 
refund of £96 million in relation to 
prior years’ tax matters, covering a 
period of over ten years in total. The 
amount principally related to tax 
deductions on capital expenditure and 
included the revised tax treatment 
for capital expenditure at water and 
sewage treatment works agreed 
between the Industry and HMRC, 
following the abolition of industrial 
buildings allowances. Taking account 
of this one-off repayment, the net 
effective cash tax rate for 2013/14 
reduced to a credit of six per cent.
The current tax charge was £77 million 
in the year, compared with £81 million 
in the previous year. In addition, there 
was a current tax credit of £141 million 
relating to matters agreed with HMRC 
in respect of prior years. On top of 
the £96 million cash refund, the £141 
million current tax credit also includes 
the release of an accounting accrual, 
which is a non-cash item.
For 2013/14, the group recognised 
a deferred tax charge of £41 million, 
compared with a credit of £3 million 
in 2012/13. In addition, the group 
has recognised a deferred tax credit 
of £157 million relating to the three 
per cent staged reduction in the 
mainstream rate of corporation 
tax, substantively enacted on 2 July 
2013, to reduce the rate to 20 per cent 
by 2015/16. A deferred tax credit of 
£53 million relating to a similar one 
per cent reduction in the mainstream 
rate of corporation tax was included in 
2012/13. The group also recognised 
a deferred tax credit of £13 million 
relating to prior years’ matters. 
An overall tax credit of £194 million 
has been recognised for 2013/14. 
Excluding the deferred tax impact of 
the future reduction in the corporation 
tax rate and the adjustments relating to 
recently agreed matters in relation to 
prior years, the total tax charge would 
have been £117 million or 22 per cent 
compared with a £78 million charge or 
25 per cent in the previous year. This 
reduction in total tax rate is due to the 
decrease in the mainstream rate of 
corporation tax from 24 per cent for 
2012/13 to the current rate of 23 per 
cent, together with the year-on-year 
movement in tax disallowable items.
In addition to corporation tax, the 
group pays and bears further annual 
economic contributions, typically of 
around £140 million per annum, in the 
form of business rates, employer’s 
national insurance contributions, green 
taxes and other regulatory service fees 
such as water abstraction charges.
Proﬁt after tax
Underlying proﬁt after tax of £305 
million was £41 million higher than the 
previous year, principally reﬂecting the 
increase in underlying proﬁt before tax. 
Reported proﬁt after tax was £739 
million, compared with £288 million 
last year, impacted by the £171 million 
improvement in fair value gains on 
debt and derivative instruments and 
the £218 million increase in the net tax 
credit between the two periods.
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share 
increased from 38.7 pence to 44.7 
pence. This underlying measure is 
derived from underlying proﬁt after 
tax. This includes the adjustments 
for the deferred tax credits in both 
2013/14 and 2012/13, associated 
with the reductions in the corporation 
tax rate and an adjustment for the tax 
credit arising from agreement of prior 
years’ tax matters in 2013/14. Basic 
earnings per share increased from  
42.2 pence to 108.3 pence. 
Dividend per share
The board has proposed a ﬁnal 
dividend of 24.03 pence per ordinary 
share in respect of the year ended 31 
March 2014. Taken together with the 
interim dividend of 12.01 pence per 
ordinary share, paid in February, this 
produces a total dividend per ordinary 
share for 2013/14 of 36.04 pence. 
This is an increase of 5.0 per cent, 
compared with the dividend relating 
to the previous year, in line with 
group’s dividend policy of targeting 
a growth rate of RPI+2 per cent per 
annum through to at least 2015. The 
inﬂationary increase of 3.0 per cent 
is based on the RPI element included 
within the allowed regulated price 
increase for the 2013/14 ﬁnancial 
year (i.e. the movement in RPI between 
November 2011 and November 2012).  
The ﬁnal dividend is expected to be 
paid on 1 August 2014 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business 
on 20 June 2014. The ex-dividend date 
is 18 June 2014.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Cash ﬂow 
Net cash generated from continuing 
operating activities for the year ended 
31 March 2014 was £805 million, 
compared with £631 million last year. 
This mainly reﬂects the receipt of the 
exceptional tax refund, an improvement 
in working capital cash ﬂows, impacted 
by the reduction in the total pension 
contribution payments between 
the two periods, and an increase in 
operating proﬁt. The group’s net 
capital expenditure was £683 million, 
principally in the regulated water and 
wastewater investment programmes. 
This excludes infrastructure renewals 
expenditure which is treated as an 
operating cost under International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
Net debt including derivatives at 
31 March 2014 was £5,532 million, 
compared with £5,451 million at 31 
March 2013. This slight increase 
reﬂects expenditure on the regulatory 
capital expenditure programmes 
and payments of dividends, interest 
and tax, alongside an increase in the 
principal of our index-linked debt, 
largely offset by operating cash 
ﬂows, fair value gains on our debt and 
derivative instruments and the one-off 
tax refund. 
Debt ﬁnancing and interest  
rate management
Gearing (measured as group net 
debt divided by United Utilities 
Water’s (UUW’s) regulatory capital 
value adjusted for actual capital 
expenditure) decreased to 58 per cent 
at 31 March 2014, compared with 60 
per cent at 31 March 2013, remaining 
well within Ofwat’s 55 per cent to 65 
per cent assumed gearing range. The 
group’s pension accounting position 
has moved to a deﬁcit of £177 million 
at 31 March 2014, on an IFRS basis, 
compared with a small pension surplus 
of £15 million as at 31 March 2013. 
Taking account of the group’s pension 
deﬁcit, and treating it as debt, gearing 
would be 60 per cent. 
UUW has long-term credit ratings 
of A3/BBB+ and United Utilities 
PLC had long-term credit ratings of 
Baa1/BBB- from Moody’s Investors 
Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings 
Services respectively. The split rating 
reﬂects differing methodologies 
used by the credit rating agencies. 
Standard & Poor’s currently have the 
group’s ratings on positive outlook, 
citing improving ﬁnancial metrics and 
operational performance. 
Cash and short-term deposits at  
31 March 2014 amounted to £127 
million. In December 2013, UUW 
agreed a new £500 million term loan 
facility with the European Investment 
Bank (EIB). As at 31 March 2014, 
UUW had drawn down £100 million 
on this facility as a ﬂoating rate 
amortising term loan with semi-annual 
repayments, a ﬁnal maturity in 18 
years and an initial capital repayment 
holiday of two and a half years. The 
remaining £400 million is expected to 
be drawn down in tranches over the 
next year or so. The group also renewed 
£100 million of committed bank 
facilities prior to 31 March 2014 and a 
further £50 million since the year end. 
The group has headroom to cover its 
projected ﬁnancing needs into 2016.

Shareholder information Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Strategic report > Our performance The group has access to the 
international debt capital markets 
through its €7 billion euro medium-
term note programme which provides 
for the periodic issuance by United 
Utilities PLC and UUW of debt 
instruments on terms and conditions 
determined at the time the instruments 
are issued. The programme does not 
represent a funding commitment, with 
funding dependent on the successful 
issue of the debt securities.
Long-term borrowings are structured 
or hedged to match assets and 
earnings, which are largely in sterling, 
indexed to UK retail price inﬂation and 
subject to regulatory price reviews 
every ﬁve years. 
Long-term sterling inﬂation index-
linked debt provides a natural hedge 
to assets and earnings. At 31 March 
2014, approximately 53 per cent of the 
group’s net debt was in index-linked 
form, representing around 31 per cent 
of UUW’s regulatory capital value, with 
an average real interest rate of 1.7 
per cent. The long-term nature of this 
funding also provides a good match to 
the company’s long-life infrastructure 
assets and is a key contributor to the 
group’s average term-debt maturity, 
which is approximately 25 years.
Where nominal debt is raised in a 
currency other than sterling and/or 
with a ﬁxed interest rate, to manage 
exposure to long-term interest rates, 
the debt is generally swapped to 
create a ﬂoating rate sterling liability 
for the term of the liability. To manage 
exposure to medium-term interest 
rates, the group ﬁxes underlying 
interest costs on nominal debt out 
to ten years on a reducing balance 
basis. This is supplemented by ﬁxing 
substantially all remaining ﬂoating 
rate exposure across the forthcoming 
regulatory period around the time of 
the price control determination. 
In line with this, the group ﬁxed interest 
costs for a substantial proportion of 
the group’s debt for the duration of 
the 2010–15 regulatory period around 
the time of the 2009 price review. In 
addition, we have already ﬁxed just over 
half of our ﬂoating rate exposure  over 
the 2015–20 period. Following Ofwat’s 
2015–20 cost of debt guidance, which 
was published as part of its risk and 
reward guidance in January, we intend 
to ﬁx underlying interest rates on 
substantially all of the group’s projected 
nominal debt for the duration of the 
2015–20 regulatory period, during 
2014/15.
Liquidity
Short-term liquidity requirements are 
met from the group’s normal operating 
cash ﬂow and its short-term bank 
deposits and supported by committed 
but undrawn credit facilities. In 
addition to its €7 billion euro medium-
term note programme, the group has 
a €2 billion euro-commercial paper 
programme, both of which do not 
represent funding commitments. 
In line with the board’s treasury  
policy, UU aims to maintain a robust 
liquidity position. Available headroom 
at 31 March 2014 was £864 million 
based on cash, short-term deposits, 
medium-term committed bank 
facilities, along with the undrawn 
portion of the EIB term loan facility, 
net of short-term debt.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 UU believes that it operates a prudent 
approach to managing banking 
counterparty risk. Counterparty risk, 
in relation to both cash deposits and 
derivatives, is controlled through the 
use of counterparty credit limits. UU’s 
cash is held in the form of short-term 
money market deposits with either 
prime commercial banks or with triple 
A rated money market funds.
UU operates a bilateral, rather than 
a syndicated, approach to its core 
relationship banking facilities. This 
approach spreads maturities more 
evenly over a longer time period, 
thereby reducing reﬁnancing risk 
and providing the beneﬁt of several 
renewal points rather than a large 
single reﬁnancing requirement. 
Pensions
As at 31 March 2014, the group had 
an IAS 19 net retirement beneﬁt, 
or pension, deﬁcit of £177 million, 
compared with a net pension surplus 
of £15 million at 31 March 2013. 
This £192 million adverse movement 
principally reﬂects the movement of 
long-term market rates during the 
period, particularly inﬂuenced by the 
signiﬁcant reduction in corporate 
credit spreads. In contrast, the scheme 
speciﬁc funding basis does not suffer 
from volatility due to credit spread 
movements as it uses a prudent, ﬁxed 
credit spread assumption. 
Therefore, the recent credit spread 
movements have not had a material 
impact on the deﬁcit calculated on a 
scheme speciﬁc funding basis or the 
level of deﬁcit repair contributions.
The triennial actuarial valuations  
of the group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
schemes were carried out as at  
31 March 2013 and the overall 
funding position has improved since 
March 2010. Following the de-risking 
measures we have implemented over 
recent years, our pension funding 
position remains well placed and in line 
with our expectations. There has been 
no material change to the scheduled 
cash contributions as assessed at 
the previous valuations in 2010. The 
group has already completed early 
all scheduled deﬁcit repair payments 
through to March 2015.
Further detail is provided in note 19 
(‘Retirement beneﬁt (obligations)/
surplus’) of these consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements.

Strategic report > Our performance Our business plan 2015-20
On 2 December 2013, we 
submitted our business plan, 
covering the 2015–20 period 
(AMP6), to Ofwat. In building 
our plan we have taken 
account of the views of over 
27,000 customers and other 
stakeholders to understand 
their priorities.
Our Customer Challenge Group has 
also been extensively involved in 
formulating research and challenging 
resulting plans in detail. The result is 
a plan that we believe strikes the right 
balance between customer service, the 
environment and customer bills.
The key features of the delivery plans 
for each of the four price controls are 
set out below.
Wholesale water
The North West beneﬁts from one of 
the youngest water networks in the 
country, with over 50 per cent of our 
network constructed or renewed in the 
last 30 years. This is a consequence of 
signiﬁcant investment over previous 
regulatory cycles to improve water 
quality. We also beneﬁt from historic 
investment in the integration of our 
networks to create a core ‘integrated 
supply zone. ’ The most recent addition 
to this was the West–East pipeline 
running approximately 50 kilometres 
between Liverpool and Manchester. As 
a consequence we are able to provide 
one of the most efﬁcient and ﬂexible 
water services in the sector.
Customers told us that they wanted 
to retain their current level of water 
services, but do not want to pay for 
water service improvements. This has 
driven our proposals for AMP6, where 
our core focus is to continue ongoing 
maintenance of the existing service 
to keep it working reliably now and in 
the future, managing costs carefully 
and reducing the number of customer 
contacts. 
At Ennerdale Lake in West Cumbria, 
the Environment Agency’s planned 
withdrawal of our abstraction rights 
for environmental reasons raises 
supply and demand balance issues 
for the local population. After 
careful evaluation of a number of 
alternative options in conjunction 
with the Environment Agency and 
other stakeholders, we are proposing 
a preferred solution which has broad 
support. This will see the development 
of a new treatment works near 
Thirlmere and connection of the West 
Cumbrian supply network to our 
integrated supply zone. This project is 
the main capital scheme for our water 
network.
Key features of our plan include that 
we will: 
• maintain existing high levels of 
reliability in the delivery of day-to-
day water services, making better 
use of technology to remotely 
monitor and control more of our 
source-to-tap assets; 
• maintain existing high levels of water 
quality as measured at customers’ 
taps and our water treatment works; 
• reduce the number of contacts from 
customers regarding water quality;
• maintain leakage levels at 2014/15 
target levels, which are at or below 
the sustainable economic level;
• limit the impact to customers of 
increases in operating costs such 
as power, chemicals and rates, by 
making cost savings elsewhere 
through the continuous improvement 
in the efﬁciency of our operations; 
and
• commence work to link 150,000 
customers in West Cumbria to 
Thirlmere reservoir to ensure a 
long-term, reliable supply of drinking 
water and providing beneﬁts to the 
environment at Ennerdale. 
Wholesale wastewater
The region’s geography, the legacy 
of the Industrial Revolution, 
population growth and long-term 
underinvestment in the region’s 
wastewater infrastructure mean 
that new European environmental 
legislation has a signiﬁcant impact on 
our plans for the next regulatory cycle 
and beyond. Furthermore, the North 
West has one of the country’s largest 
combined waste and surface water 
infrastructures and this has signiﬁcant 
implications for river and bathing 
water quality in the heavy rainfall 
events anticipated under climate 
change. These are signiﬁcant new 
challenges for our wastewater service 
and will drive high levels of capital 
expenditure in meeting statutory 
obligations. 
Against this backdrop, customers 
told us that for the most part they 
wanted their wastewater services to 
remain stable. Whilst they want to see 
progress in reducing sewer ﬂooding 
and in improving the environment, they 
are concerned about the impact that 
service improvements will have on 
their bills. We have responded to this 
by devising a balanced programme of 
work over AMP6 and beyond that will 
progressively deliver UK Government 
compliance with European legislation. 
46
United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 This also takes account of customers’ 
views on the acceptable level of future 
bill increases. 
In AMP6 we will: 
• build on the customer satisfaction 
improvements we have already 
delivered. We will continue to 
improve the way we operate our 
wastewater business, making better 
use of technology, automation and 
control to drive better customer 
service at reduced cost; 
• reduce the risk of sewer ﬂooding 
inside customers’ properties by 40 
per cent, seeking opportunities to 
work in partnership with others to 
deliver schemes cost-effectively and 
promote the use of more sustainable 
drainage systems; 
• enhance the region’s bathing waters 
and work with other organisations 
to support them in delivering 
improvements to our region’s 
beaches; 
• improve the water quality in the 
North West’s rivers and lakes through 
investment in our treatment works 
and at overﬂows, reducing pollution. 
We are engaging with stakeholders 
to explore innovative catchment 
management techniques to control 
diffuse pollution in our catchments; 
• increase our production of renewable 
energy from waste to help protect 
customers from rising energy costs 
and reduce our carbon footprint; 
• absorb signiﬁcant additional 
costs for taking responsibility 
for all private sewers and private 
pumping stations across the region. 
Costs will be constrained through 
improvements to our operating 
model and efﬁcient delivery of our 
programme. 
Household retail
Our focus for the current regulatory 
period has been and continues to be 
to improve the customer experience. 
This involves being more proactive 
with customers, anticipating problems 
before they materialise and improving 
our communication channels so that 
we are easier to do business with. 
We aim to further reduce the number 
of complaints and to resolve them 
whenever we can, avoiding the need for 
complaints to be referred to the CCW .
We look to reduce the debt burden 
on the company and its customers by 
engaging with those who are struggling 
to pay, helping them to return to 
sustained payment behaviour. We are 
extending our options for assistance to 
hard-pressed customers by developing 
a social tariff that secures a high level 
of acceptability from customers. 
We remain committed to contribute 
annually to the United Utilities Trust 
fund, which has proven effective in 
helping customers in difﬁculty return 
to regular payment. 
Our domestic retail plan also sees us 
continuing our efforts to reduce the 
cost to serve our customers through 
systems and process improvement. 
This is particularly important under the 
new price control methodology which 
uses an industry average retail cost to 
serve to determine part of customer 
bills.
Non-household retail
We welcome the opportunity offered 
through the opening of the English 
non-household retail market to 
competition. Over the last two years 
we have recruited a management team 
with other sector experience to lead 
our business retail area, and separated 
this team from our domestic retail and 
wholesale business areas. This team 
has embarked on a transformation 
programme focused on getting the 
basics right against core customer 
needs, creating the culture of a 
business-to-business retailer. 
Our early progress has been 
encouraging and our success in 
growing our United Utilities Scotland 
business has allowed us to learn 
about the propositions, processes 
and systems required to win, serve 
and retain non-household customers. 
Research has highlighted a need for a 
broader range of services targeted to 
different segments. We are developing 
these in our non-appointed business 
ensuring that they are only paid for by 
customers who want these services. 
Non-household customers tell us that 
the three most important things they 
look to their water supplier to deliver 
are: value for money; a reliable supply; 
and great customer service. With this 
in mind, through the course of AMP6 
we will: 
• install meters in all business

Strategic report > Our business plan 2015-20 Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk is managed through 
the individual responsibility 
of each business area, 
supported by our Corporate 
Risk Framework, which aims 
for continuous improvement. 
With an overarching 
mandate and commitment 
by the board, the framework 
consists of four key areas:
• Governance; 
• Approach; 
• Process; and
• Guidance. 
The application of the framework 
involves the regular assessment of the 
internal and external risk environment 
by the business. We focus on the 
factors that could limit or prevent 
the achievement of our company 
objectives and involves the prioritised 
implementation of controls to mitigate 
exposure and build resilience and 
sustainability. 
The most signiﬁcant risks and the 
group’s risk proﬁle summary are 
reported to the executive and the 
board twice a year. This supports the 
determination of the nature and extent 
of those risks we are willing to take 
in pursuing our objectives in line with 
good corporate governance practice. In 
addition, the audit committee regularly 
reviews the framework’s effectiveness, 
and the group’s compliance with it (see 
page 68), reporting its ﬁndings to the 
board.
Key features and developments 
over the last year 
Key features for 2013/14 relate to 
the ongoing dominance of regulatory 
risks and the uncertainty which these 
continue to pose. 
There continues to be two ongoing 
pieces of material litigation worthy of 
note but, based on the facts currently 
known to us and the provisions in our 
statement of ﬁnancial position, our 
directors remain of the opinion that the 
likelihood of these having a material 
adverse impact on the group’s ﬁnancial 
position is remote. 
• In 2009, United Utilities 
International Limited (UUIL) was 
served with notice of a ‘class action’ 
in Argentina.  The action relates to 
allegations about a US$230 million 
bond relating to Inversora Electrica 
de Buenos Aires S.A. (IEBA) that 
UUIL had a 45 per cent shareholding 
in (but sold in 2005).  IEBA owned 
an Argentine electricity distribution 
network.  The amount of the claim 
remains unspeciﬁed and UUIL 
continues to defend the matter 
vigorously.
• In March 2010, Manchester Ship 
Canal Company (MSCC) issued 
proceedings against United Utilities 
Water PLC (UUW) alleging that UUW 
was trespassing as a result of it 
discharging into the canal.  MSCC is 
seeking damages and other relief.  
UUW won a ‘summary judgment’ 
application regarding a signiﬁcant 
element of the claim but an appeal of 
that judgment was considered by the 
Supreme Court at the beginning of 
May. We await the court’s decision.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Also notable was the extent of 
mitigating activity across the 
business in response to the changing 
regulatory environment and our 
commitment to be a leading water 
and wastewater company and service 
provider. This included signiﬁcant 
progress in customer satisfaction, 
operational service performance and 
environmental assessments carried 
out by the Environment Agency. In 
addition, there was a step forward 
following activities tied to our 
ongoing commitment to a continuous 
and secure supply of water with a 
successful inspection of the largest 
aqueduct in Europe, detecting no 
urgent structural maintenance 
required. Ongoing business change 
and transformation programmes also 
featured heavily during the year in 
both the wholesale and business retail 
businesses preparing for the opening 
of the English market in 2017. This 
included the successful acquisition of 
customers in Scotland which provides 
not only a source of income for the 
group, but also a platform to learn and 
develop expertise. Ongoing innovative 
initiatives also played a key part in 
business transformation with a focus 
on reducing operating cost and the 
cost to serve. 
Looking ahead
Following the price determination, we 
expect our risk proﬁle to return to one 
based on operational performance, 
compliance and delivery risk. The 
ongoing development of the non-
household market, including the 
extent of competitor activity and 
customer switching rates, will continue 
to be a focus as will the uncertainty 
surrounding the form of upstream 
competition for water and sewerage 
services. 
Determination of the 
principal risks
The ﬁve principal risks summarised 
on pages 50 and 51 have been 
determined by considering our 
entire risk proﬁle relative to the ﬁve 
principal risk categories contained 
within our Corporate Risk Framework 
(Strategic, Financial, Operational, 
Compliance and Hazard), drawing out 
key circumstances where there is a 
potential for material effect. In each 
case the summary illustrates a list of 
current issues and uncertainties along 
with the extent of control/mitigation 
and the  commitment to manage these 
areas by illustrating the link to our 
company objectives and the company 
business plan through relevant 
performance indicators.

Shareholder information Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Strategic report > Principal risks and uncertainties Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk Potential impact
Strategic Risk
1. The regulatory environment 
Current issues or areas of uncertainty include: 
i) The PR14 price determination will reﬂect a lower assumed 
weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and may reﬂect 
lower cost allowances than incorporated in our proposed 
business plan. Regulatory penalties relating to the current 
regulatory period are also possible
ii) Market reform (see 2 below)
iii) Compliance with regulations (see 4 below) 
Our proposed business plans are subject to final determination from Ofwat which 
may reflect a different view of the appropriate scope and /or cost of delivering 
customer benefits. Longer-term and less frequent changes to the mechanism may 
also cause increased costs of administration and also reduce income and margin. 
The water and wastewater sectors in England and Wales have benefitted from a 
stable and transparent regulatory regime based on a regulatory capital value. The 
evolution of regulation in the sector may involve incremental changes to this model, 
more variations in returns and, consequently, changes to the risk and return profile 
of companies operating in the sector.
2. Competition in the market
Current issues or areas of uncertainty include:
i) Market reform including competition in the non-household 
retail sector
ii) Competitor positioning in the market
iii) Upstream reform
iv) Compliance with regulations (see 4 below) 
The opening of the market for retail services to non-household customers in 
England generates both opportunities to gain market share and scale and risks of 
losing market share and margin erosion. Longer term, upstream competition has 
the potential to generate issues relating to underutilisation or stranding of assets, 
although there is much uncertainty surrounding the development of upstream 
competition.
Financial Risk
3. The economy 
Current issues or areas of uncertainty include:
i) Stability of the world economy 
ii) Speed of economic recovery 
iii) Stability of ﬁnancial institutions 
iv) Socio-economic deprivation in the North West
v) Welfare Reform and the impact on domestic bad debt 
Adverse market conditions can impact the group’s profitability and financial 
condition in a number of ways. These range from price rises for goods and services 
affecting profit and cash flow to the availability and /or cost of funding and 
hedging. It may also lead to increased customer bad debt with the North West 
suffering a higher level of socio-economic deprivation than any other region of 
the UK. Differentials to predicted financial instrument yields can also affect the 
economic return on the RCV and on our pension schemes with a requirement for 
the group to make additional contributions. In extreme but remote cases adverse 
conditions can affect our debt obligations and credit rating and the ability of our 
financial counterparties to meet their debt obligations to us.
Compliance Risk
4. Failure to comply with applicable 
 law or regulations 
Current issues or areas of uncertainty include:
i) Ongoing legal, economic, environmental and regulatory 
requirements associated with operating in a highly 
regulated business 
ii) Market reform (see 2 above)
iii) Material litigation (see page 48)
In addition to general UK and international laws, our activities are subject to 
significant additional obligations. In the context of changes in the regulatory 
environment there is a risk that we fail to adopt policies/processes to ensure 
compliance with emerging requirements. It is also difficult to predict the impact of 
future changes to laws or regulations or the introduction of new law or regulations 
that affect us and, from time to time, interpretation of existing laws or regulations 
may also change or the approach to enforcement may become more rigorous. 
We could face a range of impacts from this. These include financial payments, 
penalties (of up to ten per cent of relevant regulated turnover), the imposition 
of an enforcement order requiring additional capital/operating expenditure or 
compensation following litigation. It could also lead to high levels of scrutiny 
by regulators, enforcement agencies or authorities with associated increase in 
operational costs. In more extreme but remote circumstances, impacts could 
ultimately include licence revocation or the appointment of a special administrator.
Operational and Hazard Risk
5. Operational and Hazardous Events
Current issues or areas of uncertainty include:
i) Future abstraction licencing
ii) Supply demand balance in West Cumbria
iii) Weather conditions
iv) Population growth 
v) Investment requirements in wastewater infrastructure
vi) Excavation, tunnelling and construction work
Caused by both internal and external factors, operational impacts can range from 
performance related issues, such as leakage or discharge consent breaches to 
service related issues such as operational/asset failures and the effect on quality, 
supply or flooding. In exceptional and extremely remote circumstances which may 
include human error or malicious intervention, the impact could be more significant 
ranging from environmental damage, economic and social disruption to loss of life.
Depending on the circumstances the company could be exposed to increased 
regulatory scrutiny, regulatory penalties and/or additional operating or capital 
expenditure. In the more extreme situations the group could also be fined for 
breaches of statutory obligations, be held liable to third parties and sustain 
reputational damage.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Control mitigation Strategic relevance Performance indicators 
Our business plan has been prepared based on extensive research and consultation from a wide 
range of stakeholders including customers, environmental and quality regulators and others in order 
to ensure that it is both affordable and sustainable, meets statutory and legal obligations, strikes 
an appropriate balance between the needs of customers and the environment, whilst still being 
financeable by investors.
We engage in relevant government and regulatory consultations and initiatives which may affect 
the future strategic decisions made about policy and regulation in the sectors where we operate. 
In addition, we proactively consider all the opportunities and threats associated with any potential 
change, exploiting opportunities and mitigating risks where appropriate.

We look to retain existing and acquire new customers by striving to meet their needs more

Refinancing is long-term with staggered maturity dates to minimise the effect of short-term 
downturns. Counterparty credit, exposure and settlement limits exist to reduce any potential future 
impacts. These are based on a number of factors, including the credit rating and the size of the asset 
base of the individual counterparty. The group also employs hedging strategies to stabilise market 
fluctuation for inflation, interest rates and commodities (notably energy prices). Sensitivity analysis 
is carried out as part of the business planning process, influencing the various financial limits 
employed. Continuous monitoring of the markets takes place including equity movements. 
Within our operations, contract and category management covers supplier price and price volatility 
of goods and services and the effect of the economy on our customers is monitored. We adopt best 
practice collection techniques including the segmentation of customers based on their credit risk 
profile.

The group has robust processes in place to identify risks to its compliance with legal and regulatory 
obligations and seeks to take appropriate action to ensure compliance. This includes continually 
monitoring legislative and regulatory developments, the training of employees in new developments 
and the participation in consultations to influence their outcome, either directly or through industry 
trade associations for wider issues. Funding for any additional compliance costs in the regulated 
business is sought as part of the price determination process. The group also robustly defends 
litigation where appropriate and seeks to minimise its exposure by establishing provision and 
seeking recovery wherever possible.

• Dow Jones sustainability 
• Regulatory reporting

• Company risk and

Controls and mitigation relate to our core business processes, focusing on preventing negative 
impacts in order to support high levels of customer service and operation in a reasonable manner. 
Forecasting and monitoring is a fundamental element of our operational activity, with robust quality 
assurance procedures, risk assessments and rigorous sampling /testing regimes in place. Ongoing 
network maintenance and capital programmes aim to enhance standards and integration across the 
water and wastewater networks for both service and resilience. We also undertake major education 
programmes in both water usage and appropriate disposal into the sewer network in an attempt 
to minimise operational issues. In support of this, physical and technological security measures 
to protect the operational capability from malicious or accidental activity and governance and 
inspection regimes exist for key infrastructure assets (including aqueducts, dams, reservoirs and 
treatment works). We have also developed a strong health and safety and environmental culture 
throughout the organisation supported by health and safety management (HSMS) and environmental 
management systems (EMS) which are certified to OHSAS18001 and ISO14001 respectively.  
Recognising that events can materialise, we operate long-standing responsive controls. These include 
well tested and appropriately resourced incident response, business continuity, disaster recovery 
and escalation procedures which continue to be refined.  We also maintain insurance cover in relation 
to losses and liabilities likely to be associated with significant risks, although potential liabilities 
arising from catastrophic events could exceed the maximum level of cover that can be obtained cost-
effectively. The licence of the regulated business also contains a ‘shipwreck’ clause that, if applicable, 
may offer a degree of recourse to Ofwat/customers (by way of an interim determination) in the event 
of a catastrophic incident.

Quick facts
• The Chairman met the independence criteria as set out in the Code 
when he was appointed to the board
• The Code requires that half of the board is made up of independent 
non-executive directors (the test excludes the Chairman). At United 
Utilities, ﬁve out of seven directors (which excludes the Chairman) 
are independent non-executive directors
• The company secretary attends all board and committee meetings 
and advises the Chairman on governance matters. The company 
secretariat team provides administrative support
• All directors are subject to annual election at the AGM held in 
July. Following the completion of the annual evaluation process all 
the non-executive directors were considered by the board to be 
independent and making a valuable and effective contribution to 
the board. As a result, the board recommends that shareholders 
vote those wishing to stand for a further term back into ofﬁce at the 
forthcoming AGM

Dr John McAdam
Chairman
“ We have aimed to adopt 
a more transparent 
approach to this year’s 
annual report. ”
Dear Shareholder
UK Corporate Governance Code 
This is our ﬁrst annual report whereby 
we are reporting in line with the 
2012 version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (which incorporates 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2010 with which we are required to 
comply under the FRC Listing Rules)
and is referred to in this report as ‘the 
Code’ . I can conﬁrm that the company 
has complied fully with the principles 
and spirit of the Code during the year. 
As a board, we aspire to apply the 
highest standards of governance to our 
conduct around the board table and we 
strive to ensure that these standards 
are applied by the executive team and 
cascaded throughout the group. Strong 
governance is business as usual at 
United Utilities.
As last year, we have used the key 
principles of the Code - of leadership, 
effectiveness, accountability, 
remuneration and relations with 
shareholders to provide the structure 
for this report.
Over the past year, there has been 
considerable change in the areas of 
governance and narrative reporting, 
and as a board we have been monitoring 
these developments. We have aimed 
to adopt a more transparent approach 
to this year’s annual report and would 
welcome feedback as to whether you, 
as a reader, feel that this has been 
achieved. 
54
United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 On the board’s agenda
One  of  the board’s most important roles 
is to provide strategic leadership and 
direction throughout the development 
of the ﬁve-year business plan for 
2015–20 which was submitted to Ofwat 
in December 2013. The plan will be 
ﬁnalised and agreed later in the year. 
The December plan sought to meet 
the needs of all our stakeholders by 
balancing affordability, customers’ 
preferences and priorities, while 
ensuring we meet our statutory 
obligations. Discussions continue with 
Ofwat and through the process we 
will agree a plan that strikes the right 
balance between customer service, 
the environment and customer bills. 
We will work with the regulator and our 
Customer Challenge Group to achieve 
the right balance of risks and rewards 
against delivery of the outcomes that 
customers value most.
The emerging challenges for the board 
to address during the year included the 
risks posed by cyber crime and shale 
gas extraction and hydraulic fracturing 
(‘fracking’), two very different but topical 
challenges. Cyber crime is high on the 
agenda for the UK Government, and our 
strategy to protect our business will 
be aligned with the government’s plan. 
We have been working to understand 
the impact of fracking on our business 
and the services we provide to our 
customers. A statement on fracking can 
be found on our website at 
corporate.unitedutilities.com/
documents/uu-shale-gas-statement.

Board changes and succession
During the year we welcomed Mark Clare 
to the board as an independent non-
executive director. Mark’s biographical 
details can be found on page 56, his 
considerable experience in ﬁnance 
and his time spent in the regulated 
environment of the energy industry, and 
more latterly as CEO of a FTSE house 
building/construction company, are 
directly relevant to our business.
Nick Salmon is due to stand down at 
the AGM in July, after around nine years 
serving on the board and, since 2007, 
as the company’s senior independent 
director. 
We wish him well for the future and 
thank him for his extensive contribution 
to the board and the group. Mark 
Clare will be appointed as the senior 
independent director on Nick Salmon 
leaving the board.
Since 2011, the boards of UUG and 
UUW (our principal operating subsidiary 
which provides water and wastewater 
services to our customers) have had 
the same serving directors on the 
board, which we feel increases the 
efﬁciency and effectiveness of our 
corporate governance structure. The 
only exception is Steven Fraser, who 
was appointed as a director of UUW on 
1 April 2013. Steven is the managing 
director of UUW’s wholesale business, 
and is responsible for the day-to-
day operational activities of UUW . 
His appointment provides the UUW 
board with additional insight into the 
operational challenges the company 
faces.
United Utilities has a simple corporate 
structure and its governance processes 
address Ofwat’s published principles 
on board leadership, transparency 
and governance. Our statement can 
be found on our website at corporate.
unitedutilities.com/corporate-
governance
As Chairman, and leader of the board, it 
is my responsibility to ensure we have 
effective governance, and to do this 
we need to have the right atmosphere 
of openness and trust around the 
board table in order that queries and 
concerns can be raised and addressed 
in a constructive way. In our annual 
board evaluation, I am pleased to report 
that the views of my fellow directors 
reﬂected that we do indeed have a 
positive atmosphere around our board 
table and that issues are freely raised 
and addressed.
We have a comprehensive programme 
of events where our CEO, CFO and 
investor relations manager meet with 
investors and Sara Weller, the chair 
of our remuneration committee, has 
been keen to engage with shareholders 
to gain their views on our executive 
remuneration framework. As the board, 
we have an ‘open door’ policy and would 
encourage shareholders and investors 
to contact us if we can help in any way –

Audit Committee
Code principle: Leadership
Overview of the board’s 
responsibilities 
• Our board is responsible for setting 
the strategy of the group and 
ensuring the long-term success of the 
group for customers, investors and 
wider stakeholders; and in creating 
shareholder value;
• It is responsible for challenging and 
encouraging the management team in 
its interpretation and implementation 
of how it manages the business, and 
that it is doing so in accordance with 
the strategic goals the board has set. 
Collectively, the directors have many 
years of experience gained across 
a variety of areas and industries. 
Some have spent part of their careers 
overseas, and whilst there is a huge 
diversity in their skills and experience, 
they have predominantly worked in 
regulated industries, as is appropriate 
to our business. Diversity in skills 
and experience helps the board to be 
proactive in its view of the business, 
and in its guidance and challenge to 
the management team;
• The board is responsible for 
ensuring the company’s internal 
control systems (including ﬁnancial, 
operational and compliance) and 
processes are sound and ﬁt for 
purpose. See the ‘Accountability’ 
section of this report on page 67 for 
more detail;
• The board  has responsibility to 
ensure that the company has the 
necessary ﬁnancial resources and 
people with the necessary skills to 
achieve its objectives; it also reviews 
managerial performance annually; 
• Full details of the matters that 
the board has reserved for its 
own decision making due to their 
importance to the business or the 
working of the board, can be found on 
our website corporate.unitedutilities.
com/corporate-governance; and
• The UUG board has oversight of 
capital expenditure projects which 
exceed £50 million, and any project 
which materially increases the group’s 
risk proﬁle or is not in the ordinary 
course of the group’s business.
Governance structure for our 
board and our committees 
In line with the Code, the board 
delegates certain roles and 
responsibilities to various sub-
committees, as shown in the diagram 
below. Whilst the board retains overall 
responsibility, a sub-committee 
structure allows these committees to 
probe the subject matter more deeply 
and gain a greater understanding of 
the detail, and then report back to the 
board on the matters discussed. 
The reports of the principal board 
committees required by the Code can 
be found on the subsequent pages. 
The executive management team is 
chaired by the CEO, and its members 
are the senior managers who have a 
direct reporting line to the CEO. Short 
biographies of the executive team can 
be found on our website at corporate.
unitedutilities.com/united-utilities-
executive-team
The board received reports from the 
CEO and CFO at every scheduled board 
meeting, providing the board with 
an updated overview of the business 
and its ﬁnancial position. Minutes of 
board and committee meetings (with 
the exception of the remuneration 
committee) are tabled and the chairs of 
each of the board committees verbally 
report on their activities.

Notes: 
Paul Heiden retired from the board at the AGM on 26 July 2013. Paul stepped down as treasury committee chair prior to the meeting held in June 2013, when Brian May took over as the 
committee chair.
Mark Clare was appointed to the board and the audit and nomination committees on 1 November 2013. 
Nick Salmon was appointed to the audit committee on 26 July 2013 when Paul Heiden stepped down to ensure the committee membership remained at three independent non-executive 
directors. 
Steve Mogford stepped down from the nomination committee on 25 February 2014 prior to the February 2014 committee meeting.
As directors, our intention is always 
to attend all scheduled board and 
committee meetings, as you can 
see from the table above. Only in 
exceptional circumstances would we 
not do so. Similarly, every effort is 
made to attend ad hoc meetings either 
in person or via the use of video or 
telephone conferencing facilities if 
needs be. None of our non-executive 
directors have raised concerns over 
the time commitment required of 
them to fulﬁl their duties. The need for 
succinct board and committee packs 
is an enduring challenge. Board paper 
templates have been used for a number 
of years in order to provide a common 
structure for both the reader of the 
report and the author and promote a 
more consistent quality. 
We, the non-executive directors, 
regularly meet the evening before a 
scheduled board meeting along with 
the CEO, which allows us to share our 
thoughts on current issues and the 
business of the meeting. This time 
together is well spent, allowing us 
extra time to share views and cross 
check our understanding of certain 
issues ahead of the meeting.
Conflicts of interest
The company’s articles of association 
contain provisions which permit 
unconﬂicted directors to authorise 
conﬂict situations. Each director is 
required to notify the Chairman and/
or company secretary of any potential 
conﬂict, and the board reviews the 
position of each director annually. 
No changes were recorded which 
would impact the independence of 
any of the directors who fulﬁlled the 
independence criteria on appointment.
Board evaluation
We have again completed our internal 
board evaluation; we are due to engage 
an external facilitator for the 2015 
evaluation. 
The process is facilitated and 
evaluated by the company secretary 
and is based on the completion of 
questionnaires by board members 
seeking their views on the operation 
and effectiveness of the board; 
the balance of skills, experience, 
knowledge and diversity (including 
gender) of board members. 
Questionnaires speciﬁcally related 
to the operation and effectiveness of 
the various board committees are also 
completed. Views were also sought 
on the administrative support for the 
board and the different committees, 
and whether there was sufﬁcient 
information and time devoted to key 
activities such as strategic planning. 
The process we followed was that 
used by Lintstock (who undertook 
our external evaluation in 2012). In 
addition to board members, other 
senior managers who regularly 
attend and support committee 
meetings were asked to complete 
the same questionnaires. The results 
were then analysed by the company 
secretary. The ﬁndings, which are kept 
anonymous, were discussed with the 
Chairman or the chair of the speciﬁc 
committee as appropriate and tabled 
at a meeting of the relevant committee 
and then presented to the board. 
60
United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Directors also complete individual questionnaires assessing their own performance, contribution and perceptions of being 
a director at United Utilities. The Chairman also conducts one-to-one interviews with each of the non-executive directors, 
with particular focus on challenging the independence credentials of those who have served a six-year term or longer. The 
senior independent director, supported by the other non-executive directors, leads the performance evaluation of the 
Chairman. Speciﬁc training has been provided to the directors during the year on a number of areas including regulatory 
matters and changes in reporting and governance requirements. On the appointment as a director to  both UUG and/or the 
UUW board, directors receive information on the key duties of being a director of a regulated water company including the 
role of the regulated  company’s holding company (known as ‘Condition P’ of the regulatory licence). This information is kept 
continually under review.
Actions arising from the 2012/13 evaluation What we have done in response
Build further on improving the standard of presentations 
given to the board
These were felt to have improved considerably. Refinements 
and improvements will continue to be made, with presenters 
encouraged to take into account their audience and maintain a 
sharp focus on the key issues and be as succinct as possible.
Maintain the opportunities for the board to meet with 
members of the executive and wider senior management 
team
A variety of executive members and senior managers present 
to the board on a variety of issues. Due to the predominance of 
the price review process, the board has not had the opportunity 
to see the full range of senior executives that it would like, but 
steps will be taken to rectify this in 2014/15. Additionally, 
there are a number of events held during the year, including the 
management conference held in the North West, board meetings 
and the AGM when the board has the opportunity to meet with 
executives and other senior managers.
Further develop the focus of executive succession  
planning
In response to a letter sent to chairmen of FTSE100 companies 
from the Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills 
and Lord Davies of Abersoch regarding the recruitment of 
women board members, the Chairman and two female members 
of the executive team attended an event organised by the 
Department of Business Innovation and Skills where potential 
candidates for non-executive positions had the opportunity to 
meet chairmen of FTSE100 companies.
Given the evolving regulatory agenda, ensure the 
board continues to have opportunities to broaden its 
understanding and knowledge, with particular focus on 
market reform
Regulatory issues and updates have been given at every board 
meeting and the board has had the opportunity to meet with 
chair and deputy chair of the customer challenge group (CCG) 
on two occasions. The CCG is made up of representatives from 
our independent stakeholders who contributed to the price 
review process. More information can be found at corporate.
unitedutilities.com/ccg
The directors conﬁrmed that they felt the action points coming out of last year’s evaluation had been satisfactorily 
addressed.
The following actions came out of the 2013/14 evaluation:
• There was the need to further improve the visibility and engagement of the executive team and a wide range of senior 
managers with the board and provide more opportunities for such engagement; and
• Maintain the strong focus on succession planning for executives and those in critical posts in the talent pipeline.
Looking forward - what is on the board’s agenda for 2014/15
• The regulatory price review process will continue to dominate the board’s discussions for the ﬁrst half of 2014/15.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE
Dear Shareholder
We currently have a relatively small 
sized board with eight directors in 
total, two of whom are executive 
directors and the remaining six are 
non-executive directors. We feel the 
size of our board is appropriate to 
our business and that the skills and 
experience of our board members 
match its needs. In line with our 
succession plans, Mark Clare was 
appointed during the year and Nick 
Salmon will be stepping down at 
the forthcoming AGM in July after 
over nine years’ service. As a result, 
the refreshing of the board is being 
maintained for the third consecutive 
year arising as a result of natural 
turnover, due to the directors having 
reached around their ninth year of 
service on the board. 
We are aware that the European 
Parliament voted in favour of draft 
rules aimed at increasing female 
representation on the boards of 
listed companies to ensure that there 
is a quota of at least 40 per cent of 
female non-executive directors. We 
will keep this matter under review. 
For the moment, we have maintained 
the 25 per cent gender diversity 
ratio recommended by Lord Davies. 
Our gender diversity policy is taken 
into account during every candidate 
selection process – ultimately we 
will strive to appoint the person we 
believe is best matched to the role.
We have a talent management 
programme which aims to identify 
and develop leaders for our future 
resourcing needs who may, in the 
fullness of time, develop into non-
executive directors of the future. 
Over the coming year, we will be 
looking at the resourcing needs of 
our company in the new regulatory 
period (2015-2020) and ensuring 
that our succession plans at board 
and executive and senior manager 
level complement the needs of our 
business. 
Dr John McAdam 
Chair of the nomination committee

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 What has been on the committee’s 
agenda during the year
Board succession
Board succession planning has been a 
key topic of discussion. To support the 
committee in the search process, which 
resulted in the appointment of Mark 
Clare, we engaged Russell Reynolds 
Associates, an executive search 
consultant. The committee prepared a 
brief of the skills and experience that 
were needed by a candidate, which 
identiﬁed the fact that the successful 
candidate would, when Nick Salmon 
stepped down, be his successor as 
senior independent director. The 
process thereafter was for the 
committee to consider a number 
of suitable candidates, which were 
narrowed down after discussion by the 
committee. A number were then invited 
to attend initial meetings with the 
Chairman and the CEO and business 
services director. Thereafter, a small 
number of candidates were invited to 
meet the other non-executive directors 
and the CFO. The committee met 
again and after discussion agreed that 
the role should be offered to Mark 
Clare. Russell Reynolds Associates 
is a signatory to the voluntary code 
of conduct on gender diversity for 
executive search ﬁrms; it has no other 
relationship with the group other than 
being used on previous occasions for 
executive search purposes.
Question & Answer:
MARK CLARE
“ There is a real pride 
in what has been   
achieved over the last 
few years. ”
What, so far, have you done as part of your induction process?
“So far, I spent an intensive two days at the group’s head ofﬁce in 
Warrington, meeting on a one-to-one basis with members of the executive 
team and other senior managers, covering a number of areas of the business 
including the wholesale activities, domestic retail/customer services and 
regulation. I also spent the afternoon at Davyhulme wastewater treatment 
works in Manchester. It was great to get an understanding from the team 
at Davyhulme about what goes on, and what the opportunities for energy 
generation are at one of the country’s largest wastewater treatment works. ” 
(Davyhulme is the group’s largest wastewater treatment plant serving a 
population equivalent of 1.2 million in and around Manchester; it is set to 
become a centre of excellence for sludge treatment and energy generation. 
Such is the scale of recovery of energy from wastewater at Davyhulme, the 
site generated over 50GWhs of energy during the year - see page 37.)
What are your initial impressions of United Utilities?
“As a customer, in the UK we take our water services pretty much for 
granted. There has been considerable progress in improving customer 
service over the last few years and the challenge for United Utilities is to 
continue to move faster than its peers to get to a leadership position.
“While United Utilities is a big business delivering critical services to its 
customers, it’s also one that has had to embrace considerable change whilst 
continuing to invest in major infrastructure. ”
From your induction process so far, what has left you with a  
lasting impression?
“It’s the people that make great businesses and the enthusiasm, experience 
and willingness to deliver the change programmes came through very 
strongly for me. There is real pride in what has been achieved over the last 
few years and quite rightly so. ”

In February 2014, Steve Mogford 
stepped down from the committee. 
It is common practice across many 
FTSE companies for the CEO not to 
serve as a member of the nomination 
committee. Neither the Chairman 
nor the CEO will participate in the 
reappointment of their own successor 
when the time comes. It is envisaged 
that Steve will be consulted by the 
committee from time to time and 
attend meetings at their request in 
relation to other board and senior 
management appointments as they 
arise.
Board diversity
We have retained the 25 per cent 
female representation on our board, in 
line with the recommendations of Lord 
Davies of Abersoch and in accordance 
with our board diversity policy. We 
are mindful in our board succession 
planning of the wish by Lord Davies and 
the Secretary of State for Business 
Innovation and Skills (BIS) for further 
female appointments to our board. We 
are keen to develop our female senior 
managers so that, over time, they 
can be considered for board 
appointments at United Utilities or as 
potential candidates for non-executive 
directorships in other companies. In 
March 2014, the Chairman and two 
female members of the executive team 
attended the BIS ‘Women on Boards 
Conference’; the aim of the conference 
was to increase the number of female 
candidates in the pipeline for non-
executive posts. At United Utilities 
we are keen to support this ambition, 
believing that non-executive positions 
for its executive team provide 
excellent opportunities for both 
personal and career development.
As is the case in many UK companies, 
certain activities remain more widely 
populated by males (e.g. in operational 
and engineering activities) or females 
(e.g. customer contact centre roles and 
support services). United Utilities is 
no exception, but we are continuing our 
activities to try and address gender 
imbalances at all levels and in all areas 
of our business. During the year, we 
appointed Helen Samuels to a new role 
as our director of engineering (see 
page 66).

Summary of board diversity policy
• Ensure the selection process for board candidates provides access to a 
range of candidates, although any appointments will be made on the basis 
of equal merit, but with due regard for the beneﬁts of diversity on the 
board, including gender diversity
• Ensure that the policies adopted by the group will, over time, promote 
gender diversity among senior managers who will in turn aspire to a board 
position
• In selecting candidates for board positions, only use the services of 
executive search ﬁrms who have signed up to the voluntary code of 
conduct for executive search ﬁrms as recommended by Lord Davies
• Adopt measurable objectives from time to time for achieving gender 
diversity at board level – which shall currently be to maintain at least

HELEN SAMUELS 
DIRECTOR OF 
ENGINEERING
Helen joined United Utilities in February 2014, from 
CH2MHill where she was managing director of its 
European water business.
Helen says: “This is an exciting time for the UK water industry. There’s 
still a lot of work to complete in the current asset management

Wider succession and talent 
management
In 2013/14 we have continued to focus 
on developing our female talent. We 
celebrated International Women’s day 
throughout March with our female 
talent shadowing executive and senior 
leaders. Cate Cartledge, street works 
strategy and compliance manager, 
commented on her experience:
“I had the opportunity to work shadow 
with Sue Amies-King, our Retail 
Director. I found my experience very 
insightful and interesting, and I got a 
lot from the session. In particular, I now 
have much clearer and more focused 
ideas for my personal development 
which will help me reach my future 
goals within United Utilities. ”
We have also been delivering bespoke 
sessions for female employees around 
personal impact and networking, and 
later in 2014, we are partnering with 
the Army who will be working with us to 
develop leadership skills for our future 
female leaders. 
Broader talent development also 
remains a focus for us. We have 
continued to recruit graduates 
and apprentices to feed our future 
resourcing needs. Analysis of our 
attraction rate for female graduates 
and apprentices has enabled us 
to proactively target key schools 
and universities in our advertising 
campaign. This year we have seen 
an increase in the number of female 
graduates being offered a role at 
United Utilities to 35 per cent, an 
increase from last year when 24 
per cent of roles were offered to 
females. We are at the beginning of our 
apprentice recruitment programme, 
from the applications received by 
March 2014, 16 per cent were from 
females, an increase from last year’s 
ﬁgure of ten per cent.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Outcome of the nomination 
committee evaluation
No issues of concern were raised. It 
was felt that the recent non-executive 
recruitment process had been well 
organised and effective resulting in the 
successful appointment of Mark Clare.
Code principle: Accountability
Board’s approach to risk 
management and internal control
It is the board that is responsible for 
determining the nature and extent of 
the risks that it is willing to take to 
achieve its strategic objectives and 
for ensuring that risk management 
and internal control systems are 
effectively managed across the 
business and receive an appropriate 
level of scrutiny and board time. 
The risks that we must manage are 
predominantly those of any water 
and wastewater company and one 
of our most important risks is that 
of fulﬁlling our regulated activities 
and obligations. We adopt a prudent 
approach to the way we manage our 
business and the risks impacting it as is 
appropriate for an organisation such as 
ours that provides a vital service to its 
customers. This approach is reﬂected 
in the culture of our organisation. 
That being said, we are a commercial 
organisation operating within a 
regulated system, and accepting some 
level of risk is a normal consequence of 
doing business. 
It is the role of the board to ensure 
that the management team fully 
understand the risks associated with 
each activity of the business and that 
they undertake appropriate mitigating 
actions, ensuring that the activities 
of the group do not negatively impact 
UUW in accordance with the regulatory 
licence. 
We regularly review the principal risks 
and uncertainties which could impact 
our business, these can be found on 
pages 48 to 51. We believe that the 
risk management process and internal 
control systems and processes are 
well embedded as business as usual 
activities. The audit committee, 
supported by the internal audit 
team, has an initial overview of these 
processes and provides information 
to the board on the assessment of the 
suitability and effectiveness of these 
systems and processes throughout 
the business. Thereafter, the board 
conducts an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the company’s risk 
management and internal control 
systems, including those relating to 
the ﬁnancial reporting process, in 
accordance with the Turnball Guidance 
on Internal Control. No signiﬁcant 
failings or weaknesses were identiﬁed 
in this review. Further information can 
be found in the audit committee report 
on page 73.
Going concern reporting
The board has decided to await 
the publication of ﬁnal guidance 
by the Financial Reporting Council 
(FRC), following the outcome of the 
November 2013 consultation on ‘Risk 
Management, Internal Control and the 
Going Concern Basis of Accounting’ , 
prior to making any changes to its 
‘going concern’ statement (set out 
below) and the consultation the 
FRC announced in April 2014 on 
the ‘Proposed Revisions to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code’ . The 
board expects that there will be 
clariﬁcation on whether the Code will 
continue to require a ‘going concern’ 
statement in the annual report in 
addition to what is required under 
accounting standards (see page 
118), as a result our review of going 
concern and our related disclosure is 
unchanged from our 2013 accounts.
Going concern statement
As part of its review of the ﬁnancial 
report and accounts the board 
considered whether the group had 
adequate ﬁnancial resources to 
continue trading as a going concern. 
FRC guidance requires that in order to 
be considered to be a going concern, 
the group should have adequate 
ﬁnancial resources for at least 12 
months from the date of approval of 
the ﬁnancial statements.
We, the directors, have a reasonable 
expectation that the group has 
adequate resources available to it 
to continue its operational existence 
for the foreseeable future and have 
therefore continued to adopt the 
going concern policy in preparing the 
ﬁnancial statements.
This conclusion is based upon, amongst 
other matters, a review of the group’s 
ﬁnancial projections together with 
a review of the cash and committed 
borrowing facilities available to the 
group as well as consideration of the 
group’s capital adequacy. In addition, 
the directors  also considered, amongst 
other matters, the primary legal 
duty of United Utilities Water PLC’s 
economic regulator to ensure that 
companies can ﬁnance their functions. 
The directors also took into account 
potential contingent liabilities and 
other risk factors as interpreted by the 
guidance given in ‘Going Concern and 
Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors 
of UK Companies 2009’ .

Dear Shareholder
This is my ﬁrst report as chair of the 
audit committee (‘the committee’), 
having taken over the role from 
Paul Heiden in July last year. On 
Paul’s retirement, Nick Salmon 
was reappointed as a member of 
the committee (thereby ensuring 
at all times there were at least 
three independent non-executives 
directors on the committee). I am also 
pleased to welcome Mark Clare,  
who joined the board as an 
independent non-executive  
director on 1 November 2013, as  
a member of the committee. 
Much of the committee’s work, in 
addition to its role in reviewing the 
group’s ﬁnancial statements, is 
necessarily targeted at the regulated 
activities of UUW , which represents 
over 98 per cent of group revenues. 
This reﬂects our commitment to 
safeguarding the interests of our 
stakeholders and all the members of 
the committee are also independent 
non-executive directors of UUW, 
which reinforces this. Details of our 
activities over the past year are set 
out below.
During the year, the committee was 
renamed as the ‘audit committee’ to 
help clarify the committee’s role in 
relation to risk, which is to review 
internal control and risk management 
processes and systems, but it does 
not advise the board on current risk 
exposures and the strategies to 
manage these risks, which is a matter 
for the board itself.
These are changing times for audit 
committees and this report reﬂects 
the new requirements placed on 
audit committees by recent changes 
to the Code. We are committed in 
this report to providing a meaningful 
insight into our activities and 
this report contains sections on: 
the committee’s main duties; the 
activities on its agenda during the 
year; the new Code requirements 
placed on audit committees; and the 
group’s risk management systems, 
internal audit function and internal 
controls.
I trust you will ﬁnd this useful and 
informative.
Brian May 
Chair of the audit committee

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Main duties of the committee
The main duties of the committee are:
• to make a recommendation to 
the board for the appointment or 
reappointment of the auditor and 
establish policies for the provision 
of any non-audit services by the 
auditor;
• to review the scope and the results 
of the annual audit and report to 
the board on the effectiveness 
of the audit process and how the 
independence and objectivity of the 
auditor has been safeguarded;
• to review the half year and annual 
ﬁnancial statements and any 
announcements relating to ﬁnancial 
performance, including reporting to 
the board on the signiﬁcant issues 
considered by the committee in 
relation to the ﬁnancial statements 
and how these were addressed; 
• to review the scope, remit and 
effectiveness of the internal audit 
function and the group’s internal 
control and risk management 
systems;
• to review the group’s procedures for 
whistleblowing, reporting fraud and 
other inappropriate behaviour and to 
receive reports relating thereto; and
• to report to the board on how it has 
discharged its responsibilities.
What has been on the committee’s 
agenda during the year
In addition to fulﬁlling its ongoing 
duties, the committee has an extensive 
agenda of items addressing issues 
relating to the day-to-day activities 
of the business which it deals with in 
conjunction with senior management, 
the auditor, the internal audit function 
and the ﬁnancial reporting team. 
Activities undertaken during 2013/14 
included:
• considering the issues and ﬁndings 
brought to the committee’s attention 
by the internal audit team and 
satisfying itself that management 
has resolved or are in the process of 
resolving any outstanding issues or 
concerns;
• reviewing the reports from the 
ﬁnancial reporting team on the 
ﬁnancial statements and considering 
matters such as the accounting 
judgements and policies being 
applied by management;
• reviewing the going concern 
assumption prior to making a 
recommendation to the board; 
• reviewing the audit reports from 
KPMG on the ﬁnancial statements 
and tasking management to resolve 
any issues relating to internal 
controls and risk management 
systems;
• overseeing the introduction 
of updated processes for 
whistleblowing and reporting fraud; 
• bi-annual oversight and monitoring 
of the group’s compliance with the 
Bribery Act which the board reviews 
annually; and  
• reviewing the committee’s terms of 
reference and the conclusions of the 
committee’s annual evaluation. 
How we assessed whether the 
annual report and accounts, taken 
as a whole, is ‘fair, balanced and 
understandable’ 
The committee, further to the board’s 
request, has reviewed the annual 
report and ﬁnancial statements with 
the intention of providing advice to 
the board on whether, as required 
by the Code, ‘the annual report and 
accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the company’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy’ . 
To make this assessment, the 
committee reviewed the KPIs included 
in the Strategic Report (see pages 
30-31) and concluded that, in light of 
the ﬁve-year regulatory cycles that 
our business operates within, they 
continued to be appropriate for our 
shareholders’ understanding of the 
development, performance, position or 
future prospects of the business. For 
consistency and comparative purposes, 
the committee judged that KPIs 
should be retained unamended (other 
than to reﬂect regulatory reporting 
changes) up until and including the 
2015 ﬁnancial year end. In addition, 
the committee is satisﬁed that all the 
key events and issues which have been 
reported to the board in the CEO’s 
monthly report during the year, both 
good and bad, have been adequately 
referenced or reﬂected within the 
annual report.

How we assessed the effectiveness 
of the external audit process
All members of the committee, as 
well as key members of the senior 
management team, received a 
questionnaire seeking their views 
on how well KPMG had performed 
the audit in 2012/13. The feedback 
was collated and discussed at the 
committee’s meetings in May and 
November 2013 and at the meeting 
in May 2014, when the conclusions 
were discussed and approved. As a 
result, the committee was satisﬁed 
that the overall external audit process 
and services provided by KPMG were 
effective.
How we assessed the 
independence of our external 
auditor
There are two aspects to the auditor 
independence test that the committee 
monitors.
First, in accordance with the Auditing 
Practices Board Ethical Standards, 
KPMG has to implement rules and 
requirements which include that 
none of their employees working 
on our audit can hold any shares in 
United Utilities Group PLC. KPMG 
is also required to tell us about any 
signiﬁcant facts and matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on their 
independence or on the objectivity of 
the lead partner and the audit team. 
The lead partner in the audit team 
must change every ﬁve years, the 
quality review partner who reviews the 
judgements of the audit team actually 
doing the audit rotates every seven 
years along with the key audit partner. 
Secondly, the committee considers 
and approves all the fees that it 
pays for audit, audit-related and 
non-audit services from KPMG. 
KPMG is prohibited from providing 
certain services to the group, such 
as operational consulting, internal 
audit services and strategic planning 
support, as it is felt that these 
types of services could impede their 
independence. 
The policy in relation to non-audit 
fees is that non-audit fees paid to the 
statutory auditor shall not, ordinarily 
exceed 100 per cent of the audit 
fee. The committee has discretion in 
exceptional circumstances for this cap 
on fees to be exceeded. The CFO has 
pre-approval to authorise  certain non-
audit services, such as tax compliance 
work up to £100,000. Thereafter, any 
non-audit fees up to the 100 per cent 
cap can be approved by the committee 
chair. These are then ratiﬁed by the 
committee.
For a number of years, the group 
has engaged the consultancy ﬁrm 
Makinson Cowell to provide it with 
investment research and advice. In 
June 2013, Makinson Cowell was 
acquired by KPMG, thereby increasing 
the level of non-audit fees paid to 
KPMG. Given the board’s satisfaction 
with Makinson Cowell’s services and 
a desire to retain them going forward, 
the committee decided that it was 
in the best interests of the group to 
retain Makinson Cowell’s services for 
the year ended 31 March 2014. These 
services will be reviewed annually. 
As part of UUW’s licence conditions 
it is required to prepare audited 
regulatory accounts. Given the audit 
of the statutory accounts is already 
undertaken by KPMG, there are 
efﬁciencies and cost savings if KPMG 
also audits the regulatory accounts.

Included in the above statutory audit fee for the year 
ended 31 March 2014 is £26,000, in relation to the 
company (year ended 31 March 2013: £25,000).
Taking into account our ﬁndings 
in relation to the effectiveness of 
the audit process and in relation 
to the independence of KPMG, the 
committee is satisﬁed that KPMG 
continues to be independent, and free 
from any conﬂicting interest with the 
group. As a result, the committee has 
recommended to the board that KPMG 
be proposed for reappointment at the 
forthcoming AGM in July 2014.
Audit tender
In 2010 the group completed 
the disposal of its non-regulated 
businesses to concentrate on its core 
regulated water and wastewater 
business and, as a consequence, it 
was felt that this was an appropriate 
time to tender the audit. This took 
place in March 2011 at the end of 
which process KPMG was appointed in 
place of Deloitte. In accordance with 
the Code, the committee will tender 
the audit at least every ten years and 
more frequently if thought beneﬁcial 
to the needs of the business or in 
accordance with any new audit tender 
requirements.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Significant issues considered by 
the committee in relation to the 
financial statements and how 
these issues were addressed  
In relation to the group’s ﬁnancial 
statements, the committee reviewed 
the following principal areas of 
judgement (as noted in the accounting 
policies): 
Capitalisation of ﬁxed assets 
Fixed assets represent a subjective 
area, particularly in relation to costs 
permitted for capitalisation and 
depreciation policy.
• The committee assessed the 
appropriateness of the group’s 
approach to capitalising costs. 
Management demonstrated how 
expenditure was only capitalised 
where it was directly attributable to 
the eventual construction of assets 
under the group’s capital programme. 
Following challenge of management’s 
rationale and considering KPMG’s 
technical advice, the committee 
concluded that the approach was 
appropriate.
• The committee also considered 
expenditure on infrastructure 
assets and the split between what 
is charged to the income statement 
as ‘maintenance’ (see page 112 for 
infrastructure renewal expenditure) 
and capitalised as an ‘enhancement’ . 
Management conﬁrmed that capital 
projects are subject to regular stage 
gate approvals and monthly project 
control reviews, which includes 
project by project assessment 
of expenditure split between 
infrastructure renewals expenditure 
(IRE) and enhancements. After 
further questioning of management 
and KPMG, the committee was 
satisﬁed that processes were 
in place to ensure that IRE was 
appropriately charged to the income 
statement. 
Revenue recognition and allowance 
for doubtful receivables
Due to the nature of the group’s 
business, the extent to which revenue 
is recognised and doubtful customer 
debts are provided against is an 
area of considerable judgement and 
estimation.
• The committee considered the 
appropriateness of the existing 
revenue recognition policy which 
derecognises revenue for certain 
household customers who have not 
paid their bills within a particular 
period of time. After reviewing cash 
collection history and practice, the 
committee concluded the revenue 
recognition policy was appropriate.
• The committee also questioned the 
current levels of doubtful debt and 
credit note provisioning (see note 
16 for more detail). Management 
explained that the increase in the 
provision for doubtful debt was 
largely due to the allowed annual 
increase in customer bills and that 
the bad debt charge as a percentage 
of turnover was in line with the prior 
year. The committee determined that 
the levels of provisioning made were 
reasonable. 
Provisions and contingencies
The group makes provisions for 
contractual and legal claims which 
by their nature are subjective and 
require management to arrive at a best 
estimate as to the probable outcomes 
and costs associated with each 
individual case.
• The committee received regular 
updates on new and existing claims 
being made against the group 
and the extent to which these 
have been provided for (see note 
21 for details). The committee 
focused their attention on the more 
signiﬁcant items and discussed the 
judgements made by management in 
arriving at appropriate provisions in 
relation to these matters.
• Based upon the facts behind each 
provision and taking account of any 
relevant legal advice that may have 
been received as well as the past 
experience of management in making 
such provisions and challenging 
where necessary the views taken 
by management and through the 
assurance provided by KPMG who 
cover these as part of their audit, 
the committee concluded that the 
provisions management had made 
were appropriate.

Retirement benefit obligations
The group’s deﬁned beneﬁt retirement 
schemes is an area of considerable 
judgement and the performance and 
position of which is sensitive to the 
assumptions made.
• The committee sought from 
management an understanding 
as to the factors which led to the 
signiﬁcant deterioration in the 
IAS19 net retirement beneﬁt 
position during the period and noted 
that the scheme speciﬁc funding 
basis had not been impacted by this 
volatility. Management presented 
an explanatory note (see page 
149) in order to communicate 
most effectively what is a complex 
area for the beneﬁt of the group’s 
stakeholders. The committee was 
satisﬁed with the explanations 
provided by management and 
following a review of the explanatory 
note approved its inclusion in the 
ﬁnancial statements.
• The committee reviewed the 
methodology and assumptions 
used in calculating the deﬁned 
beneﬁt scheme positions (see 
note A2 for more details). The 
committee employs the services 
of an external actuary to perform 
these calculations and determine 
the appropriate assumptions to 
make. In addition, KPMG audit 
these assumptions and report 
how the assumptions applied 
compare against other companies. 
After considering the above, the 
committee concluded that the 
approach taken and assumptions 
made were appropriate and fairly 
balanced in determining the net  
retirement beneﬁt obligation.
Derivative financial instruments
The group has a signiﬁcant value 
of swap instruments, the valuation 
of which is based upon models 
which require certain judgements 
and assumptions to be made. The 
committee requires management to 
perform periodic checks to ensure that 
the model derived valuations agree 
back to third party valuations and that 
KPMG check a sample against their 
own valuation models. It was conﬁrmed 
to the committee that such testing 
had been undertaken during the year 
and there were no signiﬁcant issues 
identiﬁed.
Taxation
The committee considered the tax 
risks that the group faces and the key 
judgements made by management 
underpinning the provisions for 
potential tax liabilities and deferred 
tax assets. 
The committee was informed of the 
settlement reached with HMRC, 
primarily in relation to industrial 
business allowances, and the 
signiﬁcant impact this would have 
on the group results (see page 39 for 
more details).

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 The internal audit 
function, led by the head 
of audit and risk, is a key 
element of the group’s 
corporate governance 
framework.
The annual business 
unit risk assessment 
process (BURA) seeks 
to identify how well risk 
management is
embedded across the 
different teams in the 
business.
Internal audit function
The internal audit function, led by 
the head of audit and risk, is a key 
element of the group’s corporate 
governance framework, supporting the 
organisation’s vision and objectives 
by evaluating and recommending  
improvements to risk management 
systems, business processes and 
internal controls. Internal audit covers 
the whole of the group’s activities 
and reports to the committee and 
functionally to the CFO. 
In addition to reviewing the 
effectiveness of these areas and 
reporting on aspects of the group’s 
compliance with them, internal audit 
makes recommendations to address 
any key issues and improve processes. 
Once any recommendations are 
agreed with management, it monitors 
their implementation and reports to 
the committee on progress at every 
meeting.
It produces an annual audit plan, 
endorsed by management, which 
the committee approves formally. 
The plan is risk-based and includes 
risk assessments, issues raised by 
management, prior audit ﬁndings and a 
cyclical review programme to provide 
assurance coverage over time across 
the whole business. 
Risk management systems 
The committee receives updates 
and reports from the head of audit 
and risk on activities relating to the 
company’s risk management systems 
and processes at every meeting. These 
are then reported to the board, as 
appropriate. The group designs its 
risk management activities in order 
to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve its strategic 
objectives.
The CFO has executive responsibility 
for risk management processes and 
systems and is supported in this role 
by the head of audit and risk and the 
corporate risk manager and his team. 
The group audit and risk board (GARB) 
is a sub-committee of the executive 
team. The GARB meets quarterly and 
reviews the governance processes and 
the effectiveness and performance 
of these processes along with the 
identiﬁcation of emerging trends and 
themes within and across the business. 
The work of the GARB then feeds 
into the information and assurance 
processes of the audit committee 
and into the board’s assessment of 
risk exposures and the strategies to 
manage these risks.
The annual business unit risk 
assessment process (BURA) seeks to 
identify how well risk management is 
embedded across the different teams 
in the business. The BURA involves 
a review of the effectiveness of the 
controls that each business unit has 
in place to mitigate risks relating to 
activities in their area of the business, 
to encourage the identiﬁcation of new 
and emerging risks and generally to 
facilitate improvements in the way 
risks are managed. The outcome of 
the BURA process is communicated 
to the board and the executive team. 
This then forms the basis of the 
determination of the most signiﬁcant 
risks that the company faces which are 
then reviewed by the board. 
Internal controls 
The committee reviews the group’s 
internal control systems and receives 
updates on the ﬁndings of internal 
audit’s investigations at every meeting, 
prior to reporting any signiﬁcant 
matters to the board. Internal control 
systems are part of our ‘business as 
usual’ activities and are documented in 
the company’s internal control manual 
which covers ﬁnancial, operational and 
compliance controls and processes. 
Implementation of internal control 
systems are the responsibility of the 
executive team, with the support of 
the GARB, the internal audit team and 
the ﬁnancial control team, although 
the head of audit and risk and his team 
are directly accountable to the audit 
committee. 
Conﬁrmation that the controls 
and processes are being adhered 
to throughout the business is the 
responsibility of managers, but is 
continually tested by the work of the 
internal audit team as part of its annual 
plan of work which the committee 
approves each year. Compliance 
with the internal control system is 
tested annually by the completion of 
a self-assessment checklist by senior 
managers in consultation with their 
teams. The results are then reviewed 
and audited by the internal audit team 
and reported to the committee.

shareholders and is kept fully informed 
about information in the market place 
including:
• Makinson Cowell produce an annual 
survey of shareholders, the results of 
which are presented and discussed 
by the board;
• the board receives regular updates 
and feedback on activities within 
investor relations and reports from 
sector analysts to ensure that the 
board maintains an understanding of 
investors’ priorities; and
• the board welcomes engagement 
with institutional investors - both 
executive and non-executive 
directors are available to meet with 
major shareholders, this is also one 
of the speciﬁc roles of the senior 
independent director.
Institutional investors
We are always keen to hear the views 
of and engage with our shareholders 
and investors. We have an active 
investor relations programme, the 
activities include:
• the CEO and CFO have a regular 
programme of meetings with 
representatives from major 
shareholders and met with around 
100 institutions over the course of 
the year. This is supplemented with 
meetings hosted by our investor 
relations team. The programme 
covers institutions based in the UK, 
Europe, North America and Asia/
Paciﬁc region;
• the CEO and CFO undertake 
presentations to groups of 
institutional shareholders and 
investors, both on an ad hoc basis 
and linked to our half and full-year 
results announcements;
• the board receives regular feedback 
on the views of its institutional 
investors following on from the CEO 
and CFO’s meetings;
• close contact is also maintained 
between the investor relations team 
and a range of City analysts that 
research United Utilities; and
• in total, we met or offered to 
meet with 43 per cent by value 
of the overall shareholder base, 
which represents 79 per cent 
of the targetable institutional 
shareholder base (when adjusting for 
shareholders who do not typically 
meet with companies, such as 
indexed funds).
In meetings with investors, frequent 
areas of common interest include 
operational and environmental 
performance, customer service, capital 
investment, efﬁciency initiatives and 
regulatory outperformance. Investors 
are always keen to observe ﬁnancial 
stability, and investors are interested 
in the level of gearing versus regulatory 
assumptions, cost of ﬁnance, debt 
portfolio and maturity proﬁle, future 
ﬁnancing requirements and dividends. 
The price review process and 
submission of our regulatory business 
plan is a key area of interest for them.
Retail shareholders
Despite the privatisation process being 
around 25 years ago, we have retained 
a large number of shareholders with 
registered addresses in the North West 
of England - in fact over 59 per cent. 
We have historically always held our 
AGM in Manchester, which enables our 
more local shareholders to attend the 
meeting. These shareholders are also 
our customers.
There is a considerable amount 
of information on our website; we 
produce an online report which 
provides information on our key 
social and environmental impacts and 
performance during the year. Together 
with the annual and half yearly results 
announcements, our annual report and 
interim management statements, all 
of which are available on our website 
for shareholders to access, these 
are the principal ways in which we 
communicate with our shareholders. 
Our secretariat and investor relations 
teams, along with our registrar, 
Equiniti, are also on hand to help our 
retail shareholders with any queries 
they may have.
Relations with other providers  
of capital
Running a water and wastewater 
business, by its very nature, requires 
a long-term outlook. Our regulatory 
cycle is based on ﬁve-year periods, 
and we raise associated funding in 
order to build and improve our water 
and wastewater treatment works 
and associated network of pipes for 
each ﬁve-year cycle. We are, as a 
group, heavily reliant on successfully 
acquiring long-term funding from 
banks and debt capital markets to fund 
the improvements we need to fund our 
capital investment programme.

Running a water and 
wastewater business, 
by its very nature, 
requires a long-term 
outlook
This requires a long-term commitment 
and involvement from our credit 
investors who lend us the funds with 
the company paying them a return for 
doing so. We arrange term debt ﬁnance 
in the bond markets (with maturities 
typically ranging from seven years to 
up to 50 years at issue). Debt ﬁnance 
is raised via the group’s London listed 
multi-issuer Euro Medium Term Note 
Programme, which gives us access 
to the sterling and euro public bond 
markets. Committed credit facilities 
are also arranged with various 
relationship banks on a bilateral 
basis. Additionally, the European 
Investment Bank (EIB), which is the 
ﬁnancing arm of the European Union, 
is our single biggest lender, currently 
providing circa £1.5 billion of term 
funding (of which circa £1.1million 
has been advanced and £400 million 
remains available to draw down) used 
to support our capital investment 
programme. The group currently has 
gross borrowings of £6,069.3 million. 
Given the importance of debt funding 
to our group, we have an active credit 
investor programme co-ordinated 
by our group treasury team, who 
provide a ﬁrst point of contact for 
credit investors’ queries. One-to-one 
meetings are held with credit investors 
through a programme aimed at the 
major European fund managers known 
to invest in corporate bonds, that 
may be existing holders of the group’s 
debt or be potential holders. Regular 
mailings of company information are 
sent in order to keep credit investors 
informed of signiﬁcant events. The 
treasury team has regular dialogue 
with the group’s relationship banks and 
the EIB.
Code principle: Remuneration
Addressing the new remuneration 
policy requirements has been a key 
topic for our remuneration committee 
during the year. The board’s intention is 
to ensure that our remuneration policy 
reﬂects our shareholders’ expectations 
and current market practice in order 
that we can attract, motivate and 
retain the right individuals with 
the right skills and experience to 
contribute to, and ensure, our strategic 
objectives are implemented efﬁciently 
and effectively.
Sara Weller’s report as chair of the 
committee can be found on pages 
78-98.
Outcome of the remuneration 
committee evaluation
The responses reported that the 
committee was working efﬁciently 
with a well-structured work 
programme, and good support from the 
HR reward team and external advisors. 
The committee demonstrated close 
regard to the views of shareholders 
and investors. The new reporting 
requirements had been addressed.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report on the work 
of the corporate responsibility 
committee (CRC) over the past 12 
months. 
To see how we are performing 
as a responsible business, we 
measure ourselves against national 
and international benchmarks, 
independently and externally 
assessed. This year we retained 
world class status in the Dow Jones 
Sustainability index for the 6th 
consecutive year and for the last 
ﬁve years have achieved the highest 
‘platinum big tick’ ranking in Business 
in the Community’s Corporate 
Responsibility index.
One of the challenges is how we 
continue to deliver stretching 
business objectives in a responsible 
way over the next ﬁve years and 
beyond, recognising that the external 
political, regulatory, physical and 
social environment in which we 
operate is constantly evolving. 
In considering this, the CRC has 
recommended and the board has 
endorsed re-balancing our approach 
to responsible business to focus on: 
• effective implementation of 
UU’s ﬁve Business Principles 
commitments, using a set of 
performance scorecards to highlight 
achievements and identify risks and 
mitigating actions relating to both 
performance and reputation;
• scrutiny of the impact of our 
investment programme viewed 
through the corporate responsibility 
lens; and 
• how responsible activities best 
support the reputation of the 
company.
We are also considering how 
techniques such as social impact 
assessment can help measure the 
return on investment from community 
projects. These techniques can help 
us set consistent criteria for choosing 
future projects to support.
As we look to the next ﬁve-year 
investment period, the CRC will seek 
to ensure the Business Principles 
are aligned with the business plan 
outcomes customers expect to see.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Main duties of the CRC
The board approved a revised set of 
terms of reference for the CRC in April 
2014, with the main duties to: 
• consider and recommend to 
the board the broad corporate 
responsibility (CR) policy taking into 
account the company’s desired CR 
positioning;
• keep under review the group’s 
approach to CR and ensure it is in 
alignment with the group strategy;
• review CR issues and objectives 
material to the group’s stakeholders 
and identify and monitor the extent 
to which they are reﬂected in group 
strategies, plans and policies;
• monitor and review compliance with 
the board’s CR policy and scrutinise 
the effectiveness of the delivery of 
the CR policy requirements;
• develop and recommend to the board 
CR targets and key performance 
indicators and receive and review 
reports on progress towards the 
achievement of such targets and 
indicators;
• review all approved speciﬁc giving 
where the aggregate ﬁnancial 
contribution exceeds £100,000 over 
the period of the proposed funding 
and to review all community giving 
expenditure annually;
• review the proﬁle of the charitable 
donations directed by the United 
Utilities Trust Fund; and
• agree and approve the annual CR 
report.
  
What has been on the committee’s 
agenda during the year
In carrying out its duties, in the past 
twelve months the CRC has paid 
particular attention to the following:
• governance – the CRC recommended 
changes to its terms of reference, 
subsequently approved by the board, 
and the ﬂow of information between 
the CRC and the CR panel, the 
leadership body for CR on behalf of 
UU’s executive, was improved.
• measuring CR performance – the 
CRC endorsed a set of measures 
and targets that will evidence the 
progress the group is making in 
meeting its responsible business 
commitments, as set out in its 
Business Principles.
• Speciﬁc topics including:
 – PR14 – the CRC examined the 
price review process through 
a responsibility lens, seeking 
reassurance that responsible 
business themes were woven into 
the group’s ﬁve-year business 
plan;
 – affordability – with around 
half of the most socially and 
economically deprived areas of 
England in the North West, the 
CRC examined the positive impact 
the group’s charitable Trust Fund 
and support for debt advice 
services have on customers 
struggling to pay their water bills; 
and
 – bathing water quality – more 
stringent EU bathing water 
standards from 2015 are likely to 
result in an increase in the number 
of North West beaches failing to 
comply. The CRC reviewed plans 
to bring key stakeholder together 
to tackle this complex issue. 
• Speciﬁc trends in CR, including:
 – trends in corporate reporting – 
the CRC debated the merits of 
bringing together the annual and 
CR reports into a single document, 
in response to an emerging trend 
known as integrated reporting;   
 – diversity – the CRC reviewed 
initiatives focused on improving 
the diversity of the group’s 
workforce; and 
 – the relationship between CR, 
communications and reputation. 
Following discussions at the 
CRC, the group has enhanced 
how and what it reports on as 
a responsible business. This is 
especially important at a time 
when public trust in business 
needs to be renewed.
Looking to the next year, as the water 
industry prepares for its next ﬁve-year 
investment programme, the CRC will:
• approve an updated set of Business 
Principles and related measures 
and targets, aligned with the group’s 
2015-2020 business plan;
• review the next iteration of the 
group’s carbon strategy and targets, 
updated for the 2015-2020 period;
• continue to examine how a better 
understanding of the social beneﬁt 
of our programmes can shape which 
community projects we choose to 
support;
• consider the sustainability beneﬁts 
that ﬂagship investment and 
innovation programmes like the new 
Wholesale Operating Model will 
bring; 
• examine the group’s approach to 
sustainable supply chain and the 
beneﬁts that can be achieved; and
• continue its focus on the interaction 
between CR, communications and 
reputation.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Sara Weller
Chair of the remuneration committee
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
the year ended 31 March 2014, which 
includes my statement, the directors’ 
remuneration policy which is intended 
to take effect from the date of our 
2014 AGM (subject to shareholder 
approval), and the annual report on 
remuneration for the year ended  
31 March 2014.
As outlined in last year’s report, during 
2012/13 the committee undertook 
an extensive review of executive 
incentives and consulted widely 
with shareholders on the changes 
introduced. We were encouraged that 
our remuneration report and new Long 
Term Plan received strong support 
from shareholders at the 2013 AGM.  
Remuneration for the year ended  
31 March 2014 reﬂects strong 
business performance
We remain committed to ensuring 
that executive pay is aligned to the 
company’s strategy of delivering long-
term shareholder value by providing 
the best service to customers, at 
the lowest sustainable cost and in a 
responsible manner. As a committee 
we seek to achieve this by strongly 
linking pay with performance, at both 
an individual and a company level.
As you will have seen throughout the 
annual report, the company has had 
a very successful year. The strong 
ﬁnancial and operational performance, 
and particularly the successful 
delivery of our capital programme 
and achievement of key sustainability 
targets (including achieving ‘World 
Class’ status in the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index), has resulted in 
annual bonus payments of around 78 
per cent of maximum for the executive 
directors. As the same bonus measures 
are used throughout the company, 
employees at all levels have also 
beneﬁted from this success, receiving 
bonuses totalling £16 million for the 
2013/14 year. 
In March 2014 the company’s share 
price reached a 15-year high, and, 
together with the dividend policy to 
grow dividends each year by RPI plus 
two per cent, this resulted in a Total 
Shareholder Return over the preceding 
three years of around 50 per cent. 
The company also delivered excellent 
results against its operational and 
capital expenditure targets over 
the same period. These measures 
together form the basis of the long-
term incentive plan awards that were 
granted in 2011 and were measured 
over the three years ending 31 March 
2014, and as a result 93.5 per cent of 
the awards vested. 
“Strongly linking pay 
with performance, at 
both an individual and a 
company level. ”
This will be the ﬁrst year in which Steve 
Mogford is eligible for a payout under 
a long-term incentive plan since he 
joined the company as CEO in 2011. 
Committed to shareholder 
engagement
Following the introduction of the new 
regulations on remuneration reporting, 
during the year the committee 
consulted further with shareholders on 
the directors’ remuneration policy. 
Whilst no substantial changes were 
made to executive remuneration in 
2013/14 or are expected to be made 
in 2014/15, we continue to welcome 
feedback from shareholders. 
I hope we can continue to receive your 
support on the remuneration-related 
votes at the 2014 AGM.

Strategic report
Financial statements Governance Directors’ remuneration policy
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy for the company and has been prepared 
in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 
2013. The policy in this report will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM on 25 July 2014 and will take 
formal effect from that date, subject to shareholder approval.  It is intended that the policy will formally apply for the three 
years beginning on the date of approval.
The committee considers the remuneration policy annually to ensure that it remains aligned with business strategy and 
is appropriately positioned relative to the market. However, we do not anticipate that the policy will be revised more 
frequently than once every three years.
Overview of remuneration policy
The company’s remuneration arrangements are designed so that the overall level of remuneration (including salary and 
beneﬁts, together with the short and long-term incentive opportunities) is sufﬁcient to attract, retain and motivate 
executives of the quality required to run the company successfully. The company does not pay more than is necessary for 
this purpose. The committee recognises that the company operates in the North West of England in a regulated environment 
and therefore needs to ensure that the structure of executive remuneration reﬂects both the practices of the markets in 
which its executives operate, and stakeholder expectations of how the company should be run.
A signiﬁcant proportion of senior executives’ remuneration is performance related. Senior executives are incentivised 
to achieve stretching results which are delivered with an acceptable level of risk. There is a strong direct link between 
incentives and the company’s strategy and if the strategy is delivered, senior executives will be rewarded through the annual 
bonus and long-term incentives. If it is not delivered, then a signiﬁcant part of their potential remuneration will not be paid.
Future policy table for directors 
Base salary
Purpose and link to strategy: T o attract and retain executives of the experience and quality required to deliver the company’s 
strategy. 
Operation Maximum opportunity
Reviewed annually, effective 1 September.
Significant increases in salary should only take place 
infrequently, for example where there has been a material 
increase in:
• the size of the individual’s role;
• the size of the company (through mergers and  
acquisitions); or
• the pay market for directly comparable companies (for 
example, companies of a similar size and complexity).
On recruitment or promotion to executive director, the 
committee will take into account previous remuneration 
and pay levels for comparable companies when setting 
salary levels. This may lead to salary being set at a lower or 
higher level than for the previous incumbent.
Current salary levels are shown in the annual report on 
remuneration.
Executive directors will normally receive a salary increase 
broadly in line with the increase awarded to the general 
workforce, unless one or more of the conditions outlined under 
‘operation’ is met.
Where the committee has set the salary of a new hire at a 
discount to the market level initially, a series of planned 
increases can be implemented over the following few years to 
bring the salary to the appropriate market position, subject to 
individual performance.
Performance measures

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Notes to the policy table 
Selection of performance measures and targets
Performance measures for the annual bonus are selected annually to align with the company’s key strategic goals for the 
year and reﬂect ﬁnancial, operational and personal objectives. ‘Target’ performance is typically set in line with the business 
plan for the year, following rigorous debate and approval of the plan by the board. Threshold to Stretch targets are then 
set based on a sliding scale on the basis of relevant commercial factors. Only modest rewards are available for delivering 
Threshold performance levels, with rewards at Stretch requiring substantial outperformance of the business plan. Details of 
the measures used for the annual bonus are given in the annual report on remuneration.
The Long Term Plan (LTP) measures were selected by the committee following an extensive review and shareholder 
consultation in 2012/13. The performance measures are aligned with the company’s key strategic goals and linked to the 
creation of long-term shareholder value as follows:
Measure Weighting Why selected
Relative T otal Shareholder 
Return
One-third Direct measure of delivery of shareholder returns, rewarding management for 
outperformance of a comparator group of companies.
Sustainable dividends One-third Direct measure of return to shareholders through dividend payments, whilst 
focusing on the creation of strong earnings that ensure the sustainability of 
dividends.
Customer service excellence One-third It is a key strategic objective to provide the best service to customers. This 
is fundamental to delivering our vision of becoming a leading North West 
service provider and one of the UK’s best water and wastewater companies. 
This measure has a direct financial impact on the company as our regulator 
can apply financial incentives or penalties depending on our customer service 
performance.
L TP targets are set taking into account a number of factors, including reference to market practice, the company business 
plan and analysts’ forecasts where relevant. The LTP will only vest in full if stretching business performance is achieved.
Annual bonus and long-term incentives - flexibility, discretion and judgement
The committee will operate the company’s incentive plans according to their respective rules and consistent with normal 
market practice, the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant, including ﬂexibility in a number of regards. These include 
making awards and setting performance criteria each year, dealing with leavers, and adjustments to awards and performance 
criteria following acquisitions, disposals, changes in share capital and to take account of the impact of other merger and 
acquisition activity.
The committee also retains discretion within the policy to adjust the targets, set different measures and/or alter weightings 
for the annual bonus plan, pay dividend equivalents on vested shares up to the date those shares can ﬁrst reasonably be 
exercised and, in exceptional circumstances, under the rules of the long-term incentive plans to adjust targets to ensure 
that the awards fulﬁll their original purposes (for example, if an external benchmark or measure is no longer available). All 
assessments of performance are ultimately subject to the committee’s judgement.
Any discretion exercised (and the rationale) will be disclosed in the annual remuneration report.
Historic awards
All historic awards that were granted under any current or previous share schemes operated by the company and remain 
outstanding, remain eligible to vest based on their original award terms.
Differences in policy for executive directors compared to other employees
The remuneration approach is consistently applied at levels below the executive directors. Key features include:
• market competitive levels of remuneration, incentives and beneﬁts to attract and retain employees;
• employees at all levels participate in a bonus scheme with the same corporate performance measures as for executive 
directors; and
• all employees have the opportunity to participate in the HMRC approved share incentive plan, ‘ShareBuy’ .
At senior levels, remuneration is increasingly long-term, with an increased emphasis on performance related pay and share 
based remuneration.

Long T erm Plan element vests in full (at 100% of maximum)
Annual bonus includes amounts compulsorily deferred into shares.
Long Term Plan is measured at face value i.e. no assumption for changes in share price or dividends.
Service contracts and letters of appointment
Executive directors’ service contracts are subject to up to one year’s notice period when terminated by the company and at 
least six months’ notice when terminated by the director. A company notice period longer than one year may be provided if 
necessary for recruitment, but reducing to a rolling one-year period after the initial period has expired.
The policy on payments for loss of ofﬁce is set out in the next section.  
The Chairman and other non-executive directors have letters of appointment rather than service contracts. Their 
appointments may be terminated without compensation at any time. All non-executive directors are subject to re-election 
at the AGM. 
Copies of executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are available for 
inspection at the company’s registered ofﬁce during normal hours of business and will be available at the company’s AGM. 
Copies of non-executive directors’ letters of appointment can also be viewed on the company’s website.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Shareholding guidelines
The committee believes that it is important for a signiﬁcant investment to be made by each executive director in the shares 
of the company to provide alignment with shareholder interests. Executive directors are encouraged to build up and retain 
a targeted shareholding of at least 100 per cent of base salary, normally within ﬁve years of appointment. There is an 
expectation that executive directors will continue to build a shareholding throughout their period of employment with the 
company, after the target shareholding is reached.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The remuneration package for a new executive director would be set in accordance with the terms of the company’s 
approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment. 
Buy-out awards
In addition, the committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements (on a one-time basis or ongoing) when 
it considers these to be in the best interests of the company (and therefore shareholders). Any such payments would be 
limited to a reasonable estimate of value of remuneration lost when leaving the former employer and would reﬂect the 
delivery mechanism (i.e. cash and/or share-based), time horizons and whether performance requirements are attached to 
that remuneration. Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment. 
Maximum level of variable pay
The maximum initial level of long-term incentives which may be awarded to a new executive director will be limited to the 
maximum Long Term Plan limit of 200 per cent of salary. Therefore the maximum initial level of overall variable pay that may 
be offered will be 330 per cent of salary (i.e. 130 per cent annual bonus plus 200 per cent Long Term Plan). These limits are 
in addition to the value of any buy-out arrangements which are governed by the policy above.
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to 
pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other previously 
awarded entitlements would continue, and be disclosed in the next annual report on remuneration. 
Base salary and relocation expenses
The committee has the ﬂexibility to set the salary of a new appointment at a discount to the market level initially, with 
a series of planned increases implemented over the following few years to bring the salary to the appropriate market 
position, subject to individual performance in the role. 
For external and internal appointments, the committee may agree that the company will meet certain relocation expenses 
as appropriate. 
Appointment of non-executive directors
For the appointment of a new Chairman or non-executive director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the 
approved remuneration policy in force at that time. Non-executive directors’ fees are set by a separate committee of the 
board; the Chairman’s fees are set by the remuneration committee.
Payment for loss of ofﬁce
The circumstances of the termination (taking into account the individual’s performance) and an individual’s duty and 
opportunity to mitigate losses are taken into account in every case. Our policy is to stop or reduce compensatory 
payments to former executive directors to the extent that they receive remuneration from other employment during the 
compensation period. A robust line on reducing compensation is applied and payments to departing employees may be 
phased in order to mitigate loss. Our policy is shown in the table on the following page.

Payment for loss of ofﬁce continued
Provision Summary terms
Compensation for 
loss of office
• An executive director’s service contract may be terminated without notice and without any 
further payment or compensation, except for sums earned up to the date of termination, on the 
occurrence of certain contractually speciﬁed events such as gross misconduct.
• No termination payment if full notice is worked.
• Otherwise, a payment in respect of the period of notice not worked of basic salary, plus pension 
and car allowance for that period.
• Half of the termination payment will be paid within 14 days of date of termination.
• The other half will be paid in monthly instalments between the 7th and 12th month anniversary 
from date of termination of employment. This will be reduced by the value of any salary, pension 
contribution and car allowance earned in new paid employment in that period.
Treatment of annual 
bonus on termination
• A time pro-rated bonus may be payable for the period of active service, however there is no 
automatic entitlement to payments under the bonus scheme. Any payment is at the discretion of 
the committee and is subject to clawback as detailed in the policy table.
• Performance targets would apply in all circumstances.
Treatment of 
deferred bonus on 
termination
• Determined on the basis of the relevant plan rules. Full details can be found on the company’s 
website.
• Deferred bonuses are subject to both clawback and malus provisions as detailed in the policy 
table.
• The default treatment is that any outstanding awards will vest in full on the normal vesting date 
with no time pro-rating applying.
• On a change of control, awards will generally vest on the date of a change of control, unless the 
committee permits (or requires) awards to roll-over into equivalent shares in the acquirer.
Treatment of 
unvested long-
term incentives on 
termination
• Determined on the basis of the relevant plan rules. Full details can be found on the company’s 
website.
• Normally, any outstanding awards will lapse on date of cessation of employment (if that occurs 
during the performance period).
• However, under the rules of the plans, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, 
disability, mutually agreed retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the committee, 
‘good leaver’ status can be applied. In these circumstances, a participant’s awards vest on a time 
pro-rated basis subject to the satisfaction of relevant performance criteria, with the balance of 
awards lapsing. The committee retains the discretion not to time pro-rate if it is inappropriate 
to do so in particular circumstances. The committee will take into account the individual’s 
performance and the reasons for their departure when determining whether ‘good leaver’ status 
can be applied.
• On a change of control, awards will generally vest on the date of a change of control taking in to 
account the extent to which any performance condition has been satisﬁed at that point. Time 
pro-rating will normally apply unless the committee determines otherwise.
Treatment of 
pensions on 
termination
• On redundancy, an augmentation may apply to active members of a United Utilities deﬁned 
beneﬁt pension scheme in line with the trust deed and rules of the appropriate section.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the company
The committee takes into account the general base salary increase and remuneration arrangements for the wider employee 
population when determining remuneration policy for the executive directors. Although employees are not consulted 
directly on executive remuneration policy, employee engagement surveys are carried out twice a year and regular discussion 
takes place with union representatives on matters of pay and remuneration for employees covered by collective bargaining 
or consultation arrangements.
Statement of consideration of stakeholder views
The committee understands that listening to the views of the company’s key stakeholders plays a vital role in formulating 
and implementing a successful remuneration policy over the long-term.  The committee thus actively seeks the views of 
shareholders and other key stakeholders to inform the development of the remuneration policy, particularly where any 
changes to policy are envisaged.

Notes:
(1) For executive directors taxable beneﬁts include: a car allowance of £14,000; health, life and income protection insurance; travel costs and communication costs.
(2) 50 per cent of bonus was deferred into shares for three years under the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP). Malus and clawback provisions apply - see Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
section.
(3) The performance period for the 2011 Performance Share Plan (PSP) and Matching Share Award Plan (MSAP) awards ended on 31 March 2014. The ﬁnal vesting of those awards was 
93.5 per cent. See the section ‘Additional requirements in respect of the single total ﬁgure table’ below for further information.
(4) The performance period for the 2010 PSP and MSAP awards ended on 31 March 2013 and the awards vested on 21 May 2013. The ﬁnal vesting of those awards was 35.3 per cent. 
Russ Houlden received 19,581 vested shares (including dividend equivalents) and the value of these shares shown in the table above has been calculated using the closing share price 
on date of vesting, which was 787 pence per share. Steve Mogford joined the company in January 2011 and so did not participate in the 2010 PSP and MSAP awards.
(5) Cash allowance of 22 per cent of base salary paid in lieu of pension.
(6) The company offers a one-for-ﬁve match on partnership shares bought by employees under ShareBuy. These matching shares cease to become forfeitable one year after they are 
awarded. The ﬁgures shown in the ShareBuy column are the value of matching shares which vested in the year, valued using the closing share price on the day they vested.
(7) The company recognises that its executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of companies outside the company and exposure to such non-executive duties 
can broaden experience and knowledge, which would be of beneﬁt to the company. Any external appointments are subject to board approval (which would not be given if the proposed 
appointment was with a competing company, would lead to a material conﬂict of interest or could have a detrimental effect on a director’s performance). Steve Mogford is the senior 
independent director of Carillion PLC for which he receives and retains an annual fee of £60,200. Russ Houlden has been appointed as an independent member of the supervisory 
board, and audit committee chairman, of Orange Polska SA for which he receives and retains fees estimated annually at 320,000 Polish Zloty (around £63,000). 
(8) Mark Clare joined the board on 1 November 2013.
(9) Paul Heiden retired from the board on 26 July 2013.

(one-third)
• TSR measured over a three-year performance period
• Relative to the FTSE 100 (excluding Financial Services, Oil & Gas and Mining companies)
• No payment for below median performance
• Threshold vesting (25%) at median performance
• Stretch vesting (100%) at 1.15x median (or greater)
• ‘Straight-line’ vesting between Threshold and Stretch
• For the purpose of calculating TSR, the TSR index is averaged over the three months prior to 
the start and end of the performance period
Sustainable dividends
(one-third)
• Comprises two elements – dividend growth and dividend cover
• For 2013 where the performance period straddles two regulatory periods, dividend cover will 
operate as an underpin, with dividend growth (over the three-year period) providing the payout 
range based on Threshold (25% vesting) to Stretch (100% vesting) targets
• Given the commercial and shareholder sensitivity of forecasting the outcome of the ongoing  
regulatory price review process, the committee strongly believe that disclosing precise 
targets for this measure in advance could be seriously prejudicial to shareholder interests. 
Actual targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published retrospectively so 
shareholders can fully understand the basis for any payouts.
Customer service 
excellence
(one-third)
• Based on Ofwat’s customer service measure (currently the Service Incentive Mechanism)
• Vesting based on ranking position in ﬁnal year compared to the other water and wastewater 
companies (currently 19 companies including United Utilities)
• No payment for below median performance
• Threshold vesting (25%) for median position 
• Intermediate vesting (80%) for upper quartile position  
• Stretch vesting (100%) for upper decile position 
• ‘Straight-line’ vesting between these points
The committee will have the ﬂexibility to make appropriate adjustments to the performance targets in exceptional 
circumstances, to ensure that the award achieves its original purpose.
Any vesting is also subject to the committee being satisﬁed that the company’s performance on these measures is 
consistent with underlying business performance.

Statement of directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited information)
Executive directors are expected to build up and maintain a shareholding in the company of at least 100 per cent base salary 
within ﬁve years of appointment. There is also an expectation that they will continue to build a shareholding throughout 
their period of employment with the company, after the guideline is reached.
Details of beneﬁcial interests in the company’s ordinary shares as at 31 March 2014 held by each of the directors and their 
connected persons are set out in the table below along with progress against the targeted shareholding guideline level. The 
table shows that both Steve Mogford and Russ Houlden have already exceeded the target shareholding.

Greenhouse gas emissions
We measure our emissions over the 
ﬁnancial reporting year against a 
footprint covering the operational 
activities of the water and property 
services businesses in the UK. All 
ﬁgures stated are in line with the latest 
UK Government carbon reporting 
guidance. Our reporting is compliant 
with the international carbon reporting 
standard ISO14064, Part 1 and 
veriﬁed by the Certiﬁed Emissions 
Measurement and Reduction Scheme 
certiﬁcation.
As stated in the performance report on 
page 37 our carbon emissions for the 
year 2013/14 were 449,042 tonnes 
of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO
2
e), 
a reduction of 23 per cent against our 
2005/06 baseline of 586,017 tCO
2
e. 
Our carbon target is a 21 per cent 
reduction by 2015.
Our carbon footprint
The boundary of our carbon footprint 
includes both direct and indirect 
emissions as a result of our operations. 
Direct emissions include emissions 
from our treatment processes, 
company vehicles and burning of fossil 
fuels for heating or incineration of 
sewage sludge. Indirect emissions 
include those from the electricity we 
use to power our treatment plants, 
emissions from travel on company 
business and sludge and treatment 
waste disposal emissions. Our 
emissions account for all of the Kyoto 
Protocol gases – converted to carbon 
dioxide equivalents. There are no 
material omissions.

In 2010 we stated our short-term target to reduce our emissions by 21 per cent by 2015, against our 2005/06 baseline. 
The trend in our overall emissions continues to be downwards even though they have ﬂuctuated over the past few years – as 
they can be affected by weather and operational conditions. Last year our emissions were 23 per cent below our 2005/06 
baseline and our aim is to remain at or above 21 per cent next year.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Dividends
Our directors are recommending a ﬁnal 
dividend of 24.03 pence per ordinary 
share for the year ended 31 March 
2014, which, together with the interim 
dividend of 12.01 pence, gives a total 
dividend for the year of 36.04 pence 
per ordinary share (the interim and 
ﬁnal dividends we paid in respect of 
the 2012/13 ﬁnancial year were 11.44 
pence and 22.88 pence per ordinary 
share respectively). Subject to approval 
by our shareholders at our AGM, our 
ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 1 August 
2014 to shareholders on the register at

Directors
The summary biographical details, 
together with the skills and experience

Reappointment
Our articles of association provide 
that our directors must retire at the 
third annual general meeting following 
their last election or reappointment by 
our shareholders. However, our board, 
being mindful of the recommendation 
contained within the UK Corporate 
Governance Code published in 2012 
that all directors should be subject 
to annual election by shareholders, 
has decided that all of our directors 
will retire at the 2014 AGM and offer 
themselves for election/reappointment, 
as happened at the AGMs in 2011, 2012 
and 2013. Information regarding the 
appointment of our directors is included 
in our corporate governance report on 
pages 62–67. 
Interests
Details of the interests in the 
company’s shares held by our directors 
and persons connected with them are 
set out in our directors’ remuneration 
report on pages 78–98.
Corporate governance statement
Further details of our compliance with 
the code as published by the Financial 
Reporting Council in 2012 are given on 
pages 52–98. Our statement includes a 
description of the main features of our 
internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to the ﬁnancial 
reporting process and forms part of this 
directors’ report. A copy of the code 
published in 2012, as applicable to the 
company for the year ended 31 March 
2014, can be found at the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website

Our corporate governance statement 
also includes the consideration given by 
our directors to the factors relevant to 
the adoption of the going concern basis.
We can conﬁrm that during the 
ﬁnancial year 2013/2014 there have 
been no breaches of our Anti Bribery 
and Competition policies and no 
investigations or enforcement activity 
against us in respect of these matters.

Governance > Corporate governance report > Directors’ Report - other statutory information Share capital
At 31 March 2014, the issued 
share capital of the company 
was £499,819,926 divided into 
681,888,418 ordinary shares of ﬁve 
pence each and 273,956,180 deferred 
shares of 170 pence each. Details of 
our share capital and movements in our 
issued share capital are shown in note 
24 to the ﬁnancial statements on page 
139. The ordinary shares represented 
71.3 per cent and the deferred shares 
represented 28.7 per cent respectively 
of the shares in issue as at 31 March 
2014. 
All our ordinary shares have the same 
rights, including the rights to one vote at 
any of our general meetings, to an equal 
proportion of any dividends we declare 
and pay, and to an equal amount of any 
surplus assets which are distributed in 
the event of a winding-up. 
Our deferred shares convey no right 
to income, no right to vote and no 
appreciable right to participate in 
any surplus capital in the event of a 
winding-up. The rights attaching to our 
shares in the company are provided by 
our articles of association, which may 
be amended or replaced by means of 
a special resolution of the company in 
general meeting. The company renews 
annually its power to issue and buy back 
shares at our AGM and such resolutions 
will be proposed at our 2014 AGM. Our 
directors’ powers are conferred on them 
by UK legislation and by the company’s 
articles. At the AGM of the company 
on 26 July 2013, the directors were 
authorised to issue relevant securities 
up to an aggregate nominal amount 
of £11,364,806 and were empowered 
to allot equity securities for cash on a 
non pre-emptive basis to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £1,704,721.
Voting
Electronic and paper proxy 
appointment and voting instructions 
must be received by our registrars 
(Equiniti) not less than 48 hours before 
a general meeting and when calculating 
this period, the directors can decide 
not to take account of any part of a day 
that is not a working day. 
Transfers
There are no restrictions on the transfer 
of our ordinary shares in the company, 
nor any limitations on the holding of 
our shares in the company, save (i) 
where the company has exercised its 
right to suspend their voting rights or 
to prohibit their transfer following the 
omission of their holder or any person 
interested in them to provide the 
company with information requested 
by it in accordance with Part 22 of the 
Companies Act 2006; or (ii) where their 
holder is precluded from exercising 
voting rights by the Financial Conduct 
Authority’s Listing Rules or the City 
Code on Takeovers and Mergers. 
There are no agreements known to us 
between holders of securities that may 
result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or on voting rights. All our 
issued shares are fully paid.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Change of control
As at 31 March 2014, Equiniti Trust 
(Jersey) Limited was the trustee that 
administered our executive share plans 
and had the ability to exercise voting 
rights at its discretion which related to 
shares that it held under the trust deed 
constituting the trust. In the event of 
a takeover offer which could lead to 
a change of control of the company, 
the trustee must consult with the 
company before accepting the offer or 
voting in favour of the offer. Subject 
to that requirement, the trustee may 
take into account a prescribed list of 
interests and considerations prior to 
making a decision in relation to the 
offer, including the interests of the 
beneﬁciaries under the trust. 
In the event of a change of control, the 
participants in our share incentive plan 
(ShareBuy) would be able to direct the 
trustee of the share incentive plan, 
Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited, 
how to act on their behalf.
Directors’ indemnities  
and insurance
We have in place contractual 
entitlements for the directors of the 
company and of its subsidiaries to 
claim indemniﬁcation by the company 
in respect of certain liabilities which 
might be incurred by them in the 
course of their duties as directors. 
These arrangements, which constitute 
qualifying third party indemnity 
provision and qualifying pension 
scheme indemnity provision, have been 
established in compliance with the 
relevant provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006. They include provision for 
the company to fund the costs incurred 
by directors in defending certain 
claims against them in relation to their 
duties as directors of the company 
or its subsidiaries. The company 
also maintains an appropriate level 
of directors’ and ofﬁcers’ liability 
insurance.
Political donations
We do not support any political party 
and do not make what are commonly 
regarded as donations to any political 
party or other political organisations. 
However, the wide deﬁnition of 
donations in the Political Parties, 
Elections and Referendums Act 2000 
covers activities which form part of the 
necessary relationship between the 
group and our political stakeholders. 
This includes promoting United 
Utilities’ activities at the main political 
parties’ annual conferences, and 
occasional stakeholder engagement in 
Westminster.
The period 2013/14 saw us engage 
with our stakeholders along a number 
of policy themes as the Water Bill 
made its way through Parliament and 
Market Reform planning continued. 
The group incurred expenditure of 
£12,235 (2013: £16,211) as part of 
this process. At the 2013 AGM, an 
authority was taken to cover such 
expenditure. A similar resolution will 
be put to our shareholders at the 2014 
AGM to authorise the company and its 
subsidiaries to make such expenditure.
Employees
Our policies on employee consultation 
and on equal opportunities for our 
disabled employees can be found in 
the ‘Our approach to doing business’ 
section on page 18. The company’s 
business principles make clear how it 
and all our employees must seek to act 
with integrity and fairness and observe 
legal requirements. Anyone with 
serious concerns that the company 
may not be adhering to these principles 
is encouraged to speak up via their 
line manager or through a conﬁdential 
telephone line. 
Importance is placed on strengthening 
employees’ engagement, measuring 
their views annually, then by taking 
action to improve how they feel about 
the company and understand its 
direction. 
For further information on our average 
number of employees during the year, 
go to page 122.
Environmental, social and 
community matters
Details of our approach to corporate 
responsibility, relating to the 
environment and social and community 
issues, can be found in the ‘Our 
approach to doing business’ section  
on page 18.
Essential contractual relationships
Certain suppliers we use contribute 
key goods or services, the loss of which 
could cause disruption to our services. 
However, none are so vital that their 
loss would affect our viability as a 
group as a whole nor are we overly 
dependent on any one individual 
customer.
Approach to technology 
development
We are committed to using innovative, 
cost-effective and practical solutions 
for providing high quality services 
and we recognise the importance of 
ensuring that we focus properly our 
investment in the development of 
technology and that we have the right 
skills to apply technology to achieve 
sustainable competitive advantage 
and also that we continue to be alert to 
emerging technological opportunities.

Property, plant and equipment
The group holds signiﬁcant land assets; 
however, the vast majority of these 
are water catchment assets which are 
an integral and essential part of the 
operation of the group’s regulated 
business. The nature of these assets, 
which are primarily moorland areas 
and which could not be sold by the

to obtain meaningful market values 
for the land. Other land owned by the

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the annual report and the ﬁnancial statements
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
group and parent company ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations.
Company law requires the directors 
to prepare group and parent company 
ﬁnancial statements for each 
ﬁnancial year. Under that law they 
are required to prepare the group 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU) and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the 
parent company ﬁnancial statements 
on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must 
not approve the ﬁnancial statements 
unless they are satisﬁed that they 
give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the group and parent 
company and of their proﬁt or loss for 
that period. In preparing each of the 
group and parent company ﬁnancial 
statements, the directors are required 
to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU; and
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
group and the parent company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufﬁcient to show and explain 
the parent company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the ﬁnancial position of the 
parent company and enable them to 
ensure that its ﬁnancial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets 
of the group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the directors are also responsible for 
preparing a strategic report, directors’ 
report, directors’ remuneration report 
and corporate governance statement 
that complies with that law and those 
regulations.
The directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and ﬁnancial information 
included on the company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
ﬁnancial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the 
directors in respect of the annual 
ﬁnancial report
We conﬁrm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
• the ﬁnancial statements, prepared 
in accordance with the applicable set 
of accounting standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss 
of the company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; 
• the Strategic Report (contained on 
pages 2 to 51) includes a fair review 
of the development and performance 
of the business and the position 
of the issuer and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face; and
• the directors consider the annual 
report and accounts, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides 
the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the 
company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements is unmodiﬁed
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of United Utilities Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2014 set out on pages 
112 to 160. In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 March 2014 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the ﬁnancial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest 
effect on our audit were as follows: 
Capitalisation of costs relating to the capital programme (£695.4 million)
Refer to page 71 Audit committee report, page 119 accounting policy and notes11 ﬁnancial disclosures.
The risk Our response
The group has a substantial capital programme which has 
been agreed with the regulator (‘Ofwat’) and therefore incurs 
signiﬁcant expenditure in relation to the development and 
maintenance of both infrastructure and non-infrastructure 
assets. Expenditure in relation to increasing the capacity 
or enhancing the network is treated as capital expenditure.  
Expenditure incurred in maintaining the operating capability 
of the network is expensed in the year in which it is incurred. 
Capital projects often contain a combination of enhancement 
and maintenance activity which are not distinct and therefore 
the allocation of costs between capital and operating 
expenditure is inherently judgemental. Within the costs of 
the capital programme is an allocation of overhead relating 
to the proportion of time that the group’s support functions 
spend which relates directly to the capital programme. This 
allocation is also inherently judgemental. For these reasons 
there is a risk that capital and operating expenditure may be 
signiﬁcantly misstated and so the group’s capital programme 
is an area of focus for our work.
In this area our principal audit procedures included, 
but were not limited to, the following: we assessed the 
group’s capitalisation policy to assess compliance with 
relevant accounting standards; we tested controls over 
the application of the policy to spend incurred on projects 
within the capital programme in the period including 
attending capital approval meetings to observe the 
judgements made; for a sample of capital projects we 
assessed the appropriate application of the capitalisation 
policy to actual spend incurred; we assessed, also for a 
sample of projects, variances in actual expenditure to 
budgeted capital and operating expenditure and where 
signiﬁcant variances were identiﬁed we tested whether 
the proportionate allocation of costs between capital and 
operating expenditure was revised; we agreed overhead 
costs incurred to supporting documentation on a sample 
basis and performed comparative analysis of overheads 
absorbed into capital projects by category to assess 
consistency with the policy and absorption in previous 
years; we tested a sample of capital accruals to verify the 
existence and accuracy of the costs being capitalised. We 
also assessed the adequacy of the group’s disclosures of its 
capitalisation policy and other related disclosures.
108
United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Revenue recognition (£1,704.5 million) and provision for customer debts (£97.9 million)
Refer to page 71 Audit committee report, page 119 accounting policy, and note 16 ﬁnancial disclosures.
The risk Our response
Revenue recognition is one of the key judgemental areas for 
the audit, particularly in relation to:
• the estimate of the revenue value of water supplied to 
metered customers between the last meter reading and the 
period end; 
• supplies to properties where there is little prospect of 
revenue being realised through the occupier not being able 
to be identified or due to a past history of non-payment of 
bills relating to that property.
A proportion of the group’s customers do not or cannot pay 
their bills which results in the need for provisions to be made 
for non-payment of the customer balance. Due to the level of 
judgement and the complexity of the calculation which could 
lead to revenue being overstated, this is considered a key 
audit risk.
In this area our principal audit procedures included, but 
were not limited to, the following: we assessed whether 
appropriate revenue recognition policies are applied 
through comparison with relevant accounting standards and 
industry practice, including the policy of not recognising 
revenue where there is little prospect of revenue being 
realised; we tested the group’s controls over revenue 
recognition including reconciliations between sales 
and cash receipts systems and the general ledger; we 
recalculated the metered accrued income calculation with 
the support of our own modelling specialists; we assessed 
the appropriateness of the customer debt provisioning 
policy based on historical cash collections, credits, re-bills 
and write-off information which we veriﬁed through testing 
the data in the billing system and analysed by comparing 
the data to that which we collect independently across the 
industry; we compared the policy to the customer debt 
provision calculation to assess the extent to which historical 
trends are taken into account and applied; we remodelled 
the customer debt provision calculation to verify the 
mathematical accuracy with the support of our own 
modelling specialists. We also assessed the adequacy of 
the group’s disclosures of its revenue recognition, customer 
debt provisioning policy, disclosures in relation to the 
estimation uncertainty involved in calculating the provision 
and other related disclosures.
Retirement beneﬁt obligations (£177.4 million)
Refer to page 72 Audit committee report], page 119 accounting policy and notes 19 and A2 ﬁnancial disclosures.
The risk Our response
Signiﬁcant estimates are made in valuing the group’s 
retirement beneﬁt obligations. Small changes in assumptions 
and estimates used to value the group’s net pension deﬁcit 
would have a signiﬁcant effect on the group’s ﬁnancial 
position. 
Our principal audit procedures included, but were not 
limited to, the following: we tested the controls over 
the maintenance of the schemes’ membership data; we 
challenged the key assumptions supporting the group’s 
retirement beneﬁt obligations valuation  with input from 
our own actuarial specialists comparing the discount 
rate, inﬂation rate, salary, pension increase rates and life 
expectancy assumptions used against externally derived 
data; we obtained custodian asset valuation reports and 
reperformed the valuations using externally available data 
with input from our own valuation specialists; we veriﬁed 
contributions paid to the scheme; we veriﬁed changes in 
active members; we veriﬁed beneﬁts paid to pensioners. 
We also assessed the group’s disclosure in respect of the 
sensitivity of the deﬁcit to changes in the key assumptions.

Refer to page 72 Audit committee report, page 119 accounting policy, and note A1 ﬁnancial disclosures. 
The risk Our response
The group has signiﬁcant derivative ﬁnancial instruments, 
the valuation of which is determined through the application 
of valuation techniques which often involve the exercise of 
judgement and the use of assumptions and estimates. Due 
to the signiﬁcance of ﬁnancial instruments and the related 
estimation uncertainty, this is considered a key audit risk.
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to, the 
following: we assessed controls over the identiﬁcation, 
measurement and management of derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments and assessed the methodologies, inputs and 
assumptions used by the group in determining fair values; 
we compared observable inputs into valuation models 
such as quoted prices to externally available market data 
and we recalculated valuations utilising our own valuation 
specialists. Additionally, we assessed whether the ﬁnancial 
statement disclosures of fair value risks and sensitivities 
appropriately reﬂect the group’s exposure to valuation risk.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
In establishing the overall audit strategy and performing the audit, materiality for the group ﬁnancial statements as a whole 
was set at £25.0 million. This has been determined with reference to a benchmark of group proﬁt before taxation and net 
fair value gains and losses on debt and derivative instruments (of which it represents 6.0 per cent).
We agreed with the Audit committee to report to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identiﬁed through our 
audit with a value in excess of £0.5 million, in addition to other audit misstatements below that threshold that we believe 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Audits for group reporting purposes were performed at the key reporting components based at the group’s head ofﬁce 
in the UK. These entities covered 99 per cent of group revenues, 99 per cent of group proﬁt before tax and 98 per cent of 
group total assets
4. Our opinion on the other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodiﬁed
In our opinion:  
• the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006;  
• the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and  
• information given in the Corporate governance statement set out on pages 54–98 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent with the 
financial statements. 
5. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have identiﬁed other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or 
the ﬁnancial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if:  
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business 
model and strategy.

Financial statements
Strategic report
Financial statements Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation 
of these ﬁnancial statements are set out below.
Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union (EU), including International 
Accounting Standards (IAS) and Interpretations issued 
by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC).
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of ﬁnancial 
instruments, accounting for the transfer of assets from 
customers and the revaluation of infrastructure assets to 
fair value on transition to IFRS.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements, in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) 
under IFRS, requires management to make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and 
liabilities at the date of the ﬁnancial statements and the 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
periods presented. Although these estimates are based 
on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or 
actions, actual results ultimately may differ from these 
estimates.
The adoption of the following standards and 
interpretations, at 1 April 2013, has had no material impact 
on the group’s ﬁnancial statements. Had the standards not 
been applied in the current year, basic earnings per share 
from continuing and discontinued operations would have 
been 108.7p (2013: 43.5p) and diluted earnings per share 
from continuing and discontinued operations would have 
been 108.5p (2013: 43.5p).
IAS 19 (Revised) ‘Employee Beneﬁts’
The impact of the changes in this standard is to replace 
interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net 
interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount 
rate to the net deﬁned beneﬁt (obligations)/surplus. 
In addition, the standard clariﬁes that administration 
costs relating to the administration of beneﬁts should be 
recognised as an employee beneﬁts expense through the 
income statement, rather than as a deduction from the 
return on plan assets which was previously recognised 
through other comprehensive income. The application 
of the standard is retrospective and, hence, requires the 
restatement of the year ended 31 March 2013.
The impact in the year ended 31 March 2014 has been an 
increase in employee beneﬁt expense of £2.2 million 
(2013: £2.9 million), a decrease in ﬁnance expense 
of £nil (2013: £10.0 million) and an offsetting gain 
to remeasurement gains and losses within other 
comprehensive income of £2.2 million (2013: £7.1 million 
loss). These amendments have had no overall impact on the 
retirement beneﬁt (obligations)/surplus in the statement of 
ﬁnancial position. 
The impact on taxation in the year ended 31 March 2014 
has been a deferred taxation credit of £0.4 million 
(2013: £1.6 million charge) and an offsetting charge to 
other comprehensive income of £0.4 million (2013: £1.6 
million credit).
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’
The standard provides guidance on the measurement of 
fair value where required by existing accounting standards. 
The application of the standard is prospective and, hence, 
impacts the year ended 31 March 2014 only. The impact 
in the year ended 31 March 2014 has been a £0.3 million 
credit to ﬁnance expense and a corresponding reduction in 
derivative liabilities, due to the inclusion of the group’s own 
credit risk in measuring the fair value of its liabilities.
Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of items of Other 
Comprehensive Income’
The impact of the amendments is that items, which may be 
reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss in the future, are presented 
separately in the statement of other comprehensive income 
from those that would never be reclassiﬁed to proﬁt 
and loss.
Improvements to IFRS (2011)
This is a collection of amendments to ﬁve standards as part 
of the International Accounting Standards Board’s (IASB) 
programme of annual improvements. The improvements 
were issued May 2012 and are effective for periods 
commencing on or after 1 January 2013.
Going concern
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the going 
concern basis. The directors have set out factors considered 
in concluding the appropriateness of this presentation in 
the corporate governance report on page 67.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying its accounting policies, the group 
is required to make certain estimates, judgements and 
assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the 
information available. These judgements, estimates and 
assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the ﬁnancial statements and the amounts 
of revenues and expenses recognised during the reporting 
periods presented.
On an ongoing basis, the group evaluates its estimates 
using historical experience, consultation with experts and 
other methods considered reasonable in the particular 
circumstances. Actual results may differ signiﬁcantly 
from the estimates, the effect of which is recognised in 
the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision 
become known.
118
United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 The following paragraphs detail the estimates and 
judgements the group believes to have the most signiﬁcant 
impact on the annual results under IFRS.
Property, plant and equipment
The group recognises property, plant and equipment (PPE) 
on its water and wastewater infrastructure assets where 
such expenditure enhances or increases the capacity of the 
network, whereas any expenditure classed as maintenance 
is expensed in the period it is incurred. Determining 
enhancement from maintenance expenditure is a subjective 
area, particularly when projects have both elements within 
them. In addition, management charge to PPE in relation 
to the time and resources incurred by the group’s support 
functions on capital programmes.
The estimated useful economic lives of PPE are based 
on management’s judgement and experience. When 
management identiﬁes that actual useful economic lives 
differ materially from the estimates used to calculate 
depreciation, that charge is adjusted prospectively. Due to 
the signiﬁcance of PPE investment to the group, variations 
between actual and estimated useful economic lives could 
impact operating results both positively and negatively, 
although historically few changes to estimated useful 
economic lives have been required.
The group is required to evaluate the carrying values of 
PPE for impairment whenever circumstances indicate, in 
management’s judgement, that the carrying value of such 
assets may not be recoverable. An impairment review 
requires management to make subjective judgements 
concerning the cash ﬂows, growth rates and discount rates 
of the cash generating units under review.
Revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful receivables
The group recognises revenue generally at the time of 
delivery and when collection of the resulting receivable 
is reasonably assured. When the group considers that 
the criteria for revenue recognition are not met for a 
transaction, revenue recognition is delayed until such time 
as collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received 
in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred 
income.
United Utilities Water PLC raises bills in accordance 
with its entitlement to receive revenue in line with the 
limits established by the periodic regulatory price review 
processes. For water and wastewater customers with water 
meters, the receivable billed is dependent on the volume 
supplied including the sales value of an estimate of the 
units supplied between the date of the last meter reading 
and the billing date. Meters are read on a cyclical basis 
and the group recognises revenue for unbilled amounts 
based on estimated usage from the last billing through 
to each reporting date. The estimated usage is based on 
historical data, judgement and assumptions; actual results 
could differ from these estimates, which would result in 
operating revenues being adjusted in the period that the 
revision to the estimates is determined. For customers 
who do not have a meter, the receivable billed is dependent 
on the rateable value of the property, as assessed by an 
independent rating ofﬁcer.
At each reporting date, the company and each of its 
subsidiaries evaluate the recoverability of trade receivables 
and record allowances for doubtful receivables based on 
experience. These allowances are based on, amongst other 
things, a consideration of actual collection history. The 
actual level of receivables collected may differ from the 
estimated levels of recovery, which could impact operating 
results positively or negatively.
Provisions and contingencies
The group is subject to a number of claims incidental to the 
normal conduct of its business, relating to and including 
commercial, contractual and employment matters, which are 
handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. 
The group routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse 
judgements or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges 
of probable and reasonably estimated losses. 
Reasonable estimates involve judgements made by 
management after considering information including 
notiﬁcations, settlements, estimates performed by 
independent parties and legal counsel, available facts, 
identiﬁcation of other potentially responsible parties and 
their ability to contribute, and prior experience. A provision 
is recognised when it is probable that an obligation exists 
for which a reliable estimate can be made after careful 
analysis of the individual matter. The required provision 
may change in the future due to new developments and 
as additional information becomes available. Matters 
that either are possible obligations or do not meet the 
recognition criteria for a provision are disclosed as 
contingent liabilities in note 27, unless the possibility of 
transferring economic beneﬁts is remote.
Retirement beneﬁts
The group operates two deﬁned beneﬁt schemes which are 
independent of the group’s ﬁnances. Actuarial valuations of 
the schemes are carried out as determined by the trustees 
at intervals of not more than three years. The pension 
cost under IAS 19 ‘Employee Beneﬁts’ is assessed in 
accordance with the advice of a ﬁrm of actuaries based on 
the latest actuarial valuation and assumptions determined 
by the actuary. The assumptions are based on information 
supplied to the actuary by the company, supplemented 
by discussions between the actuary and management. 
The assumptions are disclosed in note A2. Proﬁt before 
taxation and net assets are affected by the actuarial 
assumptions used. The key assumptions include, discount 
rates, pay growth, mortality and increases to pensions in 
payment and deferred pensions and may differ from actual 
results due to changing market and economic conditions 
and longer or shorter lives of participants.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The model used to fair value the group’s derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments requires management to estimate future cash 
ﬂows based on applicable interest rate curves. Projected 
cash ﬂows are then discounted back using discount factors 
which are derived from the applicable interest rate curves 
adjusted for management’s estimate of counterparty and 
own credit risk, where appropriate.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements
International Financial Reporting Standards
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements, 
the following relevant standards and interpretations were 
in issue but not yet effective. All of the standards in issue 
but not yet effective have been endorsed by the EU except 
where noted. The directors anticipate that the group 
will adopt these standards and interpretations on their 
effective dates.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of the following 
standards and interpretations may have a material impact 
on the group’s ﬁnancial statements:
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ is effective for periods 
commencing on or after 1 January 2018 but will not be 
considered for endorsement by the EU until the remaining 
elements of the project have been completed. Under the 
provisions of this standard, where the group has chosen 
to measure borrowings at fair value through profit or loss, 
the portion of the change in fair value due to changes in 
the group’s own credit risk will be recognised in other 
comprehensive income rather than within profit or loss. 
If this standard had been adopted in the current year, 
£11.1 million of losses would have been recognised 
in other comprehensive income rather than within the 
income statement. The standard also broadens the scope 
of what can be included within a hedge relationship which 
may have an impact on profit or loss, subject to the extent 
which the group’s regulatory swaps can be designated 
within a cash flow hedge relationship.
• IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ is effective for periods 
commencing on or after 1 January 2014 and replaces 
IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’ . IFRS 11 removes the 
option currently taken by the group to proportionately 
consolidate its joint ventures and requires equity 
accounting. The impact on the income statement and 
statement of financial position for the year ended 
31 March 2014 would be that the group’s interests in its 
joint ventures’ assets, liabilities, income and expenses, as 
summarised in note 14, and the value of goodwill arising 
on acquisition of the joint ventures, as shown in note 12, 
would be presented on an aggregated basis as one line in 
the statement of financial position and income statement. 
There would be no impact on net assets.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of the following 
standards and interpretations will have no material impact 
on the group’s ﬁnancial statements:
• IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ is effective 
for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014 and 
builds on existing principles by identifying the concept 
of control as the determining factor in whether an entity 
should be included within the consolidated accounts of 
the parent company. The standard provides additional 
guidance to assist in the determination of control where 
this is difficult to assess. 
• IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities’ is 
effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 
2014 and includes the disclosure requirements for all 
forms of interest in other entities, including subsidiaries, 
associates, joint arrangements and unconsolidated 
structured entities.
• IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ amendment 
relating to offsetting financial assets and financial 
liabilities is effective for periods commencing on or after 
1 January 2014. This amendment provides clarification on 
the application of the offsetting rules affecting financial 
assets and financial liabilities and will impact the group 
only if it enters into any relevant offsetting transactions 
in the future. 
• IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’ is effective for periods commencing on 
or after 1 January 2014, but has not yet been endorsed 
by the EU. This interpretation clarifies that the obligating 
event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the 
activity described in the relevant legislation that triggers 
the payment of the levy. 
• Improvements to IFRS (2012) and IFRS (2013) is a 
collection of amendments to eleven standards as part 
of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) 
programme of annual improvements. The improvements, 
issued in December 2013, are yet to be endorsed by the 
EU and are effective for periods commencing on or after 
1 July 2014.
All other standards and interpretations, which are in issue 
but not yet effective, are not considered relevant to the 
activities of the group.

to IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’ (2013: £1.8 million) (see note 22).
2 SEGMENT REPORTING
The board of directors of United Utilities Group PLC (the board) is provided with information on a single segment basis for 
the purposes of assessing performance and allocating resources. The board reviews revenue, underlying operating profit 
(see page 44), operating profit, assets and liabilities, regulatory capital expenditure and regulatory capital value (RCV) 
gearing at a consolidated level. In light of this, the group has a single segment for financial reporting purposes and therefore 
no further detailed segmental information is provided in this note.
The group’s revenue predominantly arises from the provision of services within the United Kingdom, with less than one 
per cent of external revenue and non-current assets being overseas.
The group has a large and diverse customer base and there is no significant reliance on any single customer.

at fair value through proﬁt or loss. These gains/losses are largely offset by fair value losses/gains on derivatives.
(2) 
Includes £11.1 million losses (2013: £1.5 million losses) on the valuation of debt reported at fair value through proﬁt or loss due to changes in credit spread assumptions.
(3) Includes fair value movements in relation to other economic hedge derivatives relating to debt held at amortised cost.
(4) Includes £8.1 million income (2013: £8.3 million) due to interest on swaps and debt under fair value option. 
Interest payable for the year ended 31 March 2014 is stated net of £19.4 million (2013: £14.3 million) borrowing costs 
capitalised in the cost of qualifying assets within property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets during the year. 
This has been calculated by applying a capitalisation rate of 3.8 per cent (2013: 4.3 per cent) to expenditure on such assets 
as prescribed by IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’ .

The current taxation charge of £76.7 million for the year ended 31 March 2014 represents a current taxation effective 
rate of 14 per cent compared with 26 per cent for the year ended 31 March 2013. The reduction is principally due to fair 
value movements, which give rise to a corresponding current year deferred taxation charge. In addition, there is a current 
taxation credit of £141.0 million (see page 39–40 for further information), and an associated deferred taxation credit of 
£13.3 million relating to recently agreed matters in relation to prior years.
The deferred taxation credit for the year ended 31 March 2014 includes a credit of £156.8 million to reflect the staged 
reductions in the mainstream rate of corporation tax from 23 per cent in the year ended 31 March 2014 to 20 per cent 
effective from 1 April 2015. A related deferred taxation credit of £0.5 million is included within items taken directly to

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the 
company by 681.9 million, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year (2013: 681.9 million). 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the 
company by 683.2 million, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year including dilutive shares 
(2013:  682.8 million).
The difference between the weighted average number of shares used in the basic and the diluted earnings per share 
calculations represents those ordinary shares deemed to have been issued for no consideration on the conversion of all 
potential dilutive ordinary shares in accordance with IAS 33 ‘Earnings per Share’ .
The weighted average number of shares can be reconciled to the weighted average number of shares including dilutive

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 A1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
Risk management 
The board is responsible for treasury strategy and governance, which is reviewed on an annual basis. The annual treasury 
strategy review covers the group’s funding, liquidity, capital management and interest rate management strategies, along 
with the delegation of specific funding and hedging authorities to the treasury committee.
The treasury committee, a sub-committee of the board, has responsibility for setting and monitoring the group’s adherence 
to treasury policies, along with oversight in relation to the activities of the treasury function.
Treasury policies cover the key financial risks: liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk (inflation, interest rate, electricity price 
and currency) and capital risk. These policies are reviewed by the treasury committee for approval on at least an annual 
basis, or following any major changes in treasury operations and/or financial market conditions.
Day-to-day responsibility for operational compliance with the treasury policies rests with the treasurer. An operational 
compliance report is provided monthly to the treasury committee, which details the status of the group’s compliance with 
the treasury policies and highlights the level of risk against the appropriate risk limits in place.
The group’s treasury function does not act as a profit centre and does not undertake any speculative trading activity.
Liquidity risk 
The group looks to manage its liquidity risk by maintaining liquidity within a board approved duration range. Liquidity 
is actively monitored by the group’s treasury function and is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the 
operational compliance report.
At 31 March 2014, the group had £1,027.2 million (2013: £721.7 million) of available liquidity, which comprised 
£127.2 million (2013: £201.7 million) cash and short-term deposits, £500.0 million (2013: £520.0 million) of undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities, and £400.0 million (2013: £nil) of undrawn term loan facility. Short-term deposits mature 
within three months and bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
The group had available committed borrowing facilities as follows:
Group
2014 
£m
2013 
£m
Expiring within one year 50.0 220.0
Expiring after one year but in less than two years 50.0 50.0
Expiring after more than two years 400.0 250.0
Undrawn borrowing facilities 500.0 520.0
At 31 March 2014, the group had additional committed borrowing facilities of £nil (2013: £100.0 million) expiring after 
more than two years, £nil (2013: £50.0 million) available to be drawn from September 2013 and £nil (2013: £50.0 million) 
available to be drawn from January 2014.
These facilities are arranged on a bilateral rather than a syndicated basis, which spreads the maturities more evenly over 
a longer time period, thereby reducing the refinancing risk by providing several renewal points rather than a large single 
refinancing point.
Company
The company did not have any committed facilities available at 31 March 2014 or 31 March 2013.

Notes:
(1) Forecast future cash ﬂows are calculated, where applicable, utilising forward interest rates based on the interest environment at year end and are therefore susceptible to changes in 
market conditions. For index-linked debt it has been assumed that RPI will be 3.00 per cent (2013: 2.65 per cent) over the life of each instrument.
(2) The carrying value of debt is calculated following various methods in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ and therefore this adjustment 
reconciles the undiscounted forecast future cash ﬂows to the carrying value of debt in the statement of ﬁnancial position.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 A1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued
Credit risk 
Credit risk arises principally from trading (the supply of services to customers) and treasury activities (the depositing of 
cash and holding of derivative and foreign exchange instruments). The group does not believe it is exposed to any material 
concentrations of credit risk.
The group manages its risk from trading through the effective management of customer relationships. Concentrations of 
credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the group’s customer base consisting of a large number of 
unrelated households and businesses. The Water Industry Act 1991 (as amended by the Water Industry Act 1999) prohibits 
the disconnection of a water supply and the limiting of supply with the intention of enforcing payment for certain premises 
including domestic dwellings. However, allowance is made by the water regulator in the price limits at each price review for 
a proportion of debt deemed to be irrecoverable. Considering the above, the directors believe there is no further credit risk 
provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables (see note 16).
The group manages its risk from treasury activities by establishing a total credit limit by counterparty, which comprises 
a counterparty credit limit and an additional settlement limit to cover intra-day gross settlement cash flows. In addition, 
potential derivative exposure limits are also established to take account of potential future exposure which may arise under 
derivative transactions. These limits are calculated by reference to a measure of capital and credit ratings of the individual 
counterparties and are subject to a maximum single counterparty limit. A control mechanism to trigger a review of specific 
counterparty limits, irrespective of credit rating action, is in place. This entails daily monitoring of counterparty credit 
default swap levels and/or share price volatility. Credit exposure is monitored daily by the group’s treasury function and is 
reported monthly to the treasury committee through the operational compliance report. 
At 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013, the maximum exposure to credit risk for the group and company is represented by 
the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position:
Group Company

Investments (see note 14) 6.9 5.7 – –
Derivative financial instruments 512.9 721.2 – –
983.8 1,257.7 56.3 42.0
The credit exposure on derivatives is disclosed gross of any collateral held. At 31 March 2014, the group held £75.0 million 
(2013: £125.6 million) as collateral in relation to derivative financial instruments (included within borrowings in note 18). 
Market risk 
The group’s exposure to market risk primarily results from its financing arrangements and the economic return which it is 
allowed on the regulatory capital value (RCV). 
The group uses a variety of financial instruments, including derivatives, in order to manage the exposure to these risks.

Financial statements A1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued
Inﬂation risk
The group earns an economic return on its RCV , comprising a real return through revenues and an inflation return as an uplift 
to its RCV. To the extent that nominal debt liabilities finance a proportion of the RCV, there is an asset liability mismatch 
which potentially exposes the group to the risk of economic loss where actual inflation is lower than that implicitly locked in 
through nominal debt. 
The group’s index-linked borrowings, which are linked to RPI inflation, form an economic hedge of the group’s regulatory 
assets, which are also linked to RPI inflation. In particular, index-linked debt delivers a cash flow benefit compared to 
nominal debt, as the inflation adjustment on the index-linked liabilities is a deferred cash flow until the maturity of each 
financial instrument, providing a better match to the inflation adjustment on the regulated assets, which is recognised as a 
non-cash uplift to the RCV .
In addition, the group’s pension obligations also provide an economic hedge of the group’s regulatory assets. The pension 
schemes’ inflation funding mechanism (see note A2) ensures that future contributions will be flexed for movements in RPI 
and smoothed over a rolling five-year period, providing a natural hedge against any inflationary uplift on the RCV.
The group seeks to manage this risk by identifying opportunities to amend the economic hedge currently in place where 
deemed necessary and subject to relative value. Inflation risk is reported monthly to the treasury committee in the 
operational compliance report.
The carrying value of index-linked debt held by the group is as follows:
2014 
£m
2013 
£m
Index-linked debt 2,936.8 2,853.9
Sensitivity analysis
As required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure’ , the sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the 
amount of index-linked debt in place as at 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013 respectively. As a result, this analysis relates 
to the position at the reporting date and is not indicative of the years then ended, as these factors would have varied 
throughout the year. The following table details the sensitivity of profit before taxation to changes in the RPI on the group’s 
index-linked borrowings:
Increase/(decrease) in profit before taxation and equity
2014 
£m
2013 
£m
1 per cent increase in RPI (29.9) (29.1)
1 per cent decrease in RPI 29.9 29.1
This table excludes the hedging aspect of the group’s regulatory assets which, being property, plant and equipment, are not 
financial assets as defined by IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ and are typically held at cost or deemed cost less 
accumulated depreciation on the consolidated statement of financial position. In addition, the table excludes the hedging 
aspect of the group’s pension obligations.
The analysis assumes a one per cent change in RPI having a corresponding one per cent impact on this position over a 
12-month period. It should be noted, however, that there is a time lag by which current RPI changes impact on the income 
statement, and the analysis does not incorporate this factor. The portfolio of index-linked debt is either calculated on 
a three or eight-month lag basis. Therefore, at the reporting date the index-linked interest and principal adjustments 
impacting the income statement are fixed and based on the annual RPI change either three or eight months earlier.
Company
The company had no material exposure to inflation risk at 31 March 2014 or 31 March 2013.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 A1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued
Interest rate risk
The group’s policy is to structure debt in a way that best matches its underlying assets and cash flows. The group earns an 
economic return on its RCV , comprising a real return through revenues, determined by the real cost of capital fixed by the 
regulator for each five-year regulatory pricing period, and an inflation return as an uplift to its RCV .
The preferred form of debt therefore is sterling index-linked debt which incurs fixed interest, in real terms, and forms a 
natural hedge of regulatory assets and cash flows.
Where conventional long-term debt is raised in a fixed-rate form, to manage exposure to long-term interest rates, the debt 
is generally swapped at inception to create a floating rate liability for the term of the liability through the use of interest 
rate swaps. These instruments are typically designated within a fair value accounting hedge.
To manage the exposure to medium-term interest rates, the group fixes underlying interest rates on nominal debt out to 
ten years in advance on a reducing balance basis. This is supplemented by managing residual exposure to interest rates 
within the relevant regulatory price control period by fixing substantively all residual floating underlying interest rates 
on projected nominal debt across the immediately forthcoming regulatory period at around the time of the price control 
determination.
The group seeks to manage its risk by maintaining its interest rate exposure within a board approved range. Interest rate 
risk is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the operational compliance report.
Sensitivity analysis
As required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ , the sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the 
amount of net debt and the interest rate hedge positions in place at the reporting date. As a result, this analysis is not 
indicative of the years then ended, as these factors would have varied throughout the year.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the interest sensitivity analysis:
• fair value hedge relationships are fully effective;
• borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss are effectively hedged by associated swaps;
• the main fair value sensitivity to interest rates in the statement of financial position (excluding the effect of accrued 
interest) is in relation to the fixed interest rate swaps which manage the exposure to medium-term interest rates;
• cash flow sensitivity in the statement of financial position to interest rates is calculated on floating interest rate net debt;
• the sensitivity excludes the impact of interest rates on post-retirement obligations;
• management has assessed one per cent as a reasonably possible movement in UK interest rates; and
• all other factors are held constant.

Electricity price risk
The group is allowed a fixed amount of revenue by the regulator, in real terms, to cover electricity costs for each five-year 
regulatory pricing period. To the extent that electricity prices remain floating over this period, this exposes the group to 
volatility in its operating cash flows. The group’s policy, therefore, is to manage this risk by fixing a proportion of electricity 
prices in a cost-effective manner.
The group has used electricity swap contracts to fix the price of a substantial proportion of its anticipated electricity usage 
out to the end of the AMP in 2015. 
Sensitivity analysis
As required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Dislosures’ , the sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the 
amount of the group’s electricity swaps in place at the reporting date and, as a result, this analysis is not indicative of the 
years then ended, as this factor would have varied throughout the year.

Currency risk
Currency exposure principally arises in respect of funding raised in foreign currencies. 
To manage exposure to currency rates, foreign currency debt is hedged into sterling through the use of cross currency 
swaps and these are typically designated within a fair value accounting hedge. 
The group seeks to manage its risk by maintaining currency exposure within board approved limits. Currency risk in 
relation to foreign currency denominated financial instruments is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the 
operational compliance report.
The group and company have no material net exposure to movements in currency rates.
Capital risk management 
The group’s objective when managing capital is to maintain a capital structure that enables its principal subsidiary, United 
Utilities Water PLC, to retain a credit rating of A3 from Moody’s Investors Services (Moody’s), which the group believes 
best mirrors the Water Services Regulation Authority’s (Ofwat) assumptions in relation to capital structure. The strategy of 
targeting a credit rating of A3 has been consistently maintained since 2007.
One of Ofwat’s primary duties is to ensure that water companies are able to finance their functions, in particular by 
securing a reasonable return on their capital. Therefore, mirroring Ofwat’s assumptions for credit ratings (and hence capital 
structure) should help safeguard the group’s ability to earn a reasonable return on its capital, securing access to finance at 
a reasonable cost and enabling the group to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and 
credit investors, and benefits for other stakeholders.
In order to maintain a credit rating of A3 the group needs to manage its capital structure with reference to the ratings 
methodology and measures used by Moody’s. The ratings methodology is normally based on a number of key ratios (such as 
RCV gearing and adjusted interest cover) and threshold levels as updated and published from time to time by Moody’s.
The group looks to manage its risk by maintaining the relevant key financial ratios used by the credit rating agencies to 
determine a corporate’s credit rating, within the thresholds approved by the board. Capital risk is reported monthly to the 
treasury committee through the operational compliance report.
Further detail on the precise measures and methodologies used to assess water companies’ credit ratings can be found in 
the methodology papers published by the rating agencies.

*   The comparatives have been re-presented using the format required by IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ to ensure consistency with the 2014 table. As IFRS 13 is applied 
prospectively, the numbers included in the 2013 table have not been restated and were included in other sections of the financial instruments note in the 2013 financial statements.
Note:
(1) Derivatives forming an economic hedge of the currency exposure on borrowings included in these balances were £83.2 million (2013: £143.5 million).
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities;
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability 
that are not based on observable market data (unobservable).
The group has adopted IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ for the year ended 31 March 2014 and has applied it prospectively 
in line with the transitional provisions of the standard. For the year ended 31 March 2014, the group has calculated fair 
values using quoted prices where an active market exists, which has resulted in £3,179.0 million of ‘level 1’ fair value 
measurements. In the absence of an appropriate quoted price, the group has applied discounted cash flow valuation models 
utilising market available data in line with prior years.
In respect of the total change during the year in the fair value of financial liabilities designated at fair value through 
profit or loss of a £32.6 million gain (2013: £17.5 million loss), an £11.1 million loss (2013: £1.5 million) is attributable to 
changes in own credit risk. The cumulative amount recognised in the income statement due to changes in credit spread was 
£63.6 million proﬁt (2013: £74.7 million). The carrying amount is £66.6 million (2013: £99.2 million) higher than the amount 
contracted to settle on maturity.
Company
The company does not hold any financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value or 
where fair value has been separately disclosed in the notes as the carrying value is not a reasonable approximation of 
fair value.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 A2 RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
The group participates in two major funded defined benefit pension schemes in the United Kingdom – the United Utilities 
Pension Scheme (UUPS) and the United Utilities PLC Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS), both of which 
are closed to new employees. The assets of these schemes are held in trust funds independent of the group’s finances. 
The trustees are composed of representatives of both the employer and employees. The trustees are required by law to act in 
the interests of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets plus the 
day-to-day administration of the benefits.
The group also operates a series of unfunded, unregistered retirement benefit schemes. The costs of these schemes are 
included in the total pension cost, on a basis consistent with IAS 19 and the assumptions set out below.
Information about the pension arrangements for executive directors is contained in the directors’ remuneration report.
Under the schemes, employees are entitled to annual pensions on retirement. Benefits are also payable on death and following 
other events such as withdrawing from active service. No other post-retirement benefits are provided to these employees.
The latest actuarial valuations of UUPS and ESPS were carried out as at 31 March 2013. The results of these valuations have 
been adjusted to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ in order to assess the position at 31 March 
2014 by projecting forward from the valuation date by the independent actuary, Aon Hewitt Limited.
Funding requirements
The latest funding valuations of the schemes as at 31 March 2013 reported a deficit. The basis on which liabilities are valued 
for funding purposes differs to the basis required under IAS 19. Under UK legislation there is a requirement that pension 
schemes are funded prudently.
The group has a plan in place with the schemes’ trustees to address the funding deficit by 31 December 2020, through a series 
of annual deficit recovery contributions.
The group and trustees have agreed long-term strategies for reducing investment risk in each scheme.
For UUPS this includes an asset liability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the pension 
plan by investing in assets such as fixed income swaps which perform in line with the liabilities so as to hedge against changes 
in swap yields. For ESPS, a partial hedge is in place to protect against changes in swap yields.
In addition, the group has had an Inflation Funding Mechanism (IFM) in place since 2010; details of this are outlined in the 2011 
annual report. In 2013, it extended the mechanism to the ESPS, and increased the fixed percentage rate used to 3.0 per cent 
per annum from 2.75 per cent per annum. T o the extent that inflation, as measured by the RPI index at each 31 March preceding 
the payment due date is different from 3.0 per cent per annum, the inflation reserve will increase/decrease. Additional 
contributions are then payable annually based on the size of the inflation reserve. 
The duration of the combined schemes is around 20 years. The schemes’ duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time 
until benefit payments are settled, taking account of the split of the defined benefit obligation between current employees, 
deferred members and the current pensioners of the schemes.
The group expects to make contributions of £29.3 million in the year ending 31 March 2015, comprising £5.5 million to UUPS 
in respect of the inflation funding mechanism and £22.5 million and £1.3 million in respect of regular contributions to UUPS 
and ESPS respectively.
Impact of scheme risk management on IAS 19 disclosures
Under the prescribed IAS 19 basis, pension scheme liabilities are calculated based on current accrued benefits. Expected cash 
flows are projected forward allowing for RPI and the current member mortality assumptions. These projected cash flows are 
then discounted by an AA corporate bond rate, which comprises an underlying interest rate and a credit spread. 
The group has de-risked its pension schemes through hedging strategies applied to the underlying interest rate and the 
forecast RPI. The underlying interest rate has been largely hedged through external market swaps, the value of which is 
included in the schemes’ assets, and the forecast RPI has been largely hedged through the IFM, with RPI in excess of 
3.0 per cent per annum being funded through an additional schedule of deficit contribution.

Strategic report
Financial statements A2 RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued
As a consequence, the reported statement of financial position under IAS 19 remains volatile to changes in credit spread which 
have not been hedged, primarily due to the difficulties in doing so over long durations; changes in inflation, as the IFM results 
in changes to the IFM deficit contributions rather than a change in the schemes’ assets; and, to a lesser extent, changes in 
mortality as management has decided not to hedge this exposure due to its lower volatility in the short term. 
In contrast, the schemes’ specific funding basis, which forms the basis for regular (non-IFM) deficit repair contributions, is 
unlikely to suffer from volatility due to credit spread or inflation. This is because a prudent, fixed credit spread assumption is 
applied, and inflation linked contributions are included within the IFM.
In the IAS 19 assessment of financial position at 31 March 2014, although the discount rate has fallen by 0.3 per cent this 
masks a rise in underlying interest rates offset by a credit spread reduction of 0.5 per cent. This credit spread reduction results 
in substantially all of the reported £192.5 million deterioration. During the year ended 31 March 2014, there has not been any 
material change in the deficits on a scheme specific funding basis and therefore the level of deficit repair contributions.
Sensitivity of the key scheme assumptions
The measurement of the group’s defined benefit obligation is sensitive to changes in key assumptions, which are described 
below. The sensitivity calculations presented below allow for the specified movement in the relevant key assumption, whilst all 
other assumptions are held constant. This approach does not take into account the interrelationship between some of these 
assumptions or any hedging strategies adopted.
• Asset volatility 
If the schemes’ assets underperform relative to the discount rate used to calculate the schemes’ liabilities, this will create a 
deficit. The schemes hold some growth assets (equities, diversified growth funds and emerging market debt) which, though 
expected to outperform the discount rate in the long term, create volatility in the short term. The allocation to growth assets 
is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes’ long-term objectives.
• Discount rate 
An increase/decrease in the discount rate of 0.1 per cent would have resulted in a £49.1 million decrease/increase in the 
schemes’ liabilities at 31 March 2014, although as long as credit spreads remain stable this will be largely offset by an 
increase in the value of the schemes’ bond holdings and other instruments designed to hedge this exposure. The discount 
rate is based on AA corporate bond yields of a similar duration to the schemes’ liabilities.
• Price inflation 
An increase/decrease in the inflation assumption of 0.1 per cent would have resulted in a £47.0 million increase/decrease 
in the schemes’ liabilities at 31 March 2014, as a significant proportion of the schemes’ benefit obligations are linked to 
inflation. In some cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation. The 
majority of the assets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will 
also increase the deficit. Any change in inflation out-turn results in a change to the cash contributions provided under 
the IFM.
• Life expectancy 
An increase/decrease in the mortality long-term improvement rate of 0.25 per cent would have resulted in a £37.3 million 
increase/decrease in the schemes’ liabilities at 31 March 2014. The majority of the schemes’ obligations are to provide 
benefits for the life of the member and, as such, the schemes’ liabilities are sensitive to these assumptions.
A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP). The UK Government intends 
to implement legislation which could result in an increase in the value of GMP for males. This would increase the defined 
benefit obligation of the schemes. At this stage, it is not possible to quantify the impact of this change.
Reporting
The results of the latest funding valuations at 31 March 2013 have been adjusted in order to assess the position at 31 March 
2014, by taking account of experience over the period, changes in market conditions, and differences in the financial and 
demographic assumptions. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service costs, were 
measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

The fair values in the table above are all based on quoted prices in an active market, where applicable.
The assets, in respect of UUPS, included in the table above, have been allocated to each asset class based on the return 
the assets are expected to achieve as UUPS has entered into a variety of derivative transactions to change the return 
characteristics of the physical assets held in order to reduce undesirable market and liability risks. As such, the breakdown 
shown separates the assets of the schemes to illustrate the underlying risk characteristics of the assets held.
Both of the schemes employ a strategy where the asset portfolio is made up of a growth element and a defensive element. 
Assets in the growth portfolio are shown as equities and other non-equity growth assets above, while assets held in the 
defensive portfolio represent the remainder of the schemes’ assets.
The ‘other’ element of the portfolio is set aside for collateral purposes linked to the derivative contracts entered into, 
as described above. The collateral portfolio, comprising cash and eligible securities which are readily converted to cash, 
provides sufficient liquidity to manage the derivative transactions and is expected to achieve a return in excess of LIBOR.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 A3 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The total expense included within employee benefits expense from continuing operations in respect of equity-settled 
share-based payments was £4.4 million (2013: £1.7 million) and £nil (2013: £0.2 million) in respect of cash-settled share-
based payments, plus a £0.1 million accrual of national insurance contributions (2013: £0.3 million).
The company operates several share option schemes.
Long Term Plan (LTP)
The LTP is the principal long-term incentive plan for executives and eligible senior leaders. Awards vest based on company 
performance over a three-year performance period and continued employment. An additional two-year holding period 
applies for executive directors.
Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
Under the DBP , executives are required to defer part of their bonus for three years, to be settled in shares. Vesting is not 
dependent on any service or performance conditions; however, malus provisions apply. 
Further details of the L TP and DBP are given on pages 81 to 82 in the Directors’ remuneration report.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The PSP was the principal long-term incentive plan for executives and senior leaders prior to 2013. Nil-cost options were 
granted and will vest based on company performance over a three-year performance period and continued employment. The 
nil-cost options accrue dividend equivalents.
Matching Share Award Plan (MSAP)
Prior to 2013, executives could voluntarily defer part of their bonus into shares under the MSAP . Matching shares (up to 
a one-for-one match) in the form of nil-cost options were awarded subject to company performance over a three-year 
performance period and continued employment. The matched shares accrue dividend equivalents.
There is no intention to grant future awards under the PSP or MSAP . Further details of the PSP and MSAP are given on 
pages 89 to 90 in the Directors’ remuneration report.
Deferred Share Award Scheme (DSAS)
The DSAS is used as a retention mechanism for certain key employees below board level on a discretionary basis. Shares are 
released after a three-year holding period and are conditional on satisfactory job performance and continued employment 
during this time. The nil-cost options accrue dividend equivalents.
Matched Share Investment Scheme (MSIS)
One-off matched share investment awards for the directors were made on their appointments. Under this scheme, the 
directors bought company shares and were awarded a conditional one-for-one matched award of shares. Shares under 
this scheme will be transferred to the CEO on 5 January 2016 and the CFO on 1 October 2015, subject to them still being 
employed by the group and retaining their original investment. The matched shares accrue dividend equivalents.
Company Share Option Scheme 1999 (CSOS)
The CSOS 1999 is for senior executives (excluding, with effect from the introduction of the group’s long-term incentive 
plan, executive directors and other executives participating in that plan and its successor, the PSP). Options under the 
CSOS 1999 are exercisable in a period beginning no earlier than three years and ending no later than ten years from the date 
of grant.
Although the LTP , DBP and DSAS give the company the option to settle in cash, the intention is to settle in shares.

Financial statements A5 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of consolidation
The group ﬁnancial statements consolidate the ﬁnancial 
statements of the company and entities controlled by the 
company (its subsidiaries), and incorporate the results of its 
share of joint ventures using proportionate consolidation.
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or 
disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated 
income statement from the date control is obtained or until 
the date that control ceases, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies 
used under the relevant local GAAP into line with those used 
by the group.
Subsidiaries
Control is achieved where the company has the power 
to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies, generally 
accompanied by a shareholding of more than one-half 
of the voting rights of an investee entity so as to obtain 
beneﬁts from its activities. In the parent company accounts, 
investments are held at cost less provision for impairment.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at 
the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired 
is recognised as goodwill. Any deﬁciency of the cost of 
acquisition below the fair values of the identiﬁable net 
assets acquired is credited to the income statement in the 
period of acquisition. All intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are entities in which the group holds 
an interest on a long-term basis and which are jointly 
controlled with one or more parties under a contractual 
arrangement. The group’s share of joint venture income, 
expenses, assets, liabilities and cash ﬂows is included in 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements on a proportionate 
consolidation basis using the same accounting methods as 
adopted for subsidiaries.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of the income receivable 
in the ordinary course of business for goods and services 
provided. Where relevant, this includes an estimate of the 
sales value of units supplied to customers between the date 
of the last meter reading and the period end, exclusive of 
value added tax and foreign sales tax.
The group recognises revenue generally at the time of 
delivery and when collection of the resulting receivable 
is reasonably assured. Should the group consider that 
the criteria for revenue recognition are not met for a 
transaction, revenue recognition would be delayed until 
such time as collectability is reasonably assured. Payments 
received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as 
deferred income.
Operating proﬁt
Operating proﬁt is stated after charging operational 
expenses but before investment income and ﬁnance 
expense.
Borrowing costs and ﬁnance income
Except as noted below, all borrowing costs and ﬁnance 
income are recognised in the income statement in the 
period in which they are accrued.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of a ﬁnancial asset or ﬁnancial liability 
are included in the initial fair value of that instrument.
Where borrowing costs are attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs 
are capitalised as part of the speciﬁc asset.
Taxation
The taxation expense represents the sum of current 
taxation and deferred taxation.
Current taxation
Current taxation, including UK corporation tax and foreign 
tax, is based on the taxable proﬁt for the period and is 
provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered 
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at each reporting date.
Taxable proﬁt differs from the net proﬁt as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Current taxation is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited to equity, in which case the corporation taxation is 
also dealt with in equity.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or 
recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of 
taxable proﬁt. Deferred tax liabilities are provided, using 
the liability method, on all taxable temporary differences 
at each reporting date. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill 
or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
that affects neither the taxable proﬁt nor the accounting 
proﬁt.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where 
the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation is measured at the average tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary 
timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax 
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at each reporting date.
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements – appendices
156
United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 A5 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
The carrying amount of deferred taxation assets is reviewed 
at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred taxation is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited to equity, in which case the deferred taxation is 
also dealt with in equity.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment comprises water and 
wastewater infrastructure assets and overground assets 
(including properties and plant and equipment).
The useful economic lives of these assets are as follows:
• Water and wastewater infrastructure assets:
 – Impounding reservoirs 200 years;
 – Mains and raw water aqueducts 30 to 300 years;
 – Sewers 60 to 300 years;
 – Sea outfalls 77 years;
• Buildings 10 to 60 years;
• Operational assets 5 to 80 years; and
• Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 3 to 40 years.
Employee and other related costs incurred in implementing 
the capital schemes of the group are capitalised.
Water and wastewater infrastructure assets
Infrastructure assets comprise a network of water 
and wastewater pipes and systems. Expenditure on 
the infrastructure assets, including borrowing costs 
where applicable, relating to increases in capacity or 
enhancements of the network is treated as additions. 
Amounts incurred in maintaining the operating capability 
of the network in accordance with deﬁned standards of 
service are expensed in the year in which the expenditure is 
incurred. Infrastructure assets are depreciated by writing 
off their cost, less the estimated residual value, evenly over 
their useful economic lives.
Other assets
All other property, plant and equipment is stated at 
historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the items, including 
relevant borrowing costs, where applicable, for qualifying 
assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic 
beneﬁts associated with the item will ﬂow to the group 
and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other 
repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income 
statement during the ﬁnancial period in which they are 
incurred.
Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are 
not depreciated. Other assets are depreciated by writing 
off their cost, less their estimated residual value, evenly 
over their estimated useful economic lives, based on 
management’s judgement and experience.
Depreciation methods, residual values and useful economic 
lives are reassessed annually and, if necessary, changes 
are accounted for prospectively. The gain or loss arising on 
the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the 
difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in other operating 
costs.
Transfer of assets from customers 
Where the group receives from a customer an item of 
property, plant and equipment (or cash to construct or 
acquire an item of property, plant and equipment) that 
the group must then use, either to connect the customer 
to the network, or to provide the customer with ongoing 
access to a supply of goods or services, or to do both, 
such items are capitalised at their fair value and included 
within property, plant and equipment, with a credit of the 
same amount to deferred grants and contributions. The 
assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives and 
the deferred contributions released to revenue over the 
same period (or where the receipt of property, plant and 
equipment is solely to connect the customer to the network, 
the deferred contribution is released immediately to 
revenue). This interpretation has been applied to transfers 
of assets from customers received on or after 1 July 2009.
Assets transferred from customers are accounted for 
at fair value. If no market exists for the assets then 
incremental cash ﬂows are used to arrive at fair value.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an 
asset. Following initial recognition, goodwill is subject 
to impairment reviews, at least annually, and measured 
at initial value less accumulated impairment losses. Any 
impairment is recognised immediately in the income 
statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, or jointly controlled entity, 
the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior 
to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in 
determining any subsequent proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are measured initially at cost and 
are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful economic lives. The carrying amount is reduced by 
any provision for impairment where necessary.

Financial statements
Strategic report
Financial statements A5 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
On a business combination, as well as recording separable 
intangible assets already recognised in the statement of 
ﬁnancial position of the acquired entity at their fair value, 
identiﬁable intangible assets that arise from contractual 
or other legal rights are also included in the acquisition 
statement of ﬁnancial position at fair value.
Internal expenditure is capitalised as internally generated 
intangibles only if it meets the criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible 
Assets’ . 
Amortisation periods for categories of intangible assets 
are:
• Computer software 3 to 10 years; and
• Other intangible assets 2 to 20 years.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding 
goodwill
Intangible assets with deﬁnite useful economic lives 
and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for 
impairment at each reporting date to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets may have suffered 
an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order 
to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. 
Where the asset does not generate cash ﬂows that are 
independent from other assets, the group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the 
asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
to sell, and value in use. Value in use represents the net 
present value of expected future cash ﬂows, discounted 
on a pre-tax basis, using a rate that reﬂects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
speciﬁc to the asset for which the estimates of future cash 
ﬂows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating 
unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses in 
respect of non-current assets are recognised in the income 
statement within operating costs.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
reversal is recognised in the income statement and the 
carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but not so as to exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined had 
no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised and 
derecognised on the group’s statement of ﬁnancial position 
on the trade date when the group becomes/ceases to be a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Cash and short-term deposits
Cash and short-term deposits include cash at bank and 
in hand, deposits and other short-term highly liquid 
investments which are readily convertible into known 
amounts of cash, have a maturity of three months or less 
from the date of acquisition and which are subject to an 
insigniﬁcant risk of change in value. In the consolidated 
statement of cash ﬂows and related notes, cash and cash 
equivalents include cash and short-term deposits, net of 
bank overdrafts.
Financial investments
Investments (other than interests in associates, 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and ﬁxed deposits) are initially 
measured at fair value, including transaction costs. 
Investments classiﬁed as available for sale in accordance 
with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ are measured at subsequent reporting dates 
at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is 
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time 
the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity 
is included in the net proﬁt or loss for the period.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially measured at fair value, 
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, less 
any impairment for irrecoverable amounts. Estimated 
irrecoverable amounts are based on historical experience  
of the receivables balance.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁed 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group 
after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Borrowings
The group’s default treatment is that bonds, loans and 
overdrafts are initially measured at fair value being the 
cash proceeds received net of any direct issue costs. They 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost applying 
the effective interest method. The difference between the 
net cash proceeds received at inception and the principal 
cash ﬂows due at maturity is accrued over the term of the 
borrowing.
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements – appendices
158
United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 A5 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
The default treatment of measuring at amortised cost, 
whilst associated hedging derivatives are recognised at 
fair value, presents an accounting measurement mismatch 
that has the potential to introduce considerable volatility 
to both the income statement and the statement of 
ﬁnancial position. Therefore, where feasible, the group 
takes advantage of the provisions under IAS 39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ to fair value its 
borrowing instruments to reduce this volatility and better 
represent the economic hedges that exist between the 
group’s borrowings and associated derivative contracts.
Where feasible, the group designates its ﬁnancial 
instruments within fair value hedge relationships. In 
order to apply fair value hedge accounting, it must be 
demonstrated that the hedging derivative has been, and will 
continue to be, a highly effective hedge of the risk being 
hedged within the applicable borrowing instrument. 
Borrowings designated within a fair value hedge 
relationship
Where designated, bonds and loans are initially measured at 
fair value being the cash proceeds received net of any direct 
issue costs. They are subsequently adjusted for any change 
in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged at each 
reporting date, with the change being charged or credited to 
ﬁnance expense in the income statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the 
hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised, or 
where the hedge relationship no longer qualiﬁes for hedge 
accounting.
Borrowings designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss
Designation is made where the requirements to designate 
within a fair value hedge cannot be met at inception despite 
there being signiﬁcant fair value offset between the 
borrowing and the hedging derivative. Where designated, 
bonds and loans are initially measured at fair value being 
the cash proceeds received and are subsequently measured 
at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair 
value being charged or credited to ﬁnance expense in the 
income statement.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are measured at fair 
value at each reporting date with changes in fair value 
being charged or credited to ﬁnance expense in the income 
statement. The group enters into ﬁnancial derivatives 
contracts to manage its ﬁnancial exposure to changes in 
market rates (see note A1).
Derivatives and borrowings – valuation
Where an active market exists, designated borrowings and 
derivatives recorded at fair value are valued using quoted 
market prices. Otherwise, they are valued using a net 
present value valuation model. The model uses applicable 
interest rate curve data at each reporting date to determine 
any ﬂoating cash ﬂows. Projected future cash ﬂows 
associated with each ﬁnancial instrument are discounted to 
the reporting date using discount factors derived from the 
applicable interest curves adjusted for counterparty credit 
risk where appropriate. Discounted foreign currency cash 
ﬂows are converted into sterling at the spot exchange rate 
at each reporting date. Assumptions are made with regard 
to credit spreads based on indicative pricing data.
The valuation of debt designated in a fair value hedge 
relationship is calculated based on the risk being hedged 
as prescribed by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement’ . The group’s policy is to hedge its 
exposure to changes in the applicable underlying interest 
rate and it is this portion of the cash ﬂows that is included 
in the valuation model (excluding any applicable company 
credit risk spread).
The valuation of debt designated at fair value through the 
proﬁt or loss incorporates an assumed credit risk spread 
in the applicable discount factor. Credit spreads are 
determined based on indicative pricing data.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. For properties held for resale, cost 
includes the cost of acquiring and developing the sites, 
including borrowing costs where applicable.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price 
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Employee beneﬁts
Retirement beneﬁt obligations
The group operates two deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes, 
which are independent of the group’s ﬁnances, for its 
employees. Actuarial valuations of the schemes are carried 
out as determined by the pension scheme trustees using 
the projected unit credit method at intervals of not more 
than three years, the rates of contribution payable and 
the pension cost being determined on the advice of the 
actuaries, having regard to the results of these valuations. 
In any intervening years, the actuaries review the continuing 
appropriateness of the contribution rates.
Deﬁned beneﬁt assets are measured at fair value while 
liabilities are measured at present value. The difference 
between the two amounts is recognised as a surplus or 
obligation in the statement of ﬁnancial position.

Stock Code: UU.
Shareholder information Governance
Financial statements
Strategic report
Financial statements A5 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
The cost of providing pension beneﬁts to employees 
relating to the current year’s service (including curtailment 
gains and losses) is included within the income statement 
within employee beneﬁts expense. The net interest on 
the schemes’ obligation/surplus is included in the income 
statement within investment income or ﬁnance expense.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised outside 
the income statement in retained earnings and presented in 
the statement of comprehensive income.
In addition, the group also operates a deﬁned contribution 
pension section within the United Utilities Pension Scheme. 
Payments are charged as employee costs as they fall due. 
The group has no further payment obligations once the 
contributions have been paid.
Share-based compensation arrangements
The group operates equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans. In accordance with the transitional 
provisions, IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ has been applied 
to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 
that were unvested as of 1 April 2004.
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments 
to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. 
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
estimates of the number of options that are expected to 
vest. Fair value is based on simulation models, according to 
the relevant measures of performance. The group has the 
option to settle some of these equity-settled share-based 
payments in cash.
At each reporting date, the group revises its estimate of the 
number of options that are expected to become exercisable 
with the impact of any revision being recognised in the 
income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to 
equity over the remaining vesting period. The proceeds 
received net of any directly attributable transaction costs 
are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options are exercised.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, 
it is probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably 
estimated. Expenditure that relates to an existing condition 
caused by past operations that does not contribute to 
current or future earnings is expensed. 
Foreign currency translation
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the 
exchange rates applicable on the dates of the transactions. 
At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at the relevant rates of exchange applicable on that 
date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included 
in net proﬁt or loss for the period. Exchange differences 
arising on investments in equity instruments classiﬁed as 
available for sale are included in the gains or losses arising 
from changes in fair value which are recognised directly in 
equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange 
risks, the group enters into derivative instruments (see 
note A1).
Group companies
On consolidation, the statements of ﬁnancial position of 
overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures (none of which has 
the currency of a hyperinﬂationary economy) are translated 
into sterling at exchange rates applicable at each reporting 
date. The income statements are translated into sterling 
using the average rate unless exchange rates ﬂuctuate 
signiﬁcantly in which case the exchange rate at the date 
the transaction occurred is used. Exchange differences 
resulting from the translation of such statements of 
ﬁnancial position at rates ruling at the beginning and end of 
the period, together with the differences between income 
statements translated at average rates and rates ruling at 
the period end, are dealt with as movements on the group’s 
cumulative exchange reserve, a separate component of 
equity. Such translation differences are recognised as 
income or expense in the period in which the operation is 
disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the 
acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing 
rate. The group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of 
implementation of IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ (1 April 
1999) as sterling denominated assets and liabilities.
Grants and contributions
Grants and contributions receivable in respect of property, 
plant and equipment are treated as deferred income, which 
is credited to the income statement over the estimated 
useful economic lives of the related assets.
Leases
Leases are classiﬁed according to the substance of the 
transaction. Operating leases are leases that do not 
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the 
lease.

Key achievements
The highlight of 2011 was our admission to the London 
Stock Exchange’s Official List in November. 
Historically the Russian financial markets have proved to be 
too limited and too volatile for a business such as Polymetal. 
These challenges create a significant disadvantage for both 
the Company and its long-term stakeholders. The London 
listing was a reflection of our intention to raise the Company’s 
profile with the international investment community and 
improve its marketability. 
We received a positive response to the IPO from the majority 
of existing shareholders and attracted many new investors. 
The move has resulted in increased interest in Polymetal from 
a more diversified investor base, significantly improving the 
liquidity of the stock. We now have greater access to capital 
to fund organic growth and create a currency for any potential 
consolidation opportunities. 
Our inclusion in the benchmark FTSE 100 index brings with  
it additional tracker funds, which will also considerably 
enhance our access to new finance.
Polymetal has always sought to uphold the highest standards 
of corporate governance and transparency and has further 
strengthened the Board as part of the UK listing. This focus 
on continuous improvement demonstrates our ongoing 
commitment to best practice in this field.

Business review
Chairman’s statement
A year of achievement
A year of achievement
2011 was a tremendous year for 
Polymetal, both operationally and  
in terms of corporate development.
Not only did we deliver record levels 
of production, we also achieved  
a Premium Listing on the London 
Stock Exchange in November –  
a month later gaining entry to the 
FTSE 100 index. As a result, we  
have raised our international profile, 
increased our transparency, 
broadened our shareholder base  
and significantly improved our  
access to capital markets. 
We have also maintained a strong 
focus on investment, both in new  
and existing processing facilities  
and exploration. As a result, we have 
made significant progress across  
all our key investment projects.
Corporate governance
We have historically operated 
according to high standards of 
governance. During the year we  
have paid particular attention to 
ensuring that our practices are 
further developed to reflect the 
change in our status, and that  
we achieve compliance with the 
majority of the requirements of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Our aim is to deliver progressively 
more effective stewardship and 
accountability to all our stakeholders 
through an ongoing process of 
review and assessment. Improved 
internal control systems and a 
renewed Board are the key changes 
that we have implemented in 2011.
We now have a stronger and more 
experienced Board, with half of the 
Directors, excluding the Chairman, 
being independent non-executives.  
A careful and disciplined selection 
process has enabled us to attract 
Board members with extensive 
international experience in the mining 
industry. The new Board has a 
greater role in strategic decision-
making, conducts in-depth reviews 
of the Company’s performance  
and is better positioned to maintain  
a constructive dialogue with our 
expanded stakeholder base. The 
Board’s Audit and Risk, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees  
are also now chaired by – and are 
composed of – independent non-
executives and the Board Chairman. 
We have also implemented a range 
of policies and procedures that cover 
internal control, financial reporting, 
risk management and disclosure, 
enabling us to fulfil all the obligations 
required of a UK Premium Listed 
company. The Directors and I are 
strongly committed to maintaining 
the highest standards of corporate 
governance and best practice. 
Our people
I would like to extend my sincere 
thanks to my fellow Directors for their 
wise counsel and hard work in what 
has been a momentous year for 
Polymetal. This year’s good 
performance is the result of a 
collaborative effort on the part of all 
our people. I am, therefore, extremely 
grateful to all our employees whose 
talents and commitment have 
contributed to our success to date. 
I have become Chairman of 
Polymetal International at an 
extremely exciting point in the 
Company’s development. We 
are entering a new era, and  
I have every confidence that 
Polymetal is well positioned  
to build and sustain a strong 
future for all our stakeholders. Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1 9
Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
Share and dividend policy
Over 83% of JSC Polymetal 
shareholders converted their shares 
to Polymetal International through the 
Institutional Share Swap Facility 
(ISSF). A Mandatory Tender Offer 
(MTO) for the remaining shareholders 
was launched in November, and  
on completion in February 2012 we 
had achieved 99.48% ownership of 
JSC Polymetal, while JSC Polymetal 
delisted its global depositary receipts 
from the London Stock Exchange.
When moving to the London Stock 
Exchange, we carefully considered 
our approach to dividend payment. 
As a result, a new dividend policy 
was adopted in 2011, reflecting our 
commitment to meet shareholder 
expectations in an environment 
characterised on the one hand by 
high commodity prices, and tight 
financial markets on the other.  
A dividend of US$0.20 per share is 
proposed by the Board for payment 
for 2011. From 2012, we intend to  
pay annual dividends of 20% of net 
income, provided that net debt/
adjusted EBITDA is less than 1.75.
Outlook
Polymetal is entering a new era.  
Our strategy of improving efficiencies 
in existing mines, creating centralised 
processing hubs to benefit from 
economies of scale, and investing  
in exploration has given us the 
foundations to deliver long-term 
growth.
Despite continuing economic 
uncertainty across global markets, 
we believe we have a robust 
business model and a clear strategy 
that will enable us to prosper in the 
years ahead. We remain firmly 
focused on delivering the sustainable 
value that will establish Polymetal as 
a world class mining company.

Business review
Chief Executive’s review
2011 was a year to remember 
for Polymetal. Our listing on  
the London Stock Exchange  
in November and achieving 
record production volumes 
represent milestones of which 
we are particularly proud.
Record production levels
In 2011, we produced a record  
810 Koz of gold equivalent ounces
1
. 
This was achieved despite some 
grade decline at mature operations, 
which was more than offset by 
production from new operations  
and the successful expansion  
of existing mines. 
Annual gold production was essentially 
flat at 443 Koz, with a further 28 Koz  
of payable gold contained in Albazino 
concentrate prepared for processing  
at the Amursk POX plant. Silver 
production increased by 15% to  
19.9 Moz, a record for Polymetal. 
Copper production was 6.9 Kt, 
up 73% on 2010. 
The early months of the year were 
particularly challenging, with various 
issues relating to grade quality and 
production processes resulting in an 
initial operational underperformance. 
However as these issues were 
resolved, the business subsequently 
performed well, and we achieved our 
revised targets – reaching a run-rate 
of 1 Moz annual production in the last 
quarter of 201 1. This was supported  
in particular by the full ramp-up of the 
Albazino plant and stabilisation of 
grades at our Dukat hub.
As a result, we are now firmly on 
track to deliver on our target of  
1.4 Moz gold equivalent production 
per annum by the end of 2014. 
Strong financial performance
201 1 was a very successful year for 
the Company. The increase in gold 
equivalent production and the growth 
in metal prices during the year 
pushed the revenues up 43% to a 
record US$1,326 million. While cost 
pressures in Russia and in the mining 
industry in general remained high,  
we nevertheless believe we have  
been successful in managing our 
cash costs. Our cash costs were  
at US$701 per gold equivalent  
ounce, up 26% as a result of some 
operational challenges and low 
volumes due to the ramp-up of 
significant new operations at Albazino, 
and further influenced by Russia’s 
domestic inflation and the Rouble 
strengthening against the US Dollar.
Adjusted EBITDA, which is a key 
metric of our core cash earnings, 
increased by 47% to US$624 million, 
in line with revenue growth, and the 
adjusted EBITDA margin increased  
to 47%. Bottom-line net earnings 
were up 21%, driven by EBITDA 
growth, growth in non-cash 
expenses, and change in the 
effective tax rate.
As a result of the cash raised at IPO 
and robust growth in operating cash 
1  Based on 1:60 Ag/Au and 5:1 Cu/Au conversion ratios.
In shape for  
long-term growth Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1 11
Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
flows, we have significantly reduced 
leverage to 1.41 net debt/adjusted 
EBITDA, with the majority of debt 
(65%) being long-term. Both these 
factors give us and our investors 
comfort as to the Company’s liquidity 
and funding. 
Robust project delivery 
I am very pleased to report that all our 
key projects are now progressing to 
plan and schedule. The Amursk POX 
facility was completed in December 
and has entered the commissioning 
stage. In 2012 it will start processing 
refractory concentrates from Albazino, 
and in 2013-14 will reach design 
capacity with the inclusion of 
concentrate from the Mayskoye mine. 
Much development and construction 
work has been completed at 
Mayskoye, our most remote mine,  
with mills installed and the power 
substation nearing completion. 
Underground development has 
reached a steady rate of 1,100 m  
per month. 
The Merrill-Crowe circuit was 
successfully commissioned at the 
Kubaka plant (Omolon hub), and  
is ready to commence full scale 
processing of high grade Sopka ore. 
Commitment to safety and 
responsible development
During the year we continued to 
demonstrate a strong commitment  
to responsible corporate citizenship. 
We have maintained high 
environmental standards both at 
existing and new operations. We 
have also continued to provide 
meaningful support to local 
communities wherever we operate.
I would also like to highlight a marked 
improvement in safety at work last 
year. We had no fatalities, and our 
lost time injury frequency rate was 
63% lower than in 2010. This very 
successful outcome was achieved  
as a result of great efforts throughout 
our operations to improve safety 
policies and working practices. 
These new policies have been  
strictly implemented to ensure full 
compliance across all locations, and 
are supported by extensive training 
and relevant incentive arrangements.
Looking ahead
Our teams are firmly focused on 
delivering further growth in 2012.  
This will be driven by the start-up  
of the Amursk POX facility and the 
achievement of full production 
capacity at Omolon. 
In the year ahead we expect to 
produce 590-640 Koz of gold, 21-23 
Moz of silver and 6-7 Kt of copper. 
We aim to increase our total annual 
gold equivalent production to over  
1 Moz in the coming year and to  
1.4 Moz by 2014.
We continue to focus on operational 
excellence, commitment to our 
strategic objectives and proven 
business model. With our talented  
and dedicated workforce, I am 
confident that we will continue to 
deliver sustainable value as we 
continue to grow.

A secure demand
The global demand for gold  
is secure and dynamic. 
 
Key categories include:
Investment
Gold will always play a vital role in  
any long-term savings or investment 
portfolios. It is a foundation asset 
offering a hedge against currency 
and asset price volatility.
Jewellery
Jewellery accounts for over 50%  
of the market for gold. Growing 
affluence in the major markets of 
India and China will continue to 
drive demand for gold jewellery,  
not just a decorative item but  
also as a key component of 
household savings.
Central banks and  
government agencies
Gold reserves held by central banks 
have increased over the past two 
years. The factors that motivated 
these purchases will remain relevant 
for the foreseeable future.
Industry and technology
Gold is used in an increasingly 
wide range of consumer and 
industrial technologies. It has 
unique technical properties of  
high conductivity, resistance to 
corrosion, malleability and ductility. 12 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1

Investing in exploration   
Leveraging our hub-based system
Today’s precious metals markets are highly competitive;  
no single producer has a significant influence over selling prices. 
On the other hand, the world’s gold and silver resources are 
characterised by declining grades, with increased complexity in 
mining and processing of ores as the higher quality resources 
are depleted worldwide. Success in this environment therefore 
depends, to a large extent, on our ability to increase the resource 
base and production volumes, whilst simultaneously maintaining  
tight control of capital spending and operating costs. 
We have developed a business 
model that enables us to achieve 
these objectives, and which has 
demonstrated its effectiveness as the 
Group has evolved. We are strongly 
committed to this model, and are 
confident that it will enable us to 
continue delivering growth and value. Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1 13
Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
> Focusing on high-grade assets
We also have a preference for open-pit mining unless higher grades justify 
underground development. Grades and mining conditions are the key cost 
factors that drive return on invested capital in the precious metals industry. 
By setting appropriate thresholds on head grades and focusing on open-pit 
mines we are achieving better returns from our project portfolio.
> Investing in exploration
This will allow us to ensure a cost-effective increase in our reserve base 
which is, in turn, the key source of long-term organic growth.
> Maintaining exemplary governance
In order to ensure proper steering of the Company, accountability  
to shareholders and attention to other stakeholders’ interests.
> Leveraging our hub-based system
Allowing us to minimise processing and logistics costs and achieve 
economies of scale through creation of centralised facilities for the 
treatment of materials from different sources.
There are three elements that form the substance of our 
business model – a focus on high-grade assets, support and 
expansion of our hub-based operating system, and investment  
in exploration – which are described below and in more detail  
in the following pages. All these core elements are supported  
by exemplary governance.

Business review
A unique business model
The creation of the Dukat, Amursk POX and 
Omolon hubs highlights Polymetal’s strategy  
of creating centralised processing facilities  
to treat ores and concentrates from various 
sources. By the end of 2014 we expect these 
three hubs to be producing up to 70% of the 
Group’s total production.
 
Omolon
The Group’s newest operating hub includes the refurbished Kubaka 
plant and two high-grade mines.

Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
We believe this model provides us with several 
key advantages, including:
>  allowing the Group to bring small and 
medium-size deposits into production  
by sharing processing plants and  
other infrastructure. The development  
of standalone operations at such deposits  
is typically uneconomic;
>  providing the Group with benefits in terms  
of capital expenditure and operating costs, 
with larger processing plants enjoying higher 
productivity and energy efficiency, as well as  
a smaller footprint per unit of capacity; and
>  allowing the Group to use high calibre staff 
from its existing processing plants. The 
Group’s processing plant employees are 
generally better qualified and are therefore 
typically more difficult to recruit, train and 
retain than mining personnel.
We intend to create additional processing hubs 
in the future. We will also review acquisition 
opportunities near our existing hubs and 
standalone mines, with a view to creating 
additional synergies through leveraging the 
existing processing facilities.
Albazino
Albazino is part of the Amursk 
hub. It comprises an open-pit 
mine and a new flotation 
concentrator.
Dukat
The Group’s first and largest asset 
since its acquisition in 1998 has been 
converted into a hub processing ore 
from four operating mines.

Investing in exploration
Investment in greenfield exploration with the  
aim of establishing the feasibility of constructing 
two new standalone mines by 2013 is a key 
objective for us. Typically our target standalone 
mines will need to meet the following internal 
criteria that drive the cost and, ultimately, the 
return on capital invested into the project.
>  Minimum peak production of 300 Koz of  
gold equivalent per year for at least ten years
>  Minimum mine life of 15 years
>  Minimum grades for non-refractory ores  
of 1.5-3 g/t depending on the processing 
method

Operating review
Delivering a  
strong performance
In 2011 Polymetal delivered another year of 
strong performance. We produced 810 Koz  
of gold equivalent ounces
1
, an increase of 8% 
over 2010. While there was some grade decline 
at mature operations, this was more than 
compensated for by new operations and  
the successful expansion of the Dukat mill.
Key production achievements 
Annual gold production was essentially flat at 443 Koz, 
with a further 28 Koz of payable gold contained in 
Albazino concentrates prepared for processing at the 
Amursk POX plant. Silver production increased by 15% 
to 19.9 Moz, an all-time record for Polymetal. Copper 
production increased by 73% reaching 6.9 tonnes.
Throughout the year all our key projects progressed  
as planned (see table below). 
Capital projects completed in 2011
>  Full ramp-up of the Albazino processing plant 
and successful start of commercial production
>  Reconstruction of the Omsukchan concentrator 
– gravity circuit launched 
>  Expansion of the Kubaka plant – Merrill-Crowe 
section installed
>  Inaugural silver and gold concentrate sales 
(Dukat to Kazakhstan, Albazino to China)
>  Implementation of laser scanning of mining 
works at Dukat for further automated mine

Notes
1 Based on 1:60 Ag/Au and 5:1 Cu/Au conversion ratios.
2  As of 1 April 2011, the Group changed its methodology for calculating and reporting 
on the metals it produced. Previously, production of metals contained in doré and 
zinc precipitate was recorded by the Group upon shipment of the doré or precipitate 
from its mine gold rooms to third party refineries. Under the new methodology, 
these metals are considered to be produced upon receipt of doré or precipitate at 
the Group’s gold rooms. In addition, production of metals contained in concentrates 
was previously recorded upon shipment of concentrate to third party off-takers, 
whereas under the new methodology these metals are considered to be produced 
when concentrate is bagged, sampled and prepared for shipment. The Company 
believes that the new methodology is more accurate as it reflects the Group’s 
physical production and eliminates variations associated with shipment cycles. This 
mostly applies to concentrates, where stockpile build-up accelerated during 2011. 
To a lesser extent, it also applies to doré and precipitate, where shipment cycles 
have remained largely unchanged during 2011. Consequently, year-on-year 
comparisons have not been restated, as the Company believes such restatement 
would not lead to material differences to those results.
3  Polymetal reports production of metals contained in concentrates based on 
percentages payable for these metals by off-takers. Final assays are typically 
determined at the receiving smelters several months after shipment from the 
Group’s mines.

Analysis of production results 
Mining 
Ore mined was 11,002 Kt, 47% above 2010 levels.  
The bulk of ore mined – around 88% (2010: 87%), came 
from open-pit mines, a strong strategic preference for 
Polymetal. The largest increase – 1,248 Kt, representing 
a 2.8 fold increase – came from Omolon. Significant 
additional contributions came from the Amursk hub with 
another 625 Kt of ore, due to start of underground mining 
at Mayskoye and the open-pit mine at Albazino reaching 
full capacity.
Average grades in ore mined decreased slightly from 
4.4 g/t of metal equivalent to 3.8 g/t, with the decline 
mostly coming from mature operations such as Dukat, 
Khakanja and Voro. The grade decline at Omolon was 
related to mine sequencing (mostly heap leach ore mined 
at Sopka). This was compensated for by grade growth  
at new operations, in particular Albazino and Mayskoye 
which both produce high grade refractory gold ores.
Processing 
Ore processed was up 12% in 201 1 at 8,821 Kt. The 
difference between ore mined and processed resulted 
principally from inability to operate a winter road at the start 
of 201 1 at Omolon. As a result, ore from Sopka could not 
be processed at the Kubaka plant as originally planned. 
However, some Sopka ore was delivered to Khakanja  
by sea and processed there. Notable increases have  
been seen at Dukat, on completion of the Omsukchan 
concentrator reconstruction, and at Varvara at both leach 
and float circuits in line with mining volume increases. 
Focus on POX >
First pressure oxidisation plant in Russia
Read more on page 34.
Average gold equivalent grades processed in 2011  
were stable compared to 2010 at 3.8 g/t. However  
the ramp-up of new mines – in particular Albazino and 
Omolon – in the second half of the year pushed the 
grade up to 4.5 g/t in the fourth quarter. Next year we 
plan to process ore with grades close to our current 
reserve grade of 4.2 g/t. 
Production 
Throughout the year we consistently improved 
production results on a quarter-on-quarter basis, as we 
overcame the operational challenges of the first half of 
the year and started to reap the rewards of ramping-up 
new plants and reconstruction of existing facilities in the 
second half of the year. As a result, in Q4 we achieved  
a record production level of 250 Koz of gold equivalent, 
representing a run-rate of 1 Moz per year. 
Major contributions to production growth resulted from 
three operations:  
>  Dukat – which saw grade stabilisation by the year end 
and increased production capacity following gravity 
circuit completion
>  Amursk hub – the start of production and ramp-up  
of the Albazino processing plant produced saleable 
flotation concentrate
>  Omolon – ramp-up of the Kubaka plant, which will be 
followed by a significant increase in production in 2012 
on the back of full use of Sopka ore and introduction of 
the Merrill-Crowe section into commercial production

1 Based on 1:60 Ag/Au and 5:1 Cu/Au conversion ratios.
Sales of metal in 2011 were 765 Koz of metal equivalent, 
representing a 1% increase over 2010. Sales were  
lower than production volumes by 6% as some of the 
concentrate produced by the Group was not delivered  
to third-party refineries. The difference was short-term  
in nature and is not expected to reoccur.
During 2011 the Group commenced successful sales of 
concentrates from its Dukat and Albazino plants. Dukat 
now sells most of its production in the form of flotation 
and gravitation concentrates to a third-party refinery in 
Kazakhstan, a decision made based on the economics 
of third party refining compared with in-house refinery 
costs and recovery.
Concentrate produced at the Albazino plant was sold  
to generate immediate cash flows from the Amursk/
Albazino project prior to completion and commencement 
of commercial gold production at the Amursk POX. 
20,000 tonnes of concentrate – with gold content at 
more than 40 g/t – was successfully sold to a Chinese 
off-taker. Additional sales may take place in 2012, 
depending on market conditions and the exact timing  
of the Amursk POX camp-up.
Exploration 
In 2011, we conducted exploration works in four  
regions of Russia – Khabarovsk, Karelia, Magadan  
and Sverdlovsk – as well as in Kazakhstan. We currently  
have 52 licences for geological studies, exploration and 
gold and silver mining. Our exploration projects portfolio 
includes 39 licences with a total area of approximately 
9,664 km
2
.
Delivering a strong performance
continued
In 2011 we conducted exploration projects in 25 licensed 
areas, of which seven are at an advanced stage.
Key exploration objectives in 2011 included: 
 >  increasing the resource base of existing processing 
facilities (Albazino, Dukat, Omolon, Varvara, Voro) 
 >  ensuring a constant supply of ore for Khakanja, which 
currently has the shortest life of our existing mines
 >  exploring for new gold and silver deposits having a 
potential for the creation of new standalone mines.

We expect that a modest reduction in Polymetal’s ore 
reserves in 2011 will be more than reversed in 2012  
as our exploration efforts translate into new significant 
reserve and resource additions.
During 201 1, the Group’s reserves and resources were 
revised as at 30 June 201 1 as part of an audit by mineral 
experts. Mineral Expert Reports and reserve and resource 
statements as of 30 June 201 1 can be reviewed in the 
Prospectus dated 28 October 201 1, issued by the 
Company in relation to the Initial Public Offering of its shares 
on the London Stock Exchange. As at 30 June 201 1, the 
Group’s proved and probable ore reserves were 15.0 Moz 
of gold equivalent, and mineral resources (measured, 
indicated and inferred) were 13.4 Moz of gold equivalent.
For more detail on reserves and resources and the 
statement by the Competent Persons please refer  
to page 137 .
Objectives for 2012 
Our development strategy is aimed at optimising operations 
and increasing the effectiveness of our existing plants.  
We also aim to improve current assets by developing their 
reserve and resource base – creating a new generation  
of assets – whilst maintaining total unit production costs  
at a level of no more than 50% of market prices.
Operations
In the coming year we expect to produce 590-640 Koz 
of gold, 21-23 Moz of silver and 6-7 Kt of copper. As a 
result, the Group aims to increase its total annual gold 
equivalent production to over 1 Moz
1
. The structure of 
production mix is shifting towards gold as opposed to 
silver: our share of gold is expected to grow from 55%  
in 2011 to more than 65% in 2012. 
We are firmly focused on delivering further growth in  
2012, driven by the start-up of the Amursk POX facility  
and achievement of full production capacity at Omolon. 
Other operations will support this by maintaining grade  
and volume. 
In 2012, we are also targeting completion and ramp-up 
of the Mayskoye concentrator. This will contribute 
significant production volumes from 2013 as the 
concentrate produced at Mayskoye will be further treated 
at the Amursk plant. By 2014, the existing portfolio of 
assets – including Albazino and Mayskoye – will achieve 
full capacity, with annual gold equivalent production 
targeted at 1.4 Moz.
As part of our commitment to enhancing existing mining 
and processing facilities, we have implemented a number 
of initiatives, which include:
>  full implementation of JORC-based mine planning 
based on use of the Datamine system for mine 
modelling and laser scanning. Mine planning will 
include full cycle, from reserve and resource estimation 
and audit to detailed mine sequencing plans on-site
>  design and implementation of automated production 
management systems, including second generation 
automated enterprise management systems
>  further implementation of energy saving solutions and 
audit of energy use, including automated systems for 
energy saving and control
>  research, design and implementation of technologies 
for improving recoveries and optimization of ore 
processing (geotechnological mapping).
Exploration
Further growth post-2014 will be mostly based on the 
results of ongoing exploration projects, both greenfield 
and brownfield. We believe these will lead to 
development of additional mines, allowing us to leverage 
the existing processing capacity at the maturing mines. 
Delivering on the ongoing exploration projects and 
progressing further to feasibility studies and subsequent 
construction remains one of our strategic priorities.
Acquisitions
On the M&A front, Polymetal continues to be focused 
on relatively small potential near-mine targets, aimed 
at increasing ore feed for maturing operations such 
as Varvara and Voro.

Dukat
Our cornerstone asset and largest silver mine
Russia, Magadan Region
Managing director: Gennady Kuzmenko
Employees: 1,91 1
Located in the Magadan Region  
in the Russian Far East, Dukat is  
one of Polymetal’s original assets.  
It is the third largest silver deposit  
in the world, the largest primary  
silver operation in Russia and our 
flagship operation.
The Dukat hub was created in 2008 
by merging the Dukat and Lunnoye 
operating units. It consists of the 
Omsukchan concentrator, which 
processes ore from the Dukat  
and Goltsovoye mines, and the 
Lunnoye processing plant, which 
processes ore from the Lunnoye  
and Arylakh mines, as well as 
concentrate from the Omsukchan 
facility. The Dukat hub also includes 
the Nachalny-2 mine.

The year ahead
In 2012, the Dukat hub will 
continue to see a decrease  
in open-pit mining volumes  
as open-pittable deposits  
approach depletion. However 
underground mining volumes at 
Dukat, Goltsovoye and Lunnoye 
will continue to grow and will 
become the key source of ore, 
worked through a combination  
of open stoping and cut-and-fill 
methods to maintain full utilisation  
of the processing plant. 
Grades will remain at around 
current levels which, combined 
with improved recoveries,  
will allow us to achieve moderate 
growth in volumes of silver 
produced. No major reconstruction 
or modifications are expected  
at the existing processing  
plants, and near-mine exploration 
activities will continue with the aim 
of further strengthening the hub’s 
resource base. Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1 27

Mining
Underground development at  
Dukat and Goltsovoye increased 
significantly during the year. Ore 
mined grew by 12% and 451% 
respectively. However, both  
mines were experiencing some  
grade decline.
At Lunnoye and Arylakh, ore mined 
grew 12%, with a modest silver 
grade decline (-7%). 
In 2011 we also started mining at the 
Nachalny-2 deposit.
Processing
2011 saw significant improvements in 
recoveries and throughput following 
the successful completion of a 
lengthy and complex expansion 
project for the Omsukchan 
concentrator. Installation of the 
gravity circuit was the last stage 
completed in 2011. Whilst grades  
at the mine declined slightly, overall 
grades processed improved due to 
the inclusion of higher-grade feed 
from the Goltsovoye mine. As a 
result, total silver production at the 
Dukat plant increased by 23%.

Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
At Lunnoye, ore processed increased 
by 10%. The amount of silver 
produced was 2% lower than in 
2010, due to modest grade declines 
in ore processed. However gold 
production increased by 11%.
In 2011, we successfully commenced 
sales of flotation concentrate to a 
third party refinery in Kazakhstan. 
More than 17 ,000 tonnes of 
concentrate were shipped. The 
rationale for concentrate sales – as 
opposed to doré sales – was the 
better recoveries achieved by the 
third party refinery, which offset the 
additional treatment charges and 
transportation costs. Sales of 
concentrate also enabled 
optimisation of the production 
programme for the Lunnoye 
cyanidation circuit, which is now  
only treating ores with higher 
potential recovery.
Near-mine exploration
Key exploration activities in 2011 
were focused on Goltsovoye, as  
with of additional exploration works 
performed at ore zones 2 and 3.  
We also completed exploration  
works at the Krasin deposit, An 
estimate of open-pit resources  
at Krasin is expected in 2012.

Omolon
Created in 2009, the Omolon hub 
currently includes two operating 
open-pit mines, Birkachan and 
Sopka, and three development 
projects with high-grade ore and 
significant long-term potential.  
The hub is based around the  
Kubaka plant, which will become  
a centralised processing facility for 
several operating and planned mines. 
The year ahead
A trial heap leach facility to treat 
run-of-mine ore currently will 
operate at Birkachan between 
May and October. With the 
successful completion of trucking 
high-grade ore from Sopka to the 
Kubaka plant, we are expecting to 
more than treble metal production, 
supported by higher grades and 
the introduction of the Merrill-
Crowe section. We also plan to 
commence open-pit mining at 
Tsokol. This high grade ore will 
then be sent to Kubaka for 
processing together with 
Birkachan ore.
A new 8 MW coal-fired boiler will 
be commissioned during the year 
and used mostly for heating the 
heap leach solution. 
The Group will continue to carry 
out near-mine exploration projects 
at Tsokol, Oroch and Dalneye, with 
the aim of expanding the Omolon 
hub reserves.

Mining
Ore mined increased nearly threefold, 
with significant increases achieved at 
both Birkachan and Sopka deposits. 
However, adverse weather conditions 
and excessive snowfall restricted  
the amount of waste that could be 
removed from the Birkachan mine  
in the first quarter and this led to  
a failure to operate a winter road  
to deliver ore from Sopka to the 
Kubaka plant. Some of the ore  
mined at Sopka (23 Kt) was therefore 
shipped to Khakanja for processing. 
Gold in ore mined at Birkachan 
increased by 14% to 1.6 g/t, whilst  
at Sopka, lower grade ore (2.6 g/t 
compared to 7 .2 g/t in 2010) was 
mined for further heap leading.
In December 2011, we successfully 
completed construction of the winter 
road for the 2012 season. It became 
operational on 30 December 2011, 
and we are targeting to truck more 
than 250 Kt of ore by the end of  
April 2012.
Processing
No ore was stacked to heap leach 
pads at Birkachan in 2011, although 
we received 4 Koz of gold from ore 
stacked in 2010.
At the Kubaka plant, production 
trebled as a result of an increase in 
ore mined at Birkachan combined 
with improved grades and recoveries. 
However, the plant operated below 
its potential capacity of 850 Ktpa  
due lack of ore from Sopka.
Overall, annual gold production at 
Omolon more than doubled in 2011.

Construction
During the year construction of a new 
processing section was undertaken 
to enable treatment of ores with high 
silver content – initially from  
the Sopka deposit. The upgraded 
plant includes new leaching,  
counter-current decantation and  
a Merrill-Crowe circuit, which was 
successfully commissioned at the 
end of the year. 
We also completed construction of 
an unpaved road between Birkachan 
and Kubaka. A 180-metre permanent 
bridge over the Omolon river was 
also completed, which means the 
road now operates all year round. 
Exploration
We have received exploration licenses 
for 91 km
2
 around Kubaka, the key 
project being Burgali, 40 km north of 
Birkachan. These areas saw extensive 
trenching and some drilling performed 
to identify high-grade deposits with 
open-pit mining potential, and improve 
of medium term grade profiles at the 
Kubaka plant. 
Burgali was a new discovery in 2011. 
We obtained several trench assays 
– the best grading 11.1 g/t gold with 
a width of 17 .9 m, and core assays  
– the best grading 17 .5 g/t gold  
with a width of 6.9 m. Projects are 
continuing at the evaluation stage, 
with major scoping drilling scheduled 
for 2012.

Amursk POX hub
The year ahead
Underground development is 
currently underway on the central 
part of the Mayskoye deposit, with 
the aim of beginning production of 
primary ore from stopes in the first 
quarter of 2012.
Completion of the Mayskoye 
concentrator is scheduled for Q3 
2012, with the first gold concentrate 
to be produced towards the end  
of the year. The concentrate will 
then be shipped to Amursk during 
the navigation period (typically 
between the end of June and  
the end of November.
Located in the Khabarovsk Territory  
in the Russian Far East, the Amursk 
hub is Polymetal’s largest project.  
It comprises two high-grade  
refractory gold deposits, Albazino  
and Mayskoye, and three  
processing facilities, the Amursk 
hydrometallurgical plant, the  
Albazino concentrator and the 
Mayskoye concentrator.
Construction of the Amursk POX 
plant has been completed and the 
first gold pour is scheduled for the 
first half of 2012.
We have already secured shipping 
capacity from FESCO (the largest 
fleet operator in the Far East) for 
these shipments through a long-
term agreement.
Additional exploration works at 
Olga, Nadezhda and Ekaterina-2 
are expected to yield an increase  
in resource potential in the Albazino 
area. Further exploration and 
probing will also be carried out in 
two standalone areas – Kutyn and 
Uchamin – where we expect to 
significantly increase the existing 
resource potential.

The Amursk hydrometallurgical plant 
uses pressure oxidation (POX) and 
cyanidation technologies to process 
refractory ores from the operational 
Albazino mine and Mayskoye (under 
construction). It has a design 
processing capacity of approximately 
225 Ktpa of concentrate resulting in 
400-440 Koz of gold produced per 
annum depending on the gold grade. 
Albazino is a remote deposit located 
680 km from the Amursk plant.  
It comprises a high-grade gold 
open-pit mine and a 1.5 Mtpa on-site 
flotation concentrator, and it achieved 
full design capacity in Q3 2011. 
Albazino’s reserves are estimated  
to be 2.2 Moz of gold. 
Mayskoye is located in the Chaun 
district of the Chukotka Autonomous 
Territory. Proved and probable 
reserves are estimated to be  
7 .9 Mt of ore, grading 9.6 g/t gold  
for 2.4 Moz of contained gold. 
Ores at both these mines require 
pre-treatment oxidation before 
conventional cyanidation to extract 
the sulphur component. Polymetal 
selected POX (also known as 
autoclave leaching) as the preferred 
processing option since – despite 
higher initial capital costs – it offers 
several advantages over alternative 
processes.
These include the ability to treat 
various feedstocks in one facility, 
higher recoveries, lower operating 
costs and reduced environmental 
impact compared to other 
technologies such as bioleaching  
or roasting.
 
Mining
At Albazino, three times as much  
ore was mined in 2011 compared  
to 2010 as the mine has operated  
at full capacity, while gold grades 
improved from 3.7 g/t to 4.3 g/t.
At Mayskoye, underground 
development reached a steady  
state rate of 1,100 m per month.  
Ore mined reached 79 Kt grading  
9.8 g/t gold, as the mine intensified 
projects preparing feedstock for  
the concentrator.
Processing
The on-site flotation concentrator at 
Albazino was successfully started in 
April 2011. The plant took 30 months 
from approval to completion and the 
construction was completed within 
budget, despite some challenging 
logistical and climatic issues. This 
was Polymetal’s first launch of a 
greenfield mine since 2004, and it 
reached full capacity by the end of 
Q3 2011. Since then we have seen 
significantly improved recoveries at 
Albazino as processing transitioned 
from semi-oxidised to primary ore, 
reaching 88% in January 2012. 
During the year we sold some 20 Kt of 
gold concentrate, containing 29.8 Koz 
of payable gold, to a Chinese 
off-taker. These sales allowed us to 
receive immediate cash flow from the 
project before completion of the POX 
plant at Amursk. Additional sales may 
be considered in 2012 depending  
on the exact timing of the Amursk 
POX start-up. Another 23 Kt of 
concentrate with 30 Koz of contained 
gold produced in 2011 were 
delivered to Amursk to accumulate 
feedstock for further processing  
at the POX plant.
Construction
The Amursk POX facility entered the 
commissioning stage in December 
201 1. The start of 2012 saw testing  
of the autoclave integrity using high 
pressure steam and hot water and the 
first gold pour is scheduled for the first 
half of 2012. Full ramp-up is expected 
towards the end of the year. 
At Mayskoye, civil works were 
completed and mills installed with  
the majority of equipment and 
construction materials delivered  
in 2011 by sea. Work is currently 
focused on the flotation, filtering  
and drying sections. 
The power substation is nearing 
completion and is expected to link to 
the regional power grid in the first half 
of 2012. Completion of construction 
is scheduled for Q3 2012.

Exploration
Exploration works near Albazino 
revealed good potential for a further 
significant increase in reserves in the 
territories adjacent to the existing 
mine. In August we started 
construction of an underground 
exploration decline at Albazino,  
to trace continuity of mineralisation. 
As a result of our exploration 
projects, we have established new 
mineralised areas with an estimated 
3.2-4.3 Moz of gold (non-JORC 
estimates), including 1.2-1.3 Moz  
at the Olga and Nadezhda zones  
and 2-3 Moz at the newly-discovered 
Ekaterina-2 zone. 
In 2012, a new Uchamin area will be 
included in the scope of exploration 
projects. In 2011, results of re-probing 
exploration works, performed by 
previous owners, have revealed high 
resource potential with the possibility 
of open-pit mining.

The year ahead
In 2012 we expect to deliver 
production growth at Khakanja  
as ore from higher grade mines  
will constitute an increasing  
share of the overall supply  
to the processing plant.
We expect to expand open-pit 
mining at Khakanja’s pit 3, to 
commence underground mining  
at Khakanja and to begin open-pit
Located in the Russian Far East, 
Khakanja is one of Polymetal’s 
principal assets, comprising a 
standalone gold/silver open-pit  
mine and a 600 Ktpa Merrill-Crowe 
processing plant. Contributing mines 
include the main Khakanja pit, the 
small Yurievskoye satellite deposit 
and a trial mine at the AK Project 
(see page 50 ‘Standalone exploration 
projects’ for more information).  
Ore from Sopka – part of the  
Omolon hub – was also processed  
at Khakanja prior to completion  
of refurbishmentof the Kubaka 
processing plant.
 
Yurievskoye is accessible only  
by a winter road from January to 
April, and underground mining

completion of open-pit operations. 
mining at the new satellite Ozerny 
operation towards the end of 
2012, with ore to be processed  
at Khakanja in 2013. Ozerny is  
of considerable importance to  
the Group, given the relatively  
short life of the Khakanja mine 
(2018) and the resulting potential 
under-utilisation of the plant from 
2015 unless new reserves are 
discovered and mined.

Mining
At Khakanja, including the 
Yurievskoye satellite deposit, ore 
mined grew by 11%. Gold equivalent 
grade in ore mined declined as 
expected from 10.6 g/t to 6.2 g/t as 
a result of the depletion of the higher 
grade pit 1 and the start of mining  
at the lower grade pit 3.
Underground development at 
Yurievskoye and open-pit mining at 
the Avlayakan trial mine intensified in 
2011. Notably, at Avlayakan the 
average gold content in ore mined 
was 17 .1 g/t. To deliver this high-
grade ore to Khakanja, we built  
new port facilities at Kiran which  
will be used for transportation  
of Avlayakan ore going forward.
Based on the increased share of 
these two higher grade mines in the 
2012 mining programme, we are 
looking to improve the grade profile 
at Khakanja in 2012. 
Processing
During 2011, the plant processed ore 
at its full capacity – slightly above 
600 Ktpa. Gold production declined 
by around one third to 84 Moz 
principally as a result of lower grades 
from the main Khakanja deposit, 
while silver production remained flat 
due to significant improvement in 
recovery rates. Overall production 
levels were supported by additional 
higher grade ore coming from 
Yurievskoye, Avlayakan and Sopka.

Exploration
The Group is undertaking several 
brownfield exploration projects with 
the aim of extending the economic 
life of Khakanja. During the year, five 
target exploration areas close to 
Khakanja saw drilling or substantial 
trenching. This activity was part of 
our efforts to identify small-scale 
locations with potential for open-pit 
operations. 
At Ozerny, we have considerably 
increased the resource base at ore 
body 1 and are preparing for both 
statutory and JORC-compliant 
reserve estimates in 2012. Northern 
flanks of this ore body yielded grades 
ranging from 4.8 g/t gold (trench: 
width 15 m) to 6.4 g/t gold(core: 
width 4 m).

Voro
The year ahead
In 2012, the total volume of ore 
mined at main Vorontsovskoye 
deposit will slightly decrease,  
with most of the decrease coming 
from oxidised ore. Ore mined  
at Fevralskoye will be sent for  
trial processing at Varvara.  
At Degtyarskoye, we expect to see 
a continuing reduction in mining 
volumes, with the low-grade ore to 
be sent to Varvara for processing. 
Voro is one of Polymetal’s key assets, 
contributing consistent cash returns. 
Located in the Sverdlovsk Region,  
it comprises two open-pit mines – 
Voro and the smaller Degtyarskoye, 
and a newly developed mine at 
Fevralskoye. This asset also has a 
sizeable brownfield exploration area 
consisting of the South Voro and 
Volchansky projects. Primary  
and oxidised ores are processed  
at the 900 Ktpa CIP and 1 Mtpa 
heap leach plants. 
Total production volumes at both 
heap leach and CIP circuits will be 
stable, along with a slight decrease 
in head grades processed.
Our exploration activities in 2012 
will be focused around increasing 
the resource base at the south  
of the Voro area, in both primary 
and oxidised ores.

Mining
At Vorontsovskoye, ore mined in  
2011 grew by 74% compared to 
2010. The main increase was due  
to the start of mining of oxidised ore 
at the southern flanks of the main 
Vorontsovskoye deposit, while head 
grades reduced for the same reason.
At Degtyarskoye, ore mined declined 
by 29% as the mine nears depletion. 
This is also affecting the grade levels.
We commenced mining at 
Fevralskoye in early 2011 and are 
currently assessing the viability of 
further activity. The average gold 
grade in ore mined was 2.4 g/t.  
It is planned that ore from this  
mine will be transported to  
Varvara for processing.
Production
2010 was the year of peak 
performance for Voro, which is now 
entering its mature stage. In 2011, 
annual gold production decreased  
by 14% from 183 Koz to 157 Koz. 
This was principally due to the 
expected decrease in grades and 
recoveries at the CIP plant, driven  
in turn by the exhaustion of the 
Degtyarskoye satellite mine. The 
higher share of oxidised ore mined  
at Vorontsovskoye also pushed  
the overall grades processed 
down. Recoveries at both heap  
leach and CIL plants were stable.

float ore with a high copper content. 
Gold content in leach ore decreased 
slightly to 0.8g/t, whilst the total 
amount of leach ore itself declined  
by 7%.
Production
In 2011 we commenced purchases 
of ore from the nearby Komarovskoye 
deposit, which supported overall 
production and recovery levels.
Annual gold production at Varvara 
grew by 17% in 2011 from 78 Koz  
to 92 Koz. Copper production rose 
by 73% from 4,003 tonnes to 6,915 
tonnes, resulting from a considerable 
increase in float ore processed, along 
with increased copper content and 
improved recoveries (from 82% to

Business review
Pursuing standalone 
exploration projects
Typically, the standalone mines we 
target need to meet the following 
internal criteria that drive the cost  
and, ultimately, the return on capital 
invested into the project:
> Minimum peak production of  
300 Koz of gold equivalent per  
year for at least ten years;
> Minimum overall mine life of 15 years;
> Minimum grades for non-refractory 
ores:
  – 1.5 g/t for heap leaching;
  –  2 g/t for milling with grid power 
available; 
  –  3 g/t for milling with grid power 
unavailable.
These thresholds typically translate 
into a minimum requirement of 7 Moz 
for the size of resource for a new 
standalone operation and 5 Moz  
for the size of reserve. 
Our key standalone projects are:
Avlayakan-Kirankan (the ‘AK project’)
The AK project covers an area of  
323 km
2
 in the Khabarosk Territory, 
approximately 250 km north east  
of Albazino. Polymetal acquired the 
project in 2010 and began trial ore 
mining early in 2011. An open-pit  
trial mine is currently under way at 
Avlayakan, with high-grade ore mined 
then trucked to the port of Kiran, 
shipped to Okhotsk and then 
transported to the Khakanja plant.
In 201 1 the Group completed 17 km 
of core drilling at the site. We aim  
to bring the potential resource base  
of the AK project to the level of the 
Group’s internal size threshold.  
A pre-feasibility study for the project 
– with a project-wide estimate of 
JORC reserves – is planned for the 
second half of 2013. 
Kutyn
Polymetal acquired the Kutyn deposit 
in 201 1. The licence area is 1 13 km 
north east of Albazino, only 25%  
of which has been covered by 
exploration works. In 2011 we 
undertook technological mapping  
of ores and achieved a recovery rate 
of more than 80% from heap leach 
testing at a relatively coarse crush 
size. Preliminary research results also 
supported high potential recoveries 
from cyanidation on higher grade ore.
We plan to drill additional 20 km of 
diamond core holes in 2012 with a 
view to identifying the extent of known 
ore zones and testing any significant 
anomalies. To date, only a quarter  
of the 120 km
2
 licence territory has 
been sampled by drilling. An external 
audit of JORC-compliant resources  
is planned for the first half of 2013. 
Svetloye
Svetloye is located 220 km south west 
of Okhotsk. Eight major target areas 
of gold mineralisation have been 
discovered and initial metallurgical 
tests have confirmed a recovery rate 
of over 90% gold recovery through 
cyanide extraction with low cyanide 
consumption. Metallurgical test work 
is also underway at Svetloye to 
determine the viability of heap 
leaching; multiple targets are awaiting 
drilling on this 40 km
2
 land package. 
No active exploration was undertaken 
in 201 1; plans for a further exploration 
strategy will be confirmed once the 
feasibility of heap leaching has been 
determined. 
Tamunier
Located in the Sverdlovsk Region of 
Russia, the Tamunier licence covers  
23 km

Technological research of the 
Tamunier ore has proved potential 
recoveries of up to 90% which 
support the feasibility of the mine. In 
2012 we are planning to delineate high 
grade mineralised areas to assess 
resources which can be economically 
processed at our Voro plant.
Prognozny 
Acquired by the Group with the 
Kubaka processing plant in 2010, 
Prognozny is located 40 km from the 
Sopka mine. We completed 6 km of 
diamond core drilling and 30,000 m
3
 
of trenching in 201 1 with the aim of 
tracing known mineralisation along 
strike and searching for deeper levels 
of gold-bearing material. 
Elmus
The Elmus licence area covers  
188 km
2
 in the Republic of Karelia  
in north-west Russia and was 
acquired in 201 1. 
 
We drilled 14 km in diamond core 
holes in 201 1 and plan to drill a further 
23 km in 2012. The results of these 
activities will help us to determine 
whether this location merits further 
exploration.

Financial review
Key financial indicators and performance highlights
We had a very successful financial year:
 >Revenue was up 43% to US$1,326 million, driven by 
13% increase in gold equivalent ounces sold and a 26% 
increase in the average realised gold price;
 >Adjusted EBITDA of US$624 million, up 47% and 
exceeding revenue growth; adjusted EBITDA margin was 
up 1 10bps to 47% despite ramp-up of new mines and 
operational challenges in the beginning of the year;
 >Total cash cost of US$701/AuEq oz, up 26% compared 
to 2010 as a result of Russia’s domestic inflation of 6. 1%, 
Rouble strengthening against the US Dollar by 3.4%,  
and relatively high cost levels at Omolon and Albazino 
mines which have just commenced commercial 
production and are still in ramp up mode;

Gold (LHS US$/oz) Silver (RHS, US$/oz)
Gold/silver ratio (RHS, Ag/Au)
Precious metals market summary
2011 witnessed another period of strong price growth 
both for gold and silver, with gold reaching its all-time 
high in the beginning of September at US$1900/oz, and 
silver demonstrating even stronger growth, going up to 
as much as US$48.4/oz in April, with the gold/silver ratio 
standing at 32, a record low. Both gold and silver were 
rising on the back of continuing debt crisis in peripheral 
EU countries and US budget deficit problems, which, 
together with continued quantitative easing policy by  
the Federal Reserve System, raised doubts both about 
euro and dollar long-term strength as a reserve currency. 
Gold and silver therefore were viewed as ‘safe haven’ by 
many institutions and private investors, while silver price 
highs were purportedly also driven by speculative dealing, 
to which the less liquid silver market is more sensitive. 
By the end of the year, there was a moderate price 
decline to US$1564/oz for gold and US$27 .8/oz  
for silver. As a result, the average 2011 gold price  
was US$1,572/oz, up 28%, and the silver price was 
US$35.3/oz, up 75% compared to 2010. The gold/silver 
ratio during 2011 dropped to 45 Ag/Au compared to  
61 Ag/Au in the prior year.
Looking ahead to 2012, we believe that the gold price  
will stay above US$1,500/oz, as the key fundamental 
factors affecting the price are still in place for this year 
and are supporting the investment demand for gold.  
For silver, we expect a more modest price performance, 
with an average level slightly above US$30/oz. Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1 53

Accounting and reporting basis
The financial information presented for the Polymetal 
International plc Group, represents the enlarged  
Group from its formation on 2 November 2011 until  
31 December 2011. The enlarged Polymetal International 
plc Group was created following the completion of the 
institutional share swap facility (‘ISSF’) under which the 
Company obtained a controlling shareholding in the 
Open Joint Stock Company Polymetal (‘ JSC Polymetal’). 
In accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standard (‘IFRS’) guidance for a reverse acquisition,  
the assets and liabilities of the JSC Polymetal group were 
not revalued, although a non controlling interest was 
recognized for the interest in its net assets held by JSC 
Polymetal shareholders who did not participate in the 
ISSF. Prior to this date the financial information presented 
is solely that of JSC Polymetal on a consistent basis  
to that previously reported in accordance with IFRS, 
other than for a reclassification within the issued equity 
balances. This retrospective reclassification has been 
made to reflect the legal capital of Polymetal International 
plc as if it had always been the legal parent company. 
For more detail please refer to Note 1 to the consolidated 
financial statements on page 92.
Revenue
In 2011, revenue grew by 43% to US$1,326 million, 
driven mostly by significant increases in the gold and 
silver prices. Gold sales volume was up by 2%, in line 
with production dynamics. Silver sales volumes were 
down 5% despite 15% production growth, as we started 
to sell most of our silver produced at the Dukat plant

treatment at third-party refineries.
The average realised price for gold was US$1,556/oz,  
up 26% compared to 2010 and in line with market price  
of US$1,572/oz. The average realised silver price stood  
at US$34.0/oz, up 73% compared to 2010 which again 
closely reflects the market price levels and movements.
The share of gold in total revenue reduced from 59%  
in 2010 to 53% in 2011, while the share of silver grew  
from 38% to 44% on the back of the significant change  
in the gold/silver price ratio in the market.

21% and 14% to the revenues respectively, broadly 
unchanged from 2010, while the share of Khakanja 
declined in 2011 from 23% to 16% as a result of a 25% 
decrease in gold equivalent produced driven by a lower 
grade profile. Albazino generated its first sales of gold 
concentrate to a Chinese third party off-taker in 2011 
amounting to 3% of total revenues, and will become  
a meaningful revenue generating operation in 2012. Business review

Cost of sales
Total cost of sales grew by 37% in 2011 to US$626 
million, mainly on the back of volume-based growth  
both in ore mined (by 47%) and ore processed (by 12%). 
The key cost drivers were the domestic inflation in Russia 
(6. 1% CPI growth in 201 1), and appreciation of the rouble 
against the dollar (3.4% increase in average rate from 
2010 to 2011). The increased operating assets base, 
which now fully includes Omolon and Albazino, both 
currently higher cost assets, contributed 21% of the  
37% increase, while inflationary factors and production 
growth at other mines made up another 16%.
Diesel fuel price inflation in particular is an important 
factor affecting our cost base and driving cost  
increases, especially for remote mines generating  
power using diesel gensets, and in-house and third  
party transportation costs. Depending on the region,  
the price of diesel fuel increased by 20-50% in 2011.

The total cost of labour within cash operating costs 
increased by 68% in 201 1 to a total of US$130 million,  
as a result of general labour cost inflation, and also as  
a result of growth in the average number of employees 
directly involved in production by 46% as a result of 
production commencing at Albazino and a full year  
of commercial production at Omolon (including the 
Sopka mine). The cost of labour at those operations  
was mostly included in inventory costs in 2010. Another 
important factor was the increase in social tax rates  
in Russia from 26% to 34%. 
Financial review

Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
The cost of consumables and spare parts and the  
cost of services grew by 55% and 77% respectively, 
mainly affected by mining and processing volume 
increases (47% and 12%, respectively), and further 
inflated by increased diesel and electricity prices,  
as well as increases in US Dollar costs for other 
consumables in line with general CPI levels. Specific  
cost increases throughout the year were related to 
a shift of mining and, to some extent, processing 
volumes mix towards more complex and expensive  
mines and locations. In particular, significant increases  
are attributable to increased ore and concentrate 
haulage costs at Dukat, Omolon and Khakanja,  
as well as concentrate shipping costs and general 
transportation costs at Albazino.
Mining tax represents a consistent 14% share of total 
cost of sales and has increased by 69% in 2011 on the 
back of soaring metal prices, as well as an increased 
amount of total metal contained in ore mined in 2011.
Depreciation and depletion expenses nearly doubled  
in 2011 and amounted to US$140 million as we put  
into production new mining and processing assets and 
completed several capex projects, including expansion  
of the Omsukchan factory at Dukat, the start-up of a 
new mine at Goltsovoye and a trial mine at Avlayakan,  
the launch of commercial production at Albazino, and  
the inclusion of a full year of mining and production at 
Omolon. The biggest increases are attributable to three 
mines where mining volumes significantly exceeded  
ore processed at relevant processing plants: ore mined  
at Sopka and not processed at Kubaka (Omolon hub), 
Albazino ore and concentrate prepared for further 
processing, and ore at the Avlayakan trial mine. At  
all locations mentioned, depreciation charges (mainly 
represented by depletion of mineral rights) were mostly 
included in metal inventories at the year-end.
In 201 1 a net metal inventory increase of US$215 million 
was recorded as we have been building concentrate 
stockpiles at Albazino (awaiting further processing at 
Amursk POX in 2012), and Dukat (concentrate in transit 
and in third-party refineries), both largely representing 
one-off factors. The Group has also been building ore 
stockpiles at Sopka (awaiting transportation by winter  
road at the beginning of 2012), Mayskoe and Avlayakan.

and an increase in exploration expenses (US$22. 1 million) 
related to assets where no probable or proved reserves 
were established. Other components demonstrated a 
moderate increase on the back of increased production, 
asset base and general cost inflation. Business review
56 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1
We believe we have demonstrated a good ability  
to control costs in the face of both global and local 
inflationary pressures which the mining industry is facing. 
Total cash costs of gold equivalent ounce sold were  
US$701/GE oz, up 26% compared to 2010. The cash 
cost dynamics was significantly influenced by Omolon 
and Albazino, the former operating under design 
capacity during 2011, and the latter going through  
the ramp-up stage and reaching design volumes and 
recoveries in the last quarter of the year. As a result,  
both operations have demonstrated cash costs which 
are higher than the ones at our mature mines, however  
we are confident that their 2012 performance will 
however be in line with the Group’s average. Excluding 
these two operations, total cash cost was US$642/GE oz, 
or up just 19% compared to 2010. The key factors 
contributing to the growth in cash costs were the 
domestic inflation (6.1%) and appreciation of the  
US Dollar against the Rouble (3.4%) in 2011.

Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
Cash cost by mine:
 >At Dukat, the cash cost per silver equivalent ounce sold 
grew by 42% to US$14.0/AgEq oz due to an increased 
share of underground mining (Goltsovoye) and increased 
ore and concentrate haulage costs, as well as 
significantly higher mining tax on the back of rapid growth 
in the average silver price by 73% year-on-year. General 
inflation and increased diesel fuel prices also contributed 
to the growth. However, in the second half of 201 1, cash 
cost per silver equivalent dropped to US$13.4/AgEq oz 
as the both grades and recoveries improved, and silver 
prices slightly retreated from April highs.
 >At Voro, the cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold  
in 201 1 was US$553/AuEq oz, the lowest among our 
assets. Cash cost of gold equivalent ounce increased by 
31% in 201 1 on the back of a decrease in average grade 
in ore mined from 5.2 g/t to 3.6 g/t and a resulting 
production volume decline, combined with increased 
metal prices driving up mining tax, as well as general 
inflationary factors.
 >Khakanja’s cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold 
was US$672/AuEq oz, up 41% compared to 2010. The 
growth in cost was driven mainly by the grade decline 
after processing of high grade ore from Yurievskoe had 
been completed and the grades declined at the main 
Khakanja mine, coupled by Avlayakan ore transportation 
costs and diesel fuel price growth.
 >Varvara has demonstrated the least cost inflation among 
our assets, with cash cost per gold equivalent ounce 
growing by 19% in 201 1 to US$7 47/AuEq oz. The growth 
was mainly driven by increased use of third party ore and 
metal prices pushing the mining taxes up. On the positive 
side, cost inflation has been limited due to average grade 
improvement and 13% growth in total ore processed at 
the mine, with a 28% increase in gold equivalent 
production achieved in 201 1.
 >At Omolon, cash costs were US$1,481/AuEq oz sold, 
significantly above the Company’s and industry average 
as the Group has been unable to reach this year’s 
production volume targets. From a spike of US$1,833/
AuEq oz in first half of the year, the Group achieved a 
notable improvement to US$1,303/ AuEq oz in the 
second half, on the back of significant increased grade  
in Birkachan ore processed (from 1.9 g/t in 1H 201 1 to 
3. 1 g/t in 2H 201 1) and improved recoveries. The Group 
expects a radical improvement in the cost profile of the 
Kubaka plant in 2012 as it will be able to process high 
grade ore from the Sopka mine as originally planned and 
achieve more than a three-fold increase in gold equivalent 
production volume.
 >At Albazino, the cash cost was US$1,018/ AuEq oz,  
a high level driven by the ramp-up of both the mine and 
processing plant during 201 1. By the end of the year the 
processing plant has reached both its designed volume 
and recoveries, so the Group is quite positive about the 
2012 cost outlook.

1  The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) as profit for the 
period adjusted for depreciation expense, rehabilitation expenses, writedown  
of inventory to net realisable value, share-based compensation, listing expenses, 
income on disposal of subsidiaries, bargain purchase gain, foreign exchange  
gain/(loss), change in fair value of derivatives, change in fair value of contingent 
consideration, finance income, finance costs, and income tax expense. Adjusted 
EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Business review
58 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1
In 2011, adjusted EBITDA grew by 47% to US$624 
million, slightly ahead of revenue growth. This year the 
Group fully benefited from increased metal prices, 
production growth, and our ability to keep costs under 
control in a challenging environment. The adjusted 
EBITDA margin grew slightly by 110bps to 47 .0%. Dukat 
and Voro contributed most to the adjusted EBITDA 
growth. Adjusted EBITDA at Dukat grew by 83% to 
US$282 million on the back of soaring silver prices  
and a 17% increase in silver production volumes, while  
at Voro the Group benefited from the lowest cost base 
among its assets, pushing adjusted EBITDA up by 33% 
despite some production volume decline. At Albazino 
(excluding Amursk and Mayskoe, both assets under 
construction), in 201 1 the Group has already achieved a 
positive adjusted EBITDA contribution of US$4.5 million.
Other income statement items
Foreign exchange losses increased significantly from 
US$0.3 million in 2010 to US$13.6 million in 201 1, mainly 
stemming from the appreciation of the Group’s mostly 
US Dollar denominated borrowings against the Russian 
Rouble as the US Dollar appreciated against the Rouble 
by 5.6% year-on-year. The Company does not use any 
hedging instruments on foreign exchange, other than  
a natural hedge arising from the fact that the majority  
of the Group’s revenue is denominated or calculated  
in US dollars.
A US$6.8 million non-cash loss was recorded in 2011, 
arising from changes in the fair value of contingent 
consideration liabilities. The change mainly arises from  
an increase in metal prices, as the Group is obliged to 
pay a perpetual 2% of revenues from deposits acquired  
as part of the acquisition of Kubaka in 2008. In September 
201 1, the Group fully settled deferred liabilities in relation  
to the acquisition of Varvara by paying US$5.5 million 
consideration to the previous owner.
Net income, earnings per share and dividends
Pre-tax earnings in 2011 were US$409 million, up 33% 
compared to 2010, reflecting strong revenue growth  
and controlled cost dynamics. The Group’s effective tax 
rate in 201 1 was 29%, up from 22% in 2010, as a result  
of an increase in various non-deductible expense items  
or expenses incurred in jurisdictions outside Russia.  
The biggest single non-deductible expense item was 
share-based compensation (a non-cash item, US$57 
million in 2011 compared to US$8 million in 2010).  
Other significant non-deductible expenses included 
contingent consideration, and charitable and social 
expenses.
As a result, net income grew by 21% to US$290 million. 
Basic earnings per share were US$0.79, or 18% higher 
than 2010 (the average number of shares in issue in 2011 
was 2% higher as a result of the IPO). Diluted earnings 
per share were US$0.74, up 12% compared to 2010 and 
further influenced by an increase in the dilutive effect of 
shares potentially issuable by the Company under the 
terms of its Long-term Employee Incentive Programme.
From 2011, the Company has implemented a new 
dividend policy. For 2011, the Directors propose to  
pay a dividend of US$0.20 per share, and from 2012  
the Company intends to pay a dividend of 20% of net 
earnings provided that net debt to adjusted EBITDA  
ratio is below 1.75.
In 201 1, total capital expenditure was US$480 million, up 
8% compared to 2010 as the Group was completing a 
number of major projects during the year. The Company 
expects that in 2012 it will see a considerable decrease  
in investment as most of the construction projects on  
the existing assets have been completed or are nearing 
completion.
The major capital expenditure items in 2011 were:
 >US$133 million has been invested in completion  
of construction at Amursk POX and Albazino 
concentrator, with all major construction works 
completed at both sites in 2011. The concentrator 
already is up and running and the Amursk POX is 
completing the commissioning stage;
 >US$85 million was spent on construction of processing 
plant and underground mine at Mayskoye, where the 
Group is targeting completion in Q4 2012;
 >US$68 million was invested in the Omolon operations, 
including installation of a Merrill-Crowe section and 
completion of refurbishment at the Kubaka plant 
(completed in December 2011) and expansion of the 
mining fleet at Sopka and Birkachan;
 >Capital expenditure at Dukat was US$55 million, 
representing mainly completion of refurbishment of the 
Omsukchan concentrator (gravity circuit installed) and 
expansion of underground operations and fleet at 
Dukat and Goltsovoye mines;
 >Other operating mines incurred less significant capital 
expenditures in 2011, mainly representing routine 
maintenance investment and upgrades to mining fleet;

cash equivalents increased from US$11 million in 2010  
to US$659 million as at 31 December 2011 as a result  
of the following:
 >Operating cash flows before changes in working capital

by growth in adjusted EBITDA;
 >Changes in working capital were negative at  
US$250 million (2010: US$118 million) mainly as  
a result of increase in metal inventories at Omolon  
(ore mined at Sopka for further processing in 2012 at  
the Kubaka plant) and Albazino (concentrate produced 
for further processing at the Amursk POX in 2012) and, 
to a lesser extent, at other mines where the amounts  
of ore mined exceeded processing capacity in 2011 
and stockpiles of saleable concentrate have built up;
 >Investing cash flows were up 15% driven by progress  
at major capital expenditure projects in 201 1;
 >Financing cash flows were US$907 million, mainly 
represented by the IPO proceeds of US$763 million 
and US$191 million net increase in debt.

The Group is keen to maintain a safe liquidity and funding 
profile, underpinned by strong operating cash flows and 
robust short-term and long-term liquidity management 
policies.
The Group’s net debt stood at US$879 million as of  
31 December 201 1, representing a Net debt/adjusted 
EBITDA ratio of 1.41 as a result of receipt of IPO proceeds 
received in November 201 1, and recognition of the  
MTO obligation. 
 
The Group continues to focus on building a healthy  
debt profile, which is comfortable both from the liquidity 
and cost standpoints. The majority of our borrowings 
(65%) were long-term as at 31 December 201 1, while  
the average cost of debt remained at a low 3.2% in 201 1 
(2010: 3. 1%), supported by low base interest rates and  
our ability to negotiate competitive premiums on the back 
of the improved financial position of the Company and  
our excellent credit history. 
Key 2012 financial targets
We are positively looking into 2012. It will be a year when 
we will be benefiting from the following factors:
 >Achievable production targets of 1 Moz of gold 
equivalent, representing a 24% increase over the  
201 1 level;
 >Completion of a major capital investment cycle in  
201 1, with significantly less capital expenditure planned 
for 2012;
 >Completion of the ramp-up of new operations at Omolon 
and Albazino allowing the Group to achieve robust cost 
performance.
We therefore expect a strong financial year, both in terms 
of earnings and free cash flow. The Company will continue 
to implement a rigid liquidity policy, further pushing the 
debt level down in order to maintain net debt/adjusted 
EBITDA below 201 1 levels and to be able to generate  
the anticipated dividend flow to our shareholders. 60 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1

Risks and risk management
Effective risk identification 
and management
Managing our risks well is critical to the long-
term sustainability and success of the Company. 
We believe that delivery of sustainable value to 
our stakeholders should be based on effective 
risk identification and an appropriate response 
to each risk.
Risk management process
Polymetal’s risk management process is designed to 
minimise the potential threats to achieving our strategic 
objectives. The process incorporates the following stages:
>  identify and document risks;
> assess, quantify and classify  
each risk;
> develop and implement risk mitigation/control 
strategies; and 
>  monitor, report and review risk.
The Audit and Risk Committee of the Board sets the 
agenda for the risk management policies and procedures 
of the Group and is responsible for reviewing their 
effectiveness. Its duties include the review of:
>  policies and overall process to identify and assess 
business risks and manage their impact on the 
Company and the Group;
>  regular assurance reports from management, internal 
audit, external audit and others on matters related  
to risk and control; and
>  the timeliness of, and reports on, the effectiveness  
of corrective action taken by management.
Risk identification
An awareness of risk is embedded within the Group and  
is grounded in our strong ethical values and proactive 
corporate culture. Our risk management philosophy is 
driven by the Company’s Board of Directors and runs 
through all our management, employee and connected 
stakeholder activities – from developing strategy  
to day-to-day operations. 
Risk management is one of the key functions of the  
Audit and Risk Committee. Strategic risks are identified 
by the Board based on a detailed understanding of the 
Company, its markets and the legal, social, political, 
economic, technological, environmental and cultural 
environments in which we operate. Our risk identification 
system considers not only single, mutually exclusive  
risks, but also multiple linked and correlated risks.
Risk matrices are used to record, prioritise and track 
each risk through the risk management process. These 
are regularly reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee.
Risk assessment
Once identified, potential risk factors are assessed to 
consider the impact (consequences) the event or events 
may have on achieving objectives and the likelihood 
(probability) of the event (see table on top of page 61). 
Together these create a risk profile.
Risk response
When the appropriate ranking has been identified, a 
response to each risk is formulated and implemented. 
Management assesses the effects of a risk’s likelihood 
and impact, as well as costs and benefits. A response  
is then evaluated, that brings the risk within acceptable 
tolerance levels.
Monitoring and reporting
Ongoing monitoring processes are embedded in 
Polymetal’s business operations. These track the 
effective application of internal control and risk 
management policies and procedures, including internal 
audit and specific management reviews. Risk matrices 
are used to re-evaluate and adjust controls in response 
to changes in Company’s objectives, business and the 
external environment.
Management is responsible for the implementation of 
effective follow-up procedures to ensure appropriate 
actions occur in response to changes in risk and  
control assessments. Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1 61
Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
Risk category Risk description and potential effect Risk response
1 
Market risk
Gold and silver price volatility can result in material 
and adverse movement in the Group’s operating 
results, revenues and cash flows.
Movement in gold equivalent price for all metals 
produced of 10% will cause EBITDA to increase/
decrease 19% in accordance with Group budgeted 
figures for 2012.
The Group monitors gold and silver prices on an ongoing 
basis. There are market signs which support analyst and 
investor confidence in the current levels of gold and silver 
prices. The Group has therefore decided not to hedge 
gold prices in order to maximise the benefits from the 
positive price trends.
2 
Production risks
The risk of failure to meet the planned production 
programme.
Failure to meet production targets may adversely 
affect operating performance and financial results  
of the Group.
Annual, quarterly and monthly production budgeting and 
subsequent monthly control against budget is designed 
to mitigate the risk. The effectiveness and efficiency  
of the production process is ensured by the Group’s 
engineering team senior management.
2.1 
Production risk 
– low grade / 
potential dilution 
of ore
The risk of lower than expected metal grade or 
dilution is caused by complex mining and geological 
conditions, mainly at underground mines.
An approved production programme includes increased 
volume of operational prospecting works, such as in-fill 
drilling and grade control sampling.
2.2
Production 
risk – ore and 
concentrate 
shipping
The Company operates in remote locations that 
require complex and significant transportation of  
ore and gold/silver concentrates, most of which is 
conducted by third party contractors. Production 
targets may not be reached if any element of the 
logistics chain is disrupted.
To mitigate the logistics risk the Group invests 
considerable amounts into construction and maintenance 
of permanent and temporary winter roads at exploration 
and production sites. The Group exercises effective 
control over the whole logistics chain, including selection 
and operation of contractors.
2.3
Production risk – 
supply chain risks
The Group’s production activity depends heavily on 
the effectiveness of supply chains. These might be 
negatively affected by complex logistics to remote 
locations and delays in construction and delivery  
of purchased mining and processing equipment  
or spare parts.
The Group has implemented and constantly improves  
the supply chain system to closely link the production 
demand of resources with inventory levels, optimise the 
number of order placements and ensure the in-time 
inventory and equipment delivery to production sites.
2.4
Production risk – 
low recovery rate 
Recoveries at the Group’s processing plants may not 
reach planned levels due to complex technological 
properties of ore processed.
To mitigate the risk the Group invests considerable 
amounts in ore quality assessment procedures and 
seeks to control ore quality by formation of ore stacks 
with the required characteristics.
 
3
Production risk – 
construction and 
renovation
Failure to meet return required from the major capital 
expenditure projects, such as building new mines 
and processing facilities or production capacity 
increase / renovation at existing mines, as a result of 
failure to meet project delivery timeline and budgets 
which can adversely affect the Group’s financial 
results, cash flow position and increase capital costs.
Most significant ongoing projects include launch  
of Amursk POX facility and construction of  
Mayskoye concentrator.
The Group’s engineering team is responsible for the 
oversight of capital expenditure projects, including  
project support, coordination of service organisations, 
contractors, constructors and cooperation with 
regulatory bodies.
Significant parts of exploration and development projects 
are performed by the Group in-house by Polymetal 
Engineering, a subsidiary company with significant 
expertise and track record of designing and 
commissioning mines and processing plants.
On complex projects, such as construction of the 
Amursk POX plant, the Group employs world class 
consultants with recognised international experience.

Legal risk
Operating in developing countries, such as Russia 
and Kazakhstan, has a risk of changes in tax and 
other legislation which may occur from time to time. 
The most sensitive areas are regulation of foreign 
investments, private property and environmental 
protection.
In the recent years, however, both Russian  
and Kazakh governments have become more 
predictable in implementing new regulations 
and taxes, demonstrating consciousness of  
the investment climate.
Polymetal has a successful track record of operating  
in both Russian and Kazakh jurisdictions, having 
developed its own expertise in corporate, tax,  
licensing and other legal areas. 
The Group’s financial and legal teams monitor current 
legislation and proposed changes and incorporate 
these into the practice.
Corporate and operating management teams are 
responsible for meeting the legal requirements in  
their operating activities. Head office and on-site  
legal teams guarantee appropriate controls over 
compliance issues.
5
Mergers and 
acquisitions
The Group invests considerable amounts in  
gold mining assets and operations in the Russian 
Federation and Kazakhstan. There is a risk of failure 
to achieve expected benefits from any acquisition  
in the case of adverse changes in assumptions  
or inaccuracy of estimates made, or where the 
information used for decision making was 
incomplete or inaccurate.
Failure to deliver expected benefits from an 
acquisition can results in adverse financial 
performance, lower planned production volumes  
or problems with product quality.
Rigorous due diligence procedures are applied to the 
evaluation and execution of all acquisitions to assess 
the consequences of the acquisition, based on 
economic, ecological, political and social factors.
Board and/or shareholder approval is required for  
any acquisition. 
6
Environmental 
risks
Environmental damage may arise from operations, 
including air and water pollution from toxic waste. 
Waste storage and recycling is subject to 
government regulation. Potential impacts  
include fines and penalties, statutory liability for 
environmental rehabilitation and other financial 
consequences that may be significant.
The Group has implemented a number of initiatives  
to monitor and limit the impact of its operations  
on the environment. These include external expert 
assessment of pollution generated and adoption of 
industry best practice on the corporate level policies 
and procedures. Refer to page 69 of this report.
7
Political risk
Operating in Russia and Kazakhstan involves some 
risk of political instability, which includes, but is  
not limited to, changes in government, negative 
policy shifts and civil unrest. These may have an 
adverse effect on the Group’s market value and 
operating environment.
The Group actively monitors political developments  
on an ongoing basis.
We aim to maintain open working relationships with 
local authorities in the countries where we operate.
8
Currency risk
Currency risk arises as the Group’s revenue  
is linked to London Bullion Market Association 
(LBMA) gold and silver fixings and denominated  
in US Dollars. The expenses are mostly incurred 
and denominated in Russian Rubles.
Natural hedging is used to reduce the risk exposure: 
revenue is matched with US Dollar denominated debt.
Flexible budgeting is used to monitor the effect  
of exchange rate fluctuations on the Group’s  
financial results.

9
Human resources
Failure to retain key employees or to recruit new  
staff mainly at the Group’s mining and processing 
facilities may lead to increased staff costs, 
interruptions to existing operations and delay  
in new projects.
Lack of skilled and knowledgeable staff at remote 
locations may occur due to extreme weather 
conditions.
A working conditions improvement programme  
is in place.
Remuneration policies are designed to incentivise, 
motivate and retain key employees.
There is an increased focus on health and safety – 
refer to page 68 of this report and there is active 
promotion of a positive corporate culture within  
the Group.
10
Liquidity risk
Inability to raise sufficient funds to meet current 
operating or ongoing financial needs, to develop 
new projects and growth.
The Group’s Treasury function is responsible for 
ensuring that there are sufficient funds in place, 
including loan facilities, cash flow from operating 
activities and cash on hand to meet short-term 
business requirements. Long-term credit lines are 
used to finance new projects and organic growth.
In 2011, the Group moved to the LSE’s main market, 
raising additional US$768 million during its IPO.  
Part of the IPO proceeds will be used to reduce  
the current net debt level.
11
Failure to meet 
exploration 
objectives
Exploration and development are capital- and 
time-intensive activities and may involve a high 
degree of risk. They are, however, necessary for  
the future growth. Failure to discover new reserves 
of sufficient magnitude could adversely affect the 
Group’s medium and long-term growth prospects.
The Group invests considerable amounts in focused 
exploration projects to obtain sufficient information 
about the quantity and quality of expected reserves 
and to estimate expected cash flows. The Group’s 
team of mining and engineering specialists has a  
track record of successful greenfield and brownfield 
exploration leading to subsequent development  
of exploration fields into commercial production.
12
Interest rates
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as 
significant part of the Group’s debt portfolio 
comprises US Dollar denominated floating  
rate borrowings.
Based on analysis of the current economic situation, 
the Group has decided to accept the risk of floating 
interest rate rather than hedge it or borrow at fixed 
rates. However the Group does not rule out the 
possibility of fixing the interest rate on its borrowings  
in the future, should assessment of the ongoing 
economic situation suggest this may be profitable.
13
Inflation risk
The Group is exposed to potentially high rates of 
inflation in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. 
Higher rates of inflation may increase future 
operating costs and have a negative impact on 
financial results if there is no related depreciation of 
the local currency against US Dollar or an increase 
in LBMA gold and silver fixings.
As part of the budgeting process, the Group estimates 
possible inflation levels and incorporates them into 
cost planning.

Sustainability – being  
a responsible business
Polymetal aims to create shareholder value whilst protecting the 
interests of employees, communities and wider society, in order 
to underpin the Company’s long-term success. Consequently, 
responsible development and sustainability are crucial parts  
of our overall strategy.
In our view, sustainability is achieved 
through the provision of high quality 
jobs, secure and safe employment, 
protection of the environment and  
a positive relationship with local 
communities and other stakeholders. 
We work hard to be a good 
corporate citizen in all of our 
operational locations.
Scope of sustainability actions
Polymetal’s sustainability actions 
cover all Group operations, including 
the headquarters in St. Petersburg 
and each of the subsidiary 
companies.
Sustainability governance
Sustainability is the ultimate 
responsibility of the Group CEO,  
Vitaly Nesis. To assist him, a Technical 
Council is convened monthly to review 
strategy and agree priorities and 
actions. Heads of department report 
to the Council, covering employees, 
community outreach, health  
and safety and environmental 
management. The Council defines 
and monitors sustainability strategy 
and oversees implementation  
of associated policies across all 
operating subsidiaries. The latter  
is the responsibility of the relevant 
human resources, communications, 
health and safety and environmental 
heads within these businesses.
The overall sustainability strategy is 
designed to meet the requirements 
of the UN Global Compact.
This voluntary international standard 
commits affiliated companies to 
compliance with ten principles in  
the areas of human rights, labour, 
environment and anti-corruption.  
In 2009 Polymetal became an active 
member of the UN Global Compact 
Network in Russia.
The UN Global Compact is the 
starting point for more detailed 
policies and associated management 
systems, all of which are defined  
at Group level and implemented 
through the head office and the 
subsidiary companies. Ongoing 
monitoring and regular audits ensure 
that performance is measured 
against the relevant regulatory  
and company internal requirements. 
Stakeholder engagement
Our stakeholders help to define 
sustainability priorities and  
provide a vital check on how we  
are performing. We are, therefore,  
open, honest and clear in the way  
we communicate through corporate 
reporting, company news, briefings, 
hotlines and digital channels. 
Sustainability priorities
Our sustainability priorities are to:
>  Operate with the full co-operation 
of local people, government 
authorities and non-governmental 
organisations (NGOs)
 
>  Maintain productive relationships 
with local communities, 
government authorities and 
NGOs, where mining, processing 
or transportation is taking place
 
>  Provide excellent career 
opportunities and compensation

Recognition from our stakeholders
Polymetal has received formal 
recognition for its actions from the 
following stakeholders in 2011:
>  local communities – for doctors’ 
visits and healthcare provision for 
children in remote villages, material 
support for elderly and vulnerable 
people and for a proactive 
approach to tackling particular 
social problems;
>  NGOs – for sponsoring cultural 
institutions, promoting sports and 
supporting ecological education 
projects for young people;
>  Indigenous Minorities of the North 
(IMN) associations – for ongoing 
support and co-operation with 
IMN, helping to preserve their 
cultural heritage and lifestyle;
>  managers in local sports, 
healthcare, educational and  
cultural organisations – for 
improving facilities and  
purchasing equipment; and 
>  local government authorities – for 
ongoing co-operation, partnerships 
and a contribution to local and 
regional economic development 
through direct investment as well 
as tax payments.
In 2011, the Group CEO was given a 
‘For Merit’ award by the Khabarovsk 
local administration in recognition of 
his and the Company’s contribution 
to social and economic development 
in the Territory.
Communities
Polymetal maintains positive working 
relationships with local authorities and 
communities, where its subsidiaries 
operate. We recognise that future 
business growth will be underpinned 
by such relationships in areas where 
we are planning new operations. 
Our community engagement 
priorities are:
> education and healthcare; 
> development of local infrastructure;
> sports and healthy lifestyles;
> local culture and creativity; and 
> welfare of IMN. 
The standards expected of our 
subsidiaries and employees in 
relation to these priorities is set out  
in our Corporate Governance Code 
and Policy on Social and Charitable 
Investments.
Community benefit in 2011
In 2011, our Russian subsidiaries 
paid taxes and made payments  
to extra-budgetary funds of  
US$40 million. Taxes paid by the 
Group’s subsidiary in Kazakhstan 
amounted to US$3 million. Over 
and above our tax commitments,  
we maintained and enhanced local 
infrastructure and services, increased 
employment opportunities, provided 
training and education for local people 
and operated a long-term programme 
of community investment. 
Community investment in 2011
We invested US$4.0 million in 
communities, with the principal 
emphasis on health, education  
and sports related projects.
The investments were made in all 
areas of our operations and most are 
part of long-term programmes, many 
of which were started in 2010. The 
ongoing and future implementation is 
very much driven by local authorities, 
communities and NGOs. We have 
established formal dialogue and 
feedback mechanisms with all of 
these stakeholder groups, including 
surveys, hotlines and public hearings. 
Through this process, we have 
learned about the effectiveness of 
the programmes and made some 
changes for 2012. We have positive 
feedback and there is high level of 
support for the work.
Supporting the Indigenous 
Minorities of the North
Maintaining long-term supportive 
relationships with IMN communities 
is a priority for Polymetal. We work 
with such communities in Chukotka, 
Magadan Region and Khabarovsk 
Territory, providing nomadic reindeer 
herding teams with materials, fuel, 
transport, healthcare and food.

the Association of IMN in the 
Khabarovsk Territory described 
Polymetal as “the best business

and developing ethnic cultures.” 
Employees
An ability to recruit and retain high 
quality motivated people is essential 
to the sustainable long-term growth 
of our business. In line with the UN 
Global Compact, our main human 
resources objectives are:
>  to operate a fair and internationally 
competitive system of wages and 
benefits, linked to collective and 
individual performance;
>  to operate an effective training and 
career development programme;
>  to ensure that all employees are 
trained in occupational safety and 
accident prevention procedures;
We also work with younger people in 
the IMN communities to explore and 
promote their own traditions and 
culture, including sponsorship of 
celebrations, involving music, art  
and ethnography. In 2011, we funded 
the publication of a book about the 
Negidals, the smallest of the IMN 
communities, whose future is under 
threat. In the same year, we began  
a long-term programme of support 
for reindeer herders in the Okhotsk 
District, Khabarovsk Territory. This 
involves the purchase of materials, 
veterinary medicines and transport, 
repairs to equipment and grants to 
assist in building up reindeer herds.
All of this work is done with the full 
co-operation of IMN representatives. 
Regular meetings provide us with 
opportunities to identify their needs 
and assess the success of our 
funding programmes. Accordingly, 
>  to maintain an excellent working 
and living environment for 
employees and their families; and
>  to engender a positive working 
culture through clear and regular 
two-way communication.
Employment policies and profile
We have clearly defined human 
resources policies for all employees. 
These cover recruitment, professional 
development, appraisal, training, 
resources and skills, organisational 
design and motivation. As at 
31 December 2011, we employed 
8,747 people across the Group, 
with 6,497 in production, 599 in 
exploration and 735 in research, 
development, design, logistics

Additional discretionary allowances 
are also granted to reflect particular 
roles and skills shortages in certain  
markets and across certain functions.
Freedom of association
In line with the UN Global Compact, all 
employees have the right to freedom 
of association and to enter collective 
agreements with the Group. As a 
consequence, employee managed 
Workers’ Councils operate at all  
major operating subsidiaries. Where 
plants remain under construction  
or subsidiary companies have just 
joined the Group, local labour 
standards are fully adopted as  
a precursor to the establishment  
of formal Workers’ Councils.
Selection and appraisal
Polymetal is committed to being  
an employer of choice for young, 
educated and ambitious professionals. 
We, therefore, offer a wide range of 
career paths, backed by excellent 
benefits packages. This emphasis  
on skills retention, development and 
transfer provides many opportunities 
for internal candidates to progress 
within the business.
Given the growth of our business, it is 
not always possible to identify suitable 
internal candidates, so we also operate 
an extensive external recruitment 
practices for qualified people with  
a disability, observing all applicable 
labour and employment laws 
wherever its businesses are located. 
Every employee has equal access  
to training, career development and 
promotion programmes, including 
those with disabilities. 
Employee compensation  
and benefits
Polymetal is fully compliant  
with all labour laws in Russia and 
Kazakhstan. In 2011 and 2010, our 
average salary levels were between 
3-30% higher when compared with 
other mining companies, varying  
on a region-by-region basis. These 
levels are set through collective 
agreements with employees in each 
subsidiary, which recognise that the 
salary is linked to the quality of an 
individual’s work and the overall 
performance of the Group.
Expenditure on social benefits in 201 1 
was US$3,950 per employee. These 
benefits include pensions, medical 
care, access to sports facilities, clubs 
and competitions, nursery and school 
provision, food and accommodation, 
when working away from home,  
programme. An important component 
is the ‘Youth-Professionalism-Career’ 
scheme, which in 201 1 offered 1 18 
students work experience at 9 plants, 
including return travel, accommodation 
and a salary. Under the scheme, 
children of employees also receive 
education support to degree level with 
the guarantee of employment at the 
end of the course. This has led to  
a significant increase in the number  
of student interns and graduates 
employed across the Group. 
Training
Ongoing professional development 
and training is essential for 
operational integrity, safety and 
personal motivation. Our appraisal 
and training processes are, therefore, 
comprehensive and cover all aspects 
of the business. A new appraisal 
system adopted in 2010 measures 
each employee’s personal 
development and identifies career 
paths within the Group. The training 
framework includes both distance 
and experiential learning and 
continuing professional development, 
with opportunities to attend specialist 
courses, conferences and 
exhibitions. Specialist engineering 
and environmental management 
training is also available. Polymetal 
Engineering, the internal centre of 
excellence, places great emphasis 
on training and professional 
development for its engineers  
and environmental professionals.

Internal communications
Given the scale and geographic 
spread of our business, we use  
many communication channels to 
keep employees informed about 
Group-wide developments. Our 
monthly newspaper, The Northern 
Latitude, is a key communications 
tool with different editions published 
according to specific Group activities. 
Our regular employee surveys 
highlight the high regard in which  
The Northern Latitude is held.
Events are also important in terms  
of sharing experiences and building 
morale. Metallurgists’, Geologists’ 
and Miners’ Days are celebrated 
across the Group with awards 
ceremonies, gala concerts, sports 
competitions and activities for 
children and local communities. 
Gifts are distributed to first year 
schoolchildren on the Day of 
Knowledge and war veterans  
are recognised on Victory Day.
In 2007 , we initiated a formal employee 
feedback system to channel corporate 
information, receive comments  
on management decisions and 
suggestions for improved working 
The system complies with ILO-OSH 
2001, OHSAS 18001 and GOST R 
12.0.007-2009.
In 2011, health and safety activity 
focused on:
>  ongoing implementation, operation 
and refinement of the system;
>  reducing workplace injuries;
>  enhancing the culture of safety 
across all operations;
>  ensuring that the latest employee 
safety techniques and equipment 
are applied; and
>  enhancing safety training and 
techniques for motivating 
employees.
We operate 102 production sites  
and processes, each with its own  
risk profile. These include open  
and underground mines, geological 
exploration sites, ore processing  
and explosive depots, as well as 
transportation of people, equipment, 
spoil and ore. Every employee 
receives illustrated guides, backed up 
by regular briefings and formal training 
sessions, and is provided with the 
necessary equipment and workwear. 
practices. This feedback is channelled 
through mailboxes at every plant, 
telephone hotlines, direct contact with 
plant management, direct contact 
with the Group CEO, the corporate 
website and The Northern Latitude. 
We track feedback and ideas 
and are committed to responding 
within a certain time to all such 
communications. In 201 1, 397 
employee messages were delivered 
and responded to via this system. 
For example, employee feedback in 
Mayskoye led to changes in the way 
food is purchased and delivered, 
the provision of new equipment 
in factory canteens, the building of 
new bathing facilities, the opening 
of a physiotherapy unit and an 
improved library. 
Health and Safety
Our approach to Health and Safety is 
governed by our employee protection 
and workplace safety management 
system. This is designed to detect, 
assess and manage production  
risks, ensure employee health and 
workplace safety, and define the  
safe use of buildings and equipment.

Environment
Polymetal’s operations generate 
hazardous and non-hazardous 
waste, liquid effluent and air 
emissions, use significant volumes  
of water and displace significant 
quantities of soil. Whilst complying 
with all relevant national and regional 
environmental legislation, our 
environmental priorities are:
>  pollution prevention;
>  reduction in greenhouse  
gas emissions;
>  efficient use of energy and  
natural resources; and
>  effective management of waste.
These priorities are addressed 
through the adoption and effective 
use of technology, ongoing 
refinement of management 
processes, rational use of natural 
resources, reuse and recycling of 
waste, efficient use and conservation 
This is backed up by ongoing internal 
audits that identify areas of poor and 
positive practice, in order to maintain 
the integrity of the system.
Workplace accidents
In 201 1, there were 1 1 workplace 
accidents across the Group, none  
of which were fatal. This reflected a 
major upgrade of the health and safety 
system following poor performance  
in 2010, which saw 24 such accidents, 
six of which were fatal. The severity  
of incidents in 201 1 was also reduced 
compared to the previous year, with  
a 50% decrease in serious incidents.
Work-related illness
No cases of production-related  
illness were recorded in 201 1. Each 
employee receives, as a minimum, an 
annual health check from one of our 
medical professionals. In some cases, 
these checks identify the need for 
specific treatment, for example 
treatment away from the workplace  
in one of our health centres.
of energy, employee involvement  
in environmental management  
and prevention of accidents with  
an environmental impact.
Environmental governance
Group performance is managed  
by the environmental department  
at its headquarters in St. Petersburg, 
from where the environmental 
management system is defined and 
monitored. This system was revised 
and updated in 2011 in line with  
the ISO 14001 standard and in 
accordance with relevant legislation 
in Russia and Kazakhstan.
The Group environmental 
department comprises specialists  
in water pollution management,  
water treatment, air quality, land 
management and ecology. Each  
of our subsidiary companies has  
its own environmental team, 
responsible for management and 
monitoring and the provision of 
monthly reports to the Group.  
Our new shift risk assessment (SRA) 
system is placing a much greater 
emphasis on personal health and  
safety assessment at the Dukat and 
Omolon hubs. At the start of a shift, 
each employee will make a note on  
an SRA card about the nature and 
condition of their clothing and personal 
safety equipment and the type of work 
that they are about to do. Through this 
discipline, the employees essentially  
carry out their own assessment of the 
degree of risk, leading them to make  
a conscious decision about the 
acceptability or otherwise of that risk.
Experience has shown that the success 
of this approach depends largely on  
the attention paid to the process by the 
employee and their colleagues, which  
in turn places more responsibility on 
foremen and supervisors. This requires  
a high degree of communication and 
feedback from all parties, which in turn 
improves safety practices. Consequently, 
at the Omolon hub we now require all 
foremen to maintain electronic SRA logs, 
the data from which is used to adjust 
safety procedures as and when new 
issues arise, and the system is being 
rolled out across all Group operations  
in the Magadan Region. 
“Having deployed SRA, we can see  
the benefits it brings in terms of personal 
responsibility and safety. It is very  
much here to stay as an integral part  
of our overall health and safety 
management system.”

Environmental auditing and monitoring 
of Group subsidiaries is undertaken  
by state regulatory authorities in  
line with the requirements of relevant 
environmental legislation.
Regulatory authorities specify, that we 
make quarterly payments in line with 
the intensity of monitoring and auditing 
required. In 201 1, these payments 
amounted to US$2.3 million, a third 
more than in 2010 and in line with  
the substantial expansion of our 
production capacities over this period.

Corporate Governance
Dear Shareholders
This was a very exciting year for us with the listing on the London Stock 
Exchange and entry to the FTSE 100 index.
I was excited to join the Board as Chairman, committing my time and 
experience to create sustainable value to the Company’s stakeholders.  
I will do my best to ensure that the work of the Board and overall 
governance system we operate at Polymetal International will be 
conducted to the highest international standards.
It is important that we build trust and reputation through our commitment 
to stringent governance practices and accountability. 
We are complying with the majority of the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2010 with adequate provisions made to ensure 
compliance in 2012 (see details opposite). Our belief is that effective 
governance is realised through leadership and collaboration. We have  
a renewed Board with the balance of skills and experience needed to 
support and enhance the work of the Executives. In my role as Chairman 
I will also ensure that we collaborate and operate with due diligence and 
discipline across the whole Group.
It is important that we encourage dialogue with stakeholders in order  
to guide and define our approach to governance and risk management 
now and in the future.
As a Board we are responsible for defining the long-term direction  
and strategic aims of the Company. We have a robust business model 
and a focused strategy that will deliver sustainable value, underpinned  
by our commitment to high standards of governance, enabling us to 
achieve our vision of being a world-class mining company.
Bobby Godsell
Chairman  Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1 75
Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
Statement of compliance with UK Corporate  
Governance Code 
The Directors are committed to maintaining high standards  
of corporate governance. As a premium listed company, 
Polymetal International is required to comply with the UK  
Code of Corporate Governance published in June 2010  
(‘the UK Code’) and, where the provisions of the UK Code 
have not been complied with, to provide appropriate 
explanations. In 2011, the Company has complied with  
the provisions of the UK Code, except for the following:
 > B.6.1 ‘Performance evaluation of the Board, its committees 
and its individual Directors; 
 > Schedule A of the UK Code recommends share options  
and awards should not vest in less than three years.
The reason for non-compliance was the short period between 
the formation of the Group and the year end (B.6.1) and the 
existence of share option arrangements prior to admission 
(Schedule A). B.6.1 will be complied with in 2012.
Following the admission of the Company to trading on the 
London Stock Exchange in November 2011, certain planned 
improvements relating to corporate governance remained 
incomplete by the end of the year. However, arrangements 
have already been made by the Board to ensure compliance  
in 2012 in these respects. All matters subject to review and/or 
approval by the Board and its committees were included into 
the Board’s and respective committees’ agenda. The schedule 
and number of meetings planned for 2012 meets the 
requirements of the UK Code. 
The UK Code recommends that share options and awards  
should not vest in fewer than three years. During 2010, prior  
to the UK Code becoming applicable to the Company options  
were awarded to certain employees that could, subject to the 
meeting of specific performance criteria, vest in fewer than 
three years. This was considered appropriate to align employee 
incentives with the Company’s objectives.
Role and structure of the Board
The Company’s Board comprises one executive Director, 
non-executive Chairman and seven non-executive Directors 
(half of whom are independent non-executives) – refer to the 
schedule below for the structure of the Board and Committees, 
showing this status of each Director.
Non-executive Directors are determined by the Board to  
be independent in character and judgement and to be free 
from relationships or circumstances, which may affect,  
or could appear to affect, the Director’s judgement.
The role of independent Directors at the Board is to challenge 
the strategy and scrutinise the performance of management, 
monitor performance of the Company, review the integrity  
of financial information and review the appropriateness  
of the Company’s internal controls and risk management 
system.
Directors’ interests are disclosed in annual declarations  
and the Company Secretary is notified promptly of any 
changes. Before each Board meeting Directors confirm their 
independence and all Directors disclose whether they hold any 
interests in any matters to be reviewed at the Board meeting. 
Mr Yanakov is a representative of Powerboom Investments 
Limited, Ms Grönberg is a representative of Vitalbond Limited, 
A&NN and Capital Management Fund Limited and Mr Duvieusart 
is a representative of PPF Group BV. Mr Nesis is the brother of 
the beneficial owner of Powerboom Investments Limited. Save 
for the potential conflicts inherent in these relationships, there 
are no potential conflicts of interest between any duties owed 
by the Directors or senior management to the Company and 
their private interests or other duties.
 
The Company considers that the Board and its Committees 
have the appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the Company to enable  
them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities 
effectively. All directors have access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary, and are able to take independent 
professional advice, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.

and prudent management; sound planning; a strong system 
of internal control; and compliance with all statutory and 
regulatory obligations;

cease to operate all or any material part of the Group’s 
business; and
 > ensuring a mutual understanding of objectives and

The schedule of matters reserved for the Board is reviewed  
at least annually.
Roles of the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and  
Senior Independent Director
The Board has approved division of responsibilities between 
the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the 
role of the Senior Independent Director (SID). 
The Chairman reports to the Board and is responsible for the 
leadership and overall effectiveness of the Board and setting 
the Board’s agenda. His responsibilities include:
 > effective running of the Board;
 > ensuring there is appropriate delegation of authority from  
the Board to executive management; 
 > promoting a culture of openness and debate by facilitating 
the effective contribution of non-executive Directors in 
particular and ensuring constructive relations between

Mr Godsell’s other significant commitments are as the Chair of 
the board of Optimum Coal Holdings, a Johannesburg listed 
medium size coal mining company, and membership of the 
South African National Planning Commission, a government 
commission. In January 2012 he also accepted a non-executive 
Directorship in the South African state owned Industrial 
Development Corporation, however, the additional time 
commitment required by this additional role will be more than 
offset by the expected termination of his role on the board of 
Optimum Coal Holdings, which is in the process of being 
acquired by Glencore plc. This process should be complete  
by July 2012.
The CEO is responsible for the day-to-day management

customers, employees and other stakeholders;
 > identifying and executing strategic opportunities;
 > regularly reviewing the operational performance and strategic 
direction of the Group;
 > making recommendations on remuneration policies, 
executive remuneration and terms of employment for  
senior employees;
 > ensuring the development needs of the executive Directors 
and senior management are identified and met and ensuring 
effective succession planning; and
 > ensuring effective communication with shareholders and that 
appropriate, timely and accurate information is disclosed to 
the market, with issues escalated promptly to the executive 
management and the Board.
Senior Independent Director
Charles Balfour acts as the Board’s Senior Independent  
Director. Mr Balfour is available to shareholders and as an 
intermediary for the other directors if necessary. He attends 
meetings with a range of major shareholders to listen to  
their views in order to help develop a balanced understanding  
of the issues and concerns of major shareholders. Meetings 
between independent Directors, including Mr Balfour, and  
major shareholders took place in 2011 prior to the admission  
of the Company on the LSE and year end. Arrangements have 
been made for such meetings to take place in 2012.

78 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1
The responsibilities of the Audit and Risk Committee comprise:
 > monitoring the integrity of the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements and reviewing its annual and interim financial 
statements, including, but not limited to the consistency of, 
and any changes to, accounting and treasury policies across 
the Company and the Group; the methods used to account 
for significant or unusual transactions; the reasonableness of 
significant estimates and judgements, taking into account the 
views of the external auditor; and the clarity and completeness 
of disclosure in the consolidated financial statements;
 > considering and making recommendations to the Board, to 
be put to the shareholders to consider at the annual general 
meeting, in relation to the appointment, re-appointment, 
resignation or removal of the Group’s external auditors;
 > overseeing the Group’s relationship with its external auditors 
and reviewing the effectiveness of the external audit process; 
The Committee meets with the external auditors at least 
once a year without management being present, to discuss 
their remit and any issues arising from the audit;
 > reviewing the independence of external auditors and 
the appropriateness of the provision of any non-audit 
services by the external auditor;
 > reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
controls and risk management systems;
 > monitoring and review of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal audit function in the context of the Group’s overall 
risk management system; and
 > reviewing the Group’s policies and procedures for preventing 
and detecting fraud, the systems and controls in place for 
preventing bribery, and its policies for ensuring that the 
Group complies with relevant regulatory and legal 
requirements. 
Full terms of reference of the Audit and Risk Committee 
are available at the Company’s website:  
www.polymetalinternational.com 
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving 
the interim and annual financial statements remains with the 
Board. The Committee gives due consideration to applicable 
laws and regulations, the provisions of the UK Code and the 
requirements of the Listing Rules. In 2011 the Audit and Risk 
Committee dealt with the following matters:
 > reviewed and approved financial and risk information 
included in the prospectus, working capital model,  
Financial Reporting Procedures and Long Form Report;
 > reviewed JSC Polymetal’s results for the six months  
to 30 June 2011;
 > discussed and approved the Committee work plan;
 > approved Deloitte LLP as external auditors;
 > discussed and recommended for approval by the Board 
policies for compliance with the UK Bribery Act;
 > reviewed the Group’s internal audit plan;
 > reviewed the Group’s external audit plan.
The Audit and Risk Committee monitors the Company’s 
relationship with external auditors relating to the provision  
of non-audit services to ensure that auditor objectivity and 
independence is safeguarded. This is achieved by disclosure  
of the extent and nature of non-audit services (see note 14  
to the consolidated financial statements) and the prohibition of 
selected services being provided by the external auditor.  
The Audit and Risk Committee has considered information 
pertaining to the balance between fees for audit and non-audit 
work for the Company in 2011 and concluded that the nature 
and extent of non-audit fees do not present a threat to the 
external auditor’s objectivity or independence.
The appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Group’s external 
auditors following the listing in 2011 (with Deloitte CIS having 
been auditors of JSC Polymetal since the last tendering 
process in 2008) is kept under annual review by the Audit  
and Risk Committee.
The Committee’s assessment of the external auditors’ 
performance and independence underpins its 
recommendation to the Board to propose to shareholders the 
re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as auditors until the conclusion 
of the AGM in 2013. Resolutions to authorise the Board to 
re-appoint and determine their remuneration will be proposed 
at the AGM on 13 June 2012.
The Board considers that the Audit and Risk Committee 
complies with the requirements of the UK Code.
Internal control and risk management
The Company aims to ensure that all its activities are 
adequately controlled to mitigate risk and support the 
achievement of its objectives, while avoiding the creation 
of excessive bureaucracy. The system of internal controls 
is designed to manage rather than completely eliminate 
the risk to achieve the Company’s business objectives 
in order to bring the residual risk to an acceptable level.
In conducting its annual review of the effectiveness of risk 
management, the Board considers the key findings from the 
ongoing monitoring and reporting processes, management 
assertions and independent assurance reports. The Board 
also takes account of material changes and trends in the risk 
profile and considers whether the control system, including 
reporting, adequately supports the Board in achieving its risk 
management objectives.
 
During the course of the year the Board considered the Group’s 
responsiveness to changes within its business environment.  
The Board is satisfied that there is an ongoing process, which

Corporate Governance
continued Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1 79
Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
Internal audit
The internal audit function supports this aim by providing 
the Directors, through the Audit and Risk Committee, with  
an objective evaluation of the Company’s and the Group’s 
governance framework. The internal audit function also aims 
to raise levels of understanding and awareness of risk and 
control throughout the Group.
The head of internal audit reports to the CEO and, through  
the Audit and Risk Committee, to the Board of Directors. Where 
relevant, the internal audit function will additionally report its 
findings to members of the Company’s executive management.
The internal audit’s annual work plan is designed to focus 
on matters arising from the operational risk matrix and is 
approved by the Audit and Risk Committee in advance.
The internal audit function uses an annual self-certification 
process, which requires managers throughout the Group 
to personally confirm the testing of internal controls and 
compliance with Group policies within their business or  
function and the steps taken to address actual or potential 
issues that are identified.
Management provides a timely response to issues raised 
by internal audit. Where possible, the issues are resolved  
within one reporting period.
Internal control framework and activities
The management structure of the Group and internal policies 
and procedures are aimed at maintaining a robust control 
framework within the Group which will result in achievement  
of strategic objectives within the set risk tolerance levels.  
This framework includes:
 > appropriate tone set from the top from the Board level, 
aimed at building the appropriate control environment;
 > proper risk identification and management system  
(for more detail please refer to page 60);
 > strict division of responsibilities and adequate  
delegation of authority;
 > specific control activities implemented at all levels  
of the Group; and
 > periodic review of effectiveness of controls.
The governance framework reflects the specific structure  
and management of the Group, where authority and control  
are delegated by the Board to different levels, from the 
Chief Executive to the managers of the Group’s operating 
entities and then downward to business and project managers 
as appropriate. 
Within this framework, authority is delegated within clearly 
prescribed limits and decisions are escalated where either 
project size or risk profile require a higher level of authority.
The Board confirms that the actions it considers necessary  
have been or are being taken to remedy any failings or 
weaknesses in the Group’s system of internal controls,  
which it has determined to be significant from its review  
of that system. This has involved considering the matters 
reported to it and developing plans and programmes that  
it considers are reasonable in the circumstances.
UK Bribery Act 2010
The Company and Directors are committed to ensuring 
adherence to the highest legal and ethical standards.  
This must be reflected in every aspect of the way in which the 
Group operates. Bribery is a criminal offence in the countries  
in which the Group operates, and corrupt acts expose the 
Group and its employees to the risk of prosecution, fines  
and imprisonment, as well as endangering the Company’s 
reputation. The Group has adopted anti-bribery policies, which 
extend across all of Group’s business dealings in all countries 
and territories in which the Group operates and apply to 
employees of the Group as well as relevant business partners 
and other necessary individuals and entities. The Board 
attaches the utmost importance to this policy and applies  
a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to acts of bribery and corruption by 
any of the Group’s employees or by business partners working 
on the Group’s behalf and prohibits the payment, offer or 
authorisation of bribes, the receipt or acceptance of a bribe, and 
the payment, offer or promise to pay any facilitating payments. 
Any breach of this policy is regarded as a serious matter by the 
Company and is likely to result in disciplinary action.
As part of implementation of internal procedures to comply with 
the UK Bribery Act, the Group has implemented a formalised 
whistle-blowing policy which describes processes in place for 
staff to communicate, in confidence, concerns about possible 
improprieties, unethical or illegal activities and ensures that 
arrangements are in place for independent investigation of  
such matters.
Copies of the Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy and the 
whistle-blowing policy are available on request from the 
Company’s offices. Governance

The Company’s and the Group’s policy is to set the terms  
of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of  
each transaction, ensure that the suppliers are made aware  
of the terms of payment and abide by the agreed terms of 
payment. Polymetal International plc is a holding company  
and therefore did not have any material trade creditors as

Charitable and political donations
The Company may not make a political donation to a political  
party or other political organisation, or to an independent election 
candidate, or incur any political expenditure, unless such donation 
or expenditure is authorised by an ordinary resolution of 
shareholders and is passed before the donation is made or  
the expenditure incurred.
Many of the regions in which the Group operates are 
considered socially and economically undeveloped areas of 
Russia and Kazakhstan. The Group pursues a responsible 
social strategy in those regions and views the implementation 
of long-term social programmes as a key factor in the 
sustainability of the Group’s operations.
The Group’s social programmes focus on the social and 
economic development priorities in the regions in which  
it operates and aims to improve education and healthcare, 
develop local infrastructure, promote sports and healthy 
lifestyles, promote the cultural and artistic potential of the  
local population and support local minorities.
As part of this social programme, the Group has entered into 
social partnership agreements with municipalities and regional 
governments. Under these social partnership agreements,  
the Group organises and finances a variety of humanitarian 
projects and development and maintenance projects in these 
communities. In addition, the Group also undertakes various 
social projects in accordance with the agreements with the 
public organisations of indigenous minorities of the north  
of Russia (‘IMN’) and in accordance with the Group’s own 
charitable programmes. More detail on these activities can 
be found on pages 64 to 71 of this Annual Report.
In 2011, the Group spent US$4.0 million on social and 
community projects (2010: US$3.9 million).
Capital structure
The structure of the Company’s share capital is detailed 
in Note 31 to the financial statements.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding or on 
the transfer of shares, which are both regulated by the Articles 
of Association of the Company and applicable legislation.  
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between 
holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions 
on the transfer of shares or on voting rights. Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1 81
Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the company such as 
commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, and employees’ 
share plans. None of these is considered to be significant  
in terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group  
as a whole. Furthermore, the Directors are not aware of any 
agreements between the Company and its Directors or 
employees that provide for compensation for loss of office  
or employment, that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
Substantial shareholdings in the Company are disclosed  
on page 147.
Details of employee option schemes are set out in the 
Remuneration report on pages 82 to 85.
There were no acquisitions of the Company’s own shares in 
2011, other than the 3,305,988 shares that were repurchased 
and cancelled out at a cost of 920 pence per ordinary share  
in December 2011 as part of the provision of stabilisation 
mechanism following the listing. At 31 December 2011 the 
Group and its subsidiaries legally held no treasury shares.  
In the financial statements the Group present treasury shares  
in JSC Polymetal. These were legally sold under a sale and 
repurchase arrangement for which the accounting treatment 
has been to continue to recognise the treasury shares. As at 
31 December 2011, the Company did not have any shareholder 
authorities to purchase its own shares.
Articles of the Company can be altered from time to time by 
special resolution of the Company. A resolution is a special 
resolution, when it is passed by three-fourths of the members 
who (being entitled to do so) vote in person, or by proxy,  
at a general meeting of the Company.
 
The Board may appoint a person, who is willing to act to be  
a Director, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional Director 
and in either case whether or not for a fixed term. Irrespective 
of the terms of his appointment, a Director so appointed shall 
hold office only until the next following annual general meeting.  
If not re-appointed at such annual general meeting, he shall 
vacate office at its conclusion.
 
The Company may by ordinary resolution remove any Director 
from office (notwithstanding any provision of the Company’s 
Articles of Association or of any agreement between the 
Company and such Director, but without prejudice to any  
claim he may have for damages for breach of any such 
agreement). No special notice needs to be given of any 
resolution to remove a Director and no Director proposed to  
be removed has any special right to protest against his or her 
removal. The Company may, by ordinary resolution, appoint 
another person in place of a Director removed from office.
Dividends

Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of shareholders of the Company 
will take place on 13 June 2012 at 11am BST time in  
Le Hocq Suite, Radisson Blu Waterfront Hotel, Rue De L ’Etau,

the meeting in person.
Auditors
The Directors confirm that at the date of approval of this  
Annual Report:
 > so far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; 
and
 > the Directors have taken all reasonable steps to ascertain any 
relevant audit information and ensure the auditors are aware 
of such information.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue 
in office as auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will be

82 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1
This report sets out the Company’s remuneration policy  
and practice for its Directors and provides details of their 
remuneration and share interests for the year ended 
31 December 2011. Although it is not a requirement of  
Jersey company law to have the Directors’ remuneration  
report approved by shareholders, the Board believes that  
as a Company whose shares are listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, it is an element of good corporate governance  
for it to do so. 
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the  
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes 
how the Board applied the principles relating to the Directors’ 
remuneration in the UK Code. Accordingly, a resolution to 
approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements  
will be put to shareholders for approval. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mr Homeniuk and 
its other members are Mr Best and Mr Balfour. All members 
are independent non-executive Directors.
The principal role of the Remuneration Committee are: 
 > to make recommendations to the Board on the Group’s 
policy on remuneration of executive management; 
 > to determine, within agreed terms of reference, the 
remuneration of the Chairman and of specific remuneration 
packages for each of the Executive Directors, the Company 
Secretary and the members of the senior management, 
including pension rights and any compensation payments;
 > to formulate suitable performance criteria for the 
performance-based pay of the executive management;
 > to review and oversee all aspects of any executive 
share scheme operated by or to be established by 
the Company; and
 > to oversee and advise the Board on any major changes  
in employee benefit structures throughout the Company  
or the Group.
The full Terms of Reference of the Remuneration Committee 
can be found in the Corporate Governance section on the 
Company’s website: www.polymetalinternational.com.
The Committee will meet at least twice a year. In 2011, there 
were no meetings of the Committee as the Company was  
only admitted to trading on the LSE in November 2011. 
However, the business conducted since formation of the 
Remuneration Committee on 29 September 2011 was 
approved by written resolutions of the Remuneration 
Committee. Two meetings of the Committee are scheduled  
in 2012.
The Board considers that the composition of the Remuneration 
Committee complies with the requirements of the UK Code.
Remuneration policy – executive Directors:  
salary, bonuses, share options, long-term  
incentive schemes, pension 
The Company put in place an executive remuneration policy  
for Directors and senior management that is comparable to 
FTSE 100 and other international mining companies in order  
to attract and retain high quality executive talent at the top  
level that will help to maximise shareholder value.
Under the policy, executive remuneration comprises a base 
salary, an annual bonus and participation in a long-term 
Employee Incentive Programme approved by shareholders.  
No pension contributions are funded, other than paid to Vitaly 
Nesis in accordance with Russian law (refer to page 85).
Base salary is reviewed and compared to FTSE 100 and 
international mining companies annually by the Remuneration 
Committee. Salary increases are determined taking into 
account the Company’s performance.
Annual bonus obtainable is a maximum of 150% of the base 
salary and focuses participants on achieving relevant annual 
performance goals, including meeting budget on production, 
total costs, completion of new projects on time  
and within budgets, and safety.
Long-term Employee Incentive Programme
A long-term incentive share option plan is designed to reward 
participants for increasing the share price and delivering 
superior performance over a long-term horizon. 
In September 2010, the Board of JSC Polymetal approved  
the Employee Incentive Programme. The Employee Incentive 
Programme established a bonus fund (the ‘Bonus Fund’), 
consisting of up to 30 million JSC Polymetal shares. The 
shares were to be transferred to participants in the Programme 
(the ‘Participants’) in 2013 or 2014, pursuant to a prescribed 
formula linked to the price of the shares in those years.
On 29 September 2011 and 30 September 2011 respectively, 
the Board of Directors and the Board of JSC Polymetal 
approved several amendments to the Employee Incentive 
Programme, which amongst other matters, provided that 
effective from admission of the Company to the London  
Stock Exchange, all awards made under the Employee 
Incentive Programme will be satisfied by the transfer of  
shares of the Company, rather than shares of JSC Polymetal, 
to the Participants. The Bonus Fund consists of up to  
30 million shares.
Remuneration report  Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1 83
Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
The principal terms of the Employee Incentive Programme,  
are summarised below:
 > participants of the Programme are executive Directors and 
senior employees of the Group selected at the discretion  
of the Board. The Participants, with an indication of the 
percentage of the Bonus Fund due to each Participant, were 
determined by the Board of JSC Polymetal on 8 November 
2010 and further supplemented by decisions of the 
management board of JSC Polymetal. Over 150 employees 
have been selected to participate in the Employee Incentive 
Programme. Of those employees, 76 have received an 
entitlement to 85 per cent of the Bonus Fund pursuant  
to the decision of the Board of JSC Polymetal:
 > the total size of the Bonus Fund is to be determined 
according to a prescribed formula, which is linked to  
share price performance:
 > exercise price: Shares from the Bonus Fund may 
be purchased by Participants at the price of one penny 
per share
 > performance conditions: the number of shares awarded to 
each Participant from the Bonus Fund is based on certain 
non-financial performance criteria, such as job performance 
and career growth potential, all at the discretion of the Board 
or the executive management;
 > the Employee Incentive Programme vesting date is 
11 June 2013 and may, with respect to a particular 
Participant, at such Participant’s discretion, be postponed 
for one year until 11 June 2014; and
 > vesting period, if 2013 is chosen, is 2.5 years which is shorter 
than the three years recommended by the UK Code. See 
Note 32 of the financial statements.
 > Vesting mechanism: in the base case scenario the aggregate 
number of shares comprising the Bonus Fund will be 
determined on June 1 1, 2013 (the ‘Programme Implementation 
Date’) according to the following formula:
BF = M * (X – S) / X, where 
M – Maximum Number of shares; 
X – Average Weighted Price of a share (quotation  
period from 11 December 2012 to 11 June 2013); and
 S – Strike Price (US$16.74 per share) adjusted by  
the amounts of dividends paid. 
E.g., to receive the maximum amount in full, the 
Averaged Weighted Price of a share must be  
US$33.48 ((33.48-16.74)/16.74=1).
The possible deviations from the base case scenario include:
 > extension of the participants’ rights to purchase shares from 
the Bonus Fund by one year (at the sole discretion of each 
participant) until June 11, 2014. In this case, X will be equal to 
the weighted average price of Polymetal shares in US Dollars 
during the quotation from 11 December 2013 to 11 June 2014, 
and S will be equal to US$18.75 per share; and
 > the option to execute the rights to purchase all or part  
of the shares from the Bonus Fund before the Programme 
Implementation Date under certain circumstances, such 
as change of control of the Company. In this case, both 
X and S will be adjusted accordingly.
Each time the dividends upon shares are paid prior to the 
Exercise Date, the Strike shall be reduced by the amount 
calculated according to the following formula:
D*1,12^(T/365), where 
D – dividend paid per share; 
T –  number of calendar days from the date of payment 
of dividends to the relevant Exercise Date.
For the purposes of the relevant calculations, the amounts  
of dividends shall be converted into US Dollars at the relevant 
daily spot exchange rate (XUDLUSS) published by the Bank  
of England on its official website (www.bankofengland.co.uk/) 
for the day the relevant dividends have been paid.
Mr Nesis, as the only Executive Director, is subject to 
the Employee Incentive Programme. None of the non-executive 
Directors are included in the Programme.
Mr Nesis has entered into an appointment letter with the 
Company in relation to his appointment as a Director. The

Articles of Association. Mr Nesis can terminate his appointment 
as a Director on one month’s notice. Mr Nesis is not entitled to 
receive any compensation in respect of his role as Director on 
termination of his appointment as Director.
On 25 July 2008, JSC Polymetal, a subsidiary of the Company 
incorporated in Russia, entered into an employment contract 
with Mr Nesis as its Chief Executive Officer (the general 
director) further to the resolution of the Board of Directors of 
JSC Polymetal dated 23 July 2008, pursuant to which Mr Nesis

to US$352,000 in 2011) per annum under his employment 
contract with JSC Polymetal. The employment contract does 
not contain any specific grounds for early termination, but may 
be terminated prior to its expiration in accordance with the 
Russian labour law.
Save for the Group’s contributions to the mandatory pension 
fund of the Russian Federation during the financial year ended 
31 December 2011, no amounts were set aside or accrued by 
the Group to provide pension, retirement or other benefits to 
the Directors and senior management.  Governance

Chairman, Remuneration Committee 86 Polymetal International plc  Annual Report 201 1
Financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
for use in the European Union (IFRS). The financial statements are required by law to be properly prepared in accordance  
with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for 
each financial year the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation 
of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and 
presentation of financial statements’.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, the Directors 
are also required to:
 > properly select and apply accounting policies;
 > present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
 > provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and 
 > make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK and Jersey governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements  
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 > the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
 > the management report, which is incorporated into the directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of  
Polymetal International plc
We have audited the Group financial statements (the financial statements) of Polymetal International plc for the year ended  
31 December 2011 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity and the related notes 1 to 35. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of  
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes  
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report  
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements: 
 > give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
 > have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by European Union; and
 > have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters, where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report  
to you if, in our opinion:
 > proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or proper returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 > the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
Other matters
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 as if that Act had applied to the Company.
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement, contained within the Directors’ Report, in relation to going concern as if the 
Company had been incorporated in the UK and have nothing to report to you in that respect.

1. General
Formation of the Polymetal International plc Group
Polymetal International plc (the Company) was incorporated on 29 July 2010 as a public limited company under Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991.
On 2 November 2011, the Company was admitted to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and commenced trading on the 
London Stock Exchange’s premium listed market. The Company is the new ultimate parent company of Joint Stock Company 
Polymetal (JSC Polymetal) and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (the JSC Polymetal Group) and owns 83.26% of  
the issued share capital of JSC Polymetal as at 31 December 2011, with 8.11% held by third parties and 8.63% effectively held  
as treasury shares (see Note 31).
On 30 September 2011, PMTL Holding Limited (PMTL), the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, made an offer (known as the 
Institutional Share Swap Facility or the ISSF) to certain institutional shareholders of JSC Polymetal to acquire their JSC Polymetal 
shares and JSC Polymetal GDRs. The ISSF terms provided for the issue of new shares in the Company in exchange for  
JSC Polymetal shares or GDRs on a one for one basis. 
The completion of the ISSF was conditional on the IPO such that 2 November 2011 was the date on which Polymetal 
International plc, via PMTL, acquired control of the JSC Polymetal Group and the enlarged Group (the Group) was formed. 
Polymetal International issued new shares to those investors participating in the ISSF and who tendered these shares to PMTL. 
Polymetal International plc contributed JSC Polymetal shares acquired in course of ISSF as a capital investment in PMTL.
Following completion of the ISSF, PMTL became the owner of more than 50% of the issued share capital of JSC Polymetal  
and, in accordance with Russian law, launched a mandatory tender offer (MTO) for all of the JSC Polymetal shares or GDRs  
not held by it.
The formation of the enlarged Polymetal International Group has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition under IFRS 3 
Business Combinations. Although the ISSF resulted in Polymetal International plc becoming the controlling shareholder of the 
JSC Polymetal Group, for accounting purposes in the consolidated financial statements, JSC Polymetal is treated as the acquirer 
of the Company.
The following accounting treatment has been applied to account for the reverse asset acquisition:
 > the consolidated assets and liabilities of the subsidiary Joint Stock Company Polymetal were recognised and measured  
at their pre-restructuring carrying amounts, without restatement to fair value;
 > the assets and liabilities of the Company are recognized at their fair value and are consolidated from 2 November 2011,  
the date at which the new company was formed;
 > comparative numbers presented in the consolidated financial statements are those reported in the consolidated financial 
statements of Joint Stock Company Polymetal, for the year ended 31 December 2010, except for the presentation of the  
stated capital account, which has been retrospectively restated to reflect the legal issued share capital of the Company as  
the legal parent;
 > the Group’s consolidated income statement and statement of other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 
2011 therefore comprises the results of the JSC Polymetal Group from 1 January 2011 to 1 November 2011 and the results  
of the Group from 2 November 2011 to 31 December 2011. The Group’s retained earnings and other reserves shown in the 
balance sheet as at 31 December 2011 and the statement of changes in equity are the effective 91.1% share (after excluding 
treasury shares) in the equity of the JSC Polymetal Group acquired by the Company on formation of the Group on 2 November 
2011 plus the subsequent equity movements of the Group in the period to 31 December 2011.
 > the open MTO offer represents an unavoidable obligation to transfer cash to any persons taking up the offer. In accordance 
with IAS 32 Financial Statements: Presentation a US$561.7 million Rouble-denominated liability was recognised at  
2 November 2011, with a corresponding debit recognised in reserves. At 31 December the liability was retranslated  
at the year end exchange rate to US$534.6 million with the movement recognised within the Translation reserve.

the ultimate beneficial owner of which is Mr Oleg Shuliakovskii (4.27%). No other parties control more than 3% of the Company 
shares. There were no changes to the Significant shareholders’ ownerships as of 1 April 2012.
Going concern
In assessing its going concern status, the Group has taken account of its financial position, anticipated future trading performance, 
its borrowings and other available credit facilities and its capital expenditure commitments and plans. It has also considered  
the US$534 million payment made in February 2012 for the purchase of JSC Polymetal shares not participating in the Group 
reconstruction under the Mandatory Tender Offer and the further payment expected in June 2012 to purchase the remaining 
JSC Polymetal shares under the Squeeze Out (meaning the compulsory acquisition of JSC Polymetal Shares under Russian law), 
together with the risks facing the Group.
The Board is satisfied that the Group’s forecasts and projections, having taken account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance, show that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least the next  
12 months from the date of this document and that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these 
consolidated financial statements.
Basis of presentation
The Group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 are prepared in accordance  
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and 
endorsed by the European Union. IFRS includes the standards and interpretations approved by the IASB including International 
Accounting Standards (IAS) and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC).
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments which are 
measured at fair value. 
The accounting policies set out in Note 2 have been applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2011. The Group used IFRS, effective as at 31 December 2011, in preparation of these Consolidated 
financial statements.
Standards and Interpretations in issue not yet adopted
The following new or amended IFRS accounting standards not yet adopted are expected to have a significant impact on 
the Group:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement reflects the first phase of the IASB’s three stage project to replace 
IAS 39. The first phase deals with the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard 
applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. Financial statements

IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements  
that addresses accounting for consolidated financial statements and SIC-12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 
provides a single basis for consolidation with a new definition of control. The standard applies to annual periods beginning on  
or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly-controlled Entities – Non-monetary 
Contributions by Venturers. Under IFRS 11 a joint arrangement is classified as either a joint operation or a joint venture, and the 
option to proportionately consolidate joint ventures has been removed. Interests in joint ventures must be equity accounted.  
This standard applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities will accompany IFRS 10 and IFRS 11. This standard combines the disclosure 
requirements previously covered by IAS 27 , related to consolidated financial statements, IAS 31 Interest in Joint Ventures and  
IAS 28 Investments in Associates, as well as including additional disclosure requirements. This standard applies to annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine provides a model for accounting for costs associated  
with the removal of waste during the production phase of a surface mine, including guidance on the apportionment of the costs 
incurred for obtaining a current and future benefit and how capitalised costs are depreciated. This interpretation applies to annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
The following new, amended or revised IFRS accounting standards and interpretations not yet adopted are not expected to have 
a significant impact on the Group:
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement provides a single framework for all fair value measurements and applies to annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
An amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements which requires items to be grouped in other comprehensive 
income based on whether those items are subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. The amendment is to be applied for  
annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012.
An amendment to IAS 12 Income taxes is to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012.
An amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits is to be applied retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2013.
Amendments have been made to IAS 27 and it has been reissued as IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements. The revised 
standard prescribes the accounting and disclosure requirements for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates 
when an entity prepares separate financial statements. The accounting and disclosure requirements for investments in 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in consolidated financial statements are prescribed by IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12. 
The revised standard is to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. Amendments have been made  
to IAS 28 and it has been reissued as IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. The revised standard prescribes the 
application of the equity method when accounting for investments in associates and joint ventures. The revised standard is to be 
applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures  
is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011.
2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and,  
if applicable, special purpose entities, from the date that control effectively commenced until the date that control effectively 
ceased. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity  
so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line  
with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-Group balances, transactions and any unrealised profits or losses arising from intra-Group transactions are eliminated  
on consolidation.
Changes to the Group’s ownership interests that do not result in a loss of control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as 
equity transactions. The carrying amount of the Group’s interests and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change 
in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted 
and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Parent.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements  
continued Polymetal International plc  Annual Report 201 1 95
Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on the disposal is calculated as the difference between 1)  
the aggregated fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and 2) the previous carrying 
amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and non-controlling interests.
For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, non-controlling interests are initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion  
of the fair values of net assets recognised at acquisition. Thereafter, a share of the profit or loss for the financial year and other 
movements in the net assets or liabilities of the subsidiary is attributed to the non-controlling interests as shown in the income 
statement and balance sheet.
Business combinations
IFRS 3 Business Combinations applies to a transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination.  
When acquiring new entities or assets, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed constitute an integrated set of activities, whether the integrated set is capable of being conducted and managed  
as a business by a market participant, and thus whether the transaction constitutes a business combination, using the guidance 
provided in the standard. Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for  
each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred  
or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs  
are recognised in the consolidated income statement as incurred. Transaction costs incurred in connection with the business 
combination are expensed. Provisional fair values are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition may include an asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration 
transferred in a business combination. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition 
retrospectively with the corresponding adjustment against goodwill where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. 
Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement 
period about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. The measurement period may not exceed one year 
from the effective date of the acquisition. The subsequent accounting for contingent consideration that does not qualify for  
as a measurement period adjustment is based on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration  
that is classified as equity is not subsequently remeasured. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or liability is 
remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  
or IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement with the corresponding amount being recognised in profit or loss.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the 
acquisition date, except that:
 > deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured 
in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
 > liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment 
arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in 
accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment at the acquisition date; and
 > assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured 
to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date 
that have previously been recognised in equity are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that 
interest was disposed of.
Goodwill and goodwill impairment
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in 
the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the 
acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, 
the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in  
the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating 
units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that 
the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment 
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit 
pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed 
in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. Financial statements

2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Acquisition of mining licences
The acquisition of mining licences is often effected through a non-operating corporate entity. As these entities do not represent  
a business, it is considered that the transactions do not meet the definition of a business combination and accordingly the 
transaction is accounted for as the acquisition of an asset. The net assets acquired are accounted for at cost.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint 
venture. Significant influence constitutes the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee 
but does not extend to a not control or joint control over the enactment of those policies. The results and assets and liabilities  
of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Interests in joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject 
to joint control (i.e. when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities of the joint venture require 
the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control). Joint venture arrangements that involve the establishment of a separate 
entity in which each venturer has an interest are referred to as jointly controlled entities. The Group reports its interests in jointly 
controlled entities using the equity method of accounting.
Equity method of accounting
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity (investee) is initially recognised in the 
consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income of the investee. When the Group’s share of the losses of an associate exceeds the Group’s interest  
in that entity, the Group ceases to recognise its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent  
that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of an investee recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the 
carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The requirements of IAS 39 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect to 
the Group’s investments. Where an indicator of impairment exists or the carrying value of the asset contains goodwill with an 
indefinite useful life, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance  
with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets (IAS 36) as a single cash generating unit through the comparison of its recoverable amount 
(the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised forms part  
of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36.
When a Group entity transacts with its investees, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the investee are 
recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not related  
to the Group.
Functional and presentation currency
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment  
in which it operates. For all Russian entities the functional currency is the Russian Rouble (RUB). The investment holding 
companies, including Polymetal International plc, also have a Rouble functional currency as they are in substance an extension  
of the Russian group and have significant Rouble-denominated intercompany loans in most cases. The functional currency  
of the Group’s entity located in Kazakhstan and operating with significant degree of autonomy is the Kazakh Tenge (KZT).
The Group has chosen to present its consolidated financial statements in US Dollars (US$), as management believes it is a more 
convenient presentation currency for international users of the consolidated financial statements of the Group as it is a common 
presentation currency in the mining industry. The translation of the financial statements of the Group entities from their functional 
currencies to the presentation currency is performed as follows:
 > all assets and liabilities are translated at closing exchange rates at each reporting period end date;
 > all income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the periods presented, except for significant 
transactions that are translated at rates on the date of such transactions;
 > resulting exchange differences are included in equity and presented as movements relating to the effect of translation to the 
Group’s presentation currency within the Translation reserve; and
 > in the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash balances at the beginning and end of each reporting period presented  
are translated using exchange rates prevalent at those respective dates. All cash flows in the period are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the periods presented, except for significant transactions that are translated at rates on the date  
of transaction.

Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving 
loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of joint control over a jointly controlled 
entity that includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a 
foreign operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners  
of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss.
In the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign 
operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are  
not recognised in the consolidated income statement. For all other partial disposals (i.e. reductions in the Group’s ownership 
interest in associates or jointly controlled entities that do not result in the Group losing significant influence or joint control),  
the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to the consolidated income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets and liabilities acquired arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation 
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each 
reporting period. Exchange differences arising are recognised in equity.
Exchange rates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements were as follows:
31 December 
2011
31 December 
2010
Russian Rouble/US Dollar
Year end 32.20 30.48
Average for the year 29.39 30.36
Kazakh Tenge/US Dollar
Year Period end 148.40 147.40
Average for the year 146.60 147.35
The Rouble and Kazakh Tenge are not freely convertible currencies outside the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan and, 
accordingly, any translation of Rouble and Kazakh Tenge denominated assets and liabilities into US Dollar for the purpose of  
the presentation of consolidated financial statements does not imply that the Group could or will in the future realise or settle  
in US Dollars the translated values of these assets and liabilities.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currencies (foreign currencies) are recorded at the exchange rates 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. All monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at 
the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Non-monetary items carried at historical cost are translated at the exchange 
rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Non-monetary items carried at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing 
on the date on which the most recent fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising from changes in exchange rates 
are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Property, plant and equipment
Mining assets
Mining assets and leases include the cost of acquiring and developing mining assets and mineral rights. Mining assets are 
depreciated to their residual values using the unit-of-production method based on proved and probable ore reserves under  
the Russian Resource Reporting Code (GKZ), which is the basis on which the Group’s mine plans are prepared. Changes in 
proved and probable reserves are dealt with prospectively. Depreciation is charged on new mining ventures from the date that 
the mining asset is capable of commercial production. In respect of those mining assets whose useful lives are expected to be 
less than the life of the mine, depreciation over the period of the asset’s useful life is applied. The difference in the depreciation 
charge which would have been applied had the Group based the depreciation expense on JORC reserves is considered to  
be immaterial. When there is little likelihood of a mineral right being exploited, or the value of the exploitable mineral right has 
diminished below cost, an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Capital construction-in-progress assets are measured at cost less any recognised impairment. Depreciation commences  
when the assets are ready for their intended use. Mineral exploration and evaluation costs, including geophysical, topographical, 
geological and similar types of costs, are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that a mineral property can  
be economically developed as a result of established proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred in exploration and 
development of such property, including costs to further delineate the ore body are capitalised.
Non-mining assets are depreciated to their residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. When parts  
of an item of property, plant and equipment are considered to have different useful lives, they are accounted for and depreciated 
separately. Depreciation methods, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed at least annually.
Estimated useful lives are as set out below:
Machinery and equipment Up to 20 years
Transportation and other assets Up to 15 years Financial statements
98 Polymetal International plc  Annual Report 201 1
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with  
the asset’s carrying amount at the date. The gain or loss arising is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Stripping costs
When it has been determined that a mining asset can be economically developed as a result of established proven and probable 
reserves, the costs to remove any overburden and other waste materials to initially expose the ore body, referred to as stripping 
costs, are capitalised as a part of mining assets.
Post-production stripping costs are recognised as a component of inventory and included in cost of sales in the same period  
as the revenue from the sales of inventory is recognised.
Estimated ore reserves
Estimated proved and probable ore reserves reflect the economically recoverable quantities which can be legally recovered  
in the future from known mineral deposits. The Group’s reserves are estimated in accordance with GKZ and the JORC Code.
Leases
Finance leases
Leases under which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. 
Assets subject to finance leases are capitalised as property, plant and equipment at the lower of fair value or present value  
of future minimum lease payments at the date of acquisition, with the related lease obligation recognised at the same value. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their estimated economic useful lives or over the term of the lease,  
if shorter. If there is reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the period of 
expected use is useful life of the asset.
Finance lease payments are calculated using the effective interest rate method, and allocated between the lease finance cost, 
which is included in finance cost, and the capital repayment, which reduces the related lease liability payable to the lessor.
Operating leases
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals arising 
under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
An impairment review of property, plant and equipment is carried out when there is an indication that those assets have suffered 
an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the carrying amount of the asset is compared to the estimated recoverable 
amount of the asset in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the 
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which  
the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the 
recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount  
of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense 
immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to  
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed  
the original carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately.
Inventories
Metal inventories
Inventories including refined metals, metals in concentrate and in process, doré and ore stockpiles are stated at the lower of 
production cost or net realisable value. Production cost is determined as the sum of the applicable expenditures and expenses 
incurred directly or indirectly in bringing inventories to their existing condition and location. Refined metals are valued at the 
average total cost of production per saleable unit of metal. Work in-process, metal concentrate and doré are valued at the 
average total production costs at each asset’s relevant stage of production. Ore stockpiles are valued at the average cost  
of mining ore.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for that product based on prevailing spot metal prices, less estimated 
costs to complete production and selling costs.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements  
continued Polymetal International plc  Annual Report 201 1 99
Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
Consumables and spare parts
Consumables and spare parts are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined on the weighted average 
moving cost. The portion of consumables and spare parts not reasonably expected to be used within one year is classified as  
a long-term asset in the Group’s consolidated balance sheet. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to  
the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate,  
on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Financial Instruments Designated as Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)
A financial instrument other than a financial instrument held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
 > such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise; or
 > the financial instrument forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its 
performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment 
strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or
 > it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial instruments at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or 
loss. Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 29.
Financial assets
The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and of allocating interest 
income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts  
or payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction 
costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter 
period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Effective interest rate method
Non-derivative financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: FVTPL, available for sale (AFS) financial 
assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is 
determined at the time of initial recognition. No financial instruments have been classified as available for sale.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for financial instruments other than those financial assets classified as at FVTPL.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. 
Interest income is determined by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of 
interest would be immaterial.
AFS financial assets
Investments other than those classified as held for trading, held-to-maturity or loans and receivables are classified as available  
for sale financial assets. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and unrealised gains and losses are recognised  
in equity until the investment is disposed or impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity  
is included in the consolidated income statement.
When an available for sale financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss in the period.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. 
Financial assets are considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that 
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. 
For equity investments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is 
considered to be objective evidence of impairment. Financial statements
100 Polymetal International plc  Annual Report 201 1
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
For all other financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include:
 > significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
 > breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
 > it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation; or
 > the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment loss recognised is the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective 
interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception  
of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable  
is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written 
off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement.
For financial assets measured at amortised cost, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and 
the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed through the consolidated income statement to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment 
at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not  
been recognised.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it 
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group 
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, 
the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise  
the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities (including borrowings) are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they 
expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable 
is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to certain risks. Further details  
of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note 29.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the 
timing of the recognition in the consolidated income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics 
are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the hybrid contracts are not measured at FVTPL.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets  
is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.

Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, cash deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities  
of three months or fewer, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk  
of changes in value.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event,  
it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount  
of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the 
reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using 
the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
Environmental obligations
An obligation to incur environmental restoration, rehabilitation and decommissioning costs arises when disturbance is caused  
by the development or ongoing production of mining assets. Such costs arising from the decommissioning of plant and other 
site preparation work, discounted to their net present value using a risk-free rate applicable to the future cash flows, are provided 
for and capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are recognised 
in the consolidated income statement over the life of the operation, through the depreciation of the asset in the cost of sales line 
and the unwinding of the discount on the provision in the finance costs line. Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage 
which is created on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at their net present values and recognised in the 
consolidated income statement as extraction progresses.
Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site preparation work (that result from 
changes in the estimated timing or amount of the cash flow or a change in the discount rate), are added to or deducted from the 
cost of the related asset in the current period. If a decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess is 
recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
The provision for closure cost obligations is remeasured at the end of each reporting period for changes in estimates and 
circumstances. Changes in estimates and circumstances include changes in legal or regulatory requirements, increased 
obligations arising from additional mining and exploration activities, changes to cost estimates and changes to the risk free 
interest rate.
Employee benefit obligations
Remuneration paid to employees in respect of services rendered during a reporting period is recognised as an expense in that 
reporting period. The Group pays mandatory contributions to the state social funds, including the Pension Fund of the Russian 
Federation and Kazakhstan, which are expensed as incurred.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Income taxes are computed in 
accordance with the laws of countries where the Group operates.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the 
consolidated income statement because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in  
a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and 
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible 
temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected  
to reverse in the foreseeable future. Financial statements
102 Polymetal International plc  Annual Report 201 1
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that  
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is 
settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of  
the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from 
the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets 
and liabilities.
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except when they relate to items that are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred 
tax also recognised in consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current tax  
or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the 
business combination.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is derived principally from the sale of gold and silver bullions and copper, gold and silver concentrate and is measured 
at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts.
Revenue from the sale of gold and silver bullion and sale of copper gold and silver concentrate is recognised when the risks and 
rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer, the Group retains neither a continuing degree of involvement nor control over 
the goods sold, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with 
the transaction will flow to the Group. Revenue from the sale of gold and silver bullion represents the invoiced value of metal 
shipped to the buyer, net of value added tax (VAT).
Sale of gold and silver bullion
The Group processes doré produced in the Russian Federation (at Dukat, Khakanja, Voro, and Omolon) into London Good 
Delivery Bars prior to sale. This final stage of processing is carried out on a toll-treatment basis at four state-owned refineries. 
The Group sells gold and silver bullion to banks through long-term agreements. The sales price, as determined in the agreement, 
may be variable based upon the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) spot price or fixed but the Group’s policy is not to 
enter into fixed price contracts. For domestic sales, title passes from the Group to the purchaser at the refinery gate with revenue 
recognised at that point. For export sales, once the gold and/or silver bars have been approved for export by Russian customs, 
they are then transported to the vault of the purchaser, which is typically located in London. Title passes and revenue is 
recognised at the point when the gold and/or silver bars are received by the purchaser.
Sales of copper, gold and silver concentrate
The Group sells copper, gold and silver concentrate under pricing arrangements where final prices are determined by quoted 
market prices in a period subsequent to the date of sale. Concentrate sales are initially recorded based on forward prices for  
the expected date of final settlement. Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment, which is also when risks and rewards pass  
to the buyer. Revenue is calculated based on the copper, gold and silver content in the concentrate and using the forward 
London Metal Bulletin (LMB) or London Metal Exchange (LME) price to the estimated final pricing date, adjusted for the specific 
terms of the relevant agreement. Until final settlement occurs, adjustments to revenue are made to take into account the changes 
in metal quantities upon receipt of new information and assay. Revenue is presented net of refining and treatment charges which 
are subtracted in calculating the amount to be invoiced.
The Group’s sales of copper, gold and silver concentrate are based on a provisional price and as such, contain an embedded 
derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable 
from the sale of the concentrate at the forward exchange price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not 
qualify for hedge accounting, is measured at FVTPL with changes in its fair value recognised within revenue 
in the consolidated income statement for each period prior to the final settlement.
Share-based compensation
The Group applies IFRS 2 Share-based Payments to its accounting for share-based compensation. IFRS 2 requires companies 
to recognise compensation costs for share-based payments to employees based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
The fair value of share-based payments is calculated by the Group at the grant date using the two-stage Monte-Carlo simulation 
model. The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards.
The fair value of the awards granted is recognised as a general and administrative expense over the vesting period with a 
corresponding increase in the share-based compensation reserve. Where relevant, the proceeds received on exercise of the 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements  
continued Polymetal International plc  Annual Report 201 1 103
Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
awards, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to the stated capital account, and the amounts recognised 
within the share-based compensation reserve transferred to retained earnings.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share calculations are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. 
Diluted earnings per share are calculated using the treasury stock method, whereby the proceeds from the potential exercise  
of dilutive stock options with exercise prices that are below the average market price of the underlying shares are assumed  
to be used in purchasing the Company’s common shares at their average market price for the period.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see below), that the management has made  
in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised 
in consolidated financial statements.
Production start date
The Group assesses the stage of each mine construction project to determine when a mine moves into the production stage. 
The criteria used to assess the start date are determined by the unique nature of each mine construction project and include 
factors such as the complexity of a plant and its location.
The Group considers various relevant criteria to assess when the mine is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
and moves into the production stage. Criteria considered but are not limited to the following:
 > the level of capital expenditure incurred compared to the construction cost estimates;
 > the completion of a sufficient level of testing on the mine plant and equipment;
 > the ability to produce gold and silver in saleable form (within specifications); and
 > the ability to sustain ongoing commercial level of production of gold.
When a mine construction project moves into the production stage and depreciation commences, the capitalisation of certain 
mine construction costs and interest ceases and costs are either regarded as inventory or expensed, except for capitalisable 
costs related to mining asset additions or improvements, underground mine development or ore reserve development.
Acquisitions
IFRS 3 Business Combinations applies to a transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination.  
When acquiring new entities or assets, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed constitute an integrated set of activities and thus whether the transaction constitutes a business combination, using the 
guidance provided in the standard. In making this determination, management evaluates the inputs, processes and outputs of 
the asset or entity acquired. 
As a result of this evaluation process, management has determined that its 2011 acquisitions of Kutynskaya GGK LLC, Industriya 
LLC and Office LLC did not meet the definition of a business combination and as such the Group has accounted for these 
transactions as asset acquisitions (see Note 4). Such purchases are recorded at cost, allocated across the assets and liabilities 
acquired pro-rata to their fair values.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Group’s management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. The determination of estimates requires judgements which are based on historical experience, current and 
expected economic conditions, and all other available information. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the 
reporting period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial period.
The most significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to:
 > fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations;
 > ore reserve estimates;
 > depreciation;
 > impairment of goodwill, mining assets and other property, plant and equipment;
 > inventory obsolescence and write-downs;
 > share-based compensation;
 > environmental obligations;
 > contingencies; and
 > income taxes. Financial statements
104 Polymetal International plc  Annual Report 201 1
3. Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations
In accordance with the Group’s policy, the Group allocates the cost of the acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed based on their fair values as estimated on the date of acquisition. Any difference between the cost of the acquired 
entity and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Group exercises significant 
judgement in the process of identifying tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, valuing these assets and liabilities, and 
estimating their remaining useful lives. The valuation of these assets and liabilities is based on assumptions and criteria that,  
in some cases, include management’s estimates of discounted future cash flows. 
If actual results are not consistent with estimates and assumptions considered, the Group may have to adjust its estimates of the 
fair values of assets and liabilities recognised and the goodwill balance during the measurement period. Such a remeasurement 
could have an impact on the amounts reported in the consolidated income statement in current and future periods.
Ore reserve estimates
An ore reserve estimate is an estimate of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the  
Group’s properties. Ore reserve estimates are used by the Group in the calculation of: depletion of mining assets using  
the units-of-production method; impairment charges and in forecasting the timing of the payment of decommissioning and  
land restoration costs. Also, for the purpose of impairment review and the assessment of the timing of the payment of 
decommissioning and land restoration costs, management may take into account mineral resources in addition to ore reserves 
where there is a high degree of confidence that such resources will be extracted.
In order to calculate ore reserves, estimates and assumptions are required about geological, technical and economic factors, 
including quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, 
commodity prices, discount rates and exchange rates. Estimating the quantity and/or grade of ore reserves requires the size, 
shape and depth of ore bodies to be determined by analysing geological data such as the logging and assaying of drill samples. 
This process may require complex and difficult geological judgements and calculations to interpret the data.
Ore reserve estimates may change from period to period as additional geological data becomes available during the course of 
operations or if there are changes in any of the aforementioned assumptions. Such changes in estimated reserves may affect  
the Group’s financial results and financial position in a number of ways, including the following:
 > asset carrying values due to changes in estimated future cash flows;
 > depletion charged in the consolidated income statement where such charges are determined by using the units-of-
production method;
 > provisions for decommissioning and land restoration costs where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations about  
the timing of the payment of such costs; and
 > carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities where changes in estimated reserves affect the carrying value of the relevant 
assets and liabilities.
Depreciation
Mining assets are depreciated using the units-of-production method except where the useful lives of the assets are shorter than 
the life of mine. The units-of-production depreciation calculations are based on proved and probable reserves under the Russian 
Resource Reporting Code (GKZ), which is the basis on which management’s mine plans are prepared. For other property,  
plant and equipment, the straight-line method is applied over the estimated useful life of the asset which does not exceed the 
estimated mine life based on proved and probable ore reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited  
to the life of the relevant mine. 
 
The calculation of the units-of-production rate of depreciation could be impacted to the extent that actual production in the future 
is different from current forecast production based on proved and probable ore reserves. This would generally arise when there 
are significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in estimating ore reserves. The Group’s units-of-production 
depreciation rates are based on the GKZ reserves figures which are different to the reserves calculated under the JORC 
reporting code and included into the Group’s external reporting.
Impairment of goodwill, mining assets and other property, plant and equipment
The Group considers both external and internal sources of information in assessing whether there are any indications that goodwill, 
mining assets or other property, plant and equipment owned by the Group are impaired. External sources of information the Group 
considers include changes in the market, economic and legal environment in which the Group operates that are not within its 
control and that affect the recoverable amount of goodwill, mining assets or other property, plant and equipment.
Internal sources of information the Group considers include the manner in which mining properties and plant and equipment  
are being used or expected to be used and indications of economic performance of the assets. In determining the recoverable 
amounts of the Group’s mining assets and other property, plant and equipment, the Group’s management makes estimates  
of the discounted future after-tax cash flows expected to be derived from the Group’s mining properties, costs to sell the  
mining properties and the appropriate discount rate. Reductions in metal price forecasts, increases in estimated future costs of 
production, increases in estimated future capital costs, reductions in the amount of recoverable reserves and resources and/or 
adverse current economics can result in a write-down of the carrying amounts of the Group’s goodwill, mining assets or other 
property, plant and equipment.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements  
continued Polymetal International plc  Annual Report 201 1 105
Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
In making the assessment for impairment, assets that do not generate independent cash flows are allocated to an appropriate 
cash-generating unit. Management necessarily applies its judgement in allocating assets that do not generate independent  
cash flows to appropriate cash-generating units, and also in estimating the timing and value of underlying cash flows within the 
value-in-use calculation. Subsequent changes to the cash-generating unit allocation or to the timing of cash flows could impact 
the carrying value of the respective assets.
Inventory obsolescence and write-downs
In determining mine operating costs recognised in the consolidated income statement, the Group’s management makes 
estimates of quantities of ore stacked on leach pads and in process and the recoverable gold, silver and copper in this material 
to determine the average costs of finished goods sold during the period. Changes in these estimates can result in a change in 
mine operating costs of future periods and carrying amounts of inventories.
Share-based compensation
The Group issued equity-settled share appreciation rights to certain employees. Equity−settled share appreciation rights  
are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value 
determined at the grant date of the awards is expensed as services are rendered over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of the rights that will eventually vest.
The fair value of share based compensation is measured using the Monte-Carlo model. The expected life used in the model 
has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.
The most significant assumptions used in estimation of the cost of equity-settled stock appreciation rights are; the expected 
volatility of the Company’s share price over the life of the award; the risk-free interest rate used; the level of expected forfeitures 
and the expectation at the grant date of the dividends to be paid over the life of the awards. Expected volatility is based on the 
historical volatility of return on the Company’s GDRs.
The risk-free rates used in the valuation model are based on US Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal  
to the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
Expected forfeitures are estimated using historical trends of executive director and employee turnover.
At the grant date, the Group had not historically declared dividends. As such, the expected annual dividend per share was 
therefore nil. Any subsequent change in dividend policy will be taken into account when valuing options granted in the future.
Environmental obligations
The Group’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the 
environment. The Group’s provision for future decommissioning and land restoration cost represents management’s best 
estimate of the present value of the future cash outflows required to settle the liability which reflects estimates of future costs, 
inflation, movements in foreign exchange rates and assumptions of risks associated with the future cash outflows; and the 
applicable interest rate for discounting the future cash outflows. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ materially 
from the estimates. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations, life of mine estimates and discount rates 
could affect the carrying amount of this provision.
Contingencies
By their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of 
such contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgements and estimates of the outcome of future events.
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Significant judgement is required in 
determining the provision for income taxes due to the complexity of legislation. There are many transactions and calculations  
for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on 
estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts  
that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such 
determination is made.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. The estimation of that probability includes 
judgements based on the expected performance. Various factors are considered in order to assess the probability of the future 
utilisation of deferred tax assets, including past operating results, operational plan, expiration of tax losses carried forward,  
and tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from these estimates or if these estimates must be adjusted in future periods, 
the financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected. Financial statements

4. Acquisitions and disposals
(a) Asset acquisitions
Kutyn LLC
On 29 April 2011, the Group acquired a 100% interest in Kutynskaya GGK LLC (Kutyn) from Olsen Business Limited, an 
unrelated party, in exchange for 3,500,000 JSC Polymetal GDRs. The GDR share price on the acquisition date was US$19.14.  
The Group acquired Kutyn as it holds the mining licence for Kutyn gold deposit located in the Khabarovsk Region.
Kutyn does not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008) thus this acquisition was accounted for as an 
acquisition of a group of assets. The allocation of the cost of acquisition to the group of assets acquired was as follows:

5. Segment information
The Group has seven reportable segments:
 > Voro (CJSC Zoloto Severnogo Urala);
 > Khakanja (JSC Okhotskaya GGC, Rudnik Avlayakan LLC and Kirankan LLC, see Note 4);
 > Dukat (CJSC Serebro Magadana, CJSC Ayax);
 > Omolon (JSC Omolon Gold Mining Company, Rudnik Kvartseviy LLC);
 > Varvara (JSC Varvarinskoye);
 > Amursk-Albazino (Albazino Resources LLC, Amursky Hydrometallurgy Plant LLC); and
 > Mayskoye (ZK Mayskoye LLC).
Reportable segments are determined based on the Group’s internal management reports and are separated based on the 
Group’s geographical profile. Minor companies and activities (management, exploration, purchasing and other companies) which 
do not meet the reportable segment criteria are disclosed within Corporate and other. Each segment is engaged in gold, silver 
and copper mining and related activities, including exploration, extraction, processing and reclamation. The Group’s segments 
are all based in the Russian Federation other than Varvara which is based in Kazakhstan.
The measure which management and the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the CODM) use to evaluate the performance of the 
Group is segment adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as profit for the period adjusted for depreciation and amortization, write-
downs of inventory to net realisable value, share-based compensation expenses, listing expenses, rehabilitation expenses, gains 
or losses arising on disposal of subsidiaries, foreign exchange gains or losses, changes in the fair value of derivatives, changes  
in the fair value of contingent consideration, finance income, finance costs and income tax expenses. The accounting policies  
of the reportable segments are consistent with those of the Group’s accounting policies under IFRS as described in Note 2. Financial statements

5. Segment information (continued)
Revenue shown as corporate and other comprises, principally, intersegment revenue relating to the supply of inventories, spare 
parts and fixed assets to the Group’s production entities. Intersegment revenue is recognised based on costs incurred plus  
a fixed margin basis. External revenue shown within Corporate and other represents revenue from services provided to third 
parties by the Group’s non-mining subsidiaries. 
Business segment current assets and liabilities, other than current inventory, are not reviewed by the CODM and therefore are 
not disclosed in these consolidated financial statements.
The segment adjusted EBITDA reconciles to the profit before income tax as follows:

Prior year adjustment 5,305 –
Total income tax expense 118,985 67,414
The actual tax expense differs from the amount which would have been determined by applying the statutory rate of 20% for  
the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan to profit before income tax as a result of the application of relevant jurisdictional tax 
regulations, which disallow certain deductions which are included in the determination of accounting profit. These deductions 
include share-based compensation, social related expenditures and other non-production costs, certain general and 
administrative expenses, financing expenses, foreign exchange related and other costs.
In the normal course of business, the Group is subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the Russian Federation  
and Kazakhstan. Out of the large operating companies of the Group, tax authorities have audited OJSC Okhotskaya Mining and 
Exploration Company, CJSC Magadan Silver for the period up to 2007 , CJSC Gold of Northern Urals for the period up to 2009 
and JSC Varvarinskoye for the period up to 2010. According to Russian and Kazakhstan tax legislation, previously conducted 
audits do not fully exclude subsequent claims relating to the audited period. No significant adjustments have been proposed  
by the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation and Tax Service of the Republic of Kazakhstan as at 31 December 2011.
Deferred taxation is attributable to the temporary differences that exist between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.

reporting period.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so. The following is the analysis 
of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for financial reporting purposes:
31 December 
2011
US$’000
31 December 
2010
US$’000
Deferred tax liabilities (79,342) (83,345)
Deferred tax assets 62,118 57,676
 (17,224) (25,669)
Tax losses carried forward represent amounts available for offset against future taxable income generated by JSC Omolon Gold 
Mining Company, ZK Mayskoye LLC, Albazino Resources LLC and the Company during the period up to 2021. Each legal entity 
within the Group represents a separate tax-paying component for income tax purposes. The tax losses of one entity cannot be 
used to reduce taxable income of other entities of the Group. As at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 the aggregate 
tax losses carried forward were US$268.3 million (RUB 8.6 billion) and US$181.1 million (RUB 5.52 billion), respectively.
The Group believes that recoverability of the recognized net deferred tax asset (DTA) of US$62.1 million at 31 December 2011 is 
more likely than not based upon expectations of future taxable income in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan and available 
tax planning strategies.
Losses incurred in certain taxable entities in recent years have created a history of losses as of 31 December 2011. The Group 
has concluded that there is sufficient evidence to overcome the recent history of losses based on forecasts of sufficient taxable 
income in the carry-forward period.
The Group’s estimate of future taxable income is based on established proved and probable reserves which can be economically 
developed. The income from the Group’s proved and probable mineral reserves is a predictable source of future income and 
produces sufficient taxable income for realisation of the Group’s net DTA. The Group is projecting to generate sufficient taxable 
earnings to be able to fully realise its net DTA even under various stressed scenarios. The amount of the DTA considered 
realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period  
are reduced due to delays in production start dates, decreases in ore reserve estimates, increases in environmental obligations, 
or reductions in precious metal prices.
The Group’s recognised tax losses carried forward expire as follows:

Dukat 8,242 8,707
Total 108,587 114,712
The carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed annually to determine whether it is in excess of its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount of cash-generating unit is determined based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation. Fair value is based 
on the application of the Discounted Cash Flow Method (DCF). The DCF method is attributable to the development of proved 
and probable reserves. The tail margin method, an extension of the DCF method, is attributable to the development of resources 
beyond proved and probable reserves, assuming they could be developed after the end of the DCF forecast period. Resources 
used in calculations are based on the amounts of measured and indicated and inferred resources, which are adjusted for a 
conversion factor in order to obtain a forecast production figure. A steady state cash flow per unit of subject metal is usually 
applied to the annual resource recovery amount to determine the total annual cash flow, based on past experience with an 
appropriate risk adjustment.
The discount rate used in the calculations was fixed and equalled the Polymetal WACC (9% both periods). The DCF method  
is used based on proved and probable reserves and uses the following key assumptions:
 > production volumes;
 > commodity prices;
 > proved and probable reserves; and
 > production costs.
 
Recoverable reserves and resources are based on the proved and probable reserves and resources in existence at the end of 
the year. Production costs are based on management’s best estimate over the life of the mine. Estimated production volumes are 
based on detailed life of mine plans and take into account development plans for the mines approved by management as part of 
the long-term planning process. Commodity prices are based on latest internal forecasts, benchmarked against external sources 
of information. 
The tail margin method is used to value resources not currently included within an asset’s mine plan. The methodology involves 
calculating an estimated unit cost per ounce in order to forecast net operating cash flows which are discounted to present value. 
While applying the tail margin method the Company used the following key assumptions:
 > production forecasts were calculated based on the weighted average amount of measured and indicated and inferred 
resources with a conversion factor of 0.7 for measured and indicated resources and 0.5 for inferred resources; and
 > steady state cash flow per unit of subject metal (gold or silver) was determined as the average of cash flows per unit of subject 
metal for the period during which their values in real terms were relatively stable.
In management’s view, no reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would trigger an impairment charge of goodwill. Financial statements

Bank loans
As at 31 December 201 1, the Group has US$803 million of undrawn funds available under its credit facilities (2010: US$237 million). 
The most significant financial covenant in place is that the ratio of net debt to EBITDA must not exceed 3.25. 
Otkritie
On 6 September 2011 the Group entered into a general master repurchase agreement (the GMRA). Under the GMRA 34,450,357 
Polymetal shares (representing approximately 8.6% of the issued share capital of JSC Polymetal) were transferred to Otkritie 
Securities Limited in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of US$250 million.
The accounting substance of this arrangement is that it is a securitised loan. It has been accounted for at amortised cost with 
interest accrued for. The treasury shares have accordingly not been shown as sold and these shares are therefore excluded from 
the calculation of non-controlling interest in the JSC Polymetal Group.
On Repurchase Date the Group has the obligation to repurchase all of the Polymetal Shares transferred under the GMRA for the 
repurchase price which is calculated as the sum of (i) the price received for the relevant Polymetal shares; and (ii) the aggregate 
amount obtained by daily application of LIBOR + 2.75% to the relevant price for the number of days during the period 
commencing on the relevant transfer date and ending on the Repurchase Date.
Subsequent to the reporting date, the Group accelerated the Repurchase Date and repaid the loan in full on 16 February 2012  
in accordance with the terms of the GMRA. Financial statements

24. Borrowings (continued)
BSGV
In June 2011, the Group entered into a long-term credit facility with BSGV which allows the Group to borrow funds, denominated 
in US Dollars, up to US$100.0 million to finance its current operations. Borrowings under this credit facility are available until  
May 2014. The credit facility is repayable in quarterly instalments. Interest is also payable quarterly. The repayment of this 
long-term credit facility is guaranteed with a pledge of revenue under a sales agreement with Rosbank (see Note 28). Following 
the re-organisation of Joint-Stock Company ‘Banque Societe Generale Vostok’ (‘BSGV’) by way of merger with Joint Stock 
Commercial Bank ‘ROSBANK’, the rights of BSGV inured to the benefit of Joint Stock Commercial Bank ‘ROSBANK’  
(Open joint-stock company).
BNP Paribas
In January 2011, the Group entered into a long-term credit facility with BNP Paribas which allows the Group to borrow funds, 
denominated in US Dollars, up to US$50.0 million to finance the Group’s general corporate purposes and for refinancing of 
short-term and long-term indebtedness of the Group. Borrowings under this credit facility are available until February 2015.  
The credit facility is repayable in eleven equal quarter instalments starting from July 2012. Interest is payable quarterly.
The repayment of this long-term loan is guaranteed with a pledge of revenue under a sales agreement with Nomos-Bank  
(see Note 28), a related party.
Raiffeisenbank
In October 2010, the Group received a long-term facility from Raiffeisenbank which allows the Group to borrow funds up to  
US$150 million. The Group used the funds in part, to refinance long-term credit obtained from Raiffeisenbank in December 
2009. The remainder is being used to finance its current operations. The loan facility is available until September 2015.  
Interest is payable monthly.
Syndicate of Banks (including restructuring on 6 April 2011)
Upon the acquisition of JSC Varvarinskoye, the Group assumed a long-term loan of US$85.7 million, payable to a Syndicate  
of Banks including Investec Bank Ltd, Investec Bank plc, Nedbank Limited and Natixis Bank (Syndicate of Banks). This loan  
had a carrying amount of US$74.7 million on 6 April 2011.
In addition to the loan described above, the Group assumed obligations for amounts payable for previously realised flat forward 
gold sales and purchase contracts. As at 6 April 2011, the Group had not settled its liability under these contracts. This had  
a carrying amount of US$50.8 million on 6 April 2011.
For repayment of these two liabilities a cash sweep arrangement was applied to all free cash flows generated from JSC 
Varvarinskoye. In accordance with the cash sweep agreement, on each day following the quarter-end, JSC Varvarinskoye shall 
pay 100% of the amount by which the cash inflow for the quarter exceeds US$5.0 million. In 2013 and 2014, 35% and 65%, 
respectively, of the obligation would become due if not previously repaid through the cash sweep arrangement.
In addition the Group had unrealised net derivative liabilities for the forward sale and purchase commitments which were 
presented separately (see Note 28). This had a carrying amount of US$100.7 million on 6 April 2011.
On 6 April 2011, the Group signed an agreement to restructure its debt obligations and related derivative gold forward sale  
and purchase contracts (the Restructuring). As a result of this Restructuring, the Group’s derivative forward sale and purchase 
commitments outstanding as at the date of the Restructuring were converted to debt obligations based on the present value  
of the future net settlement payments of these derivative contracts. Following a partial immediate repayment of US$14.8 million,  
the remaining debt obligation held by Three K Exploration and Mining Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, was 
transferred to JSC Polymetal. All security arrangements held with the counterparty under the debt obligations and forward sale 
and purchase agreements, such as pledges of shares and movable and immovable property, plant and equipment, have been 
foregone as part of this restructuring.
The derivatives were previously recognised at fair value and no gain or loss arose on their conversion to debt. The amendment  
to the previous debt obligations did not constitute a significant modification and it continues to be held at their previous carrying 
value. These totalled US$226.2 million before and US$211.4 million after the repayment of US$14.8 million. The carrying value  
of the new debt arrangement at 6 April 2011 was therefore US$211.4 million, for which the fair value was US$221 million.  
The difference will be accreted using the effective interest rate method as an additional interest charge over the term of the loan.
The par value of the debt transferred, net of repayment, was US$230 million.
As of 31 December 2011 the Group repaid US$80.0 million and following schedule was agreed: US$30.0 million in 2013,  
and US$60.0 million in each of 2014 and 2015.

UniCredit bank AG (incorporated in Great Britain)
In November 2010, the Group received a long-term loan from UniCredit bank of US$100.0 million to finance its current

Gazprombank
In February 2010, the Group entered into a long-term credit facility with Gazprombank which allows the Group to borrow funds, 
denominated in Russian Roubles or US Dollars, up to US$74.8 million (Russian Rouble 2.1 billion as at 31 December 2011)  
to finance its current operations. Borrowings under this credit facility were available until December 2011 and were settled in  
full at that date. The repayment term is established separately for each loan received from the credit facility at the time of the 
draw-down date. Each loan received from the credit facility must be repaid within twelve months of the draw-down. Interest  
is payable monthly, based on a fixed rate determined by Gazprombank for each tranche but not to exceed 14% annually for 
funds borrowed in Russian Roubles and 9% for funds borrowed in US Dollars. Financial statements

28. Commitments and contingencies (continued)
Contingencies
Taxation
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently. 
Management’s interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the companies of the Group may  
be challenged by the relevant regional and federal authorities. Recent events within the Russian Federation suggest that the  
tax authorities may be taking a more assertive position in their interpretation of the legislation and assessments.
As a result, significant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed. Fiscal periods remain open to review by the 
authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years preceding the year of review. Under certain circumstances reviews may 
cover longer periods.
With regards to matters where practice concerning payment of taxes is unclear, management estimated the tax exposure at  
31 December 2011 to be approximately US$46.7 million (2010: US$38.8 million) including the CJSC Serebro Magadana tax 
litigation described below. This amount had not been accrued at 31 December 2011 as management does not believe the 
payment to be probable.
Transfer pricing legislation, which was introduced from 1 January 1999, provides the possibility for tax authorities to make transfer 
pricing adjustments and impose additional tax liabilities in respect of all controlled transactions, provided that the transaction price 
differs from the market price by more than 20%. Controllable transactions include transactions with interdependent parties, as 
determined under the Russian Tax Code, and all cross-border transactions (irrespective whether performed between related or 
unrelated parties), where the price applied by a taxpayer differs by more than 20% from the price applied in similar transactions by 
the same taxpayer within a short period of time, and barter transactions. There is no formal guidance as to how these rules should 
be applied in practice. Arbitration court practice in this respect is contradictory and inconsistent.
The Group’s subsidiaries regularly enter into controllable transactions (e.g. intercompany transactions) and based on the 
transaction terms the Russian tax authorities may qualify them as non-market. Tax liabilities arising from intercompany 
transactions are determined using actual transaction prices. It is possible with the evolution of the interpretation of the transfer 
pricing rules in the Russian Federation and the changes in the approach of the Russian tax authorities, that such transfer prices 
could potentially be challenged in the future. Given the brief nature of the current Russian transfer pricing rules, the impact of any 
such challenge cannot be reliably estimated although it may be significant.
Litigation
During the respective periods, the Group was involved in a number of court proceedings (both as a plaintiff and as a defendant) 
arising in the ordinary course of business.
During 2009 a field tax audit was performed in relation to CJSC Serebro Magadana with respect to all taxes, duties and 
contributions to social funds for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2007 (including CJSC Serebro Territorii  
as a legal predecessor).
As a result of this audit, the tax authorities issued Decision #12-13/23 dated 31 March 2009. The most significant issues  
were the alleged understatement of profits tax by US$18.4 million (including interest and penalties) and the understatement  
of mineral extraction tax by US$4.4 million (including interest and penalties) owing to the potential application of transfer  
pricing rules in respect of export transactions with ABN AMRO Bank N.V. The tax authorities challenged the prices applied  
by CJSC Serebro Magadana (previously CJSC Serebro Territorii) owing to their deviation by more than 20% from London  
Stock Exchange fixings and accounting prices set by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. This deviation was caused  
by signing a flat forward sales contract with Standard Bank of London that provided for fixed prices that were agreed by  
CJSC Serebro Territorii in 2004. CJSC Serebro Territorii supplied silver to ABN AMRO Bank N.V. in 2007 in accordance with  
its obligations under the contract and at the fixed priced stipulated in the contract. In 2004 the negotiated fixed prices were 
consistent with market prices. However, due to a significant increase in the price of silver in the intervening period, by 2007  
the contract price was much lower than the London Metal Exchange price.
CJSC Serebro Magadana appealed against this Decision in the arbitration court and has been successful in the latest appeal. 
The Directors believe that CJSC Serebro Magadana should win any new challenge based on its argument that it was bound  
by the contractual obligations and had sound business reasons to apply such prices.
In the opinion of management of the Group, there are no current legal proceedings or other claims outstanding, which could 
have a material effect on the result of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Group and which have not been accrued 
or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.

29. Fair value accounting
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, 
grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable as follows:
 > Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities;
 > Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
 > Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that  
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
At 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 the Group held the following financial instruments:

Contingent consideration liabilities – – (23,754) (23,754)
– (86,426) (23,754) (110,180)
During the reporting periods, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.
Receivables from provisional copper, gold and silver concentrate sales
The fair value of receivables arising from copper, gold and silver concentrate sales contracts that contain provisional pricing 
mechanisms is determined using the appropriate quoted forward price from the exchange that is the principal active market  
for the particular metal. As such, these receivables are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Derivatives
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined using either present value techniques or option pricing models that 
utilise a variety of inputs that are a combination of quoted prices and market-corroborated inputs. The fair value of the Group’s 
derivative contracts is adjusted for the Group’s credit risk based upon the observed credit default swap spread as appropriate. 
The Group closed the open derivative positions at 6 April 2011 as part of the Restructuring as described in Note 24.

29. Fair value accounting (continued)
Commodity forward contracts
Except for the forward sales contracts entered by JSC Varvarinskoye, other Group’s forward sales contracts (see Note 28) qualify 
for the normal purchase/sales or ‘own use’ exemption. Prior to their Restructuring in April 2011, the fair value of Varvarinskoye 
commodity forward contracts was determined by discounting contractual cash flows using a discount rate derived from observed 
US Treasury yield curve rates. Contractual cash flows were calculated using a forward pricing curve derived from market forward 
prices for each commodity. The commodity forward contracts were classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Contingent consideration liabilities
In 2008, the Group recorded a contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of 98.1% of the shares in JSC Omolon 
Gold Mining Company (Omolon). The fair value of the contingent consideration liability was determined using a valuation model 
which simulates expected production of gold and silver at the Kubaka mine and future gold and silver prices to estimate future 
revenues of Omolon. This liability is revalued at each reporting date based on 2% of the life of mine revenues with the resulting gain 
or loss recognised in the consolidated income statement. The liability recognised at 31 December 2011 was US$22.3 million 
(2010: US$18.3 million).
In 2009, the Group recorded a contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of 100% of shares in JSC Varvarinskoye 
in Kazakhstan. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability was determined using a valuation model which simulates 
expected future prices of gold, silver and copper against the gold strike price applied pursuant to the terms of the gold forward 
purchase contracts entered into (see Note 25) and the copper price as published by the LME as at the date when the gold forward 
purchase contracts described above were entered into. The liability recognised at 31 December 2010 was US$5.5 million and 
was fully settled in July 2011. The contingent consideration liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Group’s Level 3 financial liabilities for the year ended 
31 December 2011:

The Directors consider that a change in a reasonably possible valuation assumption used would not have a material effect on 
the Group.
30. Risk management activities
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising 
the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains from 
prior years.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (borrowings as detailed in Note 24 offset by cash and bank balances as 
detailed in Note 23) and equity of the Group (comprising the Stated Capital account, reserves and retained earnings as detailed 
in Note 31).
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. The Group’s Board reviews the capital structure of the 
Group on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each 
class of capital.

*Trade and other payables exclude employee benefits and social security.
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, share purchase obligation, trade and other receivables, trade and other 
payables and short-term debt recorded at amortised cost approximate to their fair values because of the short maturities of 
these instruments. The estimated fair value of the Group’s long-term debt, calculated using the market interest rate available to 
the Group as at 31 December 2011, is US$591.8 million, and the carrying value as at 31 December 2011 is US$654.6 million 
(see Note 24). Carrying values of the other long-term loans provided to related parties as at 31 December 2011 and 31 
December 2010 approximated to their fair values.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign currency and commodity price risk, interest rate, credit 
and liquidity risks.
At the end of the reporting period, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk for receivables designated at FVTPL.  
The carrying amount reflected above represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for such receivables.

30. Risk management activities (continued)
Foreign currency and commodity price risk
In the normal course of business the Group enters into transactions for the sale of its commodities, denominated in US Dollars. 
In addition, the Group has assets and liabilities in a number of different currencies (primarily Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge). 
As a result, the Group is subject to transaction and translation exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group does not use derivative instruments to currently hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk.
The carrying amounts of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than functional currencies  
of the individual Group entities at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 were as follows:

Forward sales and purchase contracts
As at 31 December 2010, the Group held the following derivative financial instruments which were subsequently closed out  
on 6 April 2011 as part of the Restructuring as described in Note 24.
A flat forward gold sales contract was assumed on the acquisition of JSC Varvarinskoye in October 2009. On the same date  
the Group entered into an offsetting flat forward gold purchase contract with the same notional amount and monthly settlement 
dates as the aforementioned flat forward gold sales contract. The gold forward purchase contract economically locks in the 
losses on the existing flat forward gold sales contract. The contracts have total notional amounts of 320,160 ounces of gold;  
fixed forward sales price of US$574.25 per ounce and fixed forward purchase price of US$1,129.65 per ounce; and monthly 
settlement dates between November 2009 and April 2014.
The Group was liable to pay a net settlement amount on each delivery date. If any settlement were not paid on its applicable 
delivery date, such settlement amount would accrue interest at 3 months LIBOR plus 3% and shall be payable on 31 December 
2013 (35% of the total and all interest accrued thereon to date) and on 31 December 2014 (the full balance of the settlement 
amount and all interest accrued thereon to date). In addition, a cash sweep mechanism applied to all free cash flows generated 
by Varvarinskoye until all the obligations were fully repaid.
As at 6 April 2011 and 31 December 2010 net settlement amounts of US$50.8 million and US$50.9 million, respectively, have 
not been paid and were recorded in the ‘Non-current borrowings’ line of the balance sheet (see Note 24).
These contracts had not been designated as hedging instruments. Changes in the fair value were recorded as part of gain/loss 
on financial instruments in the consolidated income statement. As the Group has legally enforceable master netting agreements 
with counterparties and intends to settle the contracts on a net basis, the flat forward gold sales and purchase contracts are 
presented net in the balance sheet as derivatives.
During the period ended 6 April 2011, the Group settled derivative contracts resulting in realised derivative losses of US$1.9 million 
(2010: loss of US$0.9 million).

Under a long-established practice prevalent in the industry, copper, gold and silver concentrate sales are provisionally priced at 
the time of shipment. The provisional prices are finalised in a contractually specified future period (generally one to three months) 
primarily based on quoted LBMA or LME prices. Sales subject to final pricing are generally settled in a subsequent month.  
The forward price is a major determinant of recorded revenue.
LME copper price has averaged US$8,820 per tonne since January 2011 compared with the Group’s recorded average 
provisional price of US$8,629 per tonne. The applicable forward copper price at 31 December 2011 was US$7 ,592 per tonne. 
During the year 2011 decreasing copper prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of US$0.4 million (included 
in revenue). At 31 December 2011 the Group had copper sales of 3,067 tonnes priced at an average of US$7 ,682 per tonne, 
subject to final pricing in the first quarter of 2012.
LBMA gold price averaged US$1,572 per ounce since January 2011 compared with the Group’s recorded average provisional  
price of US$1,581 per ounce. The applicable forward gold price at 31 December 2011 was US$1,525 per ounce. During the third 
quarter 2011 decreasing gold prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of US$1.2 million (included in revenue).  
At 31 December 2011 the Group had gold sales of 67 ,751 ounces priced at an average of US$1,667 per ounce, subject to final 
pricing in the first quarter of 2012.
LBMA silver price averaged US$35.30 per ounce since January 2011 compared with the Group’s recorded average provisional 
price of US$38.50 per ounce. The applicable forward silver price at 31 December 2011 was US$30.50 per ounce. During the 
third quarter 2011 decreasing silver prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of US$4.3 million (included in 
revenue). At 31 December 2011 the Group had silver sales of 972,092 ounces priced at an average of US$29.4 per ounce, 
subject to final pricing in the first quarter of 2012.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. 
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings. The Group 
does not currently hedge its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section of 
this note.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the end of the reporting 
period was outstanding for the whole period. A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk 
internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in 
interest rates.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the 
year ended 31 December 2011 would decrease or increase by US$6.5 million (2010: US$6.9 million). This is mainly attributable 
to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
The Group’s sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the current period mainly due to the increase in variable rate 
debt instruments.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a customer may default or not meet its obligations to the Group on a timely basis, leading to financial 
losses to the Group. The Group’s financial instruments that are potentially exposed to concentration of credit risk consist 
primarily of cash and cash equivalents and loans and receivables.
Accounts receivable are regularly monitored and assessed and where necessary an adequate level of provision is maintained. 
Trade accounts receivable at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 are represented by provisional copper, gold and  
silver concentrate sales transactions. A significant portion of the Group’s trade accounts receivable is due from reputable export 
trading companies. With regard to other loans and receivables the procedures of accepting a new customer include checks by  
a security department and responsible on-site management for business reputation, licences and certification, creditworthiness 
and liquidity. Generally, the Group does not require any collateral to be pledged in connection with its investments in the above 
financial instruments. Credit limits for the Group as a whole are not set up.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international 
credit-rating agencies. The major financial assets at the balance sheet date other than trade accounts receivable presented  
in Note 22 are cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2011 of US$659 million (2010: US$11 million). Financial statements

30. Risk management activities (continued)
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to settle all liabilities as they are due.
The Group’s liquidity position is carefully monitored and managed. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining detailed 
budgeting, cash forecasting processes and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities to help ensure that  
it has adequate cash available to meet its payment obligations.
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. 
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which 
the Group can be required to pay. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are 
floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the end of the reporting period. The contractual 
maturity is based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay.
Presented below is the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities as at 31 December 2011:

31. Stated Capital Account and Retained Earnings
The Company was incorporated in Jersey on 29 July 2010 as a public no par value company with limited liability under the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 for the purpose of becoming the new holding company of JSC Polymetal.
On incorporation, the number of shares that the Company was authorised to issue pursuant to its memorandum of association 
was an unlimited number of shares. Two shares were issued on incorporation at a price of US$1 per share. One of these subscriber 
shares referred to above was transferred to Metal One Limited (a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands) on  
12 August 2010. On 13 August 2010, the Company issued a further 9,998 shares to Metal One Limited at a price of US$1 per share. 
These shares, which were unpaid, were redeemed on completion of the IPO.
On 30 September 2011, PMTL, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, made an offer (known as the Institutional Share Swap 
Facility or the ISSF) to certain institutional shareholders of JSC Polymetal to acquire their Polymetal Shares and Polymetal GDRs. 
The consideration under the ISSF is the issue of new shares in the Company in exchange for Polymetal shares on a one for one 
basis. Under the ISSF, which completed simultaneously with the IPO on 2 November 2011, 332,641,773 new shares in the 
Company were issued.
On 2 November 2011, the Company successfully completed its IPO. 53,350,000 shares with no par value were issued at  
a price of 920 pence (US$14.74) per share. The net proceeds raised were US$762.6 million. As part of the price stabilisation 
provisions, 3,305,988 of the new shares were repurchased at a cost of US$46.6 million and cancelled by the Company in the 
five week period following the IPO.
The total transaction costs incurred were US$33.7 million. US$24.2 million of the transaction costs were attributable to the  
issue of new equity and have been deducted against the Stated capital account, while US$9.5 million were attributable to the 
expenses associated with the above noted restructuring. Joint transaction costs were allocated based on the ratio of new shares 
issued, in relation to total shares outstanding.

Retained earnings
Reserves available for distribution to shareholders are based on the statutory historical financial information of the Company  
as a standalone entity, which are prepared in accordance with Russian accounting standards and which differ significantly from 
IFRS. Russian legislation identifies the basis of distribution as accumulated profit. However, current legislation and other statutory 
regulations dealing with distribution rights are open to legal interpretation; consequently, actual distributable reserves may differ 
from the amount of accumulated profit under Russian statutory accounting rules.
Weighted average number of shares: Diluted earnings per share
The Group had potentially dilutive securities, namely the Group’s equity-settled share appreciation plan, which was established 
during 2010 (see Note 32).
Basic and dilutive earnings per share were calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent by  
the weighted average number of outstanding common shares before and after dilution respectively. The calculation of the 
weighted average number of outstanding common shares after dilution is as follows:
Year ended
31 December 
2011
Year ended
31 December 
2010
Weighted average number of outstanding common shares 366,969,369 358,732,335
Dilutive effect of share appreciation plan 25,875,610 3,140,220
Weighted average number of outstanding common shares after dilution 392,844,979 361,872,555
There were no adjustments required to earnings for the purposes of calculating dilutive Earnings per share in the current year 
(2010: nil). The dilutive effect of equity-settled share appreciation rights has been calculated using the treasury stock method.
32. Share-based payments
In 2010, the Group established an equity incentive plan (the Plan) for executive directors and senior employees of the Group  
in which the grant of equity-settled share appreciation rights up to 30 million shares in JSC Polymetal (the Bonus Fund) was 
approved. The number of awards to which a qualifying participant is entitled was determined by the board of JSC Polymetal  
on 8 November 2010. Group management believes that such awards better align the interests of its employees with those of  
its shareholders.
Under the terms of the plan these awards were eligible for immediate vesting on the Group restructuring and listing. However,  
the executive Director and senior managers waived that right and the entitlement to JSC Polymetal shares was exchanged for  
an entitlement to Polymetal International shares on a one to one basis with the same vesting conditions as existed previously.  
As the cancellation and reissuance of the awards was done solely to preserve the existing rights of the award holders,  
no accelerated share based charge has been recognised.
The aggregate number of shares comprising the Bonus Fund will be determined on 11 June 2013 and will depend on the excess 
of the weighted average price of the Company’s shares during the period between 11 March 2013 and 11 June 2013 over an 
established price of US$16.74.
Equity-settled stock appreciation rights granted have an exercise price of 1 penny, vest at the end of a 2.6 year service period 
and are exercisable on the vesting day in one year from the vesting date. Financial statements

32. Share-based payments (continued)
The fair value of the awards granted during the year ended 31 December 2010, was estimated using a two – stage Monte-Carlo 
model. The fair value is then amortised on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally 
the vesting period. Use of two-stage Monte-Carlo option pricing requires management to make certain assumptions with respect 
to selected model inputs. The following assumptions were used to determine the grant date fair value:
 > Expected forfeitures. This assumption is estimated using historical trends of executive director and employee turnover. As the 
Group typically only grants awards to senior employees and the turnover rate for such employees is minimal, the Group has 
estimated expected forfeitures to be 5%. Estimated forfeitures are adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent 
actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognised in the 
period of change and impact the amount of expense to be recognised in future periods.
 > Expected volatility. Expected volatility has been estimated based on an analysis of the historical stock price volatility of the 
Company’s GDRs from February 2007 , when the JSC Polymetal GDRs became publicly traded.
 > Expected life. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option of 3.6 years. As the Plan has a  
2.6 year vesting condition and the participant may exercise their right to redeem shares within one year after vesting occurs 
and such right is obtained, the Group used the 2.6 years expected term for the first stage of the Monte-Carlo simulation  
(the First date) and 3.6 – for the second stage (the Second date).
 > Fair value of common stock is equal to the market price of underlying GDRs at the grant date.
 > Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free rate is based on US Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the 
expected life assumed at the date of grant.
At the grant date, the Group had not historically declared dividends and management believed the Company would not declare  
a dividend over the life of the option. As such, the expected annual dividend per share was therefore nil. Any subsequent change 
in dividend policy will be taken into account when valuing options granted in the future.
Risk free rate 0.79% for the First date, 1.24% for the Second date
Expected dividend yield Nil
Expected volatility 40%
Expected life, years 2.6 for the First date, 3.6 for the Second date
Fair value per share, US Dollars 16.97

in general, administrative and selling expenses in the consolidated income statement (see Note 11). As at 31 December 2011  
and 31 December 2010, the Group had US$75.7 million and US$136 million, respectively of unrecognised share-based 
compensation expense related to non-vested equity-settled stock appreciated rights with a weighted average expected 
amortisation period of 2.45 years and 3.45 years, respectively.

31 December 2011 included the issuance of US$67.0 million of treasury shares for the acquisition of assets in 2011.
35. Subsequent events
On 7 February 2012 the Company completed the acquisition from AngloGold Ashanti Holdings PLC (AngloGold) of AngloGold’s 
50% interest in various companies (the Companies) held in joint venture with Polymetal comprising the AngloGold Ashanti – 
Polymetal Strategic Alliance (the Alliance). The Companies include Amikan Holding Limited, which owns the Veduga gold  
deposit in the Krasnoyarsk region of the Russian Federation. The consideration for the acquisition, including the repayment  
of all shareholder loans made by AngloGold to the Companies, was US$20 million, paid in cash. The Group’s existing 50% 
investment had a carrying value of US$12.4 million along with a loan asset of US$6.3 million. The Group intends to introduce  
a new joint venture partner in 2012 and as such the asset acquired is considered held for sale under the definitions within IFRS 5.
On 17 February 2012 the Company executed the Mandatory Tender Offer, made on 23 November 2011 (the MTO) at a cost  
of US$538 million. As a result the Company’s holding in JSC Polymetal has increased to 397 ,287 ,592 Ordinary Shares, 
representing approximately 99.48% of the total share capital of JSC Polymetal. The Company intends to exercise its right  
to proceed with a statutory squeeze out (i.e. purchase) of the remaining JSC Polymetal shares on terms and within the  
period as provided under applicable Russian law. 
As set out in Note 24, on 31 August 2012 (the Repurchase Date) Polymetal ESOP Limited would have been obligated to 
repurchase all of the JSC Polymetal shares transferred under the General Master Repurchase Agreement (the GMRA) for  
the repurchase price which is calculated as the sum of (i) the price received for the relevant Polymetal shares; and (ii) the 
aggregate amount obtained by daily application of LIBOR + 2.75% to the relevant price for the number of days during the  
period commencing on the relevant transfer date and ending on the Repurchase Date. On 16 February 2012, Polymetal ESOP 
Limited accelerated the Repurchase Date under the GMRA and settled its obligations under the GMRA in full for US$250 million.
A final dividend has been proposed in relation to the year of 20 cents per share (2010: nil) giving a total expected dividend  
of US$76.5 million (2010: nil). This is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has therefore  
not been included as a liability in these financial statements.

Glossary of technical terms
Assay  a chemical test performed on a sample of 
any material to determine the amount of 
valuable metals contained in the sample
Ag silver
Au gold
AuEqOz  gold equivalent ounce (and ‘AuEq’  
means gold equivalent)
Autoclave a lined stainless-steel vessel in which  
a technological operation of pressure 
oxidation takes place
Biological 
oxidation
 a technological operation in which slurry  
is subjected to the activity of bacteria with 
the goal to destroy sulphide particles 
enveloping gold particles and make  
slurry amenable to cyanide leaching
By-product a secondary metal or mineral that is 
produced or recovered during mining and 
processing at a deposit. A by-product 
offers additional economic benefits to the 
project, but it is not necessary in order for 
the project to be economically efficient
Carbon-in-leach 
or CIL
 a technological operation in which slurry 
containing gold and silveris leached by 
cyanide in the presence of activated 
carbon. Gold is absorbed onto activated 
carbon in parallel with leaching
Carbon-in-pulp or 
CIP
 means a technological operation in  
which slurry containing gold and silver is 
leached by cyanide initially without and 
subsequently in the presence of activated 
carbon. Gold absorption onto carbon 
starts only after preliminary leaching
Concentrate a semi-finished product of mineral 
processing (flotation or gravity separation) 
containing significantly more value per unit 
of weight than ore and subject to further 
processing for the production of metals  
or other substances in final useful form
Counter-current 
decantation
 a technological operation in which 
gold-and-silver bearing clear liquid is 
separated from the slurry through several 
stages of water addition (washing) and 
solid/liquid separation (thickening). 
Employed in the Merrill-Crowe process
Cu copper
Cut-and-fill a method of underground mining which 
requires purposeful backfilling of space 
emptied of ore. It is used where ore 
contains relatively high mineral values and 
ground conditions are less competent.
Cut-off grade the minimum grade at which mineralized 
material can be economically mined and 
processed (used in the calculation of  
ore reserves)
Cyanide leaching leaching with cyanide as the leaching 
agent
Decline a permanent inclined underground tunnel 
leading from the surface to an ore body
Diamond core 
drilling
a method of exploration in which rock 
samples from undergroundare retrieved 
as core (whole rock cylinders) for further 
examination and assaying
Dilution the share (percentage) of material below 
the cut-off grade that is extracted together 
and irretrievably mixed with ore during 
mining. All other things being equal, higher 
dilution leads to lower grade in ore mined
Doré one of the traditional end-products of  
a gold/silver mine; an alloy containing  
90 per cent. in sum of gold and silver  
as well as 10% of impurities Polymetal International plc  Annual Report 201 1 145
Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
Exploration activity ultimately aimed at discovery  
of ore reserves for exploitation. Consists  
of sample collection and analysis, 
including reconnaissance, geophysical 
and geochemical surveys, trenching, 
drilling, etc
Flotation a technological operation in which 
ore-bearing minerals are separated from 
gangue minerals in the slurry based on 
variance in the interaction of different 
minerals with water. Particles of valuable 
concentrate are carried upwards with  
froth and collected for further processing
Gossan rust-coloured oxide and hydroxide 
minerals of iron and manganese that cap 
an ore deposit. Gossans form by the 
oxidation of the sulfide minerals in an ore 
deposit and they thus may be used as 
clues to the existence of subsurface ore 
deposits. In addition to hydrous oxides  
of iron and manganese, gold and silver  
in the native state can occur in gossans
Grade means the relative amount of metal in  
ore, expressed as grams per tonne for 
precious metals and as a percentage  
for most other metals
Head grade the grade of ore coming into  
a processing plant
Heap leach a technological operation in which 
crushed material is laid on a sloping, 
impervious pad where it is leached by 
cyanide solution to dissolve gold and/or 
silver. Metals are subsequently recovered 
from pregnant leach solution by CIC  
or the Merrill-Crowe process
Indicated 
resource 
means that part of a resource for which 
tonnage, grade and content can be 
estimated with a reasonable level of 
confidence. It is based on exploration, 
sampling and testing information gathered 
through appropriate techniques from 
locations such as outcrops, trenches,  
pits, workings and drill holes. The 
locations are too widely or inappropriately 
spaced to confirm geological and/or 
grade continuity but are spaced closely 
enough forcontinuity to be assumed
Inferred resource means that part of a resource for which 
tonnage, grade and content can be 
estimated with a low level of confidence.  
It is inferred from geological evidence  
and assumed but not verified geological 
and/or grade continuity. It is based on 
information gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings  
and drill holes which may be limited  
or of uncertain quality and reliability
In-fill drilling a conventional method of detailed 
exploration on already defined resource of 
reserve, consisting of drilling on a denser 
grid to allow more precise estimation of 
ore body parameters and location
Leaching the process of dissolving mineral values 
from solid into liquid phase of slurry
Measured 
resource 
means that part of a resource for which 
tonnage, densities, shape, physical 
characteristics, grade and mineral content 
can be estimated with a high level of 
confidence. It is based on detailed and 
reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and  
drill holes. The locations are spaced 
closely enough to confirm geological  
and grade continuity
Merrill-Crowe 
process
a technological operation for extraction of 
gold and/or silver after cyanide leaching. 
In the first step slurry containing gold and/
or silver is separated into liquid and solid 
phases by washing the solids off in 
countercurrent decantation thickeners. In 
the second step pregnant leach solution 
(liquid phase of slurry) is filtered to remove 
impurities and deaerated. Finally, gold and 
silver are deposited onto the solid bed of 
claylike material where they replace zinc 
particles which pass into a solution. 
Merrill-Crowe is preferentially used for 
silver-rich ores
Mill a mineral processing plant
Mineralisation a rock containing valuable components, 
not necessarily in the quantities sufficient 
for economically justifiable extraction. 
Consists of ore minerals and gangue
Open-pittable amenable for economically feasible mining 
by open-pit methods
Open-pit mine a mine that is entirely on surface. Also 
referred to as open-cut or open-cast mine
Open stoping a method of underground mining in  
which underground voids left after ore  
is extracted are left behind unfilled and 
unsupported
Ore the part of mineralisation that can be 
mined and processed profitably
Ore body a spatially compact and geometrically 
connected location of ore
Ore mined ore extracted from the ground for further 
processing
Ore processed ore subjected to treatment in a mineral 
processing plant
Ore stacked the ore stacked for heap leach operations.
Oxidised ore ore in which both ore minerals and 
gangue are fully or partially oxidised thus 
impacting its physical and chemical 
properties and influencing the choice  
of a processing technology Appendices
146 Polymetal International plc  Annual Report 201 1
Precipitate the semi-finished product of mineral 
processing by Merrill-Crowe process, 
normally containing very high 
concentrations of silver and/or gold
POX or pressure 
oxidation
a technological operation in which slurry  
is subjected to high pressure and high 
temperature in an autoclave with the goal 
to destroy sulphide particles enveloping 
gold particles and make slurry amenable 
to cyanide leaching
Primary ore unoxidised ore
Probable reserves the economically mineable part of an 
indicated (and in some cases measured) 
resource, which has a lower level of 
confidence than proved reserves but  
is of sufficient quality to serve as the  
basis for a decision on the development  
of the deposit
Production the amount of pure precious metals, 
measured in thousands of ounces  
for gold, millions of ounces for silver  
and tonnes for copper, produced  
following processing
Proved reserves the economically mineable part of a 
measured resource, which represents the 
highest confidence category of reserve 
estimate. The style of mineralisation or 
other factors could mean that proved 
reserves are not achievable in some 
deposits
Reclamation the restoration of a site after mining  
or exploration activity is completed.
Recovery or 
recovery rate
the percentage of valuable metal in  
the ore that is recovered by metallurgical 
treatment in the final or semi-finished 
product
Refractory a characteristic of gold-bearing ore 
denoting impossibility of recovering gold 
from it by conventional cyanide leaching
Reserves the economically mineable part of a 
measured and/or indicated mineral 
resource. It takes into account mining 
dilution and losses. Appropriate 
assessments and studies have been 
carried out, and include consideration of 
and modification by realistically assumed 
mining, metallurgical, economic, 
marketing, legal, environmental, social and 
governmental factors. These assessments 
demonstrate at the time of reporting that 
extraction could reasonably be justified. 
Reserves are subdivided in order of 
increasing confidence into probable 
reserves and proved reserves
Resources a concentration or occurrence of material 
of intrinsic economic interest in or on  
the earth’s crust in such form, quality  
and quantity that there are reasonable 
prospects for eventual economic 
extraction. The location, quantity, grade, 
geological characteristics and continuity  
of resources are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological 
evidence and knowledge. Resources  
are sub-divided in order of increasing 
geological confidence, into inferred, 
indicated and measured categories
Roasting a technological operation in which slurry  
is subjected to high temperature in the 
presence of oxygen with the goal to  
burn sulphide particles enveloping gold 
particles and make slurry amenable  
to cyanide leaching
Run-of-mine ore ore as mined in terms of grade, size, 
moisture, etc
Stockwork one of the types of mineralisation, a 
complex system of structurally controlled 
or randomly oeirnted veins. Stockworks 
are common in many ore deposit types
Stope a large underground excavation entirely 
within an ore body, a unit of ore extraction
Strike a horizontal extension of an ore body  
or mineralisation
Stripping the mining of waste in an open pit mine.
Tailings part of the original feed of a mineral 
processing plant that is considered  
devoid of value after processing
Underground 
development
excavation which is carried out to access 
ore and prepare it for extraction (mining).
Vein a relatively narrow ore body with 
significant dip and strike dimensions  
and sharply defined boundaries
Waste barren rock that must be mined and 
removed to access ore in a mine

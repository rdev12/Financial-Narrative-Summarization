DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 3
Peter Dubens
Executive Chairman
The last 15 months has seen a complete
transformation of the business from a niche wireless
broadband business to a leading UK provider of
unified communications to the SME and mid-market
sector. The transformation started with the
acquisitions of Daisy Communications Limited
(“Daisy”) and Vialtus Solutions Limited (“Vialtus”) on
21 July 2009 which initiated a consolidation
strategy in the fragmented SME and mid-market
telecommunications sector. By the 2010 period end
a further five acquisitions had been completed by
Daisy Group plc (“the Company”, together with its
subsidiaries, “the Group”), formerly Freedom4
Group plc.
Revenue, adjusted EBITDA and operating losses
for the 15 months ended 31 March 2010 were
£134.4 million, £11.0 million and £17.5 million,
respectively. Although the statutory period for these
results is 15 months, the trading period
commenced on 21 July 2009; before that date,
continuing operations consisted of plc running
costs only. The results for the wireless broadband
business for the 15 month period are included in
discontinued operations.
STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS
On 1 July 2009 the Company announced that,
subject to shareholder approval, it had agreed to
acquire the entire issued share capital of both Daisy
and Vialtus Holdings Limited together with the
shares in Vialtus not held by Vialtus Holdings
Limited. The directors had carried out a detailed
review of the UK business telecommunications
market and had concluded that the fragmentation
in the SME and mid-market sector, together with
depressed valuations in both quoted and
non-quoted operators, presented a significant
consolidation opportunity for the Group. Daisy
and Vialtus were to form the cornerstone of
this consolidation.
On 20 July 2009, the Company restructured its
share capital by consolidating every 20 shares into
one. On 21 July 2009 the Company issued
103,750,000 new shares at a placing price of
80 pence per share, raising £83.0 million (before
expenses). At the same time, the share capital of
Daisy was acquired for £30.5 million in cash and the
£54.5 million issue of 63,750,000 new fully paid
shares in the Company. The Vialtus acquisition
comprised a payment of £13.0 million in cash and
the £31.0 million issue of 36,250,000 new fully paid
shares in the Company.
The acquisition of Daisy was crucial to the
Company’s consolidation strategy. Daisy has an
integrated customer relationship management
(“CRM”) and billing platform which has since laid
the foundations for the delivery of synergies from
further sector consolidating acquisitions. In the
period from 3 August 2009 to 31 March 2010, the
Group acquired the trading assets of both AT
Communications Group plc (“ATC”) and Eurotel, the
telecommunications division of Redstone plc
(“Redstone”), and the entire issued capital of each
of Managed Communications Limited (“MCL”) and
BNS Telecom Group plc (“BNS”) for a combined
consideration of £56.6 million (inclusive of
associated costs).
On 22 April 2010, the Company acquired the entire
issued share capital of Cole Robert & Co Limited
(“CRC”) for a total consideration of £2.1 million, of
which £0.5 million is deferred. CRC is a wholesale
telecoms and internet service provider.
On 10 June 2010, the Group acquired the entire
issued share capital of Fone Logistics Limited (“FLL”)
for a cash consideration of £3.6 million. FLL is a
provider of mobile handsets and airtime to the SME
market through an independent dealer channel.
On 17 June 2010, the Group announced the
disposal of its WiMAX spectrum licences for
cash consideration of £12.5 million. This transaction
ends the Group’s interest in WiMAX technology
and completes the change in strategy initiated
in July 2009. Chairman’s statement continued
4 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
FUNDING
Post period end, on 4 June 2010, the Company
announced that it had entered into a new £75.0
million banking facility. The facility is provided by
Lloyds TSB plc, Yorkshire Bank and HSBC Bank plc,
with each bank lending £25.0 million. This new
facility provides the Company with finance to
support its acquisition strategy as well as providing
additional working capital. The board will continue
its prudent approach to debt levels and will
operate within a net debt to adjusted EBITDA
ratio of 2.5.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
It is difficult to compare reported results for 2010
and 2008 as a result of the significant acquisitions,
disposals and restructuring which has occurred
during these periods.
Revenue for the Group from continuing operations,
which was all earned in the period between 21 July
2009 and 31 March 2010, was £134.4 million. The
Group’s adjusted EBITDA and operating loss were
£11.0 million and £17.5 million respectively. Net
exceptional costs of £5.8 million comprise
rationalisation and redundancy costs incurred as
part of the Group’s business integration
programme and set-up costs in respect of
businesses purchased out of administration.
Exceptional costs are stated net of negative
goodwill of £5.8 million which arose principally
on the acquisitions of the former trading assets
of ATC and Eurotel, purchased from the
administrators of these businesses.
At 31 March 2010, the Group had cash and cash
equivalents of £20.0 million resulting in a net debt
position of £8.3 million.
The underlying positive operating cashflow
(excluding exceptional cash costs of £9.8 million)
for the period was £8.2 million and is indicative of
the Group’s ability to convert adjusted EBITDA
to cash.
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
In conjunction with its acquisition activity, the Group
has a strong focus on integration. Daisy has a set of
operational and financial systems whose ability to
flex and scale enable them to meet the demands
created by acquisitive growth. As a result, the
Group has successfully integrated the acquired
businesses onto its established platforms allowing
early cost savings to be achieved.
The Group provides a comprehensive suite of
products to its customers in four main product
areas comprising network services, data solutions
(broadband, leased lines, bonded digital
subscriber line (“DSL”), data hosting), system
services (maintenance, engineering, equipment),
and mobile solutions. It also operates two further
channels to market through mobile distribution
and wholesale.
The goal is to provide the entire portfolio of
services from a single platform with a single
customer bill. During the review period the Group
has made very solid progress towards achieving
this goal. In particular, all network services business,
with the exception of the former Vialtus activity
(where there is a high concentration of data
provision), is now conducted on the Daisy CRM and
billing platform. The system services trade has been
consolidated into a single trading division, allowing
the rationalisation of the engineering cost base and
providing an integrated service delivery capability.
The mobile solutions business is also now
operating from a single division, with a longer term
aim to also migrate those services to the Daisy CRM
and billing platform.
The migration of acquired businesses to a common
platform has enabled the Group to close operations
at Halifax and London, concentrating activity on its
core centres at Nelson, Heathrow and Harlow.
To facilitate this migration our main corporate
centre at Nelson, Lancashire, has recently been
extended into a new headquarters building
providing accommodation for up to an additional
300 employees.
During the period, the board decided that, as a
consequence of the radical reshaping of the Group,
the wireless broadband business should no longer
form part of the Group’s ongoing strategy.
BOARD CHANGES
During the period there were a number of changes
to the composition of the board. Matthew Riley was
appointed chief executive officer on 21 July 2009.
Ian McKenzie and Laurence Blackall joined the
board as non-executive directors on the same date.
Ian Butcher was appointed a non-executive director
on 3 August 2009. C C
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 5
On 31 August 2009, following nine years of service
with the Group, Stewart Porter stepped down from
his role as chief financial officer and company
secretary. Stewart was replaced by Anthony Riley,
former chief financial officer of Daisy.
On 27 October 2009, David McGlennon was
appointed as general counsel and took on the
responsibility of company secretary.
On 7 December 2009, Mike Read, chief executive
officer of Freedom4 Group plc prior to the
acquisition of Daisy and a member of the main
board since 2003, stepped down from his position
following nine years with the Group.
I would like again to thank Stewart and Mike for 
all their work on behalf of the shareholders and 
the board.
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
I am delighted to be able to report such striking
progress towards our aim of becoming one of the
largest UK providers of unified communications
services and solutions to the SME and 
mid-market sector.
The integration of acquired businesses has
proceeded on schedule providing significant cost
savings which will be reflected in our results for the
year to 31 March 2011.
The market environment remains difficult for
smaller, sub-scale, operators and this will provide
further acquisition opportunities for the Group
during the current financial year.
The recently completed bank funding provides the
Group with the capability to pursue those
opportunities which will add value to the business,
whilst not compromising the Group’s strong
liquidity position.

Chief Executive Officer
INTRODUCTION
As outlined in the chairman’s statement, the 
period under review has been one of significant
positive change. During this period the Group 
has made great strides towards its aim of 
being one of the largest providers of unified
communications services in the UK to the SME and
mid-market sector.
The management team has successfully
implemented its acquisition and integration
strategy which, combined with a strong product set,
has meant that we have delivered on our financial
targets for the reporting period and laid solid
foundations for future earnings growth.
Revenue of £134.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of
£11.0 million have been generated in the reported
15 month period.
Against a difficult economic backdrop and through
significant corporate change, our performance is
very much a reflection of the effort, commitment
and tenacity of all employees from across the
Group and I would like to thank them all for the
excellent teamwork that has allowed us to make
such significant progress over this trading period.
GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our primary market is the SME and mid-market
sector. When the enlarged Group was formed in
2009, we knew the fragmented nature of the UK
SME and mid-market sector presented significant
opportunities for consolidation and the opportunity
to become the clear choice for business in this
target market.
From the announcement of the transformation of
the business on 1 July 2009 to the period end, the
Group has acquired seven businesses for a
combined consideration of £190.5 million (inclusive
of associated costs). Under the guidance of an
experienced in-house team, bolstered over the last
twelve months with some key appointments, the
business has developed a successful blueprint for
the identification, completion and integration of
acquisitions. This process has allowed us to
enhance existing product areas and embark on
supplementing the business’ portfolio with
complementary products and offerings, whilst
driving significant synergies.
The purchase of Daisy Communications Limited
(“Daisy”) gave the Group a strong presence in
network services (lines, calls and other voice
products), broadband and mobile as well asa
flexible and scalable CRM and billing platform.
The acquisition of Vialtus Solutions Limited
delivered a sizeable capability in data solutions
(data hosting, broadband and leased lines) and
access to higher end SME and mid-market 
sector customers.
The subsequent acquisitions of the trading assets of
AT Communications Group plc and Eurotel at the
beginning of August 2009 provided the Group with
complementary system services businesses, further
network services volumes and, in the case of
Eurotel, a mobile customer base.
The purchase of the telecommunications division of
Redstone plc at the end of August 2009 brought a
significant increase in network services activity,
primarily focused on the higher end SME and mid-
market sector, together with additional mobile
solutions capability and a separate mobile
distribution business.
The integration of these businesses was completed
to plan, and delivered annualised run rate synergies
of £17.0 million by the end of this reported financial
period. The full impact of these synergies will be
seen in the current financial year.
Managed Communications Limited (“MCL”) was
acquired in February 2010 and provides us with a
bonded DSL product which we believe is ideally
suited to our customer base. The purchase of BNS
Telecom Group plc, also completed in February
2010, has provided further network services
volumes, and additional skilled engineers to
support our system services activity and a new
capability in IP technology.
The Group now provides a comprehensive suite of
products to its 70,000-strong customer base, in four
main product areas comprising network services,
data solutions (data hosting, broadband, leased
lines and bonded DSL), mobile solutions and
system services (maintenance, engineering and
equipment) throughout the UK. Additionally, the
Group also operates two further channels to C C
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 7
market. These are wholesale (which provides
network services, data solutions and billing services
to other resellers) and mobile distribution.
DIVISIONAL REPORTING
Since 31 March 2010 we have changed our internal
reporting processes and hence our statutory
business segments to align with our strategic
objectives and the four main product areas
described above.
We have disclosed supplementary financial
information including revenue and gross margin in
this revised format within the segmental information
note in the consolidated financial statements.
For the 15 month period to 31 March 2010 revenue
and gross profit are illustrated as follows:-
Revenue (£ million)
Total revenue £134.4 million
Gross Profit (£ million)
Total gross profit £51.6 million
We have reflected the March 2010 annual run rate
revenues per business segment (based on March
2010 actuals) to give a better understanding of the
composition of the Group at that time.
March 2010 Annual Revenue Run Rates (£ million)
Total revenue £235.5 million
We have provided further details of the content and
performance, including the key performance
indicators (KPIs), for these segments below.
The KPIs are stated as at 31 March 2010:-
Network Services
15 months to
31 March 2010
Revenue (£ million) 62.6
Gross profit (£ million) 26.6
Gross margin (%) 42.5%
KPIs
Monthly ARPU (average revenue per user) £163
Number of customers (users) 56,000
Number of lines/channels 263,000
Revenue from the network services division
comprises recurring calls, lines and inbound
revenues together with installation charges and
other one off items.
Acquisitions have seen this division grow
significantly during the period, whilst calls gross
margins have improved as a result of the improved
purchasing power resulting from greater volumes
and the consolidation of call traffic onto
selected suppliers.
At 31 March 2010, 60% of network services
customers provided the Group with both lines and
calls revenue.

At 31 March 2010 the Group had in excess of
35,000 broadband connections and consolidation
plans are ongoing, with the aim to reduce the
number of broadband suppliers to a maximum of
three by the next financial year end.
The bonded DSL product (included in broadband
revenue) is provided through our MCL business and
we believe that this product is ideally suited to our
customer base, providing a realistic cheaper
alternative to leased lines for smaller businesses.
Data hosting is provided from the Group’s two data
centres at Serverbank, Manchester and Harbour
Exchange, London. The services provided consist of
managed services and co-location.

MARKET OPPORTUNITY
We understand that businesses do not want to deal
with multiple suppliers. We believe that by
providing a unified product set, a single point of
contact and, ultimately, a single bill solution we can
provide an ‘end to end’ customer experience that,
combined with a focused sales effort, will enable 
us to increase the impact we have already had on 
this marketplace.
Our current customer base is predominantly
focused on network services and data solutions, as
outlined in the graph below:-
Product Penetration %
We believe that the key to future growth, other than
from acquisitions, will be our ability to cross-sell
products and services into this customer base.
Set out below is the current breakdown of products
per customer which will be used as a measure of
the Group’s success in cross-selling in future
periods. For the purpose of the table, network
services has been split between fixed line calls and
line rental.

This measure shows that customers had, on
average, 1.7 products at 31 March 2010.
As at 31 March 2010 the customer base had direct
debit penetration of 69% and e-billing penetration
of 49%.
PREPARING FOR FURTHER GROWTH
Key appointments across the business have
provided the capability and scale for further
growth, both through acquisition and organic
means, with all areas of the business bolstered over
the trading period and I believe that we now have a
team in place to meet the challenges of 2010/11.
The appointments of David McGlennon (general
counsel and company secretary), Steve Smith
(corporate development director) and Gareth
Kirkwood (chief operating officer) complete an
experienced executive team, fully proficient in
leading the Group towards its stated ambition of
being the main consolidator in the sector and a
leading provider of unified communications to the
SME and mid-market business customer.
In addition to the strengthening of the team, we
have also expanded our corporate centre premises
at Nelson, Lancashire. The commencement of
migration of network systems activity to a common
platform and the centralisation of resource at the
Group’s main office in Nelson resulted in extensive
expansion, with the creation of an extra 15,000
sq.ft. providing accommodation for up to an
additional 300 employees.

The Group has made good progress in the
migration of its businesses onto common
provisioning, billing and CRM platforms. This
migration will continue in 2010 and 2011, with the
longer term aim of the Group to migrate all services
to the Daisy CRM and billing platform. This will
deliver further gains in efficiencies in terms of staff
training and operations, and will provide the ability
to cross-sell all products from the Daisy portfolio.
DISPOSAL OF NON-CORE BUSINESSES
During the period, the board decided that, as a
consequence of the radical reshaping of the Group,
the WiMAX business (Freedom4 Limited) and the
WiFi business (Freedom4 WiFi Limited) no longer
formed part of the ongoing strategy.
On 26 February 2010, the WiFi business was sold to
its management team for a nominal consideration.
On 17 June 2010, the Group announced that it had
disposed of its WiMAX spectrum licences to UK
Broadband Limited, part of the PCCW Group, for a
cash consideration of £12.5 million. The WiMAX
business will now be closed.
Results of these businesses have been included
within discontinued operations for this
reported period.
SUMMARY
We have in place the platform, the systems, the
people and the product set to allow us to continue
to grow acquisitively and to have an opportunity to
build through organic growth.
We look forward to the coming financial year with
confidence and believe that we are well placed to
satisfy the future unified communications demands
of the SME and mid-market sector.

Chief Financial Officer
The trading results of the Group for the 15 month
period ended 31 March 2010, comprising the 
costs of running the Group’s holding company
since the start of the period together with the
trading results of the acquisitions from their various
purchase dates, have been included within
continuing operations.
ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES
Acquisition of Daisy Communications Limited
(“Daisy”) and Vialtus Solutions Limited (“Vialtus”)
On 1 July 2009, the Group announced that it had
conditionally agreed to acquire Daisy, the SME
value added reseller, and Vialtus, the mid-market
managed solutions provider, in conjunction with a
proposed share placing to raise up to £83.0 million
before expenses. These transactions were
completed on 21 July 2009.
At the same time, the Group also undertook a share
consolidation on the basis of 1 consolidated
ordinary share of 2 pence each for every 
20 unconsolidated ordinary shares of 0.1 pence
each. The entire issued share capital of Daisy was
acquired for £30.5 million in cash and the issue of
63,750,000 (£54.5 million) fully paid consolidated
ordinary shares in the Company. The acquisition
resulted in the recognition of goodwill of
£40.7 million and customer and supplier
relationship intangible assets of £62.1 million.
The entire issued share capital of Vialtus was
acquired for £13.0 million in cash and the issue of
36,250,000 (£31.0 million) fully paid consolidated
ordinary shares in the Company. The acquisition
resulted in the recognition of goodwill of 
£10.4 million and customer relationship intangible
assets of £43.4 million.
To provide funding for the Daisy and Vialtus
acquisitions and for possible future acquisitions, the
Company raised £83.0 million (before expenses of
£4.5 million) through the issue via a placing of
103,750,000 consolidated ordinary shares at a
placing price of 80 pence each. The 103,750,000
consolidated ordinary shares issued pursuant to the
placing and the 100,000,000 consolidated ordinary
shares issued pursuant to the acquisitions,
represented 40.6% and 39.1% respectively of the
enlarged share capital of the Company immediately
following these transactions.
In conjunction with these transactions, the name of
the Company was changed from Freedom4 Group
plc to Daisy Group plc and the financial reporting
year end was changed from 31 December to 
31 March.
Acquisition of the trading assets of 
AT Communications Group plc (“ATC”) and Eurotel
On 3 August 2009 the Group acquired the trading
assets of ATC and Eurotel. Both businesses were
acquired out of administration.
ATC was a Harlow based information and
communications technology company focused on
the delivery of converged solutions that consist of
IP and traditional telephony services to small,
medium and large enterprises. ATC had two
principal revenue streams:-
• fixed line network services
• maintenance, engineering and system
installations
The consideration for the acquisition of the trading
assets of ATC was satisfied through the payment of
£5.7 million in cash and the issue of 1,169,591
warrants, each exercisable into one ordinary share
in the Group at a price of 85.5 pence each.
Eurotel was a Halifax based telecoms services and
equipment supplier. Eurotel had three principal
revenue streams:-
• fixed line network services
• maintenance, engineering and system
installations
• mobile services
The consideration for the acquisition of Eurotel was

Centres Limited (which operated its mobile
distribution business).

the earnings before interest and tax generated by
MCL during a twelve month post-completion 
earn-out period.
The acquisition resulted in the recognition of

recommended cash offer for the entire issued share
capital of BNS including its principal subsidiaries,
BNS Telecom Limited and 3g Comms Limited. The
offer was made in compliance with the City Code
on Takeovers and Mergers, as BNS was listed on the
Alternative Investment Market until 1 June 2009.
BNS was acquired for a cash consideration of 
£10.6 million. The acquisition resulted in the
recognition of goodwill of £5.3 million and
customer relationship intangible assets of

following acquisition. CRC will form part of the
wholesale division.
On 10 June 2010, the Group acquired the entire
issued share capital of Fone Logistics Limited (“FLL”)
for a cash consideration of £3.6 million. FLL will be
managed by Anglia Telecom, part of the mobile
distribution division.
CONTINUING OPERATIONS
It is difficult to compare reported results for 2010
and 2008 as a result of the significant acquisitions,
disposals and restructuring which has occurred
during these periods.
As a result of its intended disposal, the wireless
broadband business, Freedom4 Limited, which was
previously accounted for as a joint venture, has
been classified as held for sale within discontinued
operations. Consequently, the only item reported as
continuing operations in the year ended 
31 December 2008 was the costs of running the
Group’s holding company.
The entire Group’s continuing revenue recognised
in the current period occurred between 21 July
2009 and 31 March 2010.
The revenue and adjusted EBITDA (operating loss
before amortisation, depreciation, impairment of
fixed assets, net exceptional operating costs and
share based payments costs) from continuing
operations were £134.4 million and £11.0 million
respectively (year ended 31 December 2008: £nil
and £(3.4) million respectively). 
The operating loss from continuing operations was
£17.5 million compared to £5.0 million for the year
ended 31 December 2008.
Amortisation of intangible assets in the period was
£20.5 million (year ended 31 December 2008: £nil)
and relates primarily to the customer relationships
acquired from Daisy, Vialtus, ATC, Eurotel,
Redstone, BNS and MCL. These customer
relationships have been valued based on expected
future discounted cash flows and are being
amortised over periods from 3 to 7 years.
Depreciation for the period totalled £1.9 million
(year ended 31 December 2008: £nil) and
consists largely of the charges associated with 
the assets acquired as part of the Vialtus and
Daisy transactions. a a
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 13
Net exceptional operating costs were £5.8 million
(year ended 31 December 2008: £nil) and
comprised employee related restructuring costs of
£5.5 million, other restructuring costs of £6.1 million
and the release to the income statement of
negative goodwill of £5.8 million. The employee
related restructuring costs represent rationalisation
and redundancy costs incurred as part of the
Group’s change programme and the integration of
acquired businesses into the Group’s core
operations. The other restructuring costs and
negative goodwill principally relate to the
businesses purchased out of administration.
Net finance income was £1.3 million (year ended 
31 December 2008: £3.5 million). The majority of
this income was associated with the £17.5 million
loan note arising on the sale of the Group’s hosting
and network division in 2008. The loan note was
fully repaid during the current financial period.
The Group reported a net loss before tax from
continuing operations for the period of 
£16.2 million (year ended 31 December 2008: 
£1.5 million).
Basic and diluted loss per share from continuing
operations for the period was 6.82p (year ended 
31 December 2008: 2.09p). Basic adjusted earnings
per share excluding the after tax effect of
amortisation of acquisition related intangible assets,
impairment of fixed assets, share based payments
costs and net exceptional operating costs (as
detailed in note 8) was 4.10p (2008: 0.12p).
The board is not proposing the payment of a final
dividend (year ended 31 December 2008: £nil).
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Discontinued operations in 2010 represent the
results of the wireless division which comprises
Freedom4 WiFi Limited (the WiFi business) and
Freedom4 Limited (the WiMAX business). Given
the new focus of the Group, these operations
were no longer considered core to the Group’s
future operations.
On 26 February 2010, the WiFi business was sold to
management for a nominal cash consideration
resulting in a loss on disposal of £0.1 million.
On 24 December 2009 and 6 January 2010, the
Group agreed to acquire both Intel Capital
Corporation’s and Intel Capital (Cayman)
Corporation’s investment in the WiMAX business for
a combined consideration of $2, resulting in an
increase in the Group’s shareholding to 97.2%
(2008: 52.4%). As the business is not intended to
form part of the continuing operations of the
Group, it has not been consolidated, and the
increase in the investment has been valued at $2
in accordance with IFRS 5. The Group’s existing
share in the WiMAX business has a carrying value of
£4.9 million, representing the value of the joint
venture on 30 September 2009, the date on which
it became classified at ‘held for sale’ together with
additional funding up to 31 March 2010.
On 17 June 2010 the Group announced that it had
disposed of its WiMAX spectrum licences for a cash
consideration of £12.5 million.
The WiFi business contributed a loss after tax of
£0.3 million in the period (year ended 
31 December 2008: £0.2 million). The Group’s
share of the loss of the WiMAX joint venture was
£2.5 million (year ended 31 December 2008:
£9.6 million).
In 2008, the sale of the hosting and network services
division gave rise to a profit of £48.8 million, which
together with residual income of £1.1 million
associated with the sale of the broadband and voice
division in 2007 and the loss in 2008 from the
wireless division of £9.1 million resulted in a profit
from discontinued operations of £40.8 million for the
year ended 31 December 2008.
BALANCE SHEET
Net assets for the Group at 31 March 2010 were
£179.3 million, compared to £27.7 million at 
31 December 2008, reflecting the injection of
equity funding and the subsequent acquisitions
during the period.
Intangible assets acquired were £187.0 million
(31 December 2008: £0.1 million) and consist
predominantly of acquired customer relationships.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions was £62.3 million
(31 December 2008: £nil). The deferred tax asset of
£12.0 million (31 December 2008: £nil) primarily
relates to tax losses and fixed asset timing
differences for Vialtus, which are expected to be
utilised against future profits.
Trade and other receivables were £39.6 million 
(31 December 2008: £19.0 million) and comprised
trade receivables of £19.1 million (31 December
2008: £0.3 million) and prepayments and other
receivables of £20.5 million (31 December 2008:
£18.7 million).
Cash in the balance sheet at the period end was
£20.0 million (31 December 2008: £4.6 million).
Disposal groups classified as held for sale of
£4.9 million (31 December 2008: £nil) represented
the carrying value of the Group’s interest in the
remaining wireless business, WiMAX. Financial review continued
14 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
Trade and other payables totalled £63.7 million 
(31 December 2008: £1.2 million) and consisted of
trade creditors of £27.4 million (31 December
2008: £0.2 million), accruals and deferred income
of £30.7 million (31 December 2008: £1.0 million)
and other creditors of £5.6 million (31 December
2008: £nil). 
Total borrowings were £28.3 million (31 December
2008: £nil), primarily relating to bank loans and
overdrafts, £27.2 million of which was repayable
within twelve months of the period end date.
Overall net debt was £8.3 million (31 December
2008: net cash of £4.6 million).
In June 2010, the Group entered into a new
£75 million three-year revolving borrowing facility.
This new facility replaces the Group’s previous
finance arrangements, providing adequate funding
to meet the Group’s current cash flow forecast
requirements and to finance further acquisitions.
Other non-current liabilities were £4.8 million 
(31 December 2008: £nil) which included the
contingent earn-out consideration of £2.6 million
payable to the former owners of MCL. The
calculation of this consideration is to be based on
the earnings generated by the business during a
12 month post-completion earn-out period.
Provisions of £2.9 million (31 December 2008: £nil)
were held to cover onerous lease liabilities within
the Vialtus business. The substantial deferred tax
liability of £34.8 million (31 December 2008: £nil)
arose from the IFRS acquisition accounting
treatment applied to customer relationship
intangible asset valuations. This liability will unwind
over future periods as these intangible assets 
are amortised.
CASH FLOW STATEMENT
The significant items disclosed in the cash flow
statement for the period ended 31 March 2010
include the cash outflow of £90.5 million for current
period acquisitions. These acquisitions were part-
funded through the issue of ordinary shares which
generated a cash inflow, after deducting transaction
costs, of £78.5 million.
The loan note of £17.5 million which arose on the
sale of the Group’s hosting and network division in
2008 was fully repaid during the period.
The Group generated a cash outflow from
operations of £1.6 million (year ended
31 December 2008: inflow of£0.1 million) from
its continuing operations which includes
exceptional cash costs of £9.8 million.
The underlying positive operating cashflow
(excluding exceptional cash costs of £9.8 million)
for the period was £8.2 million and is indicative of
the Group’s ability to convert adjusted EBITDA 
to cash.
IFRS 8
IFRS 8, “Operating Segments”, has been adopted
by the Group from 1 January 2009. IFRS 8 requires
the Group to amend its segmental reporting so that
it aligns fully with the internal management
structure. The segments were Daisy retail, Daisy
wholesale, system services, mobile distribution and
central costs consistent with internal reporting and
review processes at 31 March 2010. For the year
ending 31 March 2011, the Group will be changing
its segments and internal reporting processes to
more closely align with the strategic objectives
which will result in the reporting of segmental
information by product group. 
The new segments will be network services, data
solutions, mobile solutions, system services,
wholesale and mobile distribution. We have
disclosed supplementary financial information
including revenue and gross margin in this revised
format within the segmental information of the
consolidated financial statements for the period
ended 31 March 2010.

POLICY ON PAYMENT TO SUPPLIERS
The Group’s supplier payment policy is to agree terms and conditions for business transactions with
suppliers. Suppliers are made aware of the Group’s terms of payment. Payment is then made subject to
these terms and conditions being met. The Company owed £0.8 million to trade creditors at the end of the
period (2008: £0.1 million). The Group had £27.4 million of trade payables at the end of the period
(2008: £0.2 million) which represented 67 payable days (2008: 24 days).
POLITICAL AND CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS
The Group made no political or charitable donations during the period (2008: £nil).
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
The Group’s environmental policy is to meet the statutory requirements placed upon it and to apply good
environmental practice in its operations whilst recognising that it is contractually obliged to meet its
customers’ requirements.
CORPORATE AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Group embraces corporate and social responsibility and encourages all of its subsidiaries to 
become involved in local projects and initiatives on an ad hoc basis dependent upon employee interest
and participation.
RISK
Senior management is aware of its responsibility for managing risks within each business unit. Group risk is
reviewed at board level to ensure that risk management is being implemented and monitored effectively.
The board’s policy is to ensure that the business units are operated effectively and appropriately, bearing in
mind prevailing market conditions, the requirements for timely decision making and commercial reality.
Insurance policies are regularly reviewed to ensure these are adequate and appropriate, in line with the
nature, size and complexity of the business. Standard form contracts are provided for commercial use 
and to assist the varying segments of the business and their commercial function to negotiate within
approved parameters.
See the principal risks and uncertainties section below for details of the Group’s risk management process.
BUSINESS REVIEW
The business review contained within the chairman’s statement, the chief executive’s review and the
financial review, together with the key performance indicators and principal risks and uncertainties
disclosed below, have been provided by the directors in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has disclosed the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development,
performance and position of the business.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs)
KPIs, which are set at Group level, have been devised to allow the board and shareholders to monitor the
Group as a whole, as well as the operating businesses within the Group.
The Group has financial KPIs that it monitors on a regular basis at board level and where relevant at
divisional management meetings as follows:-
• Adjusted EBITDA (continuing operations): £11.0 million (2008: loss of £3.4 million)
• Revenue (continuing operations): £134.4 million (2008: £nil)
• Operating cash flow before working capital movements: outflow of £0.9 million (2008: outflow 
of £2.6 million)
• Net borrowings: £8.3 million (2008: net cash £4.6 million)
• Net assets: £179.3 million (2008: £27.7 million) H H
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 21
The Group has non-financial KPIs that it monitors on a regular basis at board level and where relevant at
divisional management meetings, which are principally as follows:-
• Customer numbers
• Average revenue per user (“ARPU”)
• Customer churn
• Product penetration
• Direct debit penetration
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Group is affected by a number of risks and uncertainties, not all of which are wholly within its control.
Although many of the risks and uncertainties influencing performance are macroeconomic and likely to
affect the performance of businesses generally, others are particular to the Group’s operations.
This section highlights certain of those particular risks and uncertainties affecting the Group’s business but it
is not intended to be an extensive analysis of all such risks and uncertainties. Some risks may be unknown
to the Group and others, currently regarded as immaterial, could turn out to be material. All of them may
have the potential to adversely impact the Group’s business.
The Group has a risk management process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks. 
The Group risk register captures the most significant risks facing the business. Each risk is assigned to a
senior management owner responsible for monitoring and evaluating the risk and the appropriate
mitigation strategies.
The key operational risk to the Group is further deterioration of the global economy. Whilst there have been
improvements in the UK economy during 2010, the level of business activity could be impacted by
continued economic uncertainty and could lead to a reduction in revenue, profitability and cash generation.
Should markets weaken it may become difficult for the Group’s operational businesses to maintain volumes
and pass on price increases to customers. Cash collection could potentially prove more difficult and bad
debts may arise as customers suffer from the recession.
The following additional principal risks are all identified on the Group risk register:-
• Integration 
The significant growth of the Group over the last 15 months has been driven by acquisition and the
Group’s strategy includes the acquisition of further businesses where they are earnings enhancing.
Management recognises that there is a risk of operational disturbance in the course of integrating
acquired businesses into the Group’s existing operations. This risk is mitigated by detailed planning
and due diligence by the Group’s corporate development team and oversight and execution of the
integration of acquired businesses by the Group’s integration team in each case to safeguard future
financial performance and achieve planned synergies.
• Contracts with suppliers 
The Group resells the products of its suppliers and whilst it has the freedom to substitute certain of
these products, management acknowledges that the Group has a reliance on contracts with British
Telecom, Cable & Wireless, Vodafone and O2. The Group closely manages relationships with its main
suppliers and seeks to mitigate the risk created by this reliance by building strong relationships with
such suppliers throughout the business in order to understand and respond to their expectations.
• Technological change 
The market for the Group’s services is characterised by technological changes, frequent introductions
of new products and services and evolving industry standards.There is a risk that the Group may fail to
secure the necessary contracts to supply its customers with the latest technology. The Group mitigates
this risk by maintaining close relationships with the suppliers which it believes will keep it to the
forefront of product development on a sustained basis and regularly monitors trends in technological
advancement so as to anticipate and plan for future changes. Directors’ report continued
22 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
• Key resources 
Consistent with groups of a similar size, the Group is managed by certain key personnel, including
executive directors and senior management, who have significant experience within the Group and the
wider IT communications sectors and who may be difficult to replace. Furthermore, the Group depends
on being able to recruit and retain sales and marketing employees of an appropriate calibre to win and
service significant contracts. The Group has sought to mitigate this resource risk by investing in staff
training programmes, competitive reward and compensation packages, management incentive
schemes and succession planning. The Group has also appointed a HR Director (Clare Martin) to lead
the people agenda for all employees at the multiple sites over which the business operates.
• Regulatory change
The Group recognises that the pricing of products and services and the activities of major industry
organisations, such as British Telecom, may be affected by the actions of regulatory bodies in the UK
and the EU. Such action could affect the Group’s profitability either directly or indirectly. The Group
mitigates this risk by constantly monitoring and assessing the likelihood and potential impact of
regulatory change.
Last year’s annual report and accounts referred to the following priorities and risks, none of which remains
as a significant risk to the current operations of the restructured Group:-
• ensuring that the Freedom4 joint venture meets its commercial roll-out objectives
• recognising the likelihood of delays in fund-raising given the current difficult market conditions
• focusing on the marketing of wireless services, initially through resellers and distributors
• monitoring progress of the application to add mobile services to the WiMAX licence
• predicting the impact of the next spectrum auctions on the competitive landscape
GOING CONCERN
The Group had cash balances of £20.0 million giving an overall net debt position of £8.3 million at 
31 March 2010.
In June 2010 the Group entered into a new £75 million three-year revolving borrowing facility. This new
facility replaced the Group’s previous finance arrangements, providing adequate funding to meet the
Group’s current cash flow forecast requirements and to finance further acquisitions. 
After reviewing Group and Company cash balances, borrowing facilities and projected cash flows, the
directors believe that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue operations for the
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.
TREASURY POLICY AND LIQUIDITY
The Group maintains borrowing lines estimated to be sufficient to cover forecast cash requirements. In this
assessment, the Group only takes into account existing or renewing facilities and new facilities where these
have received credit approval or equivalent.
The Group uses financial instruments to raise finance and manage risk for its operations. It does not
undertake any speculative trading in derivative financial instruments.
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies, including those concerning interest rate
risk, credit risk and liquidity risk, are disclosed in note 21 of the Group financial statements.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Annual General Meeting will be held on 7 September 2010 at 11.00 am at the offices of Liberum
Capital Limited, Ropemaker Place, Level 12, 25 Ropemaker Street, London EC2Y 9AR. 
At the Annual General Meeting resolutions will be proposed to receive these financial statements and the
directors’ and auditors’ reports, to re-appoint Matthew Riley, Anthony Riley, Ian Butcher, Laurence Blackall
and Ian McKenzie who were appointed since the last annual general meeting and to re-elect
Christina Kennedy who is retiring by rotation at the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the
Company’s articles of association, and to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors and to
fix their remuneration. H H
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 23
The approval of a new long term incentive plan will also be sought at the Annual General Meeting. The
Company’s existing long term incentive plan was originally adopted by shareholders of the Company at the
annual general meeting in 2000 and was amended in 2001, 2002 and 2009. It permits the grant of awards
to selected employees (including executive directors). The current plan expires on 25 June 2010 (that is, no
awards may be made after that date). The approval of shareholders will be sought to adopt a new plan to
permit the grant of awards up to 26 June 2020. A summary of the principal terms of the proposed new long
term incentive plan is set out in Appendix 1 to the Notice of Annual General Meeting. 
In order to maintain flexibility to act in a manner which promotes the success of the Company for the
benefit of its members, the directors will also seek: (i) authority to allot shares generally in respect of
ordinary shares having an aggregate nominal value of up to £1,764,705, representing approximately one
third of the issued share capital of the Company; (ii) additional authority to allot further shares by way of a
fully pre-emptive rights issue in respect of ordinary shares having an aggregate nominal value of up to
£1,764,705, representing approximately a further one third of the issued share capital of the Company; and
(iii) a disapplication of pre-emption rights in respect of ordinary shares having an aggregate nominal value
of up to £1,058,823, representing approximately twenty per cent. of the issued share capital of the
Company. The directors will also seek authority to buy back up to 52,941,179 ordinary shares, representing
twenty per cent. of the issued share capital of the Company. The directors have no present intention to allot
any shares or to buy back any shares under the authorities being sought.
Changes to the Company’s articles of association will also be proposed at the Annual General Meeting in
order to update them to take into account recent changes in company law (including changes brought
about by the Companies Act 2006). The principal changes introduced by the new articles are summarised
in Appendix 2 to the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’ LIABILITY INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY
The Company has purchased insurance to cover its directors and officers against the costs of defending
themselves in legal proceedings taken against them in that capacity and in respect of any damages
resulting from those proceedings. In accordance with section 236(2) of the Companies Act 2006 the
directors disclose a qualifying third party indemnity provision entered into between the Company and its
directors and officers which was in force at the date of approval of this report. Neither the insurance nor the
indemnity provides cover where the director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
So far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are
unaware. Relevant audit information is defined as information needed by the Company’s auditors in
connection with preparing their report. Each director has taken all the steps (such as making enquiries of
other directors and the auditors and any other steps required by the director’s duty to exercise due care,
skill and diligence) that they ought to have taken in their duty as a director in order to make themselves
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of 
that information.
AUDITORS
In August 2009 KPMG Audit plc (“KPMG”) submitted their resignation as auditors and formally confirmed
that there were no matters concerning their resignation that needed to be brought to shareholders’
attention. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) were appointed by the board as auditors to the Company
with effect from the date of KPMG’s resignation to hold office until the conclusion of the 2010 Annual
General Meeting.
The auditors, PwC, have indicated their willingness to continue in office and a resolution concerning their
reappointment will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
This report was approved by the board on 21 June 2010.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The remuneration committee comprises Christina Kennedy, Laurence Blackall and Ian McKenzie and is
chaired by Christina Kennedy.
The committee meets not less than twice a year to determine all aspects of the remuneration of the
executive directors and other senior managers. The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by
the board as a whole. No director or employee has a role in determining their own remuneration.
During the period, the remuneration committee has taken advice from Ernst & Young LLP
regarding remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The committee determines overall policy for executive remuneration. The committee sets levels of
remuneration to attract, retain and motivate executive directors and other senior managers and, in doing
so, takes into account the level of remuneration throughout the telecommunications industry. Employees
throughout the Group, including executive directors, have performance reviews annually.
The main components of the executive directors’ and senior managers’ remuneration are:-
• a competitive base salary;
• an annual performance bonus;
• pension provision;
• benefits in kind; and
• share awards.
The Group operates a discretionary bonus scheme. The scheme applies to directors, senior managers and
certain other employees. Individual payments made under the scheme are generally dependent on the
Company achieving its financial targets and the attainment of individual objectives.
The Group makes contributions to money purchase personal pension schemes on behalf of certain
executive directors and senior managers.
Other customary benefits, such as car allowances, permanent health insurance and life assurance, are made
available as appropriate.
The Group currently operates one share option scheme, “the Daisy Group plc Executive Share Option
Scheme”. Details of awards made under the scheme are given in note 10 to the Group financial statements. 
This scheme will expire on 25 June 2010. A new scheme will be proposed to shareholders for approval 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
DIRECTORS’ SERVICE CONTRACTS
The service contracts of executive directors remain in force until age 65 and continue until terminated by
either party giving to the other not less than 12 months’ written notice (or as otherwise terminated in
accordance with their other terms).
The service contracts of non-executive directors remain in force for an initial term of 12 months, unless
terminated by either party giving to the other not less than three months’ written notice, save that the
service contract of Christina Kennedy remains in force until terminated by either party giving to the other
not less than 12 months’ written notice.
Details of directors’ remuneration and emoluments can be found in note 9 of the Group financial statements.

Chair of the remuneration committee
21 June 2010 Corporate governance 
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 25
The board is responsible to shareholders for effective direction and control of the Group and this report
describes the framework for corporate governance and internal control that the directors have established
to enable them to carry out this responsibility. Although, as an AIM listed company, the Company is not
required to comply with the provisions of the Combined Code (“the Code”) and this is not a statement of
compliance as required by the Code, the board of directors recognises the importance of, and is
committed to, ensuring that effective corporate governance procedures are in place appropriate for a
public company of its size and complexity.
THE BOARD AND COMMITTEES
Board
The board is responsible for the overall strategy and financial performance of the Group and has a formal
schedule of matters reserved for its approval. Each board meeting is preceded by a clear agenda and any
relevant information is provided to directors in advance of the meeting. The Company has established
properly constituted audit, remuneration and nomination committees of the board with formally delegated
duties and responsibilities. Terms of reference for each of these committees can be found on the
Company’s website (www.daisyplc.com).
At 1 January 2009 the board comprised two executive directors (Michael Read and Stewart Porter) and two
non-executive directors (Peter Dubens (chairman) and Christina Kennedy). Peter Dubens became an
executive director on 21 July 2009. Matthew Riley, Ian McKenzie and Laurence Blackall were appointed as
directors on 21 July 2009, Ian Butcher was appointed on 3 August 2009 and Anthony Riley was appointed
on 1 September 2009. Stewart Porter and Michael Read resigned as directors on 31 August 2009 and
7 December 2009 respectively.
Christina Kennedy and Ian Butcher are considered to be independent non-executive directors as defined
under the Code. Christina Kennedy is the senior independent director.
An evaluation of board performance is required under the Code. Due to the significant changes to the
business during the period, the board did not feel that it would be appropriate to conduct a review at this
time. The board met on seven occasions during the period to discuss operational business. All directors
were in attendance with the exception of one meeting where Ian Butcher did not attend.
An agreed procedure exists for directors in the furtherance of their duties to take independent professional
advice. Newly appointed directors are made aware of their responsibilities through the company secretary.
The Company provides training to directors where required.
No individual or group of directors dominates the board’s decision making. Collectively, the non-executive
directors bring a valuable range of expertise in assisting the Group to achieve its strategic aims.
Since September 2003 the roles of chairman and chief executive officer have been separate. The chairman
is responsible for the effective running of the board and the chief executive is ultimately responsible for all
operational matters and the financial performance of the Group.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee’s principal responsibility is to determine the framework or broad policy for the
remuneration of the chairman and the executive directors, to consider and determine all elements of the
remuneration of those directors and to review board performance. No director takes part in any discussion
concerning his own position.
Until 21 July 2009 the remuneration committee comprised Christina Kennedy and Peter Dubens only.
With effect from 21 July 2009 the remuneration committee comprises Christina Kennedy, Ian McKenzie and
Laurence Blackall and is chaired by Christina Kennedy. The board report on directors’ remuneration on
page 24 contains a detailed description of the Group’s remuneration policy. The committee met on three
occasions during the period. All members were in attendance on each occasion. Corporate governance continued
26 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
Nomination committee
Given the small size of the board until 3 September 2009 the board did not appoint a nomination
committee. With effect from 3 September 2009 the nomination committee comprises Christina Kennedy,
Laurence Blackall and Ian McKenzie and is chaired by Christina Kennedy. The nomination committee
considers the appointment of all directors and senior managers and regularly reviews the structure, size
and composition (including skills, knowledge and experience) of the board and makes recommendations
with regard to any changes. The articles of association of the Company require directors to retire from office
at the first annual general meeting following appointment (at which point they are eligible for
reappointment) and then every three years by rotation, but in accordance with good practice one third of
the directors are submitted for re-election each year. The nomination committee has had one meeting
during the period in relation to the re-elections by rotation at this year’s Annual General Meeting, without
Christina Kennedy present, and believes that she continues to be effective and demonstrates commitment
to her role. The nomination committee and board unanimously recommend the election and appointment
of all board members offering themselves for re-election or re-appointment.
Audit committee
The audit committee is responsible for the independent monitoring of the effectiveness of the system of
internal control, compliance, accounting policies and published financial statements on behalf of the board.
It receives and reviews reports from the Company’s management and auditors relating to the interim and
annual financial statements and the accounting and internal control systems in use throughout the Group.
Any significant findings or identified risks are examined so that appropriate action may be taken.
Until 21 July 2009 the audit committee comprised Christina Kennedy (chairwoman) and Peter Dubens.
The audit committee has comprised Laurence Blackall (chairman) and Christina Kennedy since 21 July 2009
and Ian Butcher since 3 August 2009. Ian Butcher is considered by the board to have recent and relevant
financial experience. The committee operates under written terms of reference and is scheduled to meet at
least twice a year with the Company’s external auditors, and with the executive directors present by invitation
only. The committee met twice during the period. All members were in attendance. The committee meets with
the external auditors without the executive directors present as it considers appropriate.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Company has procedures for the disclosure and review of any conflicts, or potential conflicts, of interest
which the directors may have and for the authorisation of such conflict matters by the board. In deciding
whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict the directors must have regard to their general duties
under the Companies Act 2006. The authorisation of a conflict matter, and the terms of authorisation, may
be reviewed at any time by the board. The board considers that these procedures are operating effectively.
Peter Dubens, executive chairman of the Company, is a director of, albeit with no shareholding in, Oakley
Capital Private Equity L.P . (“Oakley”). On 21 July 2009 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital
of Vialtus Holdings Limited together with the shares in Vialtus Solutions Limited not held by Vialtus Holdings
Limited and a debt due from Vialtus Solutions Limited to Host Europe WVS Limited of £42.0 million for a
consideration of £44.5 million (including costs), satisfied by the payment of £13.0 million in cash and the
issue of 36,250,000 fully paid ordinary shares in the Company. As Peter Dubens held an interest in the
vendor (of which Oakley is the holding entity) he did not take part in decisions of the Company relating to
this acquisition. Accordingly, an independent committee of the board, comprising all of the independent
directors and chaired by Christina Kennedy, was established to consider and, if thought fit, approve any
proposals in relation to the potential acquisition. Peter Dubens did not take part in the Company’s decision
to propose that a resolution to approve the acquisition should be put to shareholders at the general
meeting held on 20 July 2009. These matters were dealt with by the independent directors. Peter Dubens,
who owned 58,333,334 ordinary shares of 0.1p each in the Company at the relevant time, also undertook to
abstain from voting on the relevant shareholder resolution. H H
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 27
RELATIONSHIPS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company encourages the participation of both institutional and private investors. Communication with
private individuals is maintained through the annual general meeting and the Company’s annual and
interim reports. The chairmen of the Company’s audit, remuneration and nomination committees are made
available to answer questions at the Company’s annual general meetings.
In addition, further details on the strategy and performance of the Company can be found at its website
(www.daisyplc.com) which includes copies of the Company’s press releases. Regular updates are provided
to the board on meetings with shareholders and analysts, and broker’s opinions are made available to the
board. As provided by the Combined Code, non-executive directors are available to meet major
shareholders, if required. The Company’s share registrars provide a helpdesk, which members may contact
with enquiries regarding their shareholdings. The helpdesk telephone number is 0871 664 0300* 
(or +44 20 8639 3399 for overseas callers) and the helpdesk’s e-mail address is ssd@capitaregistrars.com
INTERNAL CONTROL
The board maintains full control and direction over appropriate strategic, financial, organisational and
compliance issues. The Group has an organisational structure with clearly defined lines of authority,
responsibility and accountability, which is reviewed regularly.
The annual budget and forecasts are reviewed by the board prior to approval being given. This includes the
identification and assessment of the business risks inherent in the Group and the telecommunications
sector as a whole along with associated financial risks.
The board has overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and for monitoring their
effectiveness. Although no system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss, the Group’s systems are designed to provide the directors with reasonable assurance
that issues are identified on a timely basis and dealt with appropriately. 
The Group’s key internal financial control procedures include:
• a budgeting programme with an annual budget approved by the board;
• a review by the board of actual results compared with budget and forecasts;
• reviews by the board of year end forecasts;
• the establishment of procedures for acquisitions, capital expenditure and expenditure incurred in the
ordinary course of business;
• the appraisal and approval of proposed acquisitions by the board;
• the detailed budgeting and monitoring of costs incurred on the development of new products;
• the reporting to, and review by, the board of changes in legislation and practices within the sector and
accounting and legal developments pertinent to the Company; and
• the appointing of experienced and suitably qualified staff to take responsibility for key business
functions to ensure maintenance of high standards of performance.
The external auditors are engaged to express an opinion on the financial statements. They discuss with
management the reporting of operational results and the financial condition of the Group, to the extent
necessary to express their audit opinion.
During the period the board considered the need for an internal audit function but resolved that, due to
the size of the Group, this could not be justified on the grounds of cost effectiveness.

28 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
AUDIT AND AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE
An additional responsibility of the audit committee is to keep under review the scope and cost effectiveness
of the external audit. This includes recommending to the board the appointment of the external auditors
and for reviewing the scope of the audit, approving the audit fee and, on an annual basis, satisfying the
committee that the auditors are independent.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are retained to perform audit and audit related work on the Group, the
Company and the majority of Group companies.
The committee monitors the nature and extent of non-audit work undertaken by the auditors. It is satisfied
that there are adequate controls in place to ensure auditor independence and objectivity. The matter is kept
under review and is a standing item on the agenda for the audit committee. Periodically, the audit
committee monitors the cost of non-audit work undertaken by the auditors. The audit committee considers
that it is in a position to take action if at any time it believes that there is a risk of the auditors’
independence being undermined through the award of this work.
Details of audit and non-audit fees for the period under review are disclosed in note 12 of the Group
financial statements.
GOING CONCERN
As set out more fully in the directors’ report, the directors have formed the conclusion that the Company
and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The financial statements have, therefore, been prepared on the going concern basis. Statement of directors’ responsibilities
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 29
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts in accordance with applicable
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial
period. Under that law the directors have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and the Company
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom accounting standards and applicable law).
Under company law the directors must not approve the Group and Company financial statements unless
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and United Kingdom accounting
standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
Group and Company financial statements, respectively; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position
of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions. Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Daisy Group plc
30 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
We have audited the Group financial statements of Daisy Group plc for the period ended 31 March 2010
which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated
statement of changes in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes to the
consolidated financial statements. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 29, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not,
in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation
of the financial statements.

DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 35
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Daisy Group plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together “the Group”) provide telecommunication
and managed services to UK SME and mid-market businesses. The Company is a public limited company
which is listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange and is
incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is Daisy House, Lindred Road
Business Park, Nelson, Lancashire BB9 5SR.
Following the reverse acquisition of the Company (under AIM rules) in July 2009 (see acquisitions section of
the directors’ report ), the Company changed its name from Freedom4 Group plc to Daisy Group plc and
changed its year end from 31 December to 31 March. Consequently the financial statements have been
prepared for the 15 months to 31 March 2010. As a result of the different accounting period lengths and
the acquisitions that have occurred, the results are not directly comparable to the prior year.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), International
Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historic cost
convention, modified to reflect the requirements of IFRS as adopted by the EU. In preparing the financial
statements, the directors are required to use certain critical accounting estimates and are required to
exercise judgement in the application of accounting policies. The principal accounting policies set out
below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
In all cases references to “EBITDA” relate to operating result from continuing operations before
amortisation, depreciation and impairment of fixed assets. References to “adjusted EBITDA” also exclude
share-based payment costs and net exceptional operating costs.
The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time in the financial
period beginning 1 January 2009:-
• IAS 1 (revised), ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’. The most significant change within IAS 1
(revised) is the requirement to produce a statement of comprehensive income setting out all items of
income and expense relating to non-owner changes in equity. There is choice between presenting
comprehensive income in one statement or in two statements comprising an income statement and a
separate statement of comprehensive income. As there are no further items of comprehensive income
other than as presented in the consolidated income statement, this has no impact for the current
period. In addition, IAS 1 (revised) requires the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity to be
presented as a primary statement. The other revisions to IAS 1 have not had a significant impact on the
presentation of the Group’s financial information.
• IFRS 8, ‘Operating Segments’. IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14, ‘Segment Reporting’, and requires the disclosure
of segment information on the same basis as the management information provided to the chief
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Group board
of directors. The impact of the adoption of this standard is disclosed in note 4.
• IFRS 2 (amendment), ‘Share-based payment’. The amendment deals with vesting conditions and
cancellations. It clarifies that the only conditions that are vesting are service conditions and
performance conditions only and other features of a share-based payment are not. The Group has
adopted IFRS 2 (amendment) from 1 January 2009. The amendment does not have a significant
impact on the Group financial statements. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
36 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
• IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments – Disclosures’ (amendment), the amendment requires enhanced
disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk. The amendment does not have a
significant impact on the Group financial statements.
• IAS 23 (revised), ‘Borrowing Costs’. IAS 23 (revised). The amendment requires the capitalisation of
borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a
qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use). The adoption of this
standard has resulted in a change in accounting policy as the Group previously elected to expense
borrowing costs as incurred. The amendment does not have a significant impact on the Group
financial statements
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are not yet effective and have not been early
adopted by the Group:-
• IFRS 3 (revised), ‘Business Combinations’ and consequential amendments to IAS 27, ‘Consolidated and
Separate Financial Statements, IAS 28, ‘Investments in Associates’ and IAS 31, ‘Interests in Joint
Ventures’, effective prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after
the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The revised
standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, with some significant
changes. The Group will apply IFRS 3 (revised) to all business combinations arising from 1 April 2010.
The amendment does not have a significant impact on the Group financial statements as retrospective
application is not required.
A number of other standards and interpretations have been issued, but are not yet effective and have not
been early adopted. These are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group or Company’s
financial statements.
2.2 CONSOLIDATION
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Daisy Group plc
(“the Company”) and enterprises controlled by the Company (its “subsidiaries”). The excess of cost of
acquisition over the fair values of the Group’s share of identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as
goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired
(“negative goodwill”) is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and
liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
initially measured at fair value at the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting
policies used into line with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are
eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence
of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Joint ventures and associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not
control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a long term basis and which is
jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement. H H
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 37
The results and assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of associates and jointly controlled entities are
incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting except when classified as
held for sale. In the income statement the Group’s share of net income/loss of its joint venture is included in
operating income as the operations of the joint venture are related to telecommunications. Included in the
Group’s share of the net income/loss in the joint venture is interest accrued on the redeemable preference
shares. The interest income is calculated using a market interest rate on the outstanding debt element of
the preference shares, adjusted for each cash injection as appropriate.
The Group’s share of post acquisition movement in the joint venture reserves is recognised in reserves.
Investments in associates and jointly controlled entities are carried in the balance sheet as the Group’s
share of the net assets of associates or jointly controlled entities. Losses of the associates or jointly
controlled entities in excess of the Group’s interest in those associates or jointly controlled entities 
are not recognised.
Any excess of cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of identifiable net assets 
acquired of the associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. 
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair values of identifiable 
net assets of the associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition (a discount on acquisition) 
is recognised in the income statement.
The gain or loss arising on joint venture relates to changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the joint
venture arising from additional capital contributions made by the venturers during the year, which are not in
line with the original ownership stakes prior to the capital contribution.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate or jointly controlled entity of the Group, unrealised
profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the relevant associate or jointly
controlled entity. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case
appropriate provision is made for impairment.
2.3 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The presentational currency of the Group is sterling. Transactions in currencies other than sterling are
recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date,
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was
determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the year.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of overseas operations are translated at exchange rates
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange
rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the
Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the
period in which the operation is disposed. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date
of transition to IFRS as sterling denominated assets and liabilities.
All Group companies have a functional currency of sterling which is consistent with the presentational
currency of the Group’s financial statements.
2.4 SEGMENT REPORTING
In accordance with IFRS 8, operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal
reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is
responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been
identified as the Group board of directors. The Group’s segments comprise Daisy Retail, Daisy Wholesale,
System Services, Mobile Distribution and Central which are those businesses reported in the 
Group’s management accounts used by the board of directors as the primary means for analysing 
trading performance. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
38 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Segmental revenue represents the total revenue of each business within a reporting segment and includes
inter segment revenues. Segmental profit is the measure used to assess performance internally and is
calculated as earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation, impairment of fixed assets, share
based payment costs and net exceptional operating costs (“adjusted EBITDA”), through to operating result.
2.5 REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and
services in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. Where goods and/or services are sold in one
bundled transaction, the Group allocates the total arrangement’s consideration to the different individual
elements based on their relative fair values. Management determines the fair values of individual
components based on actual amounts charged by the Group on a stand-alone basis, or alternatively based
on comparable pricing arrangements observable in the market. Revenue is shown net of value added tax,
returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales between Group companies.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that
the future economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the entity and when specific criteria
have been achieved. Where the Group acts as an agent in a transaction, it recognises revenue net of directly
attributable costs. Revenue recognition for each of the Group’s main activities is described below. To the
extent that invoices are raised, by agreement with the customer, to a different pattern than the revenue
recognition described below, appropriate adjustments are made through deferred and accrued income.
Mobile and fixed line network services
Mobile and fixed line network services (voice and data) principally consist of service and usage charges.
Service charges are recognised evenly over the period to which the service relates. Usage charges are
recognised in the period when the service is received by the customer.
Where period discounts are offered, the discount is spread evenly over the contract.
Commissions receivable from mobile network operators for new connections or the resigning of an existing
contract are recognised in line with the fulfilment of the associated obligation. Separate provision is made
for any anticipated liabilities.
Hardware, licences and installation
The Group sells and installs telephony systems. Revenue from the sale and installation of hardware and
associated licences is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of
ownership have passed to the buyer, usually on installation. External costs associated with the installation
are recorded as work-in-progress until the revenue has been recognised. Revenue in respect of licences is
only recognised where there are no ongoing obligations. Where ongoing obligations exist revenue is
deferred as appropriate.
The system may be sold as part of a package including network services and maintenance. Customer
discounts, such as free maintenance or free line rental for a period of the contract, are apportioned
between the system sale and the associated service based on sales value.
Where hardware and associated licences are leased to customers under a finance lease arrangement, lease
income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method, which reflects a constant
periodic rate of return. Where assets are leased out under an operating lease arrangement, lease income is
recognised over the term of the lease on a straight line basis.
Maintenance
The Group provides maintenance services for telephony systems. Revenue is recognised evenly over the
contract period. Fees charged to customers for the provision of maintenance and support services is
recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the related agreement.
Engineering
Revenue from the sale and installation of hardware is recognised in the income statement when the
significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer, usually on installation. Costs associated
with this revenue are recognised in the same month. H H
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 39
Hosting
Revenue from the sale and installation of hardware and software is recognised in the income statement
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer, usually on installation. 
Costs associated with this revenue are recognised in the same month.
Revenue from hosting services, including shared and dedicated hosting, are deferred and recognised
evenly over the period to which the contract relates. Domain name income is recognised in full on
registration of the associated domain names.
Mobile distribution
Revenue from the provision of hardware is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks
and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer, usually on delivery. 
Upfront commissions receivable from mobile network operators are recognised in the month of connection.
Revenue share commissions are recognised on usage by the end customer.
2.6 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Items that are material and non-operating or non-recurring in nature are presented as exceptional items in
the income statement, within the relevant account heading. Items that may give rise to classification as
exceptional items include, but are not limited to, significant Group restructuring and rationalisation
programmes, asset impairments and profits or losses on the disposal of businesses.
The directors are of the opinion that the separate recording of exceptional items provides helpful
information about the Group’s underlying business performance.
2.7 FINANCE REVENUE AND COSTS
Interest payable on borrowings, the interest expense component of finance lease payments and interest
income is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method. 
2.8 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Under the requirements of IFRS 3, all business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method
(“acquisition accounting”). The cost of a business combination is the aggregate of the fair values, at the date
of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, equity instruments issued by the acquirer and
any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The cost of a business combination is allocated
at the acquisition date by recognising the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
that satisfy the recognition criteria, at their fair values at that date. The acquisition date is the date on which
the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree. An intangible asset, such as customer or supplier
relationships, computer software and licences, is recognised if it meets the definition of an intangible asset
in IAS 38, ‘Intangible Assets’ and its fair value can be measured reliably.
2.9 GOODWILL
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest
in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or
jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Upon the acquisition of subsidiaries, goodwill is separately disclosed. Goodwill on acquisition of associates
and jointly controlled entities is included in investment in associates and jointly controlled entities.
At each balance sheet date goodwill is reviewed for impairment using a discounted cash flow method
applied to business forecasts. If this review demonstrates that impairment has occurred, this is expensed to
the income statement immediately and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made
to those cash generating units or groups of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the
business combination in which the goodwill arose identified according to operating segment.
Negative goodwill arises when the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of acquisition. Negative goodwill is recognised immediately in
the income statement. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
40 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is
included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
2.10 OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are initially measured at either cost or fair value and amortised on a
straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, which are reviewed on an annual basis. The fair value
attributable to intangible assets acquired through a business combination is determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows to be generated from that asset at the risk adjusted weighted average cost of
capital for the Group. The residual values of intangible assets are assumed to be nil.
The estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets are as follows:-
Customer lists and relationships: life of the customer contract between 2 and 7 years.
Supplier relationships: life of the supplier relationship between 2 and 3 years.
Computer software: 2 to 3 years.
Wireless licences (WiMAX): 20 years.
Telecommunication licences: 2 to 5 years.
The following are the main categories of intangible assets:
Contract related intangible assets (customer and supplier relationships)
Customer and supplier portfolios acquired as part of a business combination are initially measured at fair
value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives. Assumptions are used in
estimating the fair value of acquired intangible assets and include management’s estimates of revenue and
profits to be generated by the acquired businesses. Separate values are not attributed to internally
generated customer and supplier relationships.
Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring
into use the specific software and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products
controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one
year, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development, employee costs
and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Telecommunication licences
Licences paid to regulatory bodies, which permit telecommunication activities to be operated for defined
periods, are initially recorded at cost and amortised from the time the network is available for use to the
end of the licence period.
Subscriber acquisition costs
Subscriber acquisition costs (included within customer lists and relationships) comprise the direct 
third-party costs of recruiting and retaining customers, net of incentives from network operators and
provision for in-contract churn. These costs are expensed as incurred, unless they meet the criteria for
capitalisation as an intangible asset, to the extent that they are supported by expected future cash inflows,
in which case they are amortised on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the customer life and the
contractual period. Past experience has demonstrated that only subscriber acquisition costs arising in the
Group’s fixed line business are likely to meet the criteria for capitalisation.
2.11 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is included in the balance sheet at historical cost, less accumulated
depreciation and any impairment losses. Included within the cost for network infrastructure and equipment
are direct labour, contractors’ charges, materials and directly attributable overheads. H H
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 41
On disposal of property, plant and equipment, the difference between the sale proceeds and the net book
value at the date of disposal is recorded in the income statement.
Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment on a straight line basis from the time the asset
is available for use, so as to write off the asset’s cost over the estimated useful life taking into account any
expected residual value. Freehold land is not subject to depreciation.
The lives assigned to principal categories of assets are as follows:-
Leasehold improvements: shorter of unexpired portion of lease or 10 years.
Network infrastructure: 2 to 10 years.
Computer equipment: 3 to 4 years.
Office equipment: 3 to 5 years.
Motor vehicles: 3 to 5 years.
Residual values, remaining useful economic lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually and
adjusted prospectively if appropriate.
2.12 IMPAIRMENT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever there is an
indication that an asset may be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement if the recoverable amount (being the higher of
fair value less costs to sell and value in use) of an asset or cash generating unit falls below its carrying value
in the balance sheet.
Such impairment losses may be reversed in subsequent periods if there is an indication that the impairment
loss recognised in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased.
2.13 NON-CURRENT ASSETS (OR DISPOSAL GROUPS) HELD FOR SALE
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is
to be principally recovered through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are
stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is to be
recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
2.14 LEASES
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the
arrangement at inception date; whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific
asset or assets or the arrangement conveys the right to use the asset.
Group as a lessee
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all of the risks and rewards of
ownership are classified as finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at inception at
the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Capitalised leased assets are subsequently depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the asset’s
useful life.
Obligations related to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included as
appropriate under current, or non-current borrowings. Lease payments are apportioned between the
finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
42 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Lease payments made under operating leases are
charged to the income statement as an expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
If a sale and leaseback transaction results in the creation of an operating lease and it is clear that the
transaction is established at fair value, any profit or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Group as a lessor
Assets leased to a customer under arrangements that meet the relevant criteria of IAS 17 are classified as
finance leases. The fair value of the assets provided to the end customer are recognised as a receivable.
There are no guaranteed residual values available to the Group at the end of any finance leases, and as
unguaranteed residual values are not considered to be material to the Group, they are not included in the
net investment in the finance lease.
Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method, which reflects a
constant periodic rate of return.
Any gain or loss on early termination of leases, calculated as the total net sums recovered and the 
book value of net investments in finance leases, is recognised in the income statement when such
terminations arise.
2.15 INVENTORIES
Inventory mainly comprises items of equipment held for sale or rental and consumable items. Equipment
held and consumable items are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after
provisions for obsolescence. Cost is based on the price of purchase and is calculated on a first-in-first-out
basis. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less additional costs to completion
and disposal.
2.16 PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount
can be reliably estimated. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the liability.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the
restructuring which has been notified to affected parties. Onerous lease provisions have been measured at
the lower of the cost to fulfil the contract or the cost of terminating the contract.
2.17 CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other
years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax
is calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation
of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it
is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial
recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets
and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. H H
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 43
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in
subsidiaries and associates, and interests in jointly controlled entities, except where the Group is able to
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by
the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates
to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
2.18 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Share based payments
The Group operates a share option programme which allows Group employees to acquire shares of
the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in
equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees
become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using the
binomial method for schemes up to 31 December 2008 and using the Black-Scholes method for schemes
thereafter. Both methods take into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the
effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. Non-market vesting
conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to
vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a
corresponding adjustment to equity.
The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined
contribution plans where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a
defined contribution retirement benefit plan.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future
payments is available.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when an employment is terminated before the normal retirement date,
or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group
recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either: terminating the employment
of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal; or providing
termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due
more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are discounted to present value.
Holiday pay
Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as the
benefits are earned. An accrual is made at the balance sheet date to reflect the fair value of holidays earned
but not yet taken. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
44 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its investments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through the
income statement and loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the
investments were acquired. Management determines the classification of its investments at initial
recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that financial assets 
are impaired.
All financial assets are held at amortised cost except for derivatives, which are classified as held for trading
and are held at fair value.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables
is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due
according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original
effective interest rate. The loss is recognised in the income statement within ‘operating costs’. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and bank deposits repayable on demand. For the purposes
of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are
shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method except for
derivatives, which are classified as held for trading and are held at fair value. Financial liabilities held 
at amortised cost include trade payables, accruals, onerous lease provisions, deferred consideration 
and borrowings.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value, which is usually the original invoiced amount, and
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at the value of the amount received, net of
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at
amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income
statement over the period of the borrowing using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group makes use of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising
from financing activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative
financial instruments for trading purposes. Given the conditions applicable to the specific derivative
instrument the Group holds, it is not deemed to meet the criteria as required by IAS 39 to permit 
hedge accounting.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value, i.e. cost. Subsequent to initial
recognition derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement
to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement as a component of financing income 
or costs. H H
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 45
The fair value of the derivative financial instruments is the estimated amount that the Group would receive
or pay to terminate the instrument at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and
the current creditworthiness of the instrument counterparties. 
2.20 SHARE CAPITAL
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the
consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted
from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or
disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any
directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity
attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
2.21 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST (EBT)
The assets and liabilities of the Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) have been included in the Group financial
statements. Any assets held by the EBT cease to be recognised on the Group balance sheet when the
assets vest unconditionally in identified beneficiaries. The costs of purchasing own shares held by the EBT
are shown as a deduction against equity. The proceeds from the sale of own shares held increase equity.
Neither the purchase nor sale of own shares leads to a gain or loss being recognised in the Group 
income statement.
2.22 DIVIDENDS
Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the year in which they are declared and approved by the
Company’s shareholders in general meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates
will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. Management continually evaluates the estimates,
assumptions and judgements based on available information and experience. The estimates and
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Revenue recognition and presentation of arrangements with multiple deliverables 
In revenue arrangements including more than one deliverable, the deliverables are assigned to one or
more separate components of revenue and the arrangement consideration is allocated to each component
based on its relative fair value. 
Determining the fair value of each deliverable can require complex estimates due to the nature of the
goods and services provided. The Group generally determines the fair value of individual elements based
on prices at which the deliverable is regularly sold on a standalone basis or based on comparable pricing
arrangements observable in the market.
Receivables
Debts are recognised to the extent that they are judged to be recoverable. Management reviews are
performed to estimate the level of provision required for irrecoverable debt. Provisions are made
specifically against invoices and finance lease receivables to appropriately reflect any uncertainty as to
ultimate collection.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is more likely than not that sufficient and
suitable taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences
can be deducted. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
46 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (continued)
Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular
legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised. Historical differences
between forecast and actual taxable profits have not resulted in material adjustments to the recognition of
deferred tax assets.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment as at the transition date and thereafter
for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and at other
times when such indicators exist. Other non-financial assets are tested for impairment when there are
indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
When value in use calculations are undertaken, management must estimate the expected future cash flows
from the asset or cash generating unit and choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present
value of those cash flows.
Valuation of acquired intangible assets
Acquisitions may result in customer relationships, supplier relationships, licences and computer software
being recognised. These are valued using discounted cash flow methods which require the application of
certain key judgements and estimates are required to be made in respect of discount rates, customer churn
and future cash flows.
4. SEGMENT INFORMATION
For the year ending 31 March 2011, the Group will be changing the segments and internal reporting
processes to more closely align with strategic objectives which will result in the reporting of segmental
information by product group and channel to market product group. The new segments will be network
services, data solutions, mobile solutions and system services. The new channel segments will bewholesale
and mobile distribution. Supplementary financial information for revenue and gross margin in this revised
format has been disclosed within the current period segmental information as follows:-
Network Data Mobile System Mobile
Services Solutions Solutions Services Wholesale Distribution Total
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000

Gross profit 26,622 11,832 2,058 6,262 2,581 2,221 51,576 
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance
of the operating segments, has been identified as the Group board of directors. Operating segments, for
the period to 31 March 2010, were determined on the basis of the reports reviewed by the Group board of
directors. The segments at 31 March 2010 comprised:-
Daisy Retail – the provision of integrated voice and data services to the small-medium business market
including access, hosting, voice, managed services, telephone systems, maintenance and mobile telephony.
Daisy Wholesale – working exclusively through channel, the wholesale segment supplies partners with
billing, provisioning and business software solutions in addition to voice, lines and data services.
System Services – the provision of third party services to channel partners in the UK ICT market. The System
Services business was formed to provide traditional and IP-based carrier and engineering services.
Mobile Distribution – the distribution business to the independent mobile channel.
Central – consists of unallocated central activities which do not represent a separate reportable segment in
accordance with IFRS 8.
The Wireless segment, consisting of the WiMAX and WiFi operations, has been treated as discontinued. 
All businesses are based in the UK. H H
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 47
Segmental revenue represents the total revenue of each business within a reporting segment and includes
inter segment revenues. Segmental profit is the measure used to assess performance internally and is
calculated as earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation, impairment of fixed assets, share
based payments and net exceptional operating costs (“adjusted EBITDA”), through to operating result.
Inter segmental transactions are carried out on an arm’s length basis.
The Group does not have any customers who contribute more than 10% of total revenue.
The segment information for the 15 months to 31 March 2010 is as follows:-

5. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
a) Business combinations in the 15 months to 31 March 2010
On 21 July 2009 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Daisy Communications Limited (“Daisy”)
and Vialtus Holdings Limited (“Vialtus”). Under the AIM Rules these transactions constituted a reverse
takeover of the Company.
On 3 August 2009 the Group acquired the trading assets of AT Communications Group plc (“ATC”). On the
same day it acquired the trading assets of the Eurotel business (“Eurotel”) from Belle Holdco Limited. 
Both businesses were acquired out of administration.
Prior to the acquisition of Daisy by the Group, Daisy held 50% of the share capital in Aerofone (UK) Limited
(“Aerofone”). On 13 August 2009 the Group acquired the remaining 50% of the share capital. For the
analysis below, Aerofone has been combined with Daisy on the basis of materiality (purchase consideration
£1.7 million, net assets acquired £0.5 million).
On 28 August 2009 the Group acquired the telecommunications division of Redstone plc (“Redstone”). 
The division comprised the trading assets of Redstone plc’s fixed line business and 100% of the share
capital of its wholly owned subsidiaries Symphony Telecom Limited and Anglia Telecom Centres Limited.
On 6 February 2010 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Managed Communications Limited
(“MCL”).
On 18 February 2010 the Company announced a recommended cash offer to acquire 100% of the share
capital of BNS Telecom Group plc (“BNS”). At this date, 83.89% of the share capital was acquired, with
98.95% being held by 31 March 2010. By 23 April 2010 the Group held 100% of the share capital in BNS.
The purchase consideration for each acquisition was as follows:-

The cash consideration for the Daisy acquisition increased by £0.5 million from that reported within the
interim results as a result of a working capital adjustment. H H
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 49
The fair value of the shares issued was based on the published share price on 21 July 2009. Refer to note
30 for further details.
Direct acquisition costs include external legal and professional fees, stamp duty and employee bonuses
which are fully contingent on the acquisition occuring.
The MCL acquisition includes an earn-out which provides additional consideration based on the earnings
before interest and tax generated by MCL during a 12 month earn-out period following completion. 
The contingent consideration of £2.6 million is expected to be paid in the year ending 31 March 2012.
As part of the ATC acquisition, £3.0 million was paid into an escrow account for distribution to the vendor
based on performance of the acquired base and a working capital adjustment. It is estimated that the
Group will recover £2.3 million from the escrow account (refer to note 23). Outside the escrow account
arrangement, further consideration of £1.0 million is payable to the vendor depending on the performance
of an acquired contract. The net £1.3 million recoverable is shown above and is expected to be received in
the year ending 31 March 2011.
The consideration of £11.0 million in respect of the BNS acquisition included assumed liabilities 
of £0.3 million.
The fair value of the share warrants has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model. Refer to note 10 
for further details.
The carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the books of the acquiree were as follows:-

The provisional fair values will be finalised in the 2011 financial statements. The fair values are provisional as
a result of the proximity of many acquisitions to the period end.
The goodwill is attributable to the cost synergies and cross selling opportunities that are expected to be
achieved from combining the acquired customer bases and trade.
The negative goodwill in respect of Eurotel and ATC reflects the additional cost and management time
required to stabilise and then integrate these businesses which were previously in administration. Negative
goodwill has been reflected in the net exceptional operating costs line of the income statement as detailed
in note 8. 
Daisy Communications Limited acquired 50% of the shares in Aerofone on 4 April 2009 for £1. 
This was deemed to be the fair value of consideration when Daisy Group plc subsequently acquired 
Daisy Communications Limited which gave rise to the negative goodwill of £0.5 million above.

From the date of acquisition to 31 March 2010, the acquired businesses contributed the following revenues
and net profit:-
£’000 Integrated Vialtus MCL BNS Total
Revenue 109,184 20,862 762 3,547 134,355

Net profit/(loss) before tax (9,789) (3,864) 114 (243) (13,782)
Between the date of acquisition and 31 March 2010, there has been a high degree of integration within the
Daisy, ATC, Eurotel and Redstone businesses. For the analysis above, the results of these entities have been
aggregated into “integrated” due to the difficulty in separating the results of the integrated businesses. 
If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2009, the Group’s revenue and profit for the 15 month period
would be as follows:-
£’000
Revenue 299,468 
Adjusted EBITDA 28,982 
Loss before tax (19,377)

8. NET EXCEPTIONAL OPERATING COSTS
Items that are material in size and non-operating or non-recurring in nature are presented as exceptional
items in the income statement, within the relevant account heading. The directors are of the opinion that
the separate recording of exceptional items provides helpful information about the Group’s underlying
business performance. Net exceptional operating costs are summarised below:-
15 months to Year to
31 March 31 December

Employee related restructuring costs 5,522 — 
Other restructuring costs 6,105 — 
Negative goodwill 5 (5,791) — 
Net exceptional operating costs 5,836 — 
Employee related restructuring represents rationalisation and redundancy costs incurred as part of the
Group’s change programme. The other restructuring costs principally relate to set up costs in respect of
businesses purchased out of administration, which have been expensed. Negative goodwill relates mainly
to businesses purchased out of administration and reflects the additional cost and management time
required to stabilise and then integrate these businesses into the operations of the Group (see note 5).

acquisition of Daisy Communications Limited since the awards were issued as part of the consideration on
acquisition (refer to note 5). The charge in respect of A Riley has been recognised within the “share based
payment costs” line of the income statement.
Fair value of options and assumptions
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair
value of the share options granted. The estimates of fair value of the services received is measured based
on the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The expected volatility is based on future volatility over the life of the award. Since the Company was recently
admitted at the grant date, the historical annual volatility of the log-returns of the share prices of comparable
companies has been considered as a basis for the actual volatility calculated for the Company. The expected
life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk-free interest rate is the yield on zero-coupon UK
government bonds of a term equal to the expected life of the warrants or share option awards. Assumptions
have been made to incorporate dividend yield and the effects of forfeiture using anticipated leaver rates. The
calculations assume that the performance criteria attaching to the options will be met in full. H H

In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for indications of impairment
or more frequently if there are indications that it may be impaired.
Goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units (“CGU”) as follows for impairment testing:-
£’000
Daisy Retail 54,387 
Daisy Wholesale 5,682 
Mobile Distribution 2,216 
62,285 
These CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill was monitored by management
for internal reporting purposes, and the level that represented the smallest identifiable group of assets
which generated largely independent cash inflows. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
64 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
16. GOODWILL (continued)
Goodwill impairment reviews
Testing for impairment is performed by allocating goodwill to the relevant CGU and assessing the
recoverable amount for each CGU based on value in use calculations. These calculations use cash flow
projections derived from the most recent three-year financial plans approved by the board, which comprise
the budget for 2010/11 and the outlook for 2011/12 and 2012/13, in which the principal assumptions were
revenue growth rates and changes in costs. Revenue growth rates are based on past experience and
management’s expectation of future changes in the Group’s business and markets.
Cash flows beyond three years for the CGUs to which individually significant amounts of goodwill were
allocated were extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate, which does not exceed the expected long-term
growth rate in the United Kingdom, the principle market of the Group.
Pre-tax discount rates of 10.0% to 12.0%, derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, have
been used in discounting the projected cash flows and calculating the terminal value at the end of year
three. This discount rate reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the CGU or group of CGUs.
Based on the results of the current period impairment review, no impairment charges have been
recognised by the Group in the period ended 31 March 2010. Having assessed the anticipated future cash
flows the directors do not consider there to be any reasonably possible changes in assumptions that would
lead to such an impairment charge in the period ended 31 March 2010.

The significant additions in the period represent customer relationships acquired through business
combinations (see note 5). These are valued using discounted cash flow methods based on pre-tax
discount rates of between 10.0% and 12.0%, derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital,
adjusted for risk as appropriate. These customer relationships are being amortised over their useful
economic lives of between 3 and 7 years. The expected useful lives are an estimate and are not secured by
any legal obligations on the customers to continue with the Group for any finite period beyond their current
contract period.
All amortisation above is included within operating costs and is disclosed separately on the face of the

At 31 March 2010, there were unrelieved losses in the Group of approximately £42.0 million (2008:
£12.0 million). The Group had a potential deferred tax asset in relation to unrelieved losses, fixed asset
timing differences and short term timing differences of £19.8 million (2008: £1.1 million). The deferred tax
asset has been recognised where, in the opinion of the directors, the Group is expected to make sufficient
profits against which these tax assets can be utilised in the future. This means that there is an unrecognised
deferred tax asset at 31 March 2010 of £7.8 million.

In 2006, the Group jointly formed Freedom4 Limited with Intel Capital Corporation (together with Intel
Capital (Cayman) Corporation, “Intel Capital”). Freedom4 Limited is registered in England, and operates in
the United Kingdom. Freedom4 Limited, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, owns the largest UK 
WiMAX broadband wireless spectrum licence consisting of two blocks of 84MHz in the frequency band
3.6 – 4.2GHz. Freedom4 Limited has successfully developed the technical capability to deliver mobile
WiMAX and has been granted a licence variation by Ofcom that enables it to offer mobile WiMAX services
to its customers.
Under the terms of the original shareholder agreement between the Group and Intel Capital, key business
decisions in respect of Freedom4 Limited require the unanimous approval of the shareholders. As a
consequence, the directors of the Group did not have total management control of Freedom4 Limited, 
and therefore, the Group’s investment was accounted for as a joint venture until 30 September 2009.
The investment in the joint venture was accounted for using the equity method. The investment comprises
the cost of the investment together with the Group’s share of post acquisition profit or loss less any
impairment. An adjustment is made for interest receivable by the company on the debt element of the
preference shares. Cash injections during the year were added to the carrying value.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
68 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
20. INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE (continued)
During the period, the Group decided to divest of its interest in Freedom4 Limited (and of its wireless
business as a whole) and was actively marketing the business for sale. In accordance with IFRS 5, the
carrying value of the Group’s share of the assets and liabilities of Freedom4 Limited of £4.2 million were
reclassified as held for sale (see note 25). At 30 September 2009, the Group held an interest of 52.4%
(2008: 52.4%) in Freedom4 Limited. Refer to note 25 for details of the movement in the Group’s investment
post 30 September 2009.
21. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The Group’s principal financial instruments during the year comprised cash, cash equivalents and
borrowings. Other financial assets and liabilities, such as trade receivables, net investments in finance leases
and trade and other payables, arise directly from the Group’s operating activities. The difference between
the carrying value and the fair value of these financial instruments is not material.
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of
financial instruments:-
Floating rate borrowings – the fair value of floating rate borrowings approximates to carrying value 
because interest rates are at floating rates where repayments are reset to market rates at intervals of less
than one year.
Fixed rate borrowings – the fair value of fixed rate borrowings, namely the finance lease and the hire
purchase obligations, are estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow using appropriate
interest rates to net present value.
Trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and cash – for these items with a remaining life of
less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value as a result of the short term
maturity of these instruments.
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and
credit risk. Exposure to foreign currency risk is minimal as the Group’s borrowings at variable and fixed rates
were denominated in sterling. No foreign exchange contracts were entered into in the current year as the
Group has no direct material foreign exchange exposure.
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and
seeks to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet its foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely
and profitably.
The Group regularly reviews its exposure to these risks and, where appropriate, will take action to minimise
the impact of these risks on the business. The directors have not delegated the responsibility of monitoring
financial risk management to a sub-committee of the board. The Group’s finance department implements
the policies set by the board, with clearly defined authority and approval limits.
In accordance with its policy, the Group does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes. Such instruments are only used on occasion to manage the risks arising from
operating or financial assets or liabilities or highly probable future transactions.
a) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk comprises both the interest rate price risk that results from borrowing at fixed rates of
interest and also the interest cash flow risk that results from borrowing at variable rates. The majority of the
Group’s borrowings attract floating rates of interest and therefore the Group’s principal interest risk is a cash
flow risk. The Group has no current interest rate derivatives to manage this exposure as the directors do not
believe that the risk to the Group is significant. H H
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 69
The Group holds cash balances which are subject to floating rates of interest. Whilst the rates of interest
inherent in net investments in finance lease receivables are variable dependent on the credit worthiness of
the end customer, once contracts are entered into the rate is fixed and there is no further exposure to
interest rate changes.
Sensitivity analysis
At 31 March 2010 it is estimated that a movement of two percentage points in interest rates, which
represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change, with all other variables remaining
constant, would impact the Group’s profit before tax by approximately £0.2 million.
b) Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations. The Group is exposed to credit
risk on financial assets such as cash balances, net investments in finance leases and trade and other
receivables. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts recognised
in the balance sheet are net of appropriate allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s
management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Appropriate credit checks are undertaken on all potential customers before new contracts are accepted.
Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure the Group’s exposure
to bad debts is minimised. The Group’s customers are spread across a wide range of industry and 
service sectors and consequently the Group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on 
its trade receivables.
Credit risk associated with cash balances and funding to purchase leased vehicles is managed by
transacting with financial institutions with high quality credit ratings. Accordingly the Group’s associated
credit risk is deemed to be limited. All institutions utilised by the Group require the advance approval 
of the board.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date.
See note 23 for further information on trade receivables and net investment in finance leases.
c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall
due. The Group’s approach to managing this risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without
incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group actively forecasts,
manages and reports its working capital requirements on a regular basis to ensure that it has sufficient
funds for its operations. Significant items of capital expenditure require prior approval by the board.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant
maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity
date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the gross contractual undiscounted cash flows.

21. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)
No comparative financial information has been presented as the Group had no bank borrowings, bank
overdrafts, finance lease obligations or onerous lease provisions at 31 December 2008. The carrying value
of the Group’s remaining financial liabilities (trade payables, accruals, deferred consideration) was equal to
their total gross contractual undiscounted cash flows at 31 March 2010 and 31 December 2008.
d) Capital risk management
The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the
business. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as
a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. There were no changes to the Group’s
approach to capital management during the year.
As part of the new banking arrangements, which were completed post period end (see note 35), the Group
is required to comply with certain covenants including net debt to adjusted EBITDA and interest cover.
These covenants will be tested for the first time in the year ending 31 March 2011.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
The board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company through the use of share option schemes.
Full details are provided in note 10.
Consistent with industry practice, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is
calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as current and non-current borrowings
less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity as disclosed in the consolidated balance
sheet plus net debt as defined above. The gearing ratios at 31 March 2010 and 31 December 2008 
were as follows:-

Prepayments and accrued income of £0.1 million and other receivables of £0.1 million are classified 
as non-current; all remaining trade and other receivables are due within one year from the end of the
reporting period. All trade and other receivables are denominated in sterling.
Other receivables include the £2.3 million held in escrow in respect of the ATC acquisition as detailed in
note 5. The loan of £18.6 million due from Host Europe Group Limited at 31 December 2008, comprising
capital of £17.5 million and accrued interest of £1.1 million, was paid during the period.

receivables of £8.7 million were past due but not impaired. These relate to a number of independent
customers for whom there is no recent history of default and the directors consider that these amounts are
fully recoverable.
Trade receivables of £1.7 million were impaired and fully provided for at 31 March 2010. The individually
impaired receivables relate mainly to individual customers who are in unexpectedly difficult economic
situations. These amounts continue to be legally pursued for collection notwithstanding they are fully
provided. The receivables and associated provisions are classified within the ‘greater than 90 days overdue’
category above. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Net investment in finance leases
The leasing portfolio of the Group’s customer financing operations comprises financing of products related
to its product offerings. The term of the contract stock is approximately 70 months. All contracts carry a
fixed interest rate and include renewal options.

Assets of disposal group classified as held for sale
The Group’s share of the assets and liabilities of Freedom4 Limited (part of the wireless business) have
been presented as held for sale since 30 September 2009, following the decision during the period that the
wireless business does not form part of the ongoing strategy.

Until 30 September 2009, the Group’s 52.4% investment in Freedom4 Limited was accounted for as a joint
venture using the equity method. Accordingly, as a result of the strategic decision described above, the
carrying value of the Group’s share of the assets and liabilities of £4.2 million were reclassified as held for
sale (see note 20).
On 14 October 2009, a new subscription and shareholders agreement was entered into between the
Group, Intel Capital and Freedom4 Limited. Following completion of these funding transactions the Group’s
investment in Freedom4 Limited was increased from 52.4% to 53.1%. This transaction had no impact on the
value of the investment which continues to be recorded at its carrying value as at 30 September 2009, the
date on which it became classified as held-for-sale.
On 24 December 2009 and 6 January 2010, the Group acquired Intel Capital Corporation’s and Intel
Capital (Cayman) Corporation’s combined 44.1% investment in Freedom4 Limited for a nominal
consideration ($2). In accordance with IFRS 5, as the business is not intended to form part of the continuing
operations of the Group, the investment has been valued at $2 representing the lower of cost and fair value
less costs to sell.
At 31 March 2010, the Group’s total interest in Freedom4 Limited was 97.2% (2008: 52.4%).
The significant assets and liabilities held by Freedom4 Limited at 31 March 2010 consist of the WiMAX
licence of £3.4 million and tangible fixed assets of £3.2 million.
On 17 June 2010 the Group announced the disposal of its WiMAX spectrum licences for cash consideration
of £12.5 million. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

On 15 March 2008 the Company made a conditional offer to its shareholders to buy back 58% of their
shareholdings for a minimum price of 10p per share, capped at 11p per share, by way of two tender offers. 
On 19 March 2008 the Court approved a capital reduction scheme to eliminate the deficit on the
company’s profit and loss account and create distributable reserves to facilitate the return of cash to
shareholders. The take up by shareholders of the offers was high such that 95.8% of those shares capable
of being tendered were tendered and the tender price was set at 10.39p. On 4 April 2008 Collins Stewart
acquired 1,459,600,083 shares by means of an on-market transaction at the tender price as a result of the
first tender offer. On 7 April 2008 Collins Stewart acquired 30,175,256 shares by means of an on-market
transaction at the tender price as a result of the second tender offer. The nominal value of a share was
changed from 1.0p to 0.1p.
At 31 December 2008 £2.3 million of the merger reserve was utilised as part of the capital reduction
scheme and the remaining £5.8 million was transferred to retained earnings following the disposal of the
subsidiaries on which the merger reserve arose.
During October 2008 the Company purchased 41,138,559 of its own shares for £0.7 million which were
held in treasury for future resale or cancellation. On 30 June 2009, the treasury shares were cancelled.
On 21 July 2009 as part of the transaction to acquire Daisy and Vialtus, the Company consolidated its
shares on the basis of 20 ordinary shares with a par value of 0.1p for 1 ordinary share with a par value of
2.0p. At the same time it issued 63,750,000 fully paid ordinary shares in connection with the acquisition of
Daisy and 36,250,000 fully paid ordinary shares in connection with the acquisition of Vialtus. The excess of
the fair value of the shares issued (85.5p) over the nominal value of the shares has been credited to the
merger reserve. On the same day 103,750,000 ordinary shares were placed in the market for £83.0 million. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

30. SHARE CAPITAL, SHARE PREMIUM AND MERGER RESERVE (continued)
The share capital of the Company was increased by the creation of 300,000,000 additional ordinary shares
of 2p each pursuant to a resolution of the shareholders passed on 20 July 2009 as part of the Daisy/Vialtus
transaction (31 December 2008: 4,000,000,000 with par value of 0.1p). In accordance with the Companies
Act 2006, which abolished the concept of authorised share capital, and following a resolution of the
shareholders with effect from 1 October 2009, references to authorised share capital in the articles of
association were removed. All issued shares are fully paid.
On 6 October 2009, 4,050,000 shares were issued to the employee benefit trust as part of the Group’s
share option scheme. A further 3,500,000 were issued to the trust on 26 January 2010.

£0.7 million which were held in treasury for future resale or cancellation. On 30 June 2009, the shares were
cancelled, clearing the treasury share reserve.
The capital redemption reserve arose in 2008 on the repurchase of shares with a nominal value of
£1.5 million.
The translation reserve comprised foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the accounts
of, and investments in, foreign operations. The Group’s foreign operations were disposed of as part of the
hosting and network services disposal in 2008 (see note 6) consequently the remaining balance was
recycled through the income statement at the date of disposal. H H

The Group had no capital commitments at the balance sheet date (2008: £nil).
33. CONTINGENCIES
The Group has contingent liabilities for legal and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business
from which it is not anticipated that any material liabilities will arise.
The MCL acquisition includes an earn-out which provides additional consideration based on the earnings
before interest and tax generated by MCL during a twelve month earn-out period following completion
(see note 5). Contingent consideration of £2.6 million in respect of this earn-out has been accrued at
31 March 2010. Additional cash consideration could be payable by the Group if the future performance of
MCL during the earn-out period reaches certain predefined levels. At the date of acquisition, it was not
considered probable that these monies would be payable and they were therefore not included in the cost
of consideration for the acquisition. There is no change in this assessment at the period end.

On 21 July 2009 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Vialtus Holdings Limited together
with the shares in Vialtus Solutions Limited not held by Vialtus Holdings Limited and a debt due from Vialtus
Solutions Limited to Host Europe WVS Limited of £42.0 million for a consideration of £44.0 million
(excluding acquisition costs), satisfied by the payment of £13.0 million in cash and the issue of 36,250,0000
fully paid ordinary shares in the Company. As Peter Dubens had an interest in the vendor (of which Oakley
is the holding entity) he did not take part in decisions of the Company relating to the acquisition.
Accordingly, an independent committee of the board, comprising all of the independent directors and
chaired by Christina Kennedy, was established to consider and, if thought fit, approve any proposals in
relation to the potential acquisition. Peter Dubens did not take part in the Company’s decision to propose
that a resolution to approve the acquisition should be put to shareholders at the general meeting held on
20 July 2009. These matters were dealt with by the independent directors. Peter Dubens, who owned
58,333,334 ordinary shares of 0.1p each in the Company at the relevant time also undertook to abstain
from voting on the relevant shareholder resolution. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

C1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
C1.1   BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, are in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and standards in the United Kingdom and
comply with the Companies Act 2006. Unless otherwise stated, all policies have been applied consistently
throughout the current and comparative years.
The Company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to
present the Company profit and loss account. The loss for the Company for the period was £16.1 million
(2008: £57.8 million profit).
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by FRS 1, Cash Flow Statements not to
prepare a cash flow statement, on the basis that the cash flow of the Company is included within the
consolidated cash flow statement of Daisy Group plc (formerly Freedom4 Group plc).
The directors are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue to operate for the
foreseeable future and therefore the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
C1.2   INVESTMENTS
Investments in subsidiary undertakings held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any
impairment. In the opinion of the directors the value of such investments are not less than shown at the
balance sheet date.
C1.3   TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
Computer equipment has an estimated useful life of 3 years.
C1.3   JOINT VENTURES
A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the company holds an interest on a long term basis and
which is jointly controlled by the company and one or more other venturers under a contractual
arrangement.
The investment in the joint venture is included in the balance sheet at cost less any impairment. 
Cost includes any cash injections and interest income accrued on the redeemable preference shares. 
The interest income is calculated using a market interest rate on the outstanding debt element of 
the preference shares, adjusted for each cash injection as appropriate.
C1.4 CASH
Cash at bank and in hand comprises cash in hand, deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable
on demand and restricted deposits.
C1.5 BORROWINGS
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are
subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and
the redemption value is recognised in the profit and loss account over the period of the borrowings using
the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has a continuing right to defer settlement
of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
C1.6 FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate
of exchange at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and
loss account. H H
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 85
C1.7 TAXATION
The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and takes into account taxation deferred
because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or
a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are
differences between the taxable profits and results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are
recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing
differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
C1.8 SHARE CAPITAL
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid,
including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity
attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where
such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable
incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the
Company’s equity holders.
C1.9 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Company operates certain equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The economic cost of
awarding shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account
equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded. The fair value of options over the company’s shares
awarded to employees of subsidiary companies is treated as a capital contribution, resulting in an increase
in investments. 
The fair value of the options granted is measured using the binomial method for schemes up to 31
December 2008 and using the Black-Scholes method for schemes thereafter. Both methods take into
account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The charge is recognised in the
profit and loss account over the vesting period of the award. At each balance sheet date, the company
revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. Any revision to the
original estimates is reflected in the profit and loss account with a corresponding adjustment to equity
immediately to the extent it relates to past service and the remainder over the rest of the vesting period. 
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital
(nominal value) and share premium when the options are exercised.
C1.10 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST (EBT)
The assets and liabilities of the Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) have been included in the Group financial
statements. Any assets held by the EBT cease to be recognised on the Group balance sheet when the
assets vest unconditionally in identified beneficiaries. The costs of purchasing own shares held by the EBT
are shown as a deduction against equity. The proceeds from the sale of own shares held increase equity.
Neither the purchase nor sale of own shares leads to a gain or loss being recognised in the profit and 
loss account.
C1.11   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company and Group’s policy in respect of financial instruments and risk management are disclosed in
note 21 of the consolidated financial statements. Disclosures have been made on financial instruments as
required by the Companies Act 2006. Notes to the Company financial statements continued

On 17 June 2010, the Group announced that it had disposed of its WiMAX spectrum licences for cash
consideration of £12.5 million. The licences were held by Freedom4 Access Limited and Faultbasic Limited,
both subsidiaries of Freedom4 Limited.
Consequently the Company’s investment in Freedom4 Limited has been impaired to a carrying value of
£12.5 million.

cancelled, clearing the treasury share reserve.
Share-based payments for the financial period were £1.0 million (2008: £1.3 million) of which £0.2 million
(2008: £1.3 million) was charged to the profit and loss account, £0.6 million (2008: £nil) debited to
investments and £0.2 million is held as an intercompany loan with Daisy Telecoms Limited. The
intercompany loan relates to share warrants issued in respect of the acquisition of the trade and assets of
AT Communications Group plc (refer to note 5 of the Group financial statements). Share options relating to
the board are disclosed in the directors’ remuneration report and detailed share-based payment
disclosures are shown in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements.

C12.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Details of related party transactions with the Company are provided in note 34 of the Group 
financial statements.
The Company has undertaken transactions with wholly owned fellow members of Daisy Group plc. 
Such transactions are exempt from disclosure under FRS 8.
C13.   CONTINGENCIES
The MCL acquisition includes an earn-out which provides additional consideration based on the earnings
before interest and tax (EBIT) generated by MCL during a twelve month post completion earn-out period.
Contingent consideration of £2.6 million in respect of this earn-out has been accrued at 31 March 2010.
Additional cash consideration could be payable by the Company if the future performance of MCL during
the earn-out period reaches certain predefined levels. At the date of acquisition, it was not considered
probable that these monies would be payable and they were therefore not included in the cost of
consideration for the acquisition. There is no change in this assessment at the period end.

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation

• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTER PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion the information given in the directors’ report for the financial period for which the Company
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the Company financial statements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to
report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

NOTES:
1. Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak
and vote on their behalf at the Annual General Meeting. A shareholder may appoint more than one
proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the
rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. A proxy need not be a
shareholder of the Company. A Form of Proxy which may be used to make such appointment and give
proxy instructions accompanies this Notice. If you do not have a Form of Proxy and believe that you
should have one, or if you require additional forms, please contact Capita Registrars on 
0871 664 0330*. To appoint more than one proxy you may photocopy the Form of Proxy. Please
indicate the proxy holder’s name and number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act
as your proxy (which in aggregate should not exceed the number of shares held by you). Please also
indicate if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed
and should be returned together in the same envelope.
2. To be valid any Form of Proxy or other instrument appointing a proxy and any power of attorney or
other authority under which it is signed, or a notarially certified or office copy of such power or
authority must be received by post or (during normal business hours only) by hand at Capita
Registrars, Proxies, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU no later than
11.00 am on 5 September 2010.
3. The return of a completed Form of Proxy, other such instrument or any CREST Proxy Instruction (as
described in paragraph 8 below) will not prevent a shareholder attending the Annual General Meeting
and voting in person if he/she wishes to do so. 
4. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, to be entitled to attend
and vote at the Annual General Meeting (and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of
the votes they may cast), shareholders must be registered in the register of members of the Company
at 6.00 pm on 5 September 2010 (or, in the event of any adjournment, 6.00 pm on the date which is
two days before the time of the adjourned meeting). Changes to the register of members after the
relevant deadline shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at
the Annual General Meeting.
5. Any member attending the Annual General Meeting is entitled pursuant to section 319A of the
Companies Act 2006 to ask any question relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting. The
Company will answer any such questions unless (i) to do so would interfere unduly with the
preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information; or (ii) the answer has
already been given on a website in the form of any answer to a question; or (iii) it is undesirable in the
interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
6. As at 21 June 2010 (being the last business day prior to the publication of this Notice) the Company’s
issued share capital consisted of 264,705,895 ordinary shares of which none were held as treasury
shares. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at 21 June 2010 were 264,705,895.
7. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy
appointment service may do so by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST
Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have
appointed a service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who
will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
8. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the
appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in
accordance with CRESTCo’s specifications, and must contain the information required for such
instruction, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the
appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy,
must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent ID (RA10) by 
11.00 am on 5 September 2010. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as
determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Application Host) from which the
issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST.
After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be
communicated to the appointee through other means.
* Calls cost 10p per minute plus network extras(lines are open Mon– Fri 9.00 am – 5.30 pm). Notice of Annual General Meeting continued
94 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
19. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note
that CRESTCo does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular message.
Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore, apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy
Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member
is a CREST personal member, or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service provider, to
procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary
to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this
connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting system providers
are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the
CREST system and timings.
10. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in regulation
35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
11. There will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business
hours on any weekday (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) from the date of this Notice
until the date of the Annual General Meeting and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for at
least 15 minutes prior to the meeting and during the meeting, copies of the following documents:
• the non-executive directors’ letters of appointment;
• the executive directors’ service agreements;
• the new articles of association; and
• the rules of the Daisy Group plc Executive Share Plan. H H
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 95
APPENDIX 1 – SUMMARY OF THE PLAN
The principal features of the Daisy Group plc Executive Share Plan (the “Plan”) are as follows:-
REGULATION
The Plan will be regulated by the board of the Company or a committee of the board (the “board”). In
practice, operation of the Plan in respect of awards to executive directors of the Company will be delegated
to the remuneration committee of the board (the “remuneration committee”).
ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES
All employees (including executive directors) of the Group are eligible for selection by the remuneration
committee to participate in the Plan, provided that an employee who is an executive director of any
Company in the Group must work at least 25 hours a week (excluding meal breaks) and, in the case of any
employee, provided that employee is not within two years of his normal retirement age (generally 60 years
of age).
GRANTS OF AWARDS
Awards may be granted by the Company, the trustee of an employee trust or by any other person who the
Company has agreed may do so. Awards may not be granted after 26 June 2020. Awards made will be
personal to the participants to whom they are granted and may not be transferred or assigned.
PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS
At the time of award the remuneration committee will set performance targets in order to align the interests
of participants with shareholders and which must be satisfied before the award vests.
Performance targets once set will not be amended or waived unless an event occurs which causes the
remuneration committee to consider that an amended target would be a fairer measure of performance
and is not materially less difficult to satisfy. 
VESTING OF AWARDS
An award will not normally vest until the performance conditions are met and thereafter only if the
participant remains a director or employee of the Group. An award may, however, vest after cessation of
employment if the cessation is by reason of death or on account of illness, injury, disability or retirement.
If the participant ceases to be employed in any other circumstances, the remuneration committee has
discretion to permit vesting after cessation of employment. 
Awards will, unless and to the extent the remuneration committee determines that the awards may vest,
lapse if the participant ceases employment otherwise than in the circumstances referred to above.
Vesting is allowed in the event of an amalgamation, reconstruction or take-over of the Company.
Alternatively, awards may, with the agreement of any acquiring company, be exchanged for awards over
shares in an acquiring company or a company associated with an acquiring company. Awards may also
similarly vest in the event of a voluntary winding-up of the Company.
An award may not vest after the expiry of a period of ten years from the date of its grant or such shorter
period as may be specified at the time of award.
ISSUE OR TRANSFER OF SHARES ON VESTING
Ordinary shares issued or transferred following vesting of an award will rank pari passu in all respects and
form one class with the ordinary shares of the Company then in issue, save as regards dividends payable by
reference to a record date prior to the date of issue or transfer.
LIMITS ON THE ISSUE OF ORDINARY SHARES
No award shall be granted under the Plan if such grant would result in the aggregate of the number of
shares which have been allocated under the Plan and any other employees’ share plan adopted by the
Company during the period of 10 years ending on the relevant date of grant exceeding 10% of the total
number of shares then in issue. For the purposes of the limits described above, shares in respect of awards
which have lapsed cease to count. Notice of Annual General Meeting continued
96 DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010
ADJUSTMENTS
The number of shares subject to any award and the award price are subject to appropriate adjustment in
the event of any capitalisation issue (other than a scrip dividend which is not an enhanced scrip dividend)
or rights issue by the Company or any consolidation, sub-division or reduction of the Company’s share
capital or any other variation in the Company’s share capital.
AMENDMENTS
The board may make minor amendments to benefit the administration of the Plan, to take account of
changes in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for
participants in the Plan or for the Company or other members of the Group.
Save as set out above, no amendment to the advantage of participants may be made without the prior
approval of shareholders in general meeting.
BENEFITS NON-PENSIONABLE
Awards granted and shares acquired under the Plan are non-pensionable.
The summary above does not form part of, and should not be taken as affecting the interpretation of, 
the detailed terms and conditions constituting the rules of the Plan. H H
DAISY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 97
APPENDIX 2 – EXPLANATORY NOTES OF PRINCIPAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANY’S ARTICLES OF
ASSOCIATION
1. UPDATE TO STATUTORY REFERENCES
Since the last review of the Company’s articles of association (“Articles”) was undertaken, various additional
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (“2006 Act”) have come into force to replace the equivalent
provisions of the Companies Act 1985. Accordingly, where relevant, statutory references contained in the
Articles have been updated and amended to ensure that the relevant provisions of the 2006 Act are
referred to. For example, article 7.2 has been updated to reflect the updated statutory provisions relating to
the allotment of shares and the dis-application of statutory pre-emption rights, but the amendments have
not otherwise changed the substance of these provisions. 
2. VOTES OF MEMBERS
Changes which came into force on 3 August 2009 to implement the Shareholder Rights Directive have
clarified that (i) proxies appointed by more than one member may split their votes to reflect the different
ways in which they are instructed to vote and (ii) multiple corporate representatives have one vote each on
a show of hands at a general meeting provided they each vote in respect of a different block of shares. This
is not catered for under the provisions of the current Articles, so article 83 has been amended accordingly.
3. DELIVERY OF PROXIES
Guidance issued in July 2009 by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators stated that
companies should confirm in their articles that they are under no obligation to check whether a proxy or
corporate representative has voted in accordance with the instructions given to them and that their votes
should not be invalidated should any instructions not have been followed. New articles 93.3 (in respect of
proxies) and 96.2 (in respect of corporate representatives) have therefore been inserted to deal with this.
4. DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS
The provisions of article 129 had already been updated on the last review in anticipation of the 2006 Act
changes regarding directors’ conflicts of interest that were introduced on 01 October 2009. Accordingly, as
these provisions are now in force, article 129.12 (which stated that the relevant changes would take effect
from the date when the implementing provisions of the 2006 Act came into force) has been deleted as it is
no longer required. 
5. PROVISIONS FORMERLY FORMING PART OF THE MEMORANDUM
With effect from 1 October 2009, the 2006 Act provides that the provisions of a company’s memorandum of
association are to be treated as provisions of its articles of association.Articles 179 and 180 are therefore
new provisions which include in the Articles those provisions formerly found in the memorandum of
association which should be retained (i.e. that the liability of members is limited to the amount which 
may be unpaid on their shares and that the location of the Company’s registered office be situated in
England & Wales). Advisors

Annual Report

Another excellent 
performance
We are delighted to report that MITIE  
has made excellent progress in the past 
financial year. We have significantly 
enhanced our capabilities through 
selective investments in our energy  
and FM business propositions, as well as 
through strategic acquisitions. We have 
delivered double digit growth in revenue, 
underlying earnings and dividends. In the 
year, revenue increased by 13.0% to 
£1,720.1m and underlying operating profit 
before other items (non-cash or non-
recurring acquisition related items) by 
15.5% to £93.0m, while cash conversion 
remained extremely strong at 95.2%.  
This is an excellent performance against  
a backdrop of challenging economic 
conditions and is a testament to the 
passion and hard work of the MITIE team. 
Strategy
Our strategy is to deliver stakeholder value 
through a focus on sustainable profitable 
growth; we are delivering against that 
strategy and have ambitious plans for the 
future. MITIE has proven capabilities as a 
strategic outsourcing company that adds 
value to its clients. Today’s low carbon 
economy means that our clients are 
looking for something different. They want 
to deal with a business that can create 
an innovative outsourcing solution as 
well as providing integrated facilities 
management and specialist services. 
This market trend is creating significant 
opportunities to grow our market share 
particularly in technical, facilities and 
energy management. The execution of our 
strategy is enabled by the development of 
our talented and innovative people, our 
technology and infrastructure platform 
and through our continued investment in 
our ability to manage contracts that are 
increasingly large and complex.
During the year we have made two  
key strategic acquisitions which have 
broadened our capabilities and 
significantly strengthened our client 
proposition. In August 2009 , we acquired 
Dalkia FM for a total consideration 
(including costs) of £1 19 .5m. This acquisition 
complemented our existing engineering 
maintenance capabilities and specifically 
enhanced our carbon, energy 
management and energy efficient 
lighting credentials. We have integrated 
the business with our engineering 
maintenance business and the enlarged 
business is now operating successfully as 
MITIE Technical Facilities Management.  
In November 2009 , we acquired 
Environmental Property Services Limited 
(EPS Ltd) for maximum total consideration 
of £40.9m (including costs). EPS Ltd was 
integrated with our social housing business 
within our Property Management division 
and significantly enhances our capability 
in the social housing market, particularly in 
the South East of England. The Dalkia FM 
and EPS Ltd acquisitions have been 
successfully integrated, have delivered 
earnings in line with our expectations and 
we are confident they will make a significant 
contribution to MITIE’s future growth.
Results
The year saw revenues grow by 13.0%  
to £1,720.1m (2009: £1,521.9m), with a 
particularly good performance in our 
Facilities Management (FM) division.  
We also saw a significant contribution to 
revenue of £190.1m from the acquisitions 
made during the year. 
Operating profit before other items 
increased by 15.5% to £93.0m (2009: 
£80.5m), reflecting an enhanced margin 
of 5.4% (2009: 5.3%). Profit before tax and 
other items increased by 1 7 .0% to £91.7m 
(2009: £78.4m). Earnings per share before 
other items grew by 13.4% to 19 .5p per 
share (2009: 17 .2p per share).

The business remains very cash generative 
and has reported a cash inflow from 
operations of £98.4m (2009: £94.4m) for  
the year, representing excellent cash 
conversion of 95.2% (2009: 97 .5%). The 
balance sheet is extremely strong with net 
debt at the year end at 0.84x EBITDA at 
£86.6m (2009: net cash £10.9m), after using 
debt funding of £1 16.1m for acquisitions. 
Committed bank facilities of £230.0m 
remain in place to January 2012 which 
leaves the Group well positioned to  
take advantage of further acquisition 
opportunities as they arise. 
Our order book is strong. It grew by 30.6% 
during the year, and now stands at a 
record £6.4bn (2009: £4.9bn). Our sales 
pipeline is also at record levels and our 
contracted revenue for the year ending 
31 March 201 1 stands at 75% of budgeted 
revenue (2009: 7 4%). 
Dividend
MITIE continues to generate attractive 
dividends and dividend growth for its 
shareholders. The Board is recommending 
an increased final dividend of 4.1p per 
Ordinary share, providing a total dividend 
per share for the year of 7 .8p, a 13.0% 
increase on 2009 in line with our dividend 
policy to maintain dividends in line with 
underlying earnings per share growth at a 
cover ratio of 2.5 times adjusted earnings. 
Subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting, the dividend will 
be paid on 13 August 2010 to shareholders 
on the register at 25 June 2010.
Board
We were pleased to welcome two new 
Non-Executive Directors to the Board 
during the year. Terry Morgan CBE,  
joined the Board on 1 July 2009 and  
has been appointed Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and Larry Hirst 
CBE, joined on 1 February 2010. Both have 
considerable commercial experience  
of large complex organisations: Larry’s 
career with IBM has spanned 32 years 
where he held the role of Chief Executive 
UK & Ireland and is currently a Chairman 
of IBM EMEA; Terry is the Chairman of and 
has had extensive experience working  
for Crossrail. We look forward to the 
contributions they will make to the 
development of MITIE in the future. 
Ishbel Macpherson stepped down as a 
Non-Executive Director on 30 September 
2009 having served for four years on our 
Board. We wish Ishbel well for the future.
People
MITIE is one of the UK’s largest private 
sector employers. During the year, the 
number of people employed by MITIE rose 
by 5,093 to 56,579 . We would like to thank 
all of our people for their exceptional 
efforts and support and to welcome all 
those who have joined MITIE during the 
year. In particular, we would like to extend 
a warm welcome to all those joining the 
Group from both Dalkia FM and EPS Ltd. 
The Board realises that results as good  
as these are only produced by talented 
people dedicated to achieving the same 
strategic goals. 
Our future progress will be heavily 
influenced by our ability to maintain the 
motivation and drive of all MITIE people. 
We will be reinforcing MITIE’s ethos of 
recognising and rewarding exceptional 
team performance, nurturing talent and 
providing opportunities for our people to 
succeed in their careers.
Outlook
MITIE is in a very strong position. We have 
seen a step-change in our capabilities 
driven by selective investment in 
technology, in our energy and FM 
propositions as well as through strategic 
acquisitions. Furthermore, our developing 
international strategy will enable us to 
extend our reach and exploit growth 
opportunities both in the UK and overseas.
Our prospects for growth are very strong 
and we will benefit from the full year  
effect of both the Dalkia FM and EPS Ltd 
acquisitions in this year’s results, along with 
the related synergies. 
Demand for innovation and efficiencies  
in both the public and private sectors  
will provide great opportunities for MITIE.  
We maintain a position of financial 
strength, a robust balance sheet and 
capacity for further organic and 
acquisitive growth. We are positive about 
MITIE’s future and of continuing to deliver 
sustainable profitable growth.

Overview
MITIE is in an exciting position. We are 
a business with tremendous capability 
that is able to provide clients with the 
widest range of solutions to help them 
meet their strategic business and 
property challenges. Clients want us to 
do more. More strategic engagement, 
broader geographic coverage, capital 
investment, integrated service delivery 
and leading management information 
systems. Clients want partners that they 
trust and can rely on as their businesses 
adapt to the changing economic 
climate in both good times and bad.
MITIE is now a high volume transactional 
outsourcing business. We have the 
capability and technical infrastructure  
to manage the transfer of thousands  
of people in very short timescales.  
We manage clients’ compliance,  
risk, employment and legislative  
requirements while delivering innovative 
solutions, efficiently.
We have ambitious plans. As our clients 
grow and diversify so will we. We have 
a robust and challenging growth plan 
that recognises the importance of our 
expanding markets and opportunities 
and supports the development of our 
business overseas.
This will not however be at the cost of 
what has made MITIE such a success.  
We are passionate about keeping the 
spirit of innovation and empowerment 
that has made MITIE flexible enough to 
provide exactly what our clients need.  
We want our people to identify new 
markets and to be ready to develop 
them. We know that our future success 
depends on our ability to recruit and 
retain good people, so we will always 
have incentive schemes that promote 
and reward excellent performance.
Above all we will always put our clients 
first. Having clients who really value what 
we do and who want to develop long-
term relationships does not happen by 
chance. Spending time with clients, 
listening to their issues and helping them 
to construct solutions is what we do best.

Our strategy
Our strategy has seven elements all of 
which contribute to delivering stakeholder 
value through a focus on sustainable 
profitable growth. 
We provide value for all of our 
stakeholders: clients; employees; 
shareholders; the communities in which 
we operate; and other organisations we 
deal with. Growth provides benefits for  
our stakeholders, and our commitment  
is to growth in profits that is sustainable.  
By sustainable we mean that we grow 
profits every year and that we do it the 
right way. We care about our impacts on 
the environment and on society. We are  
a responsible business because we 
believe that is the right way to be. All of 
these strategic elements influence the 
way we do things. From our corporate 
responsibility (CR) plans to performance 
management for our people, we 
measure ourselves on our contribution  
to the following seven areas of strategic 
focus, which are covered in further detail 
throughout this report:
 
Our market opportunity
Market conditions are attractive for MITIE 
as our ability to deliver cost and carbon 
reductions for our clients comes to the 
fore. Current economic conditions have 
provided further impetus for change in  
the industry as clients see the tangible 
benefits that outsourcing delivers, in the 
form of lower costs, more innovation and 
improved value for money. As the market 
has evolved we have successfully 
positioned the Group as a partner of 
choice for our clients, having continued  
to secure and retain large contracts 
throughout the year. Our ongoing 
investment in people, systems and 
technical capabilities gives us confidence 
that we can drive economies of scale  
for our business and that of our clients 
going forward.
We offer a number of differentiated 
capabilities to our clients, which will help 
them to introduce further efficiencies 
throughout their organisations. We have 
built the capability to manage any size 
portfolio of buildings or assets and have 
the ability to deliver this across multiple 
regions. We offer a tried and tested 
capability to manage large scale 
transactional activity for our clients,  
which drives efficiency in their back office 
structures, particularly in the areas of 
supply chain, employment and payroll 
management. Energy and carbon 
efficiency is becoming an integral part  
of all our contracts and is increasingly 
embedded in everything we do. 
Technology also has an important part to 
play and the investments we are making 
now will ensure that we offer the most 
efficient service in the marketplace,  
now and in the future. 
In the private sector we have seen high 
levels of activity across our client base as 
they respond to the efficiency challenges 
faced by every organisation. This has 
resulted in an increasing level of private 
sector tender activity for all services and 
we see this trend continuing as businesses 
seek to consolidate acquired operations 
or enhance efficiency in existing 
structures. The public sector faces the 
prospect of considerable pressure  
on expenditure in the coming years.  
We believe that this will create significant 
opportunities for the outsourcing market 
as contracts will tend to become larger 
and broader in scope.

Acquisitions are a key part of our strategy and they support  
our long-term growth plans. Our two significant acquisitions  
in 2009 are now integrated into the Group. 
MITIE’s acquisition strategy seeks to enhance shareholder value 
by introducing new and scalable capabilities that build long-
term revenues, maintain margin levels and fit with the MITIE 
brand. A number of key factors drive our acquisition framework, 
including sector priorities, business differentiators, capability 
gaps, and market and brand stretch. 
The acquisition of Dalkia FM introduced the CarbonCare 
concept and brand to MITIE. We have subsequently  
launched MITIE CarbonCare across our Group and it now  
forms a core part of our important and growing carbon 
management programme.

Chief Executive’s strategy review
The satisfaction of our clients is central to our strategy of 
delivering sustainable profitable growth. We have invested time 
this year improving our understanding of our clients needs in 
order to reinforce our client strategy. 
Our clients see consolidation as the way forward and are 
looking to outsource more aggressively as they seek to cut costs 
and enhance carbon efficiency. They want to be clear about 
what the benefits are and how they can be realised. That’s why 
we are introducing new technology that reduces costs for us 
and our clients and allows us to provide a smoother delivery  
of integrated services. We are helping our clients either by 
consolidating their supplier bases within specific service lines  
or by bundling services together, or a combination of the two. 
Our clients tell us that sustainability and carbon targets are 
increasingly important issues. We have responded by launching 
CarbonCare, which will see energy management become a 
part of every service we offer.
£42m
Our strategic approach to outsourcing has allowed us to 
save our client £42m over five years by integrating their 
cleaning services with just one supplier across their entire 
UK portfolio. We are harmonising work process across 
their business, with one supplier and one specification, 
delivering one look and feel to the whole estate.

–15%
We successfully reduced North Somerset’s schools’ 
energy spend by over 15%. CarbonCare offers a full 
range of integrated services that help organisations 
manage down their energy use and carbon footprint. 
Our expertise ranges from measuring carbon 
exposure, developing comprehensive energy 
strategies, eliminating waste, identifying effective 
clean energy alternatives, to challenges with a more 
human dimension like encouraging behavioural 
change in the workforce.

We anticipate higher levels of tender 
activity to result in the medium term.  
Whilst this may not have any material 
effect on our anticipated performance 
during the current year, we believe that  
in subsequent years we will benefit from 
the efficiency agenda that is expected  
to impact central and local government.
Investment in our capability
Acquisitions
In 2009 we utilised our strong financial 
position to make two strategically 
important acquisitions, Dalkia FM and EPS 
Ltd, which are trading well. The acquisition 
of Dalkia FM was made in August 2009 
and we are particularly pleased with the 
progress made by our teams in creating a 
fully integrated technical FM business that 
complements the capabilities and skills of 
our traditional soft FM services business. 
Acquisitions will continue to feature as part 
of our growth strategy but our approach 
will always be to acquire businesses that 
have strong management teams with 
similar cultural values to ours. We want  
to acquire businesses for fair prices that 
complement our existing capabilities and 
enhance what we are able to offer our 
clients, particularly in terms of property 
and estate management, environmental 
and carbon consultancy. We will properly 
integrate each acquisition so that clients 
will be able to receive seamless support 
from MITIE as we develop.
Operational development
The operations of MITIE have been 
realigned as a result of the acquisitions  
of Dalkia FM and EPS Ltd so that with  
effect from 1 April 2010 we are structured 
into four divisions. These are Facilities 
Management, Technical Facilities 
Management, Property Management 
and Asset Management. 
We have moved some of the elements  
of the Asset Management business to 
other divisions to reflect market changes 
and client preferences.
The Technical Facilities Management 
business is a stand alone division providing 
a range of services for clients that have  
a preference for facilities management 
with an energy and technical emphasis. 
Our engineering contracting operations 
have moved from Asset Management  
to Property Management allowing the 
residual Asset Management division to 
focus on providing energy performance 
services, infrastructure and asset 
investment solutions to clients that are 
looking to optimise performance in a 
rapidly evolving energy environment. 12

People
As our business is dependent upon having 
motivated, quality people we have a 
talent management programme in place 
to ensure that we have the right people 
with the skills our clients value. MiFuture  
is the programme that formalises our 
approach to talent management and 
ranges from work experience and an 
innovative graduate programme,  
to talent mapping for our top managers 
and bespoke coaching programmes  
for senior management.
Increasingly, our clients are asking us to 
have the capability to support them 
across all of the countries in which they 
operate. MITIE is able to respond to this 
demand and has expanded its 
management team to enhance its 
international expertise through the 
targeted recruitment of key people and 
the development of its international supply 
chain. As the scale and complexity of our 
clients’ needs increase both in the UK and 
abroad, we have also selected a team of 
people who will be dedicated to large-
scale, integrated contracts and this 
specialised group will be at the forefront of 
MITIE’s strategic outsourcing opportunities. 
We are committed to fostering and 
developing a culture of employee 
involvement in the business through 
communication with employees.  
We embrace new technologies  
and see real value in social networking, 
recognising the influence it has on our 
people and industry as it becomes an 
increasingly important part of our lives.  
We are at the forefront of social 
networking and encourage all our 
employees and stakeholders to expand 
their networks in new and innovative ways. 
Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, RSS, MiNet 
and SMS are all utilised as part of our 
employee communications. The Group 
also communicates with employees 
through the use of: mailings and updates; 
employee-focused initiatives; business-
specific intranet sites; and broadcasts  
of financial presentations. 
The importance of recognising and 
rewarding our people cannot be 
underestimated. We have further 
expanded our MITIE Stars programme to 
reward exceptional performance by our 
people and in 2008 introduced MITIE’s  
Got Talent as a Group-wide talent contest 
to encourage employee engagement 
and recognition. In November 2009 we 
launched MitieRewards which is our  
brand new employee benefit rewards 
scheme available to all employees.
The Group’s culture of employee equity 
involvement is a significant driver in the 
Group’s growth performance and assists 
in attracting and retaining our employees. 
We continue to operate: the MITIE Long 
Term Incentive Plan to incentivise and 
reward senior employees of MITIE; the 
Executive Share Option Scheme for 
certain other employees below Board 
level and the Savings Related Share 
Option Scheme which is open to all 
eligible employees of the Group. 
Technology
Our technology infrastructure provides  
us with the platform to support our  
clients, our contracts and our business. 
Clients increasingly want real time 
information on the performance of  
their assets and estates that is available 
online and accessible 24 hours a day.  
This capability will be increasingly 
important as we develop our business  
in the UK and overseas.
Over the last three years, we have 
invested in our systems to ensure that they 
are robust and can support us as we grow. 
Our investment has been focused on 
back office support through the roll-out  
of a new finance and human resources 
administration system and on operational 
systems. We have developed a client 
facing management information suite 
that has the capacity to provide 
comprehensive asset performance  
data to our clients and our teams to 
enable the most efficient FM solution  
to be tailored to their needs. We see  
these developments as critical to MITIE 
and create differentiation of our service 
offering within the marketplace.

MITIE prides itself on developing new talent and this  
is demonstrated through our practice of employing

We are one of the largest employers of apprentices in 
the UK, currently employing 419 trade apprentices 
across our business and many more in short-term 
service apprenticeships.

Looking forward 
We are very positive about MITIE’s future 
prospects and remain committed  
to our strategy of delivering sustainable 
profitable growth. Further market 
consolidation and the continued drive for 
efficiency, change and enhanced service 
levels will drive the growth of the business. 
This will be reinforced by the ongoing shift 
to integrated contracts with greater 
complexities and which are increasingly 
energy focused.
We are continuing to invest in our business, 
principally in the areas of sales, geographic 
expansion, talent management and 
technology. We have created a step 
change in our capabilities this year as a 
result of the investments we have already 
made, leaving us in a strong position to 
deliver substantial growth. 
We have excellent visibility of future 
revenues, a growing long-term order  
book and an unprecedented level of  
bid opportunities. We have experienced  
an extremely positive start to the new 
financial year with new contract awards 
which demonstrate our ability to provide 
complex integrated services utilising 
MITIE’s extensive capabilities. We are at  
an exciting stage in the evolution of our 
business and we look forward to a year  
of opportunity and strong growth.
Ruby McGregor-Smith  
Chief Executive
Outsourcing is a people-based business and we are  
acutely aware of how critical our people are to our business. 
Recruiting and retaining the right people is also one of our 
biggest challenges. As MITIE has shifted from single service 
delivery to a solutions-driven approach, we have made 
significant investments in attracting, training and retaining  
the right people. Our apprentice and graduate programme  
are also important elements of our talent management.
Looking forward, we remain focused on talent identification, 
movement and succession planning as we challenge and 
motivate our management teams to keep pace with the 
business’ increasing commercial complexity 14

The drive to reduce costs and a focus on 
sustainability are the two principal areas 
of focus for all our clients at present. 
Organisations are seeking to drive down 
their costs through integrated services, 
supplier rationalisation, retendering and 
innovation. In addition, consolidation 
drives the market to consider the structure 
of its cost base and bring new and 
extended outsourcing opportunities.
The ability to deliver integrated services, 
our unrivalled coverage across the UK and 
our technology platform are increasingly 
becoming key differentiators for our 
private sector clients. Some of our clients 
are also seeking alternative approaches 
to outsourcing by taking a ‘whole life’ view 
and linking the initial capital expenditure 
to the lifetime operating expenditure of 
their contracts. 
There is still considerable impetus for 
change in the private sector as clients look 
to increase efficiency in both cost and 
carbon. The financial and professional 
services sector was one of the first to react 
to economic conditions and has been at 
the forefront of a number of large scale 
contracts that have increased 
geographical coverage or increased  
the range of services and sometimes  
both. This trend continues with a number 
of current large scale opportunities.
Other sectors are also changing 
procurement models and we have  
seen considerable tender activity in  
retail, transport and utilities. We have 
benefited from these changes and are 
seeing particularly high levels of private 
sector tenders.

We expect opportunities in the public 
sector to expand as Government seeks to 
reduce expenditure and improve service 
levels and sustainability. The reduction of 
the fiscal deficit in the UK will be a priority 
for the Government in the coming years 
and MITIE is well-positioned to support  
this agenda. Consequently we continue 
to focus on and invest in our client 
proposition in this important market.
In simple terms, increasing levels of 
outsourcing have the ability to reduce 
costs and increase innovation, delivering 
more for less. It is likely that outsourcing will 
be used to create new services models 
and to improve the efficiency of public 
sector services. Shared services models 
could be developed to reduce the costs 
of management and administration  
of Government with support services 
benefiting from a private sector approach 
that has consistently demonstrated 
improvements to productivity over the 
long-term within Government. 
We expect partnerships between the 
public and private sector to be important 
in the transformation of the Government 
estate and they will support the 
achievement of Sustainable Operation  
of Government Estate (SOGE) targets.  
The Carbon Reduction Commitment 
(CRC) Energy Efficiency Scheme will  
also affect many public sector offices.  
The CRC, which came into force in April 
2010, is a huge part of the Government’s 
pledge to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions by at least 80% from 1990 levels 
by 2050. The scheme will see organisations 
with total half-hourly metered electricity 
consumption greater than 6,000 mega 
watt hours a year (equivalent to 
approximately £460,000 electricity spend) 
forced to buy allowances for each tonne 
of carbon dioxide (CO2) they emit and  
be placed in a league table according  
to their energy performance. 
These anticipated changes present  
a significant opportunity for MITIE and  
we are continuing to invest in our sales 
proposition in the public sector. We are 
recruiting and training sector specialists  
to help with bids and manage contracts, 
tailored to the needs of each of the 
sectors we focus on and extending our 
reach into the public sector. Our ability to 
create innovative, fit-for-purpose solutions 
that satisfy the Government’s green 
objectives and need for cost reduction 
positions us particularly well in this space.

The market continues to demonstrate an appetite for 
integration, either through the amalgamation of a number  
of service lines through one contract or through horizontal 
integration across a service line to create economies of scale. 
The outsourcing model is changing towards larger, integrated 
contracts and MITIE is moving with the market. Integrated 
contracts now account for over 57% of our total contracts and 
we are seeing integration across services and also within services 
as clients seek to simplify their procurement strategies and 
reduce costs. Our integrated contracts operate with one team 
focused on the clients’ needs. Our technology platform and 
management processes all support seamless service delivery 
and reporting.

MITIE designed and installed the mechanical and 
electrical systems in the newly renovated National 
Audit Office building. In addition to our contract  
to maintain the M&E systems in the years to come,  
we also commenced onsite operations of the 
integrated facilities management in November 2009 . 
As well as delivering seven essential services, we have 
introduced a number of measures which support 
them on their path to achieving government 
sustainability targets.

Our strategy
Integration
International markets
There has recently been increased 
demand from our UK private sector  
clients for MITIE to expand its UK delivery 
capability to other regions. European 
procurement teams are now taking the 
lead for cross border procurement activity 
and we expect an international mix  
going forward. We have developed an 
international strategy with a number of  
our key clients and have invested in a 
senior management team with extensive 
overseas experience. They will be working 
closely with our partners in Service 
Management International (SMI) to 
develop opportunities for MITIE. SMI is a 
specialist provider of international facilities 
service solutions, delivering on-site to  
blue chip multinationals worldwide.
Research puts the value of the EMEA 
(Europe, Middle East and Africa) 
integrated services market at about 
£30bn and growing rapidly. Clients are 
looking for a different type of response 
that provides compliance as an 
integrated part of a solution comprising 
management skills, a technology  
platform that allows visibility of expense  
at all locations and for the organisation  
as a whole and solid competence in  
service delivery.
The key considerations are geography, 
competencies, management capabilities 
and the ability to operate locally. Client 
procurement drivers in this area are less 
about the individual services and more 
about reducing the cost base, increasing 
efficiency and finding greater agility in  
a framework of risk management and 
corporate compliance.

MITIE had a long-term partnership  
with Somerfield prior to securing  
the contract to provide cleaning  
for the enlarged portfolio of all the 
Co-operative Group stores after they 
acquired Somerfield. MITIE bid for  
six different regional tenders and  
was awarded the contract for the  
entire national estate on the back of  
our ability to streamline management  
and productivity which translated  
into significant savings for the  
Co-operative Group. 
The Facilities Management division 
delivers facilities consultancy, 
management and integrated service 
delivery to our clients. It has expertise  
and service delivery capability in the 
areas of business services, catering,  
client services, facilities services,  
PFI services, security, cleaning and 
environmental services, pest control, 
waste management and landscaping. 
As customers continue to look for cost 
savings from their property portfolios,  
MITIE is well placed to lead and meet  
the different and changing needs of the 
facilities management market. Economic 
pressures are encouraging customers  
to expand the traditional portfolio of 
outsourced facilities services in order  
to find further cost savings from areas  
that may not have been previously 
considered. Customers are now looking to 
all their assets to create value within their 
organisations and MITIE has been able to 
assist customers by combining our flexible 
and broad range of expertise in asset, 
energy and property management 
alongside our FM capabilities. 
MITIE is uniquely placed to successfully 
deliver very large scale, national  
contracts within the FM industry.  
MITIE has a presence on virtually every 
high street in Britain providing services  
for supermarkets, banks and other  
retail chains across the UK. 
Throughout this financial year MITIE has operated in three divisions. Facilities, 
Property and Asset Management. With effect from 1 April 2010 we are operating as 
four divisions. The commentary and financial data below reflects the performance 
in the organisational structures that applied during the period to 31 March 2010.  
The comparatives and proforma analysis for the segmental financial performance 
for both structures are shown in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our experience and national delivery 
capability will allow us to capitalise on  
this position and increase our market share 
as smaller regional contracts continue to 
be combined to help clients maximise 
their savings.
With green issues being higher on the  
FM agenda than ever, CarbonCare, 
MITIE’s market-leading energy offering  
has already helped to secure new work 
across the division and we expect it to  
be an important differentiator in MITIE’s 
service offering going forward.
During the year, Facilities Management 
has continued to focus on increasing the 
integration across the division in the way 
we bid and operate our contracts. 
Additional work secured during the year 
has come from existing customers that 
want to contract out larger packages of 
work to gain the economies of scale 
involved in rationalising their supply chains. 
This has come in the form of expanding 
regional contracts into larger national 
ones as well as customers adding extra 
services onto multi-service contracts or 
transitioning to a full FM service in an effort 
to realise the maximum amount of cost 
savings. With a retention rate for rebid 
contracts in the year at 87%, we are 
demonstrating that the investment that 
we have made in customer relationship 
management and in our larger integrated 
multi-service and FM contract capabilities, 
particularly during the last 18 months,  
is paying off.

Property 
Management
Property Management has expanded its 
capabilities to offer an integrated property 
management service. Clients are 
increasingly looking for a broader range 
of services that include mechanical and 
electrical, energy and more general 
facilities management services in addition 
to the traditional services such as 
maintenance, refurbishment, painting, 
roofing, interior fit-out, fire protection and 
plumbing and heating.
The social housing market is developing 
rapidly and we have made a strategic 
shift in the way we operate. Clients want 
to form long-term relationships with 
partners who work collaboratively to 
provide estate management, planned 
and responsive maintenance, capital 
projects, environmental improvements 
and help to address fuel poverty.

MITIE is now ranked seventh in the UK 
social housing market. It operates as an 
integrated national business with the 
capability to support our clients property 
strategies, collect property information 
and perform stock condition surveys  
as well as manage projects and 
maintenance contracts across the UK.  
The acquisition of EPS Ltd has added 
considerable expertise especially in the 
South East of England. One of the major 
attractions of EPS Ltd was its IFS housing 
management software that we are 
adopting and upgrading as the standard 
across the social housing business. 
This will allow us to manage all the data 
related to our social housing activities and 
is accessible to clients via a web portal so 
they can see real time reporting and 
process information. 
IFS technology also supports planning and 
scheduling, budgets, cost reports, tenant 
liaison, environmental impacts and 
satisfaction levels. We are well placed to 
expand our market share in this market.
The specialist businesses have had  
a mixed year. The businesses that 
predominantly work in the repair and 
maintenance market, painting, and 
roofing have made good progress. The 
more cyclical businesses such as interior fit-
out, fire protection and plumbing have 
suffered from the general downturn in 
construction activity across the UK, 
although there are some signs that activity 
levels in those markets are increasing.
From 1 April 2010 the Engineering 
Contracting businesses have become 
part of the Property Management division. 
This move enhances the capabilities of  
the division in terms of mechanical and 
electrical services contracting which is 
increasingly becoming part of the capital 
works, frameworks and fit-out projects  
that we are involved with. The results of 
that business are reported within Asset 
Management for the year ended 31 
March 2010. The impact of the transfer in 
financial terms from 1 April 2010 is shown  
in Note 3 to the accounts.

to cover planned and cyclical works, 
adding a further £8.4m per annum for 
the remaining term. MITIE will help 
improve homes in the area as well as 
supporting local people and businesses.

Waste-to-energy:  
turning a liability into an asset
The traditional method of waste 
management is becoming increasingly 
detrimental to the environment and 
businesses alike. In fact, it is one of the most 
expensive problems any organisation has 
to deal with. The good news is that smart 
engineering and new technologies can 
turn waste streams into valuable revenue 
streams; as valuable as oil or gas when  
it comes to generating energy while 
alleviating pressure on our natural 
resources and environment. MITIE has 
considerable expertise in these waste-to-
energy technologies. We are, for example, 
investigating the potential use of thermal 
technology at an aquaculture centre, 
using organic waste to generate heat, 
which is then converted to refrigeration. 
We are also looking at the conversion  
of medical waste to produce heat for  
a leading London hospital. In addition  
to conventional thermal waste-to-energy 
systems, there are some very promising 
new technologies on the horizon.

MITIE Technical Facilities Management 
works with NB Real Estate which is the 
property manager for The Co-operative 
Insurance Society (CIS) portfolio.  
This consists of £2.5bn of property  
assets and incorporates 18 commercial 
buildings spanning almost a million 
square feet. MITIE delivers technical 
facilities management and energy 
services for a number of the buildings in 
their portfolio. Using a dynamic shared-
savings CarbonCare business model, 
everyone involved in running the 
buildings, including the tenants, have a 
stake in reducing energy consumption 
and carbon emissions, and can benefit 
from the energy cost savings generated.

Technical Facilities Management
Technical Facilities Management focuses 
on facilities management that is led by 
technology, engineering and energy 
requirements. It comprises the integrated 
operations of our Engineering 
Maintenance business and Dalkia FM.
The division was formed following the 
acquisition in August 2009 of Dalkia FM 
services in the UK by combining it with 
existing MITIE capabilities and MITIE  
now has the largest Technical Facilities 
Management team in the UK. This was 
part of the Asset Management division 
until 31 March 2010, from which point  
it has traded separately as a new 
operating division of MITIE. This places 
MITIE in a leading position in the FM and 
engineering maintenance markets in  
the UK. It also elevates our competitive 
advantage in providing MITIE with a 
critical mass for a wide range of Energy 
Services including the provision of CRC 
Energy Efficiency Scheme management 
solutions as well as a further platform to 
cross-sell MITIE services. 
A specialist integration team worked 
alongside our newly appointed 
management team from August 2009 .  
A detailed plan set out the objectives of 
establishing clear management control, 
providing clarity to clients and our people 
and defining the work streams necessary 
for effective integration, financial 
management, communication and 
rebranding. Once established, the 
integration was reviewed weekly to ensure 
milestones were met and that priority  
was given to communication and the 
redefinition of the enlarged business. 
We now have a unified operating 
structure and a single brand in the UK 
marketplace. Moving forward in 2010  
we will continue to develop the business 
 in areas including effective talent 
mapping, enhanced contract 
management, single quality assurance 
procedures, taking the best from previous 
systems, together with a class leading 
approach to the delivery of mobile 
services and energy data management. 
Our new TFM business is extremely  
well placed to meet the challenges 
facing our clients in the management  
of their technical assets and in their 
response to increased regulations  
around carbon emissions in a capital 
constrained environment.

Corporate responsibility
Responsible 
practice across 
everything  
we do
MITIE is committed to embedding responsible business practice 
into everyday operations, policies, procedures and practices, and 
providing opportunities for people to develop their full potential.
This year we have refined the links between our corporate  
and CR strategies by introducing new SMART objectives that  
fully align the five pillars of our CR strategy to our corporate 
strategy. These objectives appear as KPIs in our CR strategy 
matrix and in our dedicated CR Report which has further detail 
on all our CR related activities. A new expanded online account 
of our CR activities and strategy matrix will be available at  
www.mitie.com/CR
100%
The 100% organic fertiliser we make from our  
waste at London’s iconic Brewery is re-circulated  
to the farmers in our supply chain. This is just one of  
the many sustainable practices we’ve introduced…  
100% of the disposable products we use each year  
are bio-degradable. We’ve also reduced energy 
consumption in the kitchens by half and lowered  
our carbon footprint by sourcing locally and cutting 
transport times.

Our strategy
Responsibility
Our unwavering commitment to CR and 
the successes we have achieved serve to 
strengthen our reputation as a responsible 
and ethical business. We utilise our CR 
capabilities to enhance our working 
relationships with our clients and suppliers 
as well as supporting communities and 
third sector partners, demonstrating to our 
stakeholders that we have a responsible 
and sustainable business model.
MITIE relies on the knowledge and skills  
of its people to deliver its unique range  
of services. Providing appropriate training 
and development to support our people 
is vital to delivering the quality of service 
demanded by our clients. MITIE is one of 
the largest employers of trade apprentices 
in the UK, currently employing 419 across 
our business. We spent over £4.4m on 
training this year with over 40,000 training 
delegate days and we retained 92%  
of management.
MITIE adopts the highest ethical standards 
and understands its responsibilities to all of 
our stakeholders including our employees, 
clients, suppliers, subcontractors, investors, 
competitors and the general public.

Corporate responsibility
Our key business principles are published 
in our policies, which are available at 
www.mitie.com/cr_policies.
Our impact on the environment is given 
careful consideration across every aspect 
of the business. The last 12 months has 
seen the Carbon Reduction Commitment 
(CRC) Energy Efficiency Scheme  
further elevate the issue of energy 
management onto the boardroom 
agenda and encouraged businesses  
to reconsider their energy consumption 
and identify areas to implement carbon 
management strategies. 
MITIE is providing strategic carbon 
management to a broad spectrum  
of clients with advisory and practical 
support on the interpretation of legislation 
including the CRC and the delivery of 
energy reduction measures. We have 
continued our involvement in landfill 
avoidance programmes with the 
development and delivery of a range  
of recycling and best practice solutions 
including waste to energy programmes  
to facilities across the UK. 
Since 2006, MITIE has proactively 
publicised its environmental KPIs 
addressing the five key impacts of 
electricity, gas and water consumption, 
transport emissions and waste creation. 
Over the coming 12 months MITIE’s focus 
on environmental sustainability will adopt 
the CarbonCare philosophy engaging  
in improved practices and strategies for 
data capture, monitoring and analysis, 
allowing us to implement environmental 
management strategies for all of our  
office facilities and prioritise appropriate 
buildings for attention. This year our 
normalised CO2 emissions per employee 
and emissions per pound of revenue have 
decreased by one percent and nine 
percent respectively.
Health and safety has always been a 
priority for MITIE and we strive to improve 
our performance every year. We use 
management systems and controls to 
support our occupational health and 
safety (OH&S) targets, providing 
comprehensive training across all levels  
of the organisation and implementing an 
improvement process to control key risks. 
Our health and safety performance  
has improved this year to a rate of three 
and a half reportable accidents per one 
thousand employees.
MITIE makes a significant contribution to  
a variety of communities across the UK. 
This contribution is demonstrated by 
numerous initiatives including volunteering, 
in-kind donations, pro-bono support and 
sponsorships. Our charity policy directs our 
main fundraising support to six regional 
charities, although we also provide support 
for various other charities that are of 
particular interest to our people. We 
contributed over £400,000 to communities 
across the UK during this financial year.
We have maintained and expanded  
our seven Construction Skills Centres at 
schools across the UK designed to provide 
craft skills and vocational education to 
approximately 500 students (aged 14–19 
years) and further enhanced our multi-
award winning Real Apprentice scheme 
with a joint programme in partnership  
with Jobcentre Plus and London Employer 
Accord in 2009 entitled ‘Raising the Game 
on Disability’ . This programme has been 
designed to provide training and 
employment opportunities specifically to 
unemployed people with physical, mental 
or learning issues. 
In 2009 MITIE also improved its position on 
the Business in the Community (BITC) CR 
Index from 81.5% to 88.7%, maintaining its 
position in the Silver Category and was 
awarded a new Big Tick in the Skills in the 
Workplace category of their National 
Awards for Excellence 2010. And in 2010, 
Suzanne Baxter, Group Finance Director, 
was awarded the ICAEW Inspiring 
Confidence in Business Award by the  
FD’s Excellence Awards supported by  
the CBI. The award recognises an FD who  
has made an outstanding contribution to  
their business through linking sustainability 
activities to organisational performance, 
and placing sustainability at the centre  
of strategy development.
CR is fundamental to MITIE as a business 
and is a key part of our corporate strategy. 
This table shows how we link the seven 
elements of our corporate strategy 
namely clients, people, risk, responsibility, 
integration, profitability and acquisitions  
to the five corporate responsibility pillars of 
people, service and delivery, environment, 
health & safety and community.

Financial review 
A 22-year track 
record of growth
MITIE has delivered another set of 
excellent results, building on our 22-year 
track record of success. We have retained 
our focus on sustainable profitable 
growth and a prioritisation of sound cash 
management, and have seen strong 
performance from our business despite 
challenging economic conditions. 
We have made selective investments, 
particularly in the areas of technology, 
our energy and FM propositions and 
in acquisitions that have enabled us to 
make a step change in MITIE’s capabilities 
during the year. We enter the new year 
in a robust financial position, with low 
gearing, a strong balance sheet and 
enhanced capacity for future growth.
From 1 April 2010 the structure of the 
Group was changed and from that 
date we have operated through four 
principal trading divisions. This change has 
principally been driven by the acquisition 
of Dalkia FM and its integration into the 
Group. The impact of this change on 
the segmental analysis of our business 
going forward is set out in Note 3 to the 
accounts. The analysis provided below 
reflects the disclosures in our consolidated 
statutory accounts and provides details 
on the performance of the Group in the 
structure applicable during the year 
ended 31 March 2010. 
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
MITIE uses a set of clear financial and 
non-financial KPIs to measure and 
communicate critical aspects of the 
Group’s performance. These KPIs are 
aligned with the Group’s strategic 
objective of achieving sustainable 
profitable growth and our financial KPIs 
are specifically focused on the level and 
quality of our earnings and cash flows, 
the control of capital expenditure and 
the sustainability of dividends. The Group 
has performed strongly against these 
measures again this year and has now 
demonstrated a five-year track record  
of strength in each of these measures.  31

We continue to review the relevance of 
our KPIs to our developing business model 
and will be refining our cash conversion 
target going forward to 80% of earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA) to reflect the 
working capital investment that we 
expect to be required to support the 
planned growth in new and larger scale 
FM style contracts within our operational 
portfolio. This trend, which is positive from 
a strategic perspective, will require the 
support of increased working capital in 
some instances but will not affect the 
underlying strength of cash flows in our 
existing contract portfolio. We remain 
committed to the prioritisation of strong 
cash management within our Group.
Sustainable profitable growth
Revenue for the year ended 31 March 
2010 increased by 13.0% to £1,720.1m, 
reflecting organic growth of 0.5% and 
a contribution of £190.1m from the two 
acquisitions made by the Group during 
the year. 
The Group maintained its track record of 
positive revenue growth despite the back 
drop of challenging economic conditions. 
We experienced organic revenue growth 
of 5.5% in our Facilities Management 
business to £824.6m (2009: £781.8m), 
where market demands for change  
and efficiency brought opportunity to  
the Group. In Property Management, 
revenues reduced by 1.0% to £295.0m 
(2009: £297 .9m), reflecting an 1 1.1% 
reduction in the underlying revenues  
of the business driven by challenging 
conditions in certain construction related 
markets such as interior fit-out, offset by  
a positive contribution to revenue from  
the EPS Ltd acquisition made in  
November 2009 of £30.1m. Finally in our 
Asset Management division, revenues 
grew by 35.8% to £600.5m (2009: £442.2m).  
This division was formed on 1 April 2009 
and comprised our traditional 
engineering services and engineering 
maintenance businesses. 
MITIE has a strong focus on revenue, earnings and cash,  
which has enabled our 22-year track record of continuous 
profitable growth. 
In these markets with changing risk profiles it is important to 
achieve revenue growth, and it is crucial to maintain profit 
margins and be paid on a timely basis for the work we have 
performed. We have achieved an average EBITDA cash 
conversion of 96.6% over the past 20 years.

and Accounts 2010
Financial review 
The performance of this business was 
greatly enhanced by the acquisition of 
Dalkia FM in August 2009 , which added 
£160.0m to revenue and by the strong 
results of our traditional engineering 
maintenance business where organic 
growth of 15.2% increased revenues to 
£184.8m (2009: £160.4m) and offset the 
impact of challenging markets within  
our engineering services business  
where revenues fell by 9 .3% to £255.7m 
(2009: £281.8m). 
Our order book continued to grow and 
now stands as £6.4bn (2009: £4.9bn), 
reflecting organic growth of £0.9bn  
whilst our acquisitions added £0.6bn.
We have seen a significant improvement 
in the level of our underlying operating 
profit during the year. Operating profit 
before other items increased by 15.5% to 
£93.0m (2009: £80.5m) and our underlying 
operating profit (EBITA) margin was 
enhanced to 5.4% (2009: 5.3%) in the year. 
Operating profit before other items before 
the impact of acquisitions grew by 5.3%, 
to £84.8m, outstripping the rate of growth 
in revenue. The contribution to operating 
profit before other items from acquisitions 
was £8.2m. 
We have seen strong margin performance 
in our Facilities Management business 
where operating profit before other 
items grew by 7 .0% to £50.5m (2009: 
£47 .2m) and operating profit margins 
improved to 6.1% (2009: 6.0%). In Property 
Management, operating profit before 
other items increased by 12.8% to £20.2m 
(2009: £1 7 .9m). This was achieved through 
an increase in underlying profits to £18.6m 
(2009: £1 7 .9m), driven by improvements 
in margins before acquisitions to 7 .0% 
(2009: 6.0%) and a contribution of 
£1.6m from the acquisition of EPS Ltd. 
Integration costs incurred in respect of 
the EPS Ltd acquisition were £1.6m. In 
Asset Management, operating profit 
before other items grew by 44.8% to 
£22.3m (2009: £15.4m). The growth in 
profitability of this division was driven by 
the acquisition of Dalkia FM which made 
a contribution of £6.6m to operating 
profit before other items and by strong 
growth in the underlying revenues and an 
enhancement in operating profit margins 
to 4.8% (2009: 4.4%) in our traditional 
engineering maintenance business.  
This improvement offsets a decline of 
19 .0% in the profitability of our Engineering 
Services business to £6.8m (2009: £8.4m). 
Integration costs incurred in respect of 
acquisitions were £6.6m and related to 
restructuring activities, management 
structure changes, rebranding and 
technology changes. Integration costs 
and other acquisition related costs, such 
as the amortisation of intangibles of £5.3m 
(2009: £1.9m) which grew in the year in 
respect of newly identified intangible 
assets on the Dalkia FM and EPS Ltd 
acquisitions, are classified as other items 
within the consolidated income statement 
of the Group. After the impact of other 
items, operating profit for the year was 
£81.1m (2009: £78.6m). 
Net finance costs for the year were £1.4m 
(2009: £2.7m), reflecting an improvement 
in the year, despite an increase in the 
Group’s average level of net debt.  
This improvement was attributable to  
the reduction in LIBOR. The Group has 
funded its debt at a level of 40 basis  
points over LIBOR during the year. 
The tax charge for the year was 
£22.2m (2009: £21.5m) representing an 
improvement in our effective rate of tax  
on profit of 27 .8% (2009: 28.3%).
These results generated a profit after tax 
for the year of £57 .5m (2009: £54.4m),  
an increase of 5.7% on the prior year. 
Cash flow, funding and liquidity
The underlying cash performance of the 
Group remains strong and in line with our 
stated KPI which targets the conversion of 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation (EBITDA) to cash at a 
rate of 90% on a rolling 12-month basis. 
Our cash conversion performance for 
the year ended 31 March 2010 was 95.2% 
(2009: 97 .5%). 
Cash conversion measures the success 
of the Group in converting its operating 
profit to cash during the year and is an 
effective measure in demonstrating the 
quality of the Group’s earnings and the 
effectiveness of its cash management 
function. MITIE has consistently delivered 
cash conversion in excess of 90% over the 
last five years. 
As the Group continues to expand its 
exposure to large scale FM contracts 
that require the funding of operational 
costs (generally wages) in advance of 
payment from clients, we are expecting 
to increase our investment in working 
capital to support the introduction of 
new, larger scale FM contracts into MITIE. 
This change in the contract portfolio 
of our Group is expected to create a 
reduction in the Group’s cash conversion 
and we are therefore rebasing our cash 
conversion KPI to an 80% target. This in no 
way reflects a worsening in the underlying 
cash flows relating to our existing portfolio 
of contracts but simply reflects the need 
to invest in working capital to support 
our strategic growth targets in this area. 
We will continue to prioritise the cash 
performance of the Group and to focus 
on maximising cash conversion within  
our business.
Net debt has increased to £86.6m  
(2009: net cash £10.9m) largely due to the 
impact of the two acquisitions mentioned 
above. Dalkia FM was funded through 
a combination of £77 .7m of debt and 
£41.8m of equity raised through a placing 
of 19 million new Ordinary shares. EPS Ltd 
was funded entirely with £36.2m of debt. 
The Group’s committed banking facility 
of £230.0m remains unchanged and in 
place until January 2012.
Delivering stakeholder value
Our track record of delivering stakeholder 
value through earnings and dividend 
growth continued during the year. Basic 
EPS before other items, our measure of 
underlying EPS, increased by 13.4% to 
19 .5p per share (2009: 1 7 .2p per share) 
while basic EPS was 16.9p per share (2009: 
16.7p per share), an increase of 1.2%. This 
latter measure showed low growth due 
to the impact of in year integration costs 
that are non-recurring and the mid year 
increase in the number of shares in issue 
following the share placing in August 2009 . 33
MITIE Group PLC   
Annual Report  
and Accounts 2010

We have a dividend policy that ensures 
our dividend tracks the underlying 
growth in our earnings per share and is 
not distorted by non-cash accounting 
adjustments or by non-recurring 
acquisition related costs such as 
amortisation or integration costs. The final 
dividend proposed by the Board of 4.1p 
per share (2009: 3.6p per share) represents 
an increase of 13.9% which brings the full 
year dividend to 7 .8p per share (2009: 
6.9p per share), an increase of 13.0%. This 
continues to reflect a cover of 2.5 times on 
an adjusted earnings per share measure 
in line with our dividend policy.
Pensions
Our financial strength remains unaffected 
by any significant deficit in our main 
pension scheme and this maintains  
our position of strength in the market.  
The net position of all the pension  
schemes included on the Group’s 
balance sheet is a deficit of £10.5m  
(2009: £0.4m). This included a deficit of 
£6.8m on the principal Group scheme 
(2009: surplus £3.0m). 
The Group also contributes to a number 
of defined contribution pension schemes 
as well as making contributions to its 
customers’ defined benefit pension 
schemes under Admitted Body Local 
Government status as well as to other 
arrangements in respect of certain 
employees who have transferred to  
the Group under TUPE. The Group’s 
defined benefit pension obligations in 
respect of schemes in which the Group  
is committed to funding amounted to 
£3.7m (2009: £3.4m).
Acquisitions
In accordance with our strategic plan 
we have made two key acquisitions 
during the year which have significantly 
enhanced our capabilities in the areas 
of Technical Facilities Management and 
Social Housing. 
On 12 August 2009 we acquired the entire 
issued share capital of Dalkia Energy and 
Technical Services Limited and Parkersell 
Limited, together Dalkia Technical Facilities 
Management (Dalkia FM), from Dalkia 
plc for total consideration of £1 19 .5m, 
including directly attributable costs of 
£3.3m. The transaction was originally 
structured to include a potential £10.0m 
of deferred contingent consideration, 
however, this is not payable. From the date 
of ownership, Dalkia FM has contributed 
revenue of £160.0m and operating profit 
before other items of £6.6m which is in 
line with our acquisition business case. 
Integration costs of £5.0m have been 
incurred in the year ended 31 March 2010. 
A further £2.0m of integration costs will be 
incurred in the year ending 31 March 201 1, 
while synergies of £6.0m are expected to 
be realised in that year. MITIE recognised 
intangible assets of £29 .9m, goodwill of 
£72.3m and other net assets of £1 7 .3m in 
relation to the acquisition. The charge in 
respect of the amortisation of intangible 
assets was £2.6m for the period ended 
31 March 2010. 
On 20 November 2009 we acquired 
the entire issued share capital of 
Environmental Property Services Ltd (EPS 
Ltd) from Uberior Holdings Ltd, the EPS 
senior management team and Alchemy 
Partners for a maximum consideration 
of £40.9m (including costs) with an initial 
consideration of £35.0m (on a cash free 
basis). From the date of ownership EPS 
Ltd has contributed revenue of £30.1m 
and operating profit before other items of 
£1.6m which is in line with our acquisition 
business case. Integration costs of £1.6m 
have been incurred in the year ended  
31 March 2010. MITIE recognised 
intangible assets of £13.3m, £3.7m net 
liabilities and goodwill of £31.3m in relation 
to the acquisition. 
Further details of these acquisitions can  
be found within Note 29 to the accounts.
Our entrepreneurial  
investment model 
We remain committed to our 
entrepreneurial investment model which 
has significantly enhanced the growth 
of the Group in the past. We have made 
an investment in a new start up which 
has given an equity opportunity to a 
new senior management team within 
the Care and Justice marketplace and 
complements the existing expertise and 
contracts within our security business.
As announced in August 2009 , we 
purchased certain minority shareholdings 
of six MITIE subsidiary companies under 
their respective articles of association 
and shareholder agreements. The 
total consideration for all six purchases 
amounted to £21.2m being satisfied as 
to £1.1m in cash and as to the remaining 
£20.1m by the issue of 8.5 million new 
Ordinary shares of 2.5p each in MITIE 
valued at 237 .75p per share, being the 
closing market price per MITIE share on  
24 July 2009 . 
MITIE also issued new Ordinary shares 
in respect of deferred consideration in 
respect of share purchase agreements 
signed in 2008. The total consideration 
in respect of the deferred consideration 
amounted to £1.3m being satisfied by the 
issue of 0.5 million new Ordinary shares  
of 2.5p each in MITIE, valued at 237 .75p 
per share, being the closing market price  
per MITIE share on 24 July 2009 .

Key performance indicators
Contract types split within MITIE Group operating profit margin 
(before other items*)
Capital expenditure as a % 
of revenue
Retention of existing contracts 
within Facilities Management %
Description:
In order to achieve sustainable, profitable growth,  
we monitor the percentage of existing contracts 
retained in our Facilities Management division on  
a rolling 12-month basis.
Target:
Achieve contract retention rates in excess of 90%.
Comment:
Our contract retention rate in our Facilities 
Management division stands at 87%. 
Description:
As a substantial portion of our revenue was historically 
generated through single service contracts, one of  
our opportunities for growth is through expanding  
our relationships with existing clients by providing other 
services. We have seen a trend in the markets towards 
multi-service and FM contracts over the past few years 
and we are well positioned to meet the demands of  
this trend due to our broad range of services.
We measure the percentage of revenue that is 
generated by these types of contracts in order to 
measure how well we are performing in this arena.  
57% of revenues are now attributable to multi-service 
and FM contracts.
Description:
Our operating profit margin (before other items*) 
provides us with a good indicator of the profitability of 
our business. Where we have material, non-recurring 
charges, such as integration costs, we exclude these 
from our measure.
Target range:
Maintain operating profit margins between 5.0%  
and 6.0% per annum.
Comment:
We have improved our margin by 0.1% to 5.4%.
*  Other items are non-cash or non recurring acquisition 
related items.
Description:
Our strength lies in the management of people and  
in the provision of suitable assets to support their work, 
but our business is not capital intensive. We continue  
to monitor and control capital expenditure, and target 
growth and acquisitions in areas that do not require 
substantial capital expenditure.
Target range:
Maintain below 2.0% of revenue.
Comment:
Our KPI has increased to 1.5% but is well below the  
2.0% target level.

Management retention % Reportable accidents 
per 1,000, employees
Carbon dioxide emissions
Conversion of EBITDA to cash Dividend growth
Description:
MITIE is a people business and we pride ourselves in 
creating and nurturing outstanding management. 
Monitoring how successful we are in retaining our 
people is an important measure for us.
Target:
Enhance focus on the development and retention of 
management to maintain a retention rate of over 90%.
Comment:
Our management retention rates are 92% for the year.
Description:
Reportable accidents are defined as fatalities, major 
injuries and injuries resulting in absence from work of 
over three days. Our people are our greatest asset. 
Providing them with a safe environment in which to  
work is of paramount importance to us, so we use a  
KPI for reportable accidents to assess our performance.
Objective:
Retain focus on reducing the risk of accidents in 
our business.
Comment:
Our focus on health and safety has enabled  
us to reduce reportable accidents to 3.5 per  
1,000 employees.
Description:
We are conscious of the impact of our operations on 
the environment. Our CO2 emissions are calculated 
using DEFRA conversion factors following a review of 
our fuel and utilities usage. The rate of CO2 emissions 
per MITIE employee is calculated using the average 
number of people employed during the year.  
This year our emissions have been calculated using  
the DEFRA Sept 2009 v2 conversion factors to Green 
House Gases. In accordance with DEFRA guidelines  
our prior year emissions have been recalculated for 
ease of comparison.
Objective:
Understand and minimise the environmental impact  
of our operations.
Comment:
Our normalised CO2 emissions (0.68 tonnes equivalent) 
per employee are marginally lower than the prior year. 
Description:
The efficiency with which we manage the generation  
of cash is an important indicator for our business.  
MITIE is built on a sound understanding of the 
importance of cash and working capital management 
and that ethos remains critical to our business.  
The conversion of the Group’s earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to cash  
is one of the significant cash-flow indicators for MITIE.
Target range:
Over 90.0% of Group EBITDA converted to cash.
Comment:
We have achieved our target this year with 95.2%  
of Group EBITDA being converted to cash.
The KPI for 2010/1 1 will be 80% to reflect the changing 
mix in MITIE’s business.
Description:
It is important that we continue to target a dividend 
policy that provides an appropriate return to 
shareholders with a dividend which grows in line with 
the underlying earnings of the Group. Dividend cover is 
calculated by reference to our underlying, cash-based 
earnings which we measure using our basic EPS before 
other items*. EPS before other items is 19 .5p (2009: 17 .2p) 
giving rise to underlying growth of 13.4%.
Target range:
At least in line with underlying earnings growth at a 
cover rate of 2.5x times adjusted earnings.
Comment:
Our dividend growth for the year is 13.0%, providing 
cover of 2.5x times adjusted earnings.
This year we have invested £155.7m in the completion  
of two third party acquisitions, Dalkia FM and EPS,  
and £21.2m in minority interest acquisitions in six 
companies under the MITIE Model. Our strong  
cash flows, committed banking facilities and strong  
balance sheet have ensured that these investments 
can be made against a backdrop of limited gearing, 
with EBITDA: total debt at 31 March 2010 at 0.84 and 
interest cover of 57 .9 for the year.

Factors that could affect our business
MITIE’s risk is classified into four areas: strategic; operational; 
financial; and compliance. The assessment of risk is part of our 
culture and every business segment has a comprehensive risk 
register that feeds through to the Group risk register which is 
reviewed by our Board. 
We give careful consideration to all the risks in our business and 
how we can best mitigate those risks, but we are also focused on 
the key risks, and, correspondingly, opportunities, that help meet 
our business objectives. Opposite is a summary of the risks that 
we currently see as critical to our business. On page 45 of the 
Directors’ and governance report there is more detail of our risk 
identification and management processes.

decommissioning site operated by Sellafield Ltd.  
The Sellafield Contractors Safety Award is awarded 
each year and MITIE won the top award for 
demonstrating exceptional management of its  
health and safety performance on-site over a  
12-month period after it scored the highest in an  
audit evaluating total compliance, areas of innovation 
and outstanding performance. The inspection looks 
at other issues including leadership, competence, 
environmental awareness, employee involvement 
and development, as well as safety, health and 
welfare conditions. The award recognises MITIE’s 
consistent standards which are best practice in  
health and safety risk management.  37

MITIE Group PLC   
Annual Report  
and Accounts 2010
Directors’ report: corporate governance statement
Compliance with the Code
The Board recognises that the manner in which the Group is governed is critical to the long-term success of the business and is 
committed to the principles of corporate governance, for which the Board is accountable to shareholders, as detailed in the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance 2008 (the Code). This report, together with the Directors’ Remuneration report, 
provides details of key aspects of MITIE’s corporate governance environment and explains the manner in which the Board has 
applied the principles and provisions of good governance as set out in Section 1 of the Code.
Throughout the reporting period, significant consideration has been given to the balance of the Board and its Committees and the 
Board is conscious of any non-compliance with the Code. As at the date of this report, the membership and composition of MITIE’s 
Board and its Committees is such that it meets substantially the requirements of the Code, with the only exception being that the 
Board composition reflects a ratio of 4:5 of independent Directors to non-independent Directors compared to a 1 : 1 requirement 
under the Code. The Board is satisfied with the balance and composition of the Board following its extensive review during the year. 
The Board confirms that the Group has complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code throughout the year other than 
as noted above, with the exception that:
the Board did not consist of at least an equal number of independent Non-Executive and Executive Directors (Code A.3)  –
between 1 April 2009 and 1 July 2009 and between 30 September 2009 and 1 February 2010. Further details relating to this non-
compliance are provided below;
the Audit Committee did not consist of at least three independent Non-Executive Directors (Code C.3.1 ) between 1 April 2009  –
and 1 July 2009 and between 30 September 2009 and 1 February 2010. Further details relating to this non-compliance are 
provided on page 42;
the Nomination Committee did not consist of a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors (Code A.4.1 ) for the reporting  –
period. Further details relating to this non-compliance are provided at on page 41. 
Board structure and operations
Board membership
The membership of the Board as at 31 March 2010 and biographical details of the Directors (including details of committee 
chairmanships and other positions held) are given on page 39 . During the year two Non-Executive Directors were appointed 
(Terry Morgan CBE and Larry Hirst CBE) and one retired from the Board (Ishbel Macpherson). Terry Morgan succeeded Ishbel as 
chairman of the Remuneration Committee, and also became a member of the Nomination Committee and both Terry and 
Larry became members of the Audit Committee. These Board changes occurred in accordance with the Board’s pre-existing 
orderly succession planning. Details of those Directors seeking re-appointment at the 2010 AGM are provided in the Notice of AGM 
which is also available at www. mitie.com/investors. 
Board operations
Matters that are exclusively dealt with by the Board include: setting Group objectives and strategies; approving business plans and 
budgets and monitoring performance against these; approving material tenders, acquisitions, disposals and business start-ups, 
including any material transactions outside of the normal course of business; approving the Group’s Half-yearly and Annual Report 
and Accounts; appointing and removing the Chairman, Directors and Company Secretary; and monitoring the Group’s corporate 
governance arrangements. Approvals are managed in accordance with the Group’s delegated authorities and matters are also 
set out in a schedule of matters reserved for the Board which are available at www. mitie.com/investors_corporate-governance.
Board responsibility
There is a clear division between the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive as formally set out in the terms of reference for each of 
these roles. These terms of reference have been reviewed as part of the review of the job specification of the Chairman. The 
Chairman is responsible for the effective running of the Board. This includes ensuring that the Non-Executive Directors contribute 
effectively and that the Board is aware of the views of major shareholders. He is also responsible for ensuring that the Board 
addresses major challenges faced by MITIE and for the effective performance of the Board and its committees. The Chairman is 
available to consult with shareholders throughout the year and will be available at the AGM. The Chief Executive is responsible for 
all aspects of the operation and management of the Group and its business within the authorities delegated by the Board.
The Executive Directors are collectively responsible for proposing strategy and for making and implementing operational decisions. 
Non-Executive Directors are responsible for exercising their independent skill and judgement and contributing to the formulation of 
strategy, policy and decision making. The terms of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors’ and the Executive Directors’ 
service contracts are available for inspection at MITIE’s registered office, the head office and at the AGM. The Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director is available to shareholders should they have concerns which have not been resolved through the normal 
channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or Group Finance Director or for which such contact is inappropriate in the circumstances. 41

Board balance and independence
During the year, Non-Executive Director independence was considered by the Board. The Board determined that all Non-
Executive Directors as at 31 March 2010, with the exception of the Deputy Chairman Ian Stewart, were independent in mind and 
judgement, and free from any material relationship that could interfere with their ability to discharge their duties effectively. Specific 
consideration was given to David Jenkins’ prior role with Deloitte LLP MITIE’s external auditors. The Board determined that David is 
independent given that he had not been involved in the provision of services to MITIE and the passage of time since his departure 
from Deloitte LLP in May 2004.
As part of the ongoing review of Board performance the Nomination Committee and the Board specifically reviewed the roles of 
Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, and the composition and chairmanship of each of its committees. The 
Board and the Nomination Committee recognised that, partly as a result of the changes in Board composition, there was an 
imbalance in the number of non-independent Directors and independent Non-Executive Directors. The Nomination Committee 
reviewed the skills, knowledge and experience required to fill this additional position and provided a detailed specification to the 
external search consultancy engaged to conduct the search process. This detailed search process was concluded on 1 February 
2010 when the Board was pleased to announce the appointment of Larry Hirst as an independent Non-Executive Director. The 
Board was broadly satisfied that its composition was appropriate having regard in particular to the integrity, skills, knowledge and 
experience of its Directors and the size and nature of the business, and having regard to its desire that the Board does not become 
too large and unwieldy. The Board as at 31 March was comprised of four independent Non-Executive Directors, a Non-Executive 
Director deemed non-independent as a result of his prior role as CEO of the Group, the Non-Executive Chairman and four 
Executive Directors. This will not result in absolute compliance with provision A.3.2 of the Combined Code and whilst the Board 
remains broadly satisfied with the composition and balance, however, the Board continues to be mindful of the need to maintain a 
balanced board and continues to keep the matter under careful review. 
Board committees
The Board has four formally constituted committees: the Audit Committee; the Executive Committee; the Nomination Committee; 
and the Remuneration Committee for which the duties and responsibilities are set out in the terms of reference available at 
www.mitie.com/investors_corporate-governance. Further details in relation to the composition, role and functioning of each 
committee are set out below. In addition, the Group operates an Executive Board. It is not a formally constituted committee of the 
Board, operating solely under the delegated powers of the Chief Executive, but is charged with supporting the Chief Executive in 
the operational management of the Group. 
Executive Committee 
The Executive Committee members are Ruby McGregor-Smith; Suzanne Baxter; Roger Goodman and Bill Robson. It functions 
primarily as an approval and signing committee and meets on an ad hoc basis, as and when required, with powers specifically 
delegated to it by the Board and formally six times per annum with the more widely constituted Executive Board.
Nomination Committee
As at 1 7 May 2010, the members of the Committee are: Roger Matthews (Committee Chairman); David Jenkins and Terry Morgan. 
Ruby McGregor-Smith has stepped down from the Committee but continues to attend meetings at the invitation of the chairman. 
During the reporting period, the Committee met the provisions of the Code if the Chairman is not included and deemed 
non-independent. 
During the year two meetings of the Committee took place. A key function of the Committee is to evaluate the balance and 
composition of the Board and ensure that new Directors bring the requisite skills, knowledge and experience required for the role 
being considered. During the year the Committee oversaw the Board succession planning as well as the recruitment of new 
directors. Appointments recommended to the Board by the Committee are done in accordance with the Committee’s 
appointment and recruitment process. 
Remuneration Committee
As at 1 7 May 2010, the members of the Committee are: Terry Morgan (Committee member and Chairman from 10 July 2009); 
David Jenkins; Roger Matthews; and Graeme Potts. During the year the Remuneration Committee’s members were Ishbel 
Macpherson (prior to her retirement on 30 September 2009); David Jenkins; Graeme Potts and Terry Morgan all of whom are 
independent Non-Executive Directors; Roger Matthews, who was independent prior to his appointment as Chairman is no longer 
deemed independent under the Code. The Committee held eight meetings throughout the reporting period; comprises 
independent Non-Executive Directors and meets the requirements of the Code.
The key duty of the Remuneration Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the individual remuneration packages 
of Executive Directors. As a part of this process the Committee oversaw the administration of the Group LTIP , ESOS and SA YE 
schemes (as further detailed in the Remuneration Report) and the benchmarking and review of Executive Director remuneration. 
During the year the Committee has been advised by the external remuneration consultant Kepler Associates in relation to 
Executive Director remuneration through formal benchmarking with market and industry comparators. Kepler Associates do not 
have any connection with the Group other than their formal appointment as advisers by the Remuneration Committee. The Board 
is responsible for reviewing and setting the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors. The Executive Directors are not involved in 
discussions concerning their own remuneration. Further details on Executive, Non-Executive Director remuneration and the 
Company’s share schemes are given in the Remuneration report. 42
MITIE Group PLC   
Annual Report

The Audit Committee
Role of the Committee
The Audit Committee is generally responsible for:
monitoring and reviewing the integrity of the Group’s financial statements and for any formal announcements relating to the  –
Group’s financial performance, and for reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements therein;
monitoring and reviewing the independence and objectivity of the Group’s external auditors, the objectivity and effectiveness of  –
the audit process and the effectiveness and implementation of the Group policy on the provision of non-audit services (the 
Non-Audit Services Policy); 
monitoring and reviewing the integrity and effectiveness of the Group’s internal financial controls environment, internal audit  –
function and business risk management structures; and
making recommendations to the Board on shareholder resolutions for the appointment of, and remuneration for, external auditors.  –
The terms of reference of the Committee are available at [www.mitie.com/investors_corporate_governance] and include the 
requirements of Rule 7 .21 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR) and the Code that the Company has a formally 
constituted audit committee comprised of independent Non-Executive Directors. The chairman of the Committee will be 
available at the AGM to answer any questions about the work of the Committee.
Committee composition
The Committee consists entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors and is currently chaired by David Jenkins. During the year 
the Audit Committee comprised: David Jenkins; Terry Morgan (with effect from his appointment on 1 July 2009); and Larry Hirst (with 
effect from his appointment on 1 February 2010) and Ishbel Macpherson who ceased to be a member of the Committee upon her 
retirement from the Board on 30 September 2009 . 
All members of the Committee are considered as being appropriately experienced to fulfil their duties, whilst David Jenkins 
continues to be deemed by the Board as at the date of this report, to have significant, recent and relevant financial experience 
through his qualifications and held appointments. 
The Committee ordinarily consists of at least three members and requires two members to be present to be quorate. Due to the 
board changes throughout the year, the Committee comprised only two members between 31 March 2009 and 1 July 2009 and 
30 September 2009 and 1 February 2010 but with effect from 1 February 2010 the Committee’s composition meets the requirements 
of the Code. 
Meetings of the Committee
During the year the Audit Committee held three meetings (see summary below). The Audit Committee invited the external 
auditors, Chairman, Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Head of Business Risk to attend relevant parts of the meetings 
of the Committee. The matters under consideration at these meetings included:
generally monitoring the Group’s financial reporting process and the statutory audit of the annual and consolidated Group  –
accounts;
the Half-yearly Financial Report and Annual Report and Accounts; –
critical accounting policies and judgements; –
the review of the external auditors’ audit plan, nature and scope of work and overall summary of key issues and judgements; –
the re-appointment of the external auditors; –
the approval of fees for the external auditors; –
the effectiveness of the external auditors including the appropriateness and skills of the audit team; –
compliance with the Non-Audit Services Policy by the external auditors and maintenance of auditor independence; –
the approval of the Group risk assurance framework and the internal audit plan for the year ending 31 March 2010; –
the review of key internal audit reports and findings; and –
generally monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control, audit and risk management systems and functions. –
The Committee also met separately with the external auditors and the Head of Business Risk without the presence of the Executive 
Directors.
Internal audit function
The remit of the Audit Committee also includes monitoring the internal audit function and the arrangements by which employees 
may raise concerns regarding any matters of financial reporting or other perceived improprieties across the Group. The Group’s 
internal audit function reports directly to the Group Counsel and the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Committee continues 
to review the size of the internal audit function to ensure that it maintains a strong recognition of the increasing size and complexity 
of the Group and the increasing emphasis placed upon remediation, rectification and re-audit of issues identified through the 
internal audit programme. During the year ‘whistle-blowing’ activity has been communicated to the Committee along with the 
Directors’ report: corporate governance statement 43

results of investigations carried out. These investigations have not identified any risks that result in a material, unmitigated exposure to 
the Group.
External auditors
Prior to 1994, MITIE was audited by BDO Binder Hamlyn who merged their practice with Touche Ross & Co. Since 1994, MITIE Group 
PLC has been audited by the firm now known as Deloitte LLP (previously Touche Ross & Co, Deloitte & Touche and Deloitte & 
Touche LLP). Each year the Audit Committee reviews auditor performance in respect of audit services, audit-related services and 
non-audit services. The Audit Committee is committed to ensuring the independence and objectivity of the external auditors and 
confirms that the requirements of the Non-Audit Services Policy have been met throughout the year. When considering the 
appointment of the external auditor, there are no contractual obligations that restrict the Audit Committee’s capacity to 
recommend a particular firm for appointment. The Committee has determined that, providing the work of the external auditors 
remains entirely satisfactory, formal consideration of a tender process will take place at the Audit Committee’s discretion. The lead 
audit engagement partner is rotated every five years, with the next rotation due in respect of the year ending 31 March 2014.
The Audit Committee has approved a Non-Audit Services Policy that ensures that the Audit Committee has visibility over the levels 
of non-audit work performed by the Auditors and requires the consent of the chairman of the Audit Committee for any non-audit 
spend with the auditors that, on an annual basis cumulatively exceeds 50% of the annual audit fee and/or where any item, 
regardless of amount, is considered significant. The Audit Committee is satisfied that this policy provides sufficient control over  
the levels of non-audit spend with the Auditors whilst providing sufficient flexibility for the Group Finance Director to approve 
expenditure on advice below those levels. This policy generally restricts the external auditors from performing work which will result 
in them auditing their own work, making management decisions for the Group, creating a conflict of interest, finding themselves in 
the role of advocate for MITIE or creating any potential threat to their independence. Additionally, the external auditors will only be 
considered for the provision of non-audit services if they are best suited to perform the work in question. Deloitte LLP also maintains 
its own internal controls designed to safeguard its independence. A summary of the fees paid to the external auditors is given in 
Note 5 to the financial statements.
Board meetings
Directors are supplied with an agenda and supporting papers for all Board meetings on a timely basis. This ensures that each 
Director is appropriately briefed and able to discharge their duties properly. Papers submitted regularly for the Board’s review 
include reports on: health and safety; current trading and performance; corporate development activities and matters relating 
to corporate governance. The Board will also receive, from time to time, detailed presentations from non-Board members on 
operational matters. The Board, its committees and its Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary 
and, where appropriate, external independent legal advice funded by MITIE. In addition to scheduled Board and committee 
meetings during the year, the Chairman met the Non-Executive Directors on several occasions without the Executive Directors 
being present.
All Directors are expected, where possible, to attend all Board meetings and the AGM. During the year ended 31 March 2010, there 
were six scheduled Board meetings. Additional unscheduled Board meetings were held to deal with the review and approval of 
acquisitions and issues relating to shares and other administrative matters. Dedicated budget review meetings have also been 
held. Directors’ attendance at scheduled Board and committee meetings (Audit, Remuneration and Nomination) of which they 
are members is shown in the following table:

MITIE Group PLC   
Annual Report  
and Accounts 2010
Director appointment, induction and training
Directors are appointed and may be removed in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company and the provisions 
of the Companies Acts. All Directors are subject to re-election at intervals of no more than three years in accordance with the 
Articles of Association and the Code. The Board has a general policy that: all new Directors are subject to election by the 
shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment; that each new Director receives a tailored induction suitable to their role;  
and that all new Directors receive a tailored information pack which includes a copy of MITIE’s Memorandum and Articles of 
Association, latest Annual Report and Accounts, committee terms of reference and copies of recent Board minutes and 
supporting papers. The Notice of AGM contains details of those Directors who are retiring by rotation and are proposed for 
re-election. As part of the formal Board evaluation, the Board has considered the performance of each Director seeking 
re-election and is satisfied that they continue to be effective and demonstrate clear commitment to their role.
Board performance 
The Board is committed to effective and rigorous review of its performance and that of the committees and individual Directors 
and accordingly a formal evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the Board, its committees and of each Director is 
performed annually. Director performance evaluation for the current year has been carried out using a combination of formal 
appraisal questionnaires completed by all Board members and through informal meetings and discussions. The results of these 
reviews are reported to the Board and used to improve the Board’s performance. Results of the prior year appraisal process 
identified an overall level of satisfaction with the performance of the Board and that of its committees and Directors. 
Notwithstanding this, several further improvements in Board operation have been implemented during the reporting year, 
including the restructuring of reporting format and content, the greater use of Board briefings by senior management or executive 
Board members, and have continued to rotate meetings around various Group operational locations.
Directors’ interests and rights
Details of the beneficial and non-beneficial interests (including share options) of each Director and connected persons in the 
Ordinary share capital of the Company are provided in the Remuneration Report. None of the Executive or Non-Executive 
Directors has a service contract with a notice period greater than 12 months. All Directors have access to management and the 
operating businesses of MITIE at their request and have secure remote access to Board and other relevant papers held on a 
dedicated online facility.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company maintains Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance providing appropriate cover for any legal action brought against 
its Directors and/or officers. The Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company extend the protection provided to 
Directors in respect of any litigation against Directors relating to their position as a Director of the Company and specifically provide 
that the Company may indemnify Directors against any liability incurred in connection with any negligence, default, breach of 
duty or breach of trust in relation to the Company and that the Company may fund defence costs. Individual Directors would still 
be liable to pay damages awarded to the Company in any action against them by the Company and to repay their defence 
costs (to the extent funded by the Company) if their defence was unsuccessful. 
Director conflicts
The Board has a formal policy on the declaration and management of director conflicts in accordance with the Articles of 
Association of the Company. Any potential situation or transactional conflict must be reported as soon as possible to the Chairman, 
the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary. Where a potential conflict is authorised (under the statutory powers and powers 
granted under the Articles of Association to the Board), such conflict is kept under ongoing review.

Statement on Internal Controls
Introduction
The Board recognises that it is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. This system is 
designed to support the Group’s pursuit of achieving its objectives and strategies and also the identification and management of 
risks that may impact upon MITIE and upon the environment in which the Group operates. The system of internal control is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failing to achieve these objectives and strategies and it will only provide reasonable, 
and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement and loss.
Internal control framework
The Board and senior management are responsible for maintaining and developing a culture of integrity, competence, fairness 
and responsibility throughout the Group. Essential to this is the recruitment and retention of highly-skilled individuals who promote 
the highest standards of integrity, competence, governance and ethical behaviour. Group policies and procedures support the 
business by providing an operational internal control framework for the Group, each division and operating business to work within. 
This framework is designed to balance the need for Group-wide consistency and control with the autonomy that local 
management require to develop and manage each operating business successfully. In order to delegate responsibilities clearly 
and effectively to the Group’s operating businesses and to ensure compliance with the matters reserved for the Board, a formal 
delegated authorities matrix is issued to all operating subsidiaries that includes both financial and non-financial authorities and 
matters relating to strategy, contract approval, recruitment, capital expenditure, banking transactions and specific Group policies. 
Each operating subsidiary is headed by a managing or regional director who has authority to manage their business within this 
framework of delegated authorities and Group policies and procedures outlined above. To support the business further, the Group 
has a team of specialist resources with individuals responsible for specific functions including legal, health and safety, IT, insurance, 
human resources, tax, pensions, purchasing, finance and business risk. Regular dialogue between these functions and the 
operating businesses provides additional support and forms a key part of the system of internal control.
Monitoring the system of internal control
The Board is responsible for monitoring the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Monitoring is carried 
out throughout the year via the receipt and review of various reports, presentations and discussions with management, as set out 
above. Specifically, the Audit Committee supports the Board by monitoring and guiding the activities of the internal audit function, 
including approving the internal audit programme, reviewing regular internal audit reports from the business risk function and  
via meetings with the Head of Business Risk. The internal audit programme is designed to provide a level of assurance over key  
risks as identified in the Group risk register and is developed by the Head of Business Risk who reports to the General Counsel  
and independently to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also receives regular reports from the external auditors who 
contribute a further independent perspective on certain aspects of the internal financial control systems arising from their work. 
As necessary, the Audit Committee will have dialogue with the Executive Directors on their control responsibilities and in particular, 
those relating to specific matters reported by internal or external audit.
Risk management
The Board confirms that there is a continuing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group. 
The Board also confirms that this process has been in place throughout the year under review and up to the date of approval of 
the Annual Report and Accounts and that this process is monitored by the Board in accordance with the revised guidance on 
internal control issued by the Financial Reporting Council. The process for identifying, evaluating and managing risks requires the 
Group and its principal businesses to consider strategic, operational, financial and compliance risks and the effectiveness of the 
mitigating controls based on a pre- and post-controls risk evaluation. The principal risks identified from this process are recorded on 
risk registers which are maintained by the Group’s Business Risk function. This register is reviewed periodically (at least twice per year) 
by the Board. The risk register forms the basis of the internal audit programme for each year with risk areas reviewed on an annual 
to triennial basis dependent upon materiality and inherent risk assessment.
Reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control
In line with Turnbull Guidance, the Board performs a formal annual assessment of the operation and effectiveness of the system  
of internal control and updates this assessment prior to the signing of the Annual Report and Accounts. The Board also holds 
discussions with senior management and reviews the results of a formal internal controls review and system effectiveness 
confirmation from each operating subsidiary. The Head of Business Risk attends each Audit Committee meeting to provide regular 
updates on the effectiveness of the group’s internal controls. The Board confirms that management has taken steps during the year 
to improve further the system of internal control, embed effective controls further into the operations of the Group and to address 
improvements as they come to management’s attention. These steps are monitored at executive level to ensure they are 
implemented appropriately and that ultimately they are effective. 46

Annual Report  
and Accounts 2010
Consolidated accounts preparation and financial reporting
The consolidated accounts of the Group are prepared by the Group Finance function that is responsible for the review and 
compilation of reports and financial results from each of the operating divisions and subsidiaries within the Group, in accordance 
with the group internal control and reporting procedures. Each operating division support their report and results submission with a 
statement of compliance with the Group’s principal internal controls which is subject to review and sample audit by the internal 
audit function. In addition, the representations made by the Board in support of the consolidated financial statements including 
those in relation to the operating divisions are supported by detailed papers and cascaded reporting requirements throughout the 
Group, all of which are reviewed by internal audit and presented to the Audit Committee and the Board for final approval. 
Internal control systems: information and communication
The Group maintains a number of systems and processes that report relevant information to Group executive management and 
the Board as necessary. This includes financial and non-financial information regarding business performance, compliance with 
policy and procedure, relevant regulations and business critical matters. At an operational level each division and business holds 
regular executive board meetings. To maintain and develop relationships between separate divisions and to address specific 
matters, regional meetings are also held and are attended by regional representatives of each division. Senior Group 
management also regularly attend these meetings.
Going concern
The Directors acknowledge the Financial Reporting Council guidance on going concern issued in October 2009 . The Group’s 
business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Business 
review as referred to on page 38. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Financial review on pages 30 to 33. In addition, Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities, and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the 
Group should be able to operate within the level of its current committed banking facility of £230.0m which expires in January 2012. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for  
the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Annual Report  
and Accounts. 
Auditors
Disclosure of information to the auditors
Each of the Directors in office as of the date of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts confirms that:

he/she has each taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant  –
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of such information.

Financial results and dividends
The profit before taxation for the financial year is £79 .7m (2009: £75.9m). The Directors have declared/recommended dividends 
as follows:
paid (on 4 February 2010) an interim dividend of 3.7p per Ordinary share (£13.1m) –
recommended a final dividend of 4.1p per Ordinary share (£14.5m)  –
total Ordinary dividend of 7 .8p per share (2009: 6.9p) (£27 .6m) –
The final dividend, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM, will be paid on 13 August 2010 to Ordinary shareholders on the 
register on 25 June 2010. The Company operates a Dividend Re-Investment Plan (DRIP). Further details on the operation of the DRIP 
can be obtained from the Company registrar.
Capital structure and powers of shareholders
Details of changes to the Company’s share capital are given in Note 28 to the financial statements. The Company has a single 
class of shares – 2.5p Ordinary shares – with no right to any fixed income and with each share carrying the right to one vote at 
general meetings of the Company. Under the Company’s Articles of Association holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to 
participate in any dividends pro rata to their holding. The Board may propose and pay interim dividends and recommend a final 
dividend for approval by the shareholders at the AGM. A final dividend may be declared by the shareholders in a general meeting 
by ordinary resolution, but such dividend cannot exceed the amount recommended by the Board. 
Certain shares that are issued as consideration upon acquisition by the Company of the shares of minority shareholders in MITIE 
Model companies have restrictions placed upon them that both prevent the transfer of such shares and/or attach specific claw-
back provisions for periods of up to two years following allotment. Otherwise, there are no specific restrictions on the size of any 
shareholding or on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the provisions of the Articles of Association of the Company 
(available at www. mitie.com/investors_corporate-governance) and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of  
any agreements between Company shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.  
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital. Details of employee share schemes are set out  
below and in Note 32 to the Accounts. 
The 2009 AGM authorised:
the Directors to allot (under s80 Companies Act 1985) up to 122,805,320 shares (representing 38% of the issued share capital as at  –
the date of the Notice of AGM) – during the reporting period, the Directors utilised this authority (and the preceding authority) to 
allot 30,153,652 shares;
the dis-application (under Sections 94-95 Companies Act 1985) of pre-emption rights over allotted shares up to a total of  –
16,150,903 shares (representing 5% of the issued share capital as at the date of the Notice of AGM); and
the Company to make market purchases of its own shares up to a total of 32,301,805 shares (representing 10% of the issued share  –
capital as at 31 March 2009).
Further details of these authorisations are available in the notes to the 2009 Notice of AGM (available at www. mitie.com/investors). 
Shareholders are referred to the 2010 Notice of AGM (which accompanies this report and/or is available at www. mitie.com/
investors) which contains similar such provisions. These provisions have been updated to take account of the implementation of the 
relevant sections of the Companies Act 2006 which came into effect on 1 October 2009 . 
In August 2009 , the Company announced the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Dalkia Technical Facilities 
Management which was part funded through the placement of 19 million 2.5p ordinary shares in the Company which constitutes 
less than 10% of MITIE’s current issued share capital. The proceeds of the placing were used to partly refinance the debt drawn 
down to satisfy the transaction consideration. 
During the year to 31 March 2010 there have been no purchases by the Company of MITIE shares. The exact amount and timing  
of future purchases will be determined by the Company and will be dependent on market conditions and other factors. It is the 
Company’s present intention to cancel any shares it buys back, rather than hold them in treasury, but this policy will be reviewed  
on a case-by-case basis. Further details on the proposed renewal of powers for share buyback and the allotment of shares in the 
Company are provided in the Notice of AGM.
Under the terms of certain shareholder agreements relating to MITIE Model companies and the articles of association of those 
companies, certain minority shareholders in such companies may provide an option for the purchase by the Company of their 
minority shares. The mechanism for calculating the price to be paid in respect of such transfer is transparent, on an arms-length 
basis, and in accordance with the pricing structure generally applicable for other transfers under the MITIE Model. Details of these 
structures are generally available (to the extent incorporated into the articles of association for individual MITIE Model companies) 
from Companies House at www.companieshouse.gov.uk. 
There are a number of other agreements with provisions that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company such as bank facility agreements, property lease arrangements and employee share plans. None of these are 
considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact on the business or the Group as a whole. The Directors are not aware of 
any agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees that provide for compensation for loss of office or 
employment that occurs solely because of a take-over bid.
Directors’ report: other information 48
MITIE Group PLC   
Annual Report  
and Accounts 2010
With regards to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Code, 
the Companies Acts and related legislation. The Articles may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. The powers of 
the Directors are described in the Matters Reserved to the Board (available at www. mitie.com/investors_corporate-governance) 
and as set out above.
Substantial interests in share capital
As at 1 7 May 2010 the Company has been notified of the following significant holdings of voting rights in its shares under the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules: 
 
Number of 
Ordinary shares 
of 2.5p each 
Percentage 
 of share  
capital 
Majedie Asset Management Limited 16,327 ,802 5.05%

Legal & General Group PLC 12,666,918 3.92%
Fidelity International Limited 1 0,065, 11 8 3.22%
Shareholder communications
The Board is committed to an ongoing dialogue with institutional and private investors. The principal method of communication 
between the Board and shareholders remains news announcements, the Interim Management Statements, the Half-yearly 
Financial Report, the Annual Report and Accounts, the Corporate Responsibility Report and MITIE’s website, www.mitie.com.  
A full programme of formal and informal events, institutional investor meetings and presentations are also held following the 
Half-yearly Financial Report and Preliminary Results announcements which are led by the Chief Executive and Group Finance 
Director. The Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director are available for additional meetings with shareholders 
upon request. The Company believes that such meetings should be at the instigation of shareholders and should not be at the 
active solicitation of the Company. During the reporting period, no such requests were received by the Company, although all the 
Non-Executive Directors were present at the 2009 AGM and made themselves available for direct discussions with shareholders. 
Latest Group information, financial reports, corporate governance and CR matters, Half-yearly Financial Report and Preliminary 
Results presentations, major shareholder information and all announcements are made available to shareholders via the MITIE 
website (www.mitie.com) which has a specific area dedicated to investor relations. 
Significant importance is attached to investor feedback on the Group’s performance, and as such the Executive Board receives 
an investor relations report at each meeting detailing corporate news, share price activity, investor relations activity and major 
shareholder movements. The Board is updated by the Executive Directors on these matters and receives detailed analyst  
and investor feedback following the Half-yearly Financial Report and Preliminary Results presentations. The AGM also allows 
shareholders to address and discuss any issues surrounding the Group directly with the Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
Electronic communications
The Directors remain committed to improving and extending the methods in which the Company communicates with its 
shareholders and wish to move towards an increase in electronic communication. At the 2007 AGM, shareholders approved 
certain amendments which aligned the Company’s Articles of Association with the new provisions of the Companies Act 2006 in 
relation to electronic shareholder communications. The Board has been disappointed with the level of uptake by shareholders to 
date and would wish to encourage all shareholders to register to receive communications from the Company electronically – thus 
realising the environmental and cost benefits of reduced printing and carriage of hard copy reports and other communications. 
Details on how to register are provided on the inside back cover of this report.
AGM
The 2010 AGM will be held at the offices of MITIE Group PLC, Ground Floor East, Cottons Centre, Cottons Lane, 47 /49 Tooley Street, 
London, SE1 2QG at 2.30pm on 14 July 2010. The Notice of AGM will be available at www. mitie.com/investors on 1 1 June 2010.
Employee involvement and employee equity-based incentivisation
The Board remains committed to fostering and developing a culture of employee involvement in the business through 
communication with employees and equity involvement whereby employees are enabled to build a stake in the Company 
through the Company’s various equity-based incentive schemes. 
Communication with MITIE’s employees continues to have a high priority. The Group communicates with employees through the 
use of: Group-wide mailings and updates; employee-focused initiatives; the use of Group-wide and business-specific intranet sites; 
and provision of access to broadcasts of periodic financial presentations. Through the use of their own communication processes 
each of the Group’s businesses is encouraged to ensure that employees are kept informed on Group and individual business 
developments. The Group continues to operate its group-wide MITIE Stars programme to recognise and reward exceptional 
performance by its people and in 2008 launched MITIE’s Got Talent as a Group-wide talent contest to encourage employee 
engagement and recognition. The Group CR Report contains further details of these initiatives. Employees remain actively involved 
in the Group’s activities via an employee forum. This year the forum held one meeting. The Board will continue to seek increasing 
involvement and activity of the employee representatives. Social networking sites are an increasingly important part of 
engagement and communication with employees.

The Board believes that the Group’s culture of employee equity involvement is a significant driver in the Group’s growth performance 
and that this assists in attracting and retaining skilled and committed employees. During the year the Group has continued to 
operate: the MITIE Long Term Incentive Plan to incentivise and reward senior members of the MITIE management team; the 
Executive Share Option Scheme for certain other employees below Board level and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
which is open to all eligible employees of the Group. The Board will continue to review and, where appropriate, recommend 
amendments to equity-incentive schemes, in order to maximise the effectiveness and incentive value of such schemes.
The Group has historically grown by giving entrepreneurial managers the opportunity to create wealth by taking the risk of starting 
a new business, taking equity stakes at fair value in those new businesses in conjunction with MITIE and then, dependent on a 
pre-agreed pricing structure, offering to sell that stake to MITIE predominantly in exchange for MITIE shares, at the option of MITIE. 
This incentivisation scheme typically provides for such managers to elect to offer their stake in their business to MITIE between the 
fifth and tenth years from the date of establishment of the business. Recipients of shares under this incentivisation scheme are 
generally restricted from selling the MITIE shares received as consideration for a minimum of two years. The Board believes that this is 
a unique business model that has driven MITIE’s past performance and continues to ensure a close alignment of interest between 
MITIE shareholders and the management and employees of the Group. It is the Board’s current intention to continue to utilise  
such structures.
Employee involvement, disability and opportunities
The Board remains committed to developing further a culture that encourages the inclusion and diversity of all of the Group’s 
employees through respecting and appreciating their differences and to promoting the continuous development of employees 
through skills enhancement and training programmes. The Group’s employment policies are designed to attract, retain, train  
and motivate the very best people, recognising that this can be achieved only through offering equal opportunities regardless of 
gender, race, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation or any other aspect of diversity. Applications from disabled persons are 
always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned. It is the policy of the Group that the training, 
career development and promotion of disabled persons (including those who become disabled whilst employees of the Group) 
should, as far as reasonably possible, be identical to that of other employees.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise bank loans, finance leases, overdrafts and performance guarantees. In addition, 
various other financial instruments such as trade creditors and trade debtors arise from its trade. The use of interest rate swaps and 
currency derivatives are used to manage interest and currency risk when necessary or material. The principal objective of these 
instruments is to raise funds for general corporate purposes and to manage financial risk. Further details of these instruments are 
given in Note 23 to the financial statements.
Payment of creditors
The Group’s policy is to comply with the terms of payment agreed with suppliers, preferably on the Group’s standard purchasing 
terms (as notified to suppliers), or otherwise to adhere to the suppliers’ standard terms. At 31 March 2010, the Group had 31 days’ 
purchases outstanding (2009: 34 days).
Fixed assets
The Board does not believe that there is any material difference between the book value and the current open market value of 
the Group’s interests in land and buildings.
Events after the balance sheet date
There have not been any significant events since the balance sheet date.
Future developments
The operating review sets out the Board’s view on likely future developments of the Group.
Research and development
Given the nature of the Group’s activities it does not carry out any material research and development work.
Donations
Donations to charity and community projects made during the year amounted to £1 10,500 (2009: £184,018). It is the Group’s policy 
not to make political donations, and during the reporting period no political contributions were made (2009: £nil). The total value of 
community investment is disclosed in more detail on pages 27 and 28 [and in our CR Report 2010 was £392,483 (2009: £603,659)]. 
Branch offices
The Group operate registered branch offices in the Republic of Ireland and the Isle of Man. Further details of the Group’s principal 
subsidiaries are given in Note 35 to the financial statements.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the accounts
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts. The Directors are required to prepare the financial 
statements for the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRS) and have 
chosen to prepare Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(UK GAAP).
In the case of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounts, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that 
financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. 
This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions 
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s 
‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements’ . In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be 
achieved by compliance with IFRS where applicable. The Directors are also required to: properly select and apply accounting 
policies; present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and, provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific IFRS requirements is insufficient 
to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance. 
In the case of UK GAAP accounts, the Directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; make 
judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and, state whether applicable accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements. 
The Directors are responsible for: keeping adequate accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company; safeguarding the assets; taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities; and the preparation of a Directors’ report and Directors’ remuneration report which comply with the relevant 
requirements of the Companies Acts, Listing Rules and Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTRs). 
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company website. Financial statements published by 
the Company on this website are prepared in accordance with UK legislation which may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
To the best of each Director’s knowledge: the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting 
standards and contained within this Annual Report and Accounts, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and the management report, 
which is incorporated into the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with the description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties they face.

Remuneration policies and principles
General remuneration principles
The Committee is responsible for formulating remuneration policies and principles that promote the success of the Company in 
creating value for shareholders over the longer term through alignment with the corporate objectives and business strategy after 
taking into full account the associated risks. The Committee understands that it is accountable to shareholders for the decisions 
made on Executive remuneration and seeks to maintain open and constructive communication where changes on remuneration 
policy are being proposed.
The remuneration policy for the Company’s Executive Directors and other Group senior executives is shaped by the requirement to 
align the interests of the senior executive team with those of MITIE’s shareholders. The policy has particular regard to the Company’s 
and the Group’s long-standing culture of encouraging equity ownership in order to achieve this alignment. 
The Committee, and the Board, continue to believe that the principle of equity incentivisation has been a key driving force in the 
past success of the Group. Consequently, in order to maintain and further develop MITIE’s performance culture, the Committee 
believes that the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors should continue to contain significant performance-related 
equity-based elements.
The Remuneration Committee believes exceptional performance should be matched with appropriate remuneration to retain 
and motivate Directors and management while being mindful of the behaviour that such packages create. The Committee 
ensures that packages are linked to and support the long-term performance of the Company. 
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy of the Company promotes and embeds the Company’s remuneration principles. The Company’s policy is:
Performance linked Company performance determines a significant element of remuneration packages.  
Only top-end performance can achieve the stretching targets that are reflected in the 
performance-linked pay elements of the packages.
Shareholder aligned The discretionary share schemes are based on EPS growth aligning the interests of 
shareholders and the members of the senior executive team. Bonuses are structured to reward 
the attainment of the strategic target of sustainable, profitable growth.
Comprehensive and simple The overall remuneration policy is comprehensive without becoming overcomplicated  
and encourages Executives to concentrate on growth of the Group.
The Remuneration Committee believes and is satisfied that the remuneration policy is appropriate and takes account of the 
Group’s performance and strategic objectives.
The Committee plans to continue to use this approach and policy as a framework for the setting of future packages, whilst having 
due regard for the remuneration packages offered across the Group and the external market.
Share Ownership Policy
A share-ownership policy for Executive Directors was introduced in 2007 at the same time as the LTIP . Under this policy, all Executive 
Directors are required, over time, to build and maintain a shareholding in the Company worth 100% of base salary (150% of salary 
for any Executive Director who is granted an LTIP award of more than 100% of base salary). The Committee recognises that the 
principal mechanism for building up this holding will be on the exercise of LTIP awards and accordingly, until such time as the 
shareholding requirement is met, Executive Directors will be expected to retain no fewer than 50% of shares (net of taxes) that vest 
under the LTIP .

Key elements of Executive Director Remuneration
The overall package for Executive Directors consists of a fixed element (salary and certain benefits) and a variable element 
(annual performance-related bonus and long-term equity based incentives) and has been structured in order to align the 
Executive Directors’ packages with the interests of shareholders. The Committee tests the remuneration structure regularly to ensure 
that it remains aligned with business needs and is appropriately positioned relative to the market. The balance between the fixed 
and variable elements of the Executive Directors’ packages is set out below.
Base salary
Benchmarking is conducted by external remuneration consultants against sector and size comparators, in respect of base salary, 
total cash (i.e. salary plus bonus) and total remuneration. The Committee also takes account of a range of other factors when 
determining appropriate salary levels including market conditions and the responsibilities and skills of the individual Directors.  
As detailed within this report, the Executive Directors received salary increases during the year. The Committee felt the increases 
were appropriate given the continued growth and performance of the Group, with due consideration of the outcomes of the 
benchmarking exercise. 
Annual bonus
Variable remuneration is designed to drive MITIE’s performance, and be aligned to the Group strategic objective of achieving 
sustainable, profitable growth. The annual bonus rewards short-term Company performance. 
Shareholders were consulted during 2009 and approved an amendment to the bonus arrangements for the Executive Directors. 
Previously, the bonus was earned in full for achieving a single specific performance target. This was replaced with a two-stage 
bonus scheme; 100% of base salary continues to be earned for the achievement of Group budgeted financial performance, but 
Executive Directors have the opportunity to earn up to 125% of salary for a ‘stretched’ level of performance. In light of the increase 
in maximum bonus opportunity, any bonus earned above 100% of salary is deferred into MITIE Group PLC ordinary shares for two 
years and is forfeited should the Director leave the business during this period. 
During the year under review, MITIE delivered the required stretch target. The Executive Directors were therefore each awarded 
performance related bonuses amounting to 125% of base salary. 100% of base salary was paid in cash and 25% of base salary 
deferred into MITIE Group PLC shares. 
Share-based incentives
The remuneration package reinforces long-term decision making and sustainable growth through the use of share-based 
incentives. For Executive Directors and certain senior Group executives, the principal methodologies and schemes designed to 
support this ethos are the Company’s LTIP (as described on page 55) and the Share Ownership Policy (as described on page 52). 
Vesting of share awards under the LTIP are based on performance measured over three years. This period is considered 
appropriate to align rewards to Executive Directors with the strategic objectives of the Company. Certain Executive Directors still 
retain options granted under the ESOS (details of the holdings are set out in Table 4 of Section B below). It is the intention of the 
Committee not to issue further ESOS options to Executive Directors, although ESOS continues to be used to reward and incentivise 
certain other members of the senior Group executive and management teams.
Other standard benefits
The other benefits awarded to the Executive Directors consist of contributions to a pension scheme, private healthcare and the 
provision of a car allowance. 54

Executive Directors’ Service Contracts
All Directors are appointed for an indeterminate period of office but are subject to re-election at the Annual General Meeting 
every three years in accordance with the Combined Code.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts are available for inspection at MITIE’s registered office, the head office and at the AGM. 
All the Executive Directors have rolling service contracts which provide for a maximum of 12 months’ notice from either party. There 
are no provisions for compensation on termination of employment set out within the contracts of the Executive Directors. The dates 
of the service contracts of the Executive Directors are set out below:

Policy on external appointments
The Board recognises that the appointment of Executive Directors to non-executive positions at other companies can be 
beneficial both for the individual Director and the Group through the broadening of their experience and knowledge. Roger 
Goodman receives fees of £40,000 per annum in respect of his role as Chairman of Networkers International plc. Ruby McGregor-
Smith receives fees of £45,000 per annum in respect of her role as a Non-Executive Director of Michael Page International plc.  
As set out in the Directors’ and Governance Report, Executive Directors are entitled to retain any fees earned from external 
appointments. 
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The fees for the Non-Executive Directors are set by the Chairman and the Executive Directors and they are reviewed annually. The 
fee level is designed both to recognise the contribution and responsibilities of the role and to attract individuals with the experience 
and skills required to contribute to the future development of the Board and the Group. The Non-Executive Directors are paid a 
basic fee with an additional fee for chairing a committee, together with expenses incurred in carrying out their duties on behalf of 
the Company. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company’s share schemes or the annual bonus 
scheme, nor do they receive pension or ancillary benefits. Fee levels for the reporting year were maintained at levels paid in the 
prior year. Further details of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are provided in Table 1 of Section B below.
Non-Executive Directors’ engagement terms
The terms of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at MITIE’s registered office, the head office 
and at the AGM. The Non-Executive Directors are engaged for a term of three years which is terminable on either three or six 
months’ notice. During the year, the Company changed its policy in respect of notice periods offered to Non-Executive Directors 
from six months to three months.

Employee share schemes
Equity-based incentive schemes
The Committee regularly reviews the Company’s share-based incentive schemes to ensure their continued effectiveness.  
The Group operates three equity-based incentive schemes as set out below. The interests of the Executive Directors in each  
of these schemes is set out in Tables 4 and 5 of Section B below. 
SAYE Scheme (‘SAYE’)
The SA YE Scheme is the Company’s non-discretionary option scheme open to all eligible employees and is approved for HMRC 
purposes. Salary deductions are made and savings are used to purchase the options at the end of the three-year period.  
No options have been issued to any Directors under the SA YE Scheme. An award may not be granted under the SA YE Scheme 
after September 201 1, when the current scheme expires.
Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’)
The ESOS is a discretionary scheme and therefore not open to all employees of the Group. The award of options under the ESOS is 
generally focused towards employees who are below main Board level and who do not participate in the LTIP . Currently, ESOS is 
used to reward and motivate employees with continuous service of six months who are part of the leadership team of the Group 
(includes senior managers, managers and team leaders). The scheme has been approved by HMRC and options over shares to an 
individual limit of £30,000 can be awarded in the approved element of the scheme. Above £30,000, options are awarded under 
the unapproved (for HMRC purposes) section of the scheme. Overall, awards are limited to 100% of an individual’s base salary. 
Following changes to the scheme approved by shareholders at the 2007 AGM, the ESOS has a single performance threshold for 
vesting of the options – average growth in earnings per share over the three-year vesting period must exceed inflation (measured 
as RPI) plus 4% per annum. The scheme permits the grant of share appreciation rights and the settlement of outstanding 
unapproved options with share appreciation rights. No price is payable upon award in respect of ESOS. 
The share options detailed in Table 4 of Section B were granted to Executive Directors prior to 2007 under the ESOS and the 
performance conditions that applied at the date of grant required a percentage growth in the Company’s earnings per share 
equal to or in excess of 10% per annum compound over the period from the date of grant of the option to the date on which the 
option first became exercisable. The performance conditions relating to the awards to Directors detailed below are the same as for 
any other member of the schemes who received awards at the same time. Since the grant to Ruby McGregor-Smith and Suzanne 
Baxter detailed in Table 4 of Section B, there have been no grants to Directors under the ESOS (both under the unapproved part 
and the HMRC-approved part), and it is the Committee’s current policy that equity-based incentives for Directors will be based 
solely upon LTIP awards. 
Long-term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
The LTIP is a discretionary scheme and therefore not open to all employees of the Group. The LTIP is focused on incentivising 
Executive Directors and senior management. Awards under the LTIP may be made, either through a joint-ownership structure or 
through direct grants, in the form of nil-cost options, conditional shares or forfeitable shares. The Committee may also decide to 
grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards or to satisfy share-based awards in cash, although it does 
not currently intend to do so. An award may not be granted under the current LTIP after 26 July 201 7 , when the current scheme 
expires. No payment (other than in respect of any individual recipient electing to pay income tax and national insurance, where 
appropriate) is required for the grant of an award. 
Awards are not transferable, except on death, and are not pensionable. The scheme rules, in line with standard industry practice, 
contain provision for pro-rata vesting in the event of retirement, redundancy, disability and/or death. In the event of a change of 
control of the Group, awards will be pro-rated both for time and performance, subject to the discretion of the Committee.
The upper limit on the market value (as at grant) of awards that an individual Executive Director may receive in any financial year is 
200% of annual base salary. The Committee intends to use this upper limit only in respect of awards to Ruby McGregor-Smith (the 
Chief Executive) and Suzanne Baxter (the Group Finance Director) and a limit of 100% of annual base salary will be applied to the 
other Executive Directors. In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment, the rules currently allow for awards of up to 250% of 
any employee’s annual base salary. 
The Committee continues to believe that EPS is the most appropriate long-term performance measure for MITIE as it is aligned with 
the Group’s strategy and KPIs. This performance criterion has the advantages of simplicity and transparency which the Committee 
believes enhance the LTIP’s effectiveness as an incentive. Awards will normally vest after three years provided that certain 
performance criteria have been met. All awards are subject to performance conditions that require adjusted EPS, less inflation 
(measured by the retail prices index – RPI), to exceed certain performance thresholds over a three-year period. Where EPS growth  
is less than a ‘lower performance threshold’ no awards will vest; awards vest in full when EPS growth is equal to, or more than, an 
‘upper performance threshold’; vesting is on a straight-line basis for performance between these levels. 
For LTIP awards granted in 2007 and 2008, the lower and upper performance thresholds were RPI + 5% per annum and RPI + 14% 
per annum respectively. Following consultation with major shareholders during the year, the upper performance threshold was 
revised to RPI + 10% per annum, first effective for LTIP awards granted in 2009 (i.e. no changes have been made to the performance 
criteria of LTIP awards granted in earlier years); the lower performance threshold remains at RPI + 5% per annum. The Committee 
believes the revision to the upper performance threshold is necessary to (i) ensure the LTIP remains motivational in light of the 
current uncertainty in the general economy, (ii) ensure our policy to deliver upper quartile pay for upper quartile performance  
is achieved, and (iii) be more competitive with comparators’ long-term incentive performance scales. 56

Annual Report  
and Accounts 2010
Remuneration report
As announced on 30 March 2010, the Committee approved the accelerated vesting of LTIP awards granted in 2007 , in line with the 
plan rules. This decision was taken by the Committee after thorough and considered reflection and will not result in any additional 
costs to the Company. The upper performance threshold applicable to the 2007 LTIP award was assessed to have been achieved 
and consequently the awards granted in 2007 vested in full. The Committee will assess the extent to which the performance 
conditions applicable to the award have been satisfied on the normal vesting date of 26 July 2010 and any award that would not 
have vested on the normal vesting date will be clawed back. 
LTIP awards granted to, and exercised by, the Executive Directors are set out in Table 5 of Section B below.
Share dilution
The Company manages dilution rates within the ABI guidelines of 10% of issued Ordinary share capital in respect of all-employee 
schemes and discretionary schemes (the LTIP , ESOS and SA YE) and 5% in respect of discretionary schemes (the LTIP and ESOS). In 
calculating compliance with these guidelines the Company allocates available ‘headroom’ on a ten-year flat-line basis, making 
adjustments for projected lapse rates and projected increases in issued share capital. 
LTIP awards are satisfied through the market purchase of shares held by the MITIE Group PLC Employee Benefit Trust 2007 and the 
MITIE Group PLC Employee Benefit Trust 2008. The potential dilution of the Company’s issued share capital is set out below in respect 
of all outstanding awards granted under the Company’s equity-based incentive schemes which are to be satisfied through the 
allotment of new shares.

Total shareholder return
The graph below shows the total shareholder return performance of MITIE shares compared with the FTSE 250 and FTSE 350 Support 
Services indices over a five-year period to 31 March 2010. The Committee is of the opinion that these comparators provide a clear 
picture of the performance of MITIE relative to a range of companies of comparable size as well as a specific group of companies 
within the same sector. Total shareholder return is calculated according to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and assumes that all dividends are reinvested.
The market price of the Company’s shares as at 31 March 2010 was 228.7p. The highest and lowest prices during the year were 
277 .8p and 185.5p respectively.

Annual Report

Audited information
The benefits of the Executive Directors who are members of the MITIE Group PLC Defined Benefit Pension Scheme are based on a 
pensionable salary capped at £123,600. The Company made contributions to the Group’s defined benefit scheme on behalf of 
the three directors who are members of the scheme at a rate of 10% (2009: 10%) of the value of the benefit cap of £123,600. 
Following consultation with major shareholders in 2009 , the Committee approved a revision to the Chief Executive’s pension  
benefit to bring its value into line with market practice and with effect from 1 April 2009 , Ruby McGregor-Smith received a salary 
supplement of 20% of salary.
Suzanne Baxter is not a member of the MITIE Group PLC Defined Benefit Pension Scheme as the scheme was closed to new 
entrants in 2005, before she joined the Group. It has always been the intention of the Remuneration Committee that the value of 
the pension benefits provided to Suzanne Baxter should mirror the value of the pension benefits provided to the other Executive 
Directors under the capped defined benefit arrangements, albeit that her benefits are provided through a separate defined 
contribution arrangement. Due to the differences in the nature of the Group’s defined benefit scheme and the defined 
contribution scheme established for Suzanne Baxter, the cost to the Company of providing mirrored benefits for Suzanne Baxter is 
greater than the cost of providing the same value of benefits to the other Executive Directors under defined benefit arrangements. 
The contributions made by the Company into Suzanne Baxter’s defined contribution scheme and the value of accrued benefits 
under the scheme have been reviewed during the year by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that the value of the benefits 
provided under that scheme mirror, as far as possible, the capped benefits of the defined benefit pension arrangements provided 
to the other Executive Directors. Pension contributions for Suzanne Baxter were 13.5% of base salary for the year ended 31 March 
2010 (2009: 13.5% of base salary) and were paid into a separate defined contribution pension scheme. With effect from 1 April 2009 , 
Suzanne Baxter received a salary supplement of 20% of base salary, following approval of the Remuneration Committee  
(see Table 1 ), in order to bring the value of her overall pension benefit into line with market practice.

Table 7 above details the beneficial interests of the Directors (who were in office on 31 March 2010) in the share capital of certain  
of the Company’s subsidiary companies. The interests of Directors in these subsidiary companies were acquired under the MITIE

since 2004 and it is the Company’s policy that Directors will not be entitled to participate in any MITIE Model investments in  
the future.
At the general meeting on 28 September 2009 , shareholders approved a substantial property transaction under which the 
Company acquired 3,600 shares in MITIE Transport Services Limited from Ruby McGregor-Smith, for a total consideration of £166,752

Independent auditors’ report to the members of MITIE Group PLC 
For the year ended 31 March 2010 
We have audited the Group financial statements of MITIE 
Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2010 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows and the related notes 1 to 35. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
− give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 31 March 2010 and of its profit for the year 
then ended; 
− have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union;  
− and have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
− the information given in the Directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Group financial 
statements; and 
− the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion: 
− the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited is not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns; or 
− certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
− we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
− the Directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ 
report: Corporate governance statement in relation to 
going concern; and 
− the part of the Corporate governance statement relating 
to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of 
the June 2008 Combined Code specified for our review. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the parent company 
financial statements of MITIE Group PLC for the year ended 
31 March 2010.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
For the year ended 31 March 2010 
1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010 are prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted for use in the European Union and therefore the Group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
As more fully detailed in the Directors’ report: Corporate Governance statement, the Group’s financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial 
instruments which are required to be measured at fair value. 
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those 
followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2009 except for the 
adoption in the year of: 
− IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’; the Group determined that the operating segments are the same as those reported 
under the previous standard (IAS 14 ‘Segment Reporting’). The Group has also early adopted the Improvement to 
IFRS 8 issued in April 2009 which clarified that a measure of segment assets should be disclosed only if that amount 
is regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker; 
− IAS 1 (Revised) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’; adoption of this standard has resulted in the inclusion of the 
statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated statement of changes in equity as primary statements; 
− IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations’; the standard has been amended to change 
the definition of vesting conditions and to clarify the accounting treatment of cancellations by parties other than the 
entity. The adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on the financial performance or position of 
the Group and therefore no restatement was required; and 
− IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’; the standard has been amended to require additional disclosure of the basis 
of fair value measurements and liquidity risks.  
The following amendments and interpretations are also effective for the first time in the current year but have had no 
impact on the results or financial position of the Group: 
− IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’; 
− IFRIC 15 ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’; 
− IFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation’; 
− IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’; 
− IAS 27 (Revised) ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’; 
− Amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1 ‘Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation’; 
− Amendment to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement – Amendments for embedded 
derivatives when reclassifying financial instruments’; and 
− Amendments resulting from May 2008 Annual Improvements to IFRSs. 
The following standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective (and in some cases have not yet 
been adopted by the EU): 
− Amendment to IFRIC 14 ‘Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement’; 
− IFRIC 17 ‘Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners’; 
− IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments’; 
− IFRS 3 (Revised) ‘Business Combinations’; and consequential amendment to: IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate 
Financial Statements’, IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates’ and IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’; 
− IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement’; 
− Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions’; 
− IAS 24 (Revised) ‘Related Party Disclosures’; 
− Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation – Amendments relating to classification of rights issues’;  
− Amendments to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement – Amendments for eligible hedged 
items’; and 
− Amendments resulting from April 2009 Annual Improvements to IFRSs.

1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies 
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material financial 
impact on the Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application, except in respect of the impact on the 
treatment of the acquisition of subsidiaries when IFRS 3 (Revised 2008) comes into effect for business combinations for 
which the acquisition date is on or after 1 April 2010. 
Significant accounting policies under IFRS 
The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group’s IFRS financial information are set 
out below. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of MITIE Group PLC and all its subsidiaries. 
The financial statements of the parent Company and subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (with the exception of Dalkia FM companies). Adjustments are made in the 
consolidated accounts to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist between UK GAAP and IFRS. 
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from inter-group transactions, have 
been eliminated in full. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. 
Interests of minority shareholders are measured at the minority’s proportion of the net fair value of the assets and 
liabilities recognised. 
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at 
the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the 
business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for 
recognition are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) 
that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations’, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of 
the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately 
in profit or loss. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the 
fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of 
acquisition. Cost of acquisition includes all deferred amounts that become payable in the future. 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses. It is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not 
subsequently reversed. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested 
for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the 
unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is 
not reversed in a subsequent period. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not 
been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.  MITIE Group PLC

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets identified in a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition. 
Software and development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset if the asset created can be identified, if it is 
probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits and if the development cost of the asset can 
be measured reliably. 
Following initial recognition, the carrying amount of an intangible asset is its cost less any accumulated amortisation and 
any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when 
there is an indication that they may be impaired. Amortisation expense is charged to administrative expenses in the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over its useful life. 
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the 
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue represents income recognised in respect of services provided during 
the period (stated net of value added tax) and is earned almost exclusively within the United Kingdom. 
Revenue from multi-service contracts consists of various components which operate independently of each other and 
for which reliable fair values can be established. Each component is accounted for separately as if it were an individual 
contractual arrangement. 
Revenue from long-term contracts represents the sales value of work done in the year, including fees invoiced and 
estimates in respect of amounts to be invoiced after the year end. Profits are recognised on long-term contracts where 
the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty. In calculating this, the percentage of completion method 
is used based on the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated cost. Cost includes direct staff costs and outlays. 
Full provision is made for all known or anticipated losses on each contract immediately such losses are forecast. 
Gross amounts due from customers are stated at the proportion of the anticipated net sales value earned to date less 
amounts billed on account. To the extent that fees paid on account exceed the value of work performed, they are 
included in creditors as gross amounts due to customers. 
Variations in contract work and claims are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. 
Operating profit 
Operating profit is stated before investment revenue and finance costs. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets 
that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of 
those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs 
are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
Leasing 
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased 
item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased item or, if lower, at the present value 
of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the 
lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are 
charged directly against income. 
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term. 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating 
leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term. Any lease incentives are amortised over the lesser of the life of the operating lease or to the first 
opportunity for termination.  MITIE Group PLC

1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies 
Foreign currency 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing 
at that date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates 
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are 
included in profit or loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried 
at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-
monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, 
any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. 
Retirement benefit costs 
The Group operates and participates in a number of defined benefit schemes. In respect of the schemes in which the 
Group participates, the Group accounts for its legal and constructive obligations over the period of its participation 
which is for a fixed period only. 
In addition, the Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying 
employees. 
Payments to the defined contribution and stakeholder pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit 
Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses 
are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside profit and loss and presented in 
the statement of comprehensive income. 
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset 
resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in 
future contributions to the plan.  
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and 
is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised 
if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of 
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged 
or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less expected residual value of the assets over their estimated useful 
lives and is calculated on a straight-line basis as follows: 
Freehold buildings and long leasehold property – over 50 years 
Leasehold improvements    – period of the lease 
Plant and vehicles    – 3–10 years 
Annually the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate 
cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs.  
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows 
have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, 
the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss 
is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) 
in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Costs represent materials, direct labour and overheads incurred in bringing the inventories to their present condition 
and location. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to 
completion and estimated selling costs. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where 
appropriate. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group derecognises financial assets and liabilities only when the 
contractual rights and obligations are discharged or expire. 
Assets that are assessed not to be individually impaired are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. 
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables includes the Group’s past experience of collecting 
payments, the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period as well as observable 
changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables. 
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade 
receivable is considered uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of 
amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the 
allowance account are recognised in the income statement. 
Financial assets comprise loans and receivables and are measured at initial recognition at amortised cost. 
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised where there is objective evidence 
that the asset is impaired. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge and manage risks associated with 
interest. The Group does not currently designate any derivative financial instruments as qualifying for hedge accounting. 
Such derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value through profit and loss (through investment revenue and 
finance costs) with fair value determined by reference to market rates.  
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs. 
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on 
an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that 
they are not settled in the period in which they arise.  MITIE Group PLC

Overview

1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
All financial liabilities are held at amortised cost with the exception of derivative financial instruments which are classified 
as fair value through profit and loss.  
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a 
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to 
be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only 
when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement 
net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting 
the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to 
the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost. 
Pre-contract and mobilisation costs 
All bid costs are expensed through the income statement up to the point where contract award (or full recovery of 
costs) is virtually certain. Bid costs incurred after this point are then capitalised within trade and other receivables. On the 
contract award these bid costs are amortised through the income statement over the contract period by reference to 
the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. 
Once a contract has been awarded, costs directly related to the mobilisation of that contract are treated as an integral 
part of contract costs and are capitalised where management is satisfied that these costs have been separately 
identified and providing the profitability of the contract can be reasonably forecast. These capitalised costs are then 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract. If the contract becomes loss making, the costs are written 
off immediately.  
Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes. For all grants of share options and 
awards, the fair value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the corresponding 
expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of shares that 
will eventually vest. 
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has 
applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 April 2005. 
2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 above, management 
has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
financial statements. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised for certain project based contracts based on the stage of completion of the contract activity. 
This is measured by comparing the proportion of costs incurred against the estimated whole-life contract costs except 
where this would not be representative of the stage of completion. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year, are discussed below. 
Impairment of goodwill 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to 
which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of  
cash-generating units and also the selection of appropriate discount rates to use in order to calculate present values. 
The carrying value of goodwill is £324.0m (2009: £201.2m) at the balance sheet date; see Note 12. Management do 
not consider that any reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions would result in an impairment. 
Retirement benefit obligations 
The calculation of defined benefit obligations is dependent on material key assumptions including discount rates, 
mortality rates, future returns on assets and future contribution rates. The present value of defined benefit obligations 
at the balance sheet date is £180.1m (2009: £126.1m); see Note 33.

3. Business and geographical segments 
Business segments 
The Group manages its business on a service division basis. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its 
primary segmental information. 
On 1 April 2009 we rebranded our three operating divisions to Facilities Management (previously Facilities Services), 
Property Management (previously Property Services) and Asset Management (previously Engineering Services). 
Further we elected to enhance our Asset Management proposition through its combination with our Engineering 
Maintenance business, which had previously been a part of our Facilities Services business. The acquired business of 
Dalkia Technical Facilities Management (Dalkia FM) was incorporated into Asset Management with effect from 
12 August 2009 and Environmental Property Services Limited (EPS Ltd) was incorporated into Property Management 
with effect from 20 November 2009. The financial data below reflects the performance of our three divisions in the 
organisational structures that applied during the year.

With effect from 1 April 2010, the acquired Dalkia FM business and our Engineering Maintenance business were 
restructured to bring together our technical facilities management proposition within a new operating division branded 
Technical Facilities Management which generated £344.8m of revenue and £15.5m of operating profit before other 
items in the year ended 31 March 2010. Furthermore, the Engineering Contracting offering of our Asset Management 
business, which generated £201.2m of revenue and £4.9m of operating profit before other items in the year ended 
31 March 2010, was combined with our Property Management business to consolidate its proposition. A proforma

The revenue analysis above is net of inter segment sales which are not considered significant. 
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of external revenue in 2010 or 2009. 
The Group has early adopted the Improvement to IFRS 8 issued in April 2009 which clarified that a measure of segment 
assets should be disclosed only if that amount is regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and 
consequently no segment assets are disclosed. 
Geographical segments 
Predominantly all of the Group’s operations are located in the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands. The Group 
considers all operations form part of that single reportable geographical segment.  MITIE Group PLC

11. Earnings per share 
Basic and diluted earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 ‘Earnings Per Share’. 
The calculation of the basic and diluted EPS is based on the following data: 
 
Number of shares 
2010 
million 
2009
million
Weighted average number of Ordinary shares for the purpose of basic EPS 338.4 318.3
Effect of dilutive potential Ordinary shares: share options 6.0 4.0
Weighted average number of Ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted EPS 344.4 322.3
The weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the year excludes those accounted for in the Own 
shares reserve which were purchased in the market and held by the MITIE Group PLC Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy 
options under the Group’s LTIP share option scheme. During the year 1.7m shares were purchased at a cost of £4.5m. 
The Own shares reserve represents the cost of 3.3m (2009: 2.2m) shares in MITIE Group PLC. 
Following the acquisition of Dalkia FM, 19.0m new Ordinary shares of 2.5p each were placed on 12 August 2009 with 
certain institutional and other qualified investors. 9.0m Ordinary shares of 2.5p were also allotted in August in respect of 
acquiring minority interests (see Note 29).  MITIE Group PLC

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are 
expected to benefit from that business combination. Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs in the following business 
segments, which is how goodwill is monitored by the Group internally.

* Re-presented in the structure which applied during the year, see Note 3. 
The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value 
in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and 
direct costs during the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry 
growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future 
changes in the market. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board for 
the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of 2% 
(2009: 2%) per annum. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. 
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows from CGUs, which are based on the Company’s Weighted Average 
Cost of Capital, are as follows:

Customer relationships are amortised over the remaining period of the contract, which currently ranges between six 
and eight years. Other acquisition related intangibles include acquired software and are amortised over their useful lives 
which currently range from three to ten years. Software and development costs are amortised over their useful life of 
between five and ten years, once they have been brought into use.  MITIE Group PLC

Before accepting new customers, the Group uses external credit scoring systems to assess the potential customer’s 
credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring are updated as appropriate. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk in relation to trade receivables at the balance sheet date is the fair value of trade receivables. 
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade 
receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited 
due to the customer base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit 
provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debt. The average credit period taken on sales of services was 
38 days (2009: 33 days). 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of

Included in cash and cash equivalents are deposits totalling £7.3m (2009: £7.3m) held by the Group’s insurance 
subsidiary, which are not readily available for the general purposes of the Group. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-

The banking facilities are unsecured but have financial and non-financial covenants and obligations commonly 
associated with these arrangements.  
All borrowings are in sterling and are measured at amortised cost. The Directors estimate that the carrying amount of the 
Group’s borrowings approximates their fair value. 
Included in non-current liabilities are £100.0m of bank loans (2009: £nil), £4.6m (2009: £2.9m) of obligations under finance 
leases (see Note 25) and £1.6m (2009: £1.6m) of loan notes which are repayable up to 2013. 
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value; fair value measurements are classified into three levels, 
depending on the degree to which the fair value is observable: 
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from other observable inputs for the asset or liability; and 
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on 
observable market data.  
We consider that the derivative financial instruments fall into level 2.

24. Financial risk management objectives 
The Group’s Treasury function monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group. 
These risks include credit risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and market risk. 
Credit risk  
The Group’s credit risk to all of its banks and financial counterparties is monitored on an ongoing basis and formally 
reported quarterly. The value of business placed with financial institutions is reviewed on a daily basis. 
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade and other receivables. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are 
net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event 
which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. In addition, 
where appropriate, certain debts are subject to credit insurance. 
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties 
and customers. 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group has very limited trading transactions in foreign currency and considers the need to hedge its exposures 
appropriately. It does not currently have any significant foreign currency balances or financial instruments. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a cash flow projection model which considers the maturity of the 
Group’s assets and liabilities and the projected cash flows from operations. Bank facilities which allow for appropriate 
headroom in the Group’s daily cash movements are then arranged. 
The tables below summarise the maturity profile (including both interest and principal cash flows) of the Group’s 
financial liabilities:

Financial liabilities 229.5 4.5 234.0
Financial assets at 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009 have a maturity of less than one year. 
Market risk  
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of interest rates. The Group’s Treasury function reviews its risk 
management strategy on a regular basis and will appropriately enter into derivative financial instruments in order 
to manage interest rate risk. Group policy is not to trade in financial instruments. 
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax for 
the year ended 31 March 2010 and reserves would decrease/increase by £0.3m (2009: £0.1m). 
Capital risk management  
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity. The capital structure of the Group 
consists of net (debt)/funds per Note 26 and equity per the consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
The Group’s capital structure is reviewed regularly. The Group is not subject to externally imposed regulatory capital 
requirements with the exception of those applicable to the Group’s captive insurance subsidiary.  MITIE Group PLC

The average remaining lease term is 35 months (2009: 33 months). For the year ended 31 March 2010, the average 
effective borrowing rate was 4.2% (2009: 5.8%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed 
repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. All lease obligations 
are denominated in sterling. 
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount. The Group’s obligations under 
finance leases are protected by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets.

During the year £1.3m of deferred contingent consideration in respect of the purchase last year of the minority 
shareholdings in MITIE Interiors Limited, MITIE Property Services (Eastern) Limited, and MITIE Technology & Infrastructure 
Limited was settled by the issue of new MITIE shares. £0.7m of deferred contingent consideration in respect of the 
acquisition in 2007 of Robert Prettie was settled in cash. 
Provision is made for deferred contingent consideration, which may become payable up to 2013 subject to profit 
targets being attained, at the best estimate of the Directors. A total of £3.5m was provided in respect of acquisitions 
made during the year (Note 29). 
The provision for insurance claims represents amounts payable by MITIE Reinsurance Company Limited in respect of 
outstanding claims incurred at the balance sheet dates. These amounts will become payable as each year’s claims 
are settled.

The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Dalkia FM and EPS Ltd is attributable to the underlying profitability of the 
companies, expected profitability arising from new business and the anticipated future operating synergies arising from 
assimilation into the Group. 
Provision is made for deferred contingent consideration at the Directors’ best estimate of the likely future obligation. 
Deferred contingent consideration of up to £3.5m, which may become payable in 2010 subject to certain profit targets 
being attained, is included above. No deferred contingent consideration is payable in respect of the purchase of 
Dalkia FM. 
Dalkia FM contributed £160.0m to revenue and £6.6m to the Group’s operating profit before other items for the year. 
EPS Ltd contributed £30.1m to revenue and £1.6m to the Group’s operating profit before other items for the year. If the 
acquisitions had taken place at the start of the year, the Group’s revenue and operating profit before other items would 
have been approximately £1,870m and £100m respectively.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
30. Contingent liabilities  
The Company is party with other Group companies to cross guarantees of each other’s bank loans, commitments and 
overdrafts of £270.0m (2009: £265.0m). 
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims that are in the 
ordinary course of business. The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, either 
individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position. 
Deferred contingent consideration relating to acquisitions has been accrued at the Directors’ best estimate of the likely 
future obligation of £12.9m (2009: £11.0m) per Note 27. The actual amounts payable may vary up to a maximum of 
£32.4m (2009: £31.0m) dependent upon the results of the acquired businesses. 
In addition, the Group and its subsidiaries have provided guarantees and indemnities in respect of performance, issued 
by financial institutions on its behalf, amounting to £23.4m (2009: £20.6m) in the ordinary course of business. These are not 
expected to result in any material financial loss.

32. Share-based payments 
Equity-settled share option schemes 
The Company has four share option schemes: 
The MITIE Group PLC Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
The LTIP was introduced in 2007. The awards of shares or rights to acquire shares (the awards) are offered to a small 
number of key senior management. Where offered as options the exercise price is nil. The vesting period is three years. 
If the awards remain unexercised after a period of four years from the date of grant, the awards expire. The awards may 
be forfeited if the employee leaves the Group. Before the awards can be exercised, a performance condition must be 
satisfied; the number of awards that vest is determined by a sliding scale above the Retail Price Index per annum 
compound growth in earnings per share over a three-year period. 
The MITIE Group PLC 1991 Executive share option scheme  
The Executive share option scheme exercise price is equal to the average market value of the shares over the five day 
period immediately preceding the date of grant. The vesting period is three years. If the options remain unexercised 
after a period of ten years from the date of grant the options expire. Options may be forfeited if the employee leaves 
the Group. No options have been granted under this scheme since August 2001. 
The MITIE Group PLC 2001 Executive share option scheme  
The Executive share option scheme exercise price is equal to the average market value of the shares over the five day 
period immediately preceding the date of grant. The vesting period is three years. If the options remain unexercised 
after a period of ten years from the date of grant the options expire. Options may be forfeited if the employee leaves 
the Group. Before options can be exercised, the performance condition that must be satisfied is that the percentage 
growth in earnings per share over a three-year period must be equal or greater than 10.0% per annum compound in 
respect of awards prior to July 2007 and 4.0% above the Retail Price per annum thereafter.  MITIE Group PLC

32. Share-based payments 
The MITIE Group PLC 2001 SAYE scheme 
The SAYE scheme is open to all employees. The exercise price is not less than 80.0% of the market value of the shares on 
the day preceding the date on which invitations to participate in the scheme are issued. For options granted prior to 
September 2008, the vesting period is five years. For options granted in September 2008 and thereafter, the vesting 
period is three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of six months from the date of vesting, the options 
expire. Options may be forfeited if the employee leaves the Group.

* Included within this balance are 0.3m (2009: 0.6m) options that have not been recognised in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 as the options were 
 granted on or before 7 November 2002. These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.

 4.0 2.4
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 234p (2009: 
201p). The options outstanding at 31 March 2010 had exercise prices (other than nil in the case of the LTIP) ranging from 
117p – 254p (2009: 95p – 254p) and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.6 years (2009: 4.7 years). In the 
year ended 31 March 2010, options were granted in June, July and August 2009 in respect of the LTIP, SAYE and 
Executive share option schemes. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates is 
£4.7m. In the year ended 31 March 2009, options were granted in June, July and September 2008 in respect of the LTIP, 
Executive and SAYE share option schemes. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those 
dates is £4.0m. 
The fair value of options is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are 
as follows: 
 2010 2009
Share price (p) 133–230 133–230
Exercise price (p) 0–254 0–254
Expected volatility (%) 27–36 27–30
Expected life (years) 3–6 3–6
Risk-free rate (%) 2.42–5.25 4.17–5.25
Expected dividends (%) 1.43–3.30 1.43–3.15
Expected volatility was based upon the historical volatility over the expected life of the schemes. The expected life is 
based upon historical data and has been adjusted based on management’s best estimates for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
33. Retirement benefit schemes  
Defined contribution schemes 
The Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for qualifying employees. The assets 
of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds controlled by the scheme providers. The Group 
paid employer contributions of £7.2m (2009: £2.9m) during the year. 
Defined benefit schemes 
Group defined benefit scheme 
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme called the MITIE Group PLC Pension Scheme where MITIE Group 
PLC is the principal employer following the merger of the MITIE Group PLC Passport Pension Scheme with the MITIE Group 
PLC Pension Scheme in May 2008.  
The assets of the scheme are held separately from the Group. Contributions to the scheme are charged to the income 
statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees’ working lives with the Group.  
Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 0 and 66 % of final salary on 
attainment of a retirement age of 65. No other post-retirement benefits are provided. The schemes are funded schemes. 
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Group scheme’s assets and the present value of their defined benefit 
obligations was carried out at 1 April 2008 by Mr Chris Bamford, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, from AON 
Consulting Limited. 
Other defined benefit schemes 
Grouped together under ‘Other schemes’ is one (2009: one) scheme in which the Group is a participating employer and 
a number of schemes to which the Group makes contributions under Admitted Body status to our customers’ defined 
benefit schemes in respect of certain TUPE employees. These valuations are updated by the actuaries at each balance 
sheet date. The present values of the defined benefit obligations, the related current service cost and past service cost 
were measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method. 
For the Admitted Body Schemes (principally the West Midlands Pension Fund), which are all part of the Local 
Government Pension Scheme, the Group will only participate for a finite period up to the end of the contracts. 
The Group is required to pay regular contributions as decided by the relevant Scheme Actuaries and detailed in the 
schemes’ Schedule of Contributions. In a number of cases contributions payable by the employer are capped and any 
excess recovered from the body that the employees transferred from. In addition, in certain cases, at the end of the 
contract the Group will be required to pay any deficit (as determined by the Scheme Actuary) that is remaining for its 
notional section of the scheme.

The overall expected return on assets is calculated as the weighted average of the expected return of each asset class. 
The expected return on equities is the sum of dividend growth and capital growth net of investment expenses. The return 
on gilts and bonds is the current market yield on long-term bonds. The expected return on property has been set equal 
to that expected on equities less a margin. The expected return on other assets is the rate earned by the scheme on 
cash and alternate assets. 
The sensitivity of defined benefit obligations to changes in principal actuarial assumptions is shown in Note 2.  MITIE Group PLC

Independent auditors’ report to the members of MITIE 
 
We have audited the parent company financial 
statements of MITIE Group PLC for the year ended 
31 March 2010 which comprise the Company Balance 
Sheet and the related notes 36 to 49. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for 
this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the parent company financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
− give a true and fair view of the state of the parent 
company’s affairs as at 31 March 2010; 
− have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
− have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the parent company 
financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion: 
− adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or 
− the parent company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
− certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
− we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the Group financial 
statements of MITIE Group PLC for the year ended 
31 March 2010 and on the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as having 
been audited.

Notes to the Company financial statements 
For the year ended 31 March 2010 
36. Significant accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by company law. They have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and law.  
As more fully detailed in the Directors’ report: Corporate governance statement, the Company’s financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have been applied consistently throughout the year 
and the preceding year. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.  
Tangible fixed assets 
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is 
charged so as to write off the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives and is calculated on a straight-line basis 
as follows: 
Plant and vehicles  3–10 years 
Software and development costs 5–10 years 
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed 
the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of tangible fixed assets is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets 
that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of 
those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs 
are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, 
for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the 
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is charged to the profit and loss account, net of 
any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, 
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.  
Taxation 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more 
tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax 
rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in tax computations in 
periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not provided on timing 
differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted 
earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are not discounted.  MITIE Group PLC

Notes to the company financial statements 
 
36. Significant accounting policies 
Financial instruments  
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts are recognised in the profit and loss account where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an 
accruals basis in the profit and loss account and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that 
they are not settled in the period in which they arise.  
Trade payables are measured at amortised cost. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Share-based payments 
The Company operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes. For all grants of share options 
and awards, the fair value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the corresponding 
expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Options over the Company’s shares awarded 
to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries are accounted for as a capital contribution within the carrying value of 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings. 
Pensions  
Pension costs represent amounts paid to one of the Group’s pension schemes. For the purposes of FRS 17 ‘Retirement 
Benefits’ the Company has been unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Group defined 
benefit pension scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. Therefore the Company is accounting for contributions 
to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. Note 33 to the consolidated financial statements sets out the 
details of the IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ net pension liability of £10.5m (2009: £0.4m).  
37. Profit for the year 
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and 
loss account for the year. MITIE Group PLC reported a profit after taxation for the financial year ended 31 March 2010 
of £10.1m (2009: £53.1m), which includes £4.7m of non-distributable profits that arose from internal restructuring during 
the year. 
The auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the Company was £50,000 (2009: £45,000).  
Detailed disclosures of Directors’ remuneration and share options are given in the audited section of the Directors’ 
remuneration report contained in the consolidated financial statements.

included as a liability in these financial statements.  MITIE Group PLC

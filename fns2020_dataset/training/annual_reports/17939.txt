Return of Capital
In July 2012 Booker Group plc issued £124m of shareholder equity to acquire Makro in the UK. Following the successful integration 
of Makro into the Group and a period of strong cash generation, the Board implemented a capital return to shareholders of 
3.50 pence per ordinary share (at a cost of approximately £61m) in July 2014. Given the continued successful development 
of the Group, the Board is proposing a second capital return to shareholders of 3.50 pence per ordinary share (at a cost of 
approximately £62m, based on the current issued share capital of the Company). It is again proposed that this is achieved by the 
issue of a new class of ‘B’ shares which shareholders will be able to redeem for cash. The return of capital requires the approval 
of shareholders, which will be sought at the Annual General Meeting on 8 July 2015. Further details of the proposed return of 
capital will be set out in a circular to shareholders which will accompany the notice convening this year’s Annual General Meeting. 
We currently anticipate returning a similar amount to shareholders in July 2016 and will provide an update on this at the 2016 Final 
Results announcement in May 2016 in light of circumstances prevailing at that time.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to report that Booker 
Group plc has delivered another good 
performance. In the 52 weeks to 27 
March 2015 sales rose by 1.5% to 
£4.8bn and operating profit (before 
exceptional items) of £140.3m was up 
17%. Customer satisfaction continued 
to improve, once again achieving best 
ever scores. The financial performance 
was good and the Group ended the 
financial year with net cash of £147.0m. 
The drive into the catering market is 
working, with Booker like-for-like total 
sales to caterers (excluding Makro) up 
by 2.0%. Booker like-for-like total sales 
to retailers (excluding Makro) increased 
by 2.7%. 
The plans to ‘Broaden’ the business 
are going well. In the 52 weeks to 27 
March 2015 Booker distributed £1.4bn 
of product to our customers’ premises 
versus £1.3bn last year as we continue 
to expand our delivered service. Booker 
Direct, Chef Direct, Classic and Ritter-
Courivaud, our specialist delivered 
businesses, remain on track. Internet 
sales were £874m compared to £777m 
in the previous year and sales at Booker 
India are making good progress. 
Makro has made a good contribution 
to the Group. We now have everybody 
operating on common systems 
and have eleven combined Makro / 
Booker business centres which are 
performing well.
I should like to thank all our colleagues 
for their contribution to the success of 
the Group in the year just ended.
Basic earnings per share were 6.73 
pence, up from 6.06 pence last 
year. Given the strong operational 
performance and cash flow of the 
business the Board recommends the 
payment of a final dividend of 3.14 
pence per share (2014: 2.75 pence per 
share) which, together with the interim 
dividend, makes a total dividend for the 
year of 3.66 pence per share (2014: 3.20 
pence per share). The final dividend is 
payable on 10 July 2015 to shareholders 
on the register on 12 June 2015.
In addition to the final dividend, the 
Board is recommending a special 
capital return to shareholders of 3.50 
pence per ordinary share (at a cost 
of approximately £62m, based on the 
current issued share capital of the 
Company). This follows the capital 
return of 3.50 pence per share to 
shareholders in July 2014. We currently 
anticipate returning a similar amount to 
shareholders in July 2016.
Having been Chairman of Blueheath 
Plc, which merged with Booker in 2007, 
and then Chairman of the combined 
Group, I have been in the Chair for nine 
years. During this time there has been 
considerable progress by the Group. 
Given the strength of the Group, I feel it is 
a good time to move on. I will step down 
at the AGM in keeping with corporate 
governance best practice, and I wish the 
Company the best for the years ahead.
The process to identify my successor 
is well underway and an update will 
be provided.
Outlook
The Group’s trading in the first seven 
weeks of the current financial year 
is ahead of last year. However, we 
anticipate that the challenging consumer 
and market environment will persist 
through the coming year and the UK’s 
food market remains very competitive.
Whilst there is increasing price 
competition in the UK grocery and 
discount sectors, we will continue to 
deliver our plans to offer our customers 
even better choice, prices and service 
supported by the continued delivery 
of our efficiency programmes. We 
are on track to deliver an outcome 
for the new financial year in line with 
our plans and to make progress in this 
challenging environment. 
Annual General Meeting
Our Annual General Meeting will be held 
on 8 July 2015. The notice of Annual 
General Meeting and a circular setting 
out further details of the proposed 
return of capital, which itself requires 
shareholder approval, will be issued to 
shareholders in due course.

keep our core line prices at market 
leading levels to provide the best 
possible margin for our customers.

Since November 2005 Booker Group

and Broaden’ the business
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Since November 2005 Booker Group 
has been seeking to ‘Focus, Drive and 
Broaden’ the business. We continue to 
make good progress. 
Focus 
(commenced November 2005)
Booker seeks to become the most 
efficient operator in our sector. We 
continue to improve business efficiency. 
We ‘stop, simplify and standardise’ work 
and invest most of the resulting savings 
in customer service. 
Drive  
(commenced March 2006)
Booker Wholesale, our cash and carry 
business, served 523,000 customers 
this year up from 503,000 last year. We 
continue to ‘Drive’ choice, price and 
service for our customers. Each year 
we survey 40,000 customers to identify 
where improvements can be made. 
Customer satisfaction improved again 
this year. Customer satisfaction is a 
key measure within the business and 
we have made significant progress 
since 2006. 
Choice Up
• Booker seeks to grow brands and 
own brand volumes.
• In 2010 we launched Farm Fresh. 
Sales in the year to 27 March 
2015 were £65m. This is despite 
considerable deflation in the fresh 
markets. The quality and freshness 
of the produce is second to none and 
can be delivered to our customers 
within 48 hours of being harvested.
• We launched CleanPro last year. 
This range of professional cleaning 
products has been well received 
by customers. We have 50,000 
customers buying CleanPro each 
week with sales of £39m per annum.

price deflation, particularly in 
the catering sector. Booker has 
consistently offered low prices on 
these core products and maintains 
its promise of helping the customer 
during challenging times.
Better Service
• Our people are doing an excellent 
job. Our customers rate Booker 
people highly. Business Centre 
teams across the Group have been 
trained in PRIDE to help improve 
the Parking, Reception, Internal, 
Delivery and Exit experience.
• We have continued to expand and 
improve our delivery service.
• We have more specialist butchers 
and greengrocers within the business 
than last year. We also have skilled 
fish mongers operating in our Makro 
business centres.
Catering
• Catering like-for-like sales grew by 
2.0%, as our choice, prices and 
service continued to improve. Our 
catering development sales force 
continues to serve our existing 
customers and to introduce new 
customers to Booker. 
Premier
• Premier, Booker’s symbol group, 
grew to 3,082 stores (2,902 
stores last year). Sales to these 
customers grew by 14%. The retail 
development team has put a lot 
of work into both compliance and 
building the sales and profits of 
existing Premier stores.
• For the first time we advertised 
Premier on the television this year. 
This was well received by Premier 
retailers and consumers.
• Premier still remains unique by 
operating a no cost model for 
members, and has the advantage 
for retailers of having deliveries and 
also the ability to top-up at their local 
Booker branch. We install the fascia 
and imagery free of charge and also 
provide a market leading promotion 
every four weeks. All goods are 
delivered at cash and carry prices.
• We are committed to Premier 
and continue to see attractive 
opportunities for independent 
retailers to prosper in the UK’s 
convenience market.
Customer Delivery
• Booker offers a seven days a 
week multi-temperature delivery 
service to both retail and catering 
customers (70% of the fleet has 
multi temperature capacity). All 
of our delivery customers pay the 
same price for goods as our collect 
customers. Our delivery business 
continues to grow (from £600m in 
2008/9 to £1.4bn in 2014/15).

Classic Drinks
• We are now operating Classic, 
our specialist on trade wholesale 
business, via the Booker and Makro 
business centres. This is working well.
Broaden  
(commenced April 2007)
In the UK, Booker seeks to offer the best 
choice, price and service to caterers, 
retailers and small business. We also 
seek to become the suppliers’ preferred 
route to market. In addition, we want 
to sell new products and services and 
reach new customers. In India we seek 
to become the best supplier to Kirana 
stores. To achieve these objectives, 
we are ‘Broadening’ the business. 
‘Broaden’ includes:
Makro
• Makro has had a good year. In eleven 
locations we have combined Makro 
and Booker. This has been tailored to 
the local market. Critically, Makro is 
helping increase our capacity to grow 
delivered sales. This should help the 
Group grow to an estimated £6bn of 
sales in the next few years.
Digital 
• Sales at booker.co.uk were £874m, 
up from £777m last year and £15m 
in 2005. All these sales are delivered 
to our customers’ premises. We have 
408,000 customers registered on 
the website compared to 334,000 
last year. Customers can view their 
account details, use an iPhone app 
and order products. We have also 
doubled the number of stock keeping 
units available to a typical customer 
on the website through our special 
order system. This has generated 
sales of £5m. 
Booker Direct/Ritter-Courivaud 
and Chef Direct
• Booker Direct serves national 
accounts from our distribution 
centres, including the prison service 
in England and Wales, Marks & 
Spencer and most of the cinema 
chains in the UK.
• In 2010 we acquired Ritter-Courivaud, 
a leading speciality food supplier to 
restaurants. Through combining the 
logistics expertise we have in Booker 
Direct, with the catering knowledge 
from Ritter-Courivaud and the 
Groups’ buying scale, we launched 
Chef Direct in 2012. Chef Direct is 
based in Didcot and has won some 
important clients such as Aramark 
and Wagamama. Aramark serves 
250,000 meals a day and, through 
working with Booker Direct, their 
road miles have been halved and 
service has been improved.
Family Shopper
• We continue to develop Family 
Shopper, a local discount format. 
This is doing well. At May 2015, we 
have thirty stores and, although it 
is early days, the response to this 
format has been encouraging.
Booker India 
• In September 2009 we opened our 
first business centre in Mumbai. 
We now have 19,000 customers 
and have also launched 190 Happy 
Shopper symbol retailers which 
harness the lessons learned from 
Premier in the UK for the Kirana 
stores of Mumbai. We now have four 
branches in Mumbai, one in Surat and 
one joint venture branch in Pune. We 
continue to review growth options in 
India and look forward to developing 
the Booker offer to become the best 
choice, price and service supplier to 
Kirana stores and caterers.
Sustainability 
• Booker was the first UK wholesaler to 
achieve a third consecutive Carbon 
Trust Standard and the first in the 
UK to achieve the new Carbon Trust 
Waste Standard. Booker are also 
The Grocer Gold ‘Green Wholesaler 
of the Year’ 2014.
• Over 20,000 customers are now 
recycling with Booker through our 
packaging and used cooking oil 
recycling services. This helps our 
customers save money, increase 
recycling levels and support more 
sustainable communities throughout 
the UK.
• We installed our first sales floor LED 
lighting trial.
• We donated surplus food equivalent 
to over 288,000 meals to local 
charities in the last year.

• We are committed to helping our 
retail and catering customers serve 
communities throughout the United 
Kingdom.
Structure
• Rather than having the business 
structured as Booker Wholesale, 
Makro, Booker Direct, Chef Direct 
and Ritter-Courivaud, we have 
restructured to reflect our customers. 
Steve Fox will be responsible for all our 
retailers whether they are Premiers, 
Family Shoppers, independents, 
chains or multiple accounts. Stuart 
Hyslop has become responsible for 
all our caterers and small business 
customers. Andrew Muldoon runs 
all the business centres, whether 
they are Booker or Makro. Andrew 
Thompson with the Directors of 
Trading will be responsible for Group 
Buying. This team reports through to 
Guy Farrant and myself. This allows 
us to best deploy the strengths of 
Booker Group to all our customers.
People 
• Again our team have done a great 
job this year. We are committed to 
continuing to make Booker better 
and safer for colleagues. We are 
also developing talent. For example, 
there is a shortage of butchers in the 
trade, so we have partnered with the 
University of West London to develop 
a formal ‘butchery apprenticeship’. 
28 new butchers graduated this year. 
We developed a similar scheme for 
greengrocers with 50 colleagues 
graduating this year. We intend to run 
both schemes again in 2015/16.
• Investment in our people has 
continued to make progress
– All of our drivers and managers 
have had an annual refresher 
course of Safe, Secure and Legal 
training and our vocational drivers 
have now completed five years 
for the Certificate of Professional 
Competence (CPC), which is run 
by our team of in house trainers 
and delivery support managers.
– Further training has been 
developed this year. From 
2015 we are running a driver 
apprenticeship scheme, open to 
internal and external drivers who 
wish to develop their career with 
Booker. We are also launching 
two new annual training days 
for managers, to support them 
by improving their day to day 
operation to increase customer 
satisfaction and continue helping 
us to drive cash profit.
• For the tenth year running, the 
performance of the business means 
our people have shared in our 
success through our bonus system. 
With this great team of people, Booker 
will continue to make progress in the 
year ahead. 
• During the year Richard Rose, our 
Chairman, and Mark Aylwin, who 
ran Booker Direct / Chef Direct and 
Ritter-Courivaud, announced they 
would step down in April. They joined 
the Group in 2007 when Booker 
merged with Blueheath. Both have 
made a real contribution to the Group 
and we wish both of them the very 
best for the future.
Our plan to Focus, Drive and Broaden 
the business remains on track. Customer 
satisfaction continued to improve. We 
grew the Group to £4.8bn of sales. We 
strive to provide our customers with 
improved choice, prices and service via 
the internet, delivery and cash and carry. 
We have a great team and together we 
will help our customers prosper in the 
year ahead.

GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REPORT
Overall Group revenue increased by 
1.5% to £4.8bn. Booker non-tobacco 
like-for-like sales (excluding Makro) 
increased by 2.9% while like-for-like 
tobacco sales rose by 1.1%. 
Operating margin increased by 0.38 
percentage points to 2.95% (2014: 
2.57%) increasing group operating profit 
by £19.9m to £140.3m. 
In the prior year, a net £3.4m exceptional 
credit was taken to the income 
statement. The credit related to the 
£11.2m difference between the fair value 
of Makro’s assets and liabilities at the 
date of consolidation and the fair value 
of consideration paid, offset by £7.8m of 
exceptional costs. No exceptional costs 
were charged or credited in the current 
financial year.
The net finance charge of £1.5m (2014: 
£1.7m) relates mainly to the unwind of 
the discounting of provisions.
Profit before tax rose £16.7m to £138.8m 
(2014: £122.1m), an increase of 14%.
The underlying effective tax rate (the tax 
charge as a percentage of profit before 
taxation and exceptional items) for the 
Group of 15.2% (2014: 14.8%) was 
below the standard rate of corporation 
tax in the UK of 21% (2014: 23%). This 
was due principally to the utilisation of 
ACT and tax losses from prior years. 
The Group holds significant tax assets, 
notably Makro tax losses and ACT, 
which continue to be unrecognised 
as the quantum and timing of their 
utilisation remains uncertain. If the 
Group is able to utilise these assets, this 
could result in the underlying effective 
rate of tax remaining below 20% for the 
next three years.
Profit after tax was £117.7m, an increase 
of £12.5m compared to 2014.
Basic earnings per share rose to 6.73p, 
up 11% from 6.06p in 2014.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 3.14 pence per share (2014: 
2.75 pence per share), up 14%, payable 
(subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting, to be held 
on 8 July 2015) on 10 July 2015 to 
shareholders on the register at 12 June 
2015. The shares will go ex-dividend on 
11 June 2015.
The final dividend increases the total 
dividend for the year to 3.66 pence 
per share, an increase of 14% on 2014 
(2014: 3.20 pence per share). 
Return of Capital
In July 2012 Booker Group plc issued 
£124m of shareholder equity to 
acquire Makro in the UK. Following the 
successful integration of Makro into 
the Group and a period of strong cash 
generation, the Board implemented a 
capital return to shareholders of 3.50 
pence per ordinary share (at a cost of 
approximately £61m) in July 2014. Given 
the continued successful development 
of the Group, the Board is proposing a 
second capital return to shareholders 
of 3.50 pence per ordinary share (at a 
cost of approximately £62m, based on 
the current issued share capital of the 
Company). It is again proposed that 
this is achieved by the issue of a new 
class of ‘B’ shares which shareholders 
will be able to redeem for cash. The 
return of capital requires the approval of 
shareholders, which will be sought at the 
Annual General Meeting on 8 July 2015. 
Further details of the proposed return 
of capital will be set out in a circular to 
shareholders which will accompany 
the notice convening this year’s Annual 
General Meeting. 
We currently anticipate returning a 
similar amount to shareholders in July 
2016 and will provide an update on this 
at the 2016 Final Results announcement 
in May 2016 in light of circumstances 
prevailing at that time.

Cash Flow
Management has continued to focus on 
cash resulting in a net inflow of £115.2m, 
before dividend payments in the year 
of £56.9m and the capital repayment 
of £60.9m. Net cash at 27 March 2015 
was £147.0m (2014: £149.6m). Earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (‘EBITDA’) of £161.5m in 
the year, funded capital additions of 
£24.6m (2014: £18.0m), working capital 
absorption of £13.3m (2014: generation 
of £3.1m) and corporation tax payments 
of £15.1m (2014: £12.3m). 
Pensions
The Booker Pension Scheme (‘the 
Scheme’) is a defined benefit scheme 
that was closed to new members in 
October 2001, and was closed to future 
accruals for existing members in August 
2002. At 27 March 2015, the Scheme 
had an IAS 19 deficit of £19.7m (2014: 
£3.6m), comprising Scheme assets 
of £649.5m and estimated liabilities of 
£669.2m. The Group contributed £2.4m 
(2014: £9.6m) in the year.
Following the 2013 Triennial valuation, 
there will be no cash contributions 
required from the Company after the 
scheduled quarterly payment of £2.4m 
paid on 31 March 2014, subject to 
the results of subsequent Triennial 
valuations. The next Triennial valuation 
date is 31 March 2016.
Impairment
The net book value of tangible and 
intangible fixed assets on the balance 
sheet is £646.9m (2014: £643.2m). The 
goodwill carrying value is more than 
supported by expected future cash 
flows discounted back to present day 
values at a pre-tax discount rate of 9.7% 
(2014: 10.5%). 
Capital Structure
The Group finances its operations 
through a combination of bank facilities, 
leases and retained profits and its capital 
base is structured to meet the ongoing 
requirements of the business. As at 27 
March 2015, the Group had net cash of 
£147.0m (2014: £149.6m).
Borrowing Facilities
The Group entered into a five year facility 
on 28 July 2011 comprising an unsecured 
£120.0m revolving credit facility. 
The Group’s borrowings are subject to 
covenants set by the lenders. In the event 
of a failure to meet certain obligations, 
or if there is a covenant breach, the 
principal amounts due and any interest 
accrued are repayable on demand.
The financial covenants are Fixed 
Charge Cover, measured by the ratio 
of EBITDAR (earnings before interest, 
tax, exceptional items, depreciation, 
amortisation and rent) to interest plus 
rent (tested half yearly on a rolling basis) 
being greater than 1.5, and Leverage, 
measured by the ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) (tested 
half yearly on a rolling basis) being less 
than 3.0.
The Group complied with its covenants 
throughout the year. At 27 March 2015 
the Group achieved a Fixed Charge Cover 
of 4.3 and Leverage of nil, comfortably 
exceeding its covenant obligations. 
In addition to these financial covenants 
the Group’s borrowing agreements 
include general covenants and potential 
events of default. The Group has 
complied in all respects with the terms 
of its borrowing agreements at the date 
of this report. 
Interest Rates 
Funds drawn on the revolving credit 
facility bear floating interest rates linked 
to LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25%, where 
the ratio of net debt/ EBITDA is less than 
one. A commitment fee is payable at 
0.5% of the unutilised facility. 
The net cost of the facility during the year 
was £0.2m (2014: £0.2m).
Liquidity
At 27 March 2015, the Group held £147 .0m 
in cash and cash equivalents. The Group 
also had in issue £6.3m of guarantees 
(2014: £4.9m) leaving undrawn facilities at 
27 March 2015 of £113.7m.
The Company did not draw down on its 
revolving credit facility on a cleared basis 
in the year to 27 March 2015 giving a 
minimum facility headroom in the year 
of £113.0m after taking into account the 
guarantees facility of £7.0m.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 
The Group recognises that it has social and environmental responsibilities arising from its operations and is committed to 
responsible business practices. These improve the welfare of colleagues and the communities in which we operate, and reduce 
our impact on the environment.
Colleagues
It is the Group’s policy to involve colleagues in the business and to ensure that matters of concern to them, including the Group’s aims 
and objectives and its financial performance, are communicated regularly in an open manner and, where appropriate, colleagues’ 
views are taken into account. This is achieved through the use of business briefings and other less formal communication. 
The Directors encourage colleagues to become shareholders in order to promote active participation in, and commitment to, the 
Group’s success. This policy has been extended to all colleagues through the provision of a SAYE share scheme. 
As at 27 March 2015, the following number of colleagues were contributing monthly to the following schemes:
• 3,069 colleagues – 2014 SAYE scheme;
• 2,888 colleagues – 2013 SAYE scheme;
• 1,576 colleagues – 2012 SAYE scheme.
Booker is an inclusive organisation where no-one receives less favourable treatment on the grounds of gender, nationality, marital 
status, colour, race, ethnic origin, creed, sexual orientation or disability. The promotion of equal opportunities for all employees is 
regarded as an important Group priority. 
An analysis of Directors, senior managers and other employees by gender as at 27 March 2015 is as follows:
Male
 Number
Female 
Number
Directors 9 2
Senior managers 52 5
Other employees 8,469 3,779
The Group has a balanced workforce in terms of experience, with an average age of 39.8 (2014: 40.0).
Community
The Group believes that good community relations are important to the long term development and sustainability of the operating 
businesses. The Group aims to build sustainable relationships with its customers, who are mainly independent businesses at the 
heart of their communities, by improving the choice, price and service of products and services supplied. 
Each business centre, distribution centre and support centre has a nominated local charity. For the year ended 27 March 2015, 
colleagues raised £77,200 for these charities.
The Group also donates surplus food to local homeless charities from Booker business centres and distribution centres. In the 
year, the equivalent of 288,000 meals were donated to charities across the UK, with an additional 41 tonnes of food reprocessed 
for animal feed.
Environment 
Resource Efficiency
Booker recognises its obligation to consider carefully its use of natural resources. We are taking steps to reduce our impact on 
the environment, both in our store operations and in our supply chain. 
Using energy efficiently, minimising our emissions to air and monitoring our energy consumption are key components of our 
environmental work. Examples of energy efficient practices are:
• The installation of voltage optimisation units. At 27 March 2015, units had been installed in 123 Booker business centres;
• The daily use of data from the installation of smart meters installed in 2010 in all 172 Booker business centres and in early 
2014 for the 29 Makro stores to monitor and control consumption of both electricity and gas. Data on energy consumption is 
captured on a half hourly basis allowing us to profile high or unusual patterns;
• New and refitted business centres with energy efficient features included in their designs:
–  Maximum transparent roof area, light-sensitivity and occupancy controls and energy-efficient lighting (including T5 and LED);
– High efficiency heaters, timing controls and re-circulation fans; 
– High thermal efficiency cold rooms; and
– New cladding and roofing to improve insulation; 11

• The efficient movement of stock through collaboration with suppliers to find ways to reduce food miles in the total supply chain 
by minimising empty journeys;
• In our HGV fleet, the replacement of old trailers with new more energy efficient refrigeration trailers; 
• Improved fuel efficiency of our new HGV tractor fleet, which have been fitted with side wind deflectors and automatic engine 
switch off during vehicle idling; 
• Solar photo voltaic (PV) panels, which convert sunlight to electricity, were installed as a trial on the roof of our Wimbledon 
branch in March 2014; and 
• The trial installation of full sales floor LED lighting at Booker Leeds.
During the year, our absolute use of energy was 250 GWh compared with 270 GWh in the prior year, a 7% reduction.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
For the second year, we report on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for which we are responsible in accordance with The 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended). The statement below 
summarises the Group’s GHG emissions from fuel consumption and the operation of the Group’s facilities for the year ended

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT CONTINUED
The Carbon Trust Standard is a voluntary certification and mark of excellence that enables organisations to demonstrate their 
success in cutting their carbon footprint. The Standard is awarded for a two year period, with Booker obtaining a third consecutive 
Carbon Trust Standard in 2013. This biennial award demonstrates Booker’s long term commitment to successfully measuring, 
managing and reducing its absolute carbon footprint consistently over a six year period. 
Work in the area of sustainability has led to Booker being awarded, in 2014, the ‘Green Wholesaler of the Year’ at the Grocer 
Gold Awards, sponsored by the industry journal ‘The Grocer’ for the third consecutive year. In addition, in 2014, Chef Direct 
was awarded the ‘Footprint’ award by Footprint a foodservice sustainability trade publication owned by Footprint Media, for 
environmentally efficient logistics following work undertaken with a large customer to reduce their delivery emissions and cut 
food miles.
Preventing Waste
Packaging Improvements
As a wholesaler of packaged goods, our primary objective is to ensure that our products are safe to eat and reach consumers 
in optimal condition. Packaging plays a critical role in achieving this and we review at every opportunity how we can use fewer 
materials. This includes improving packaging to protect stock from damage, thereby reducing food waste, and reducing the 
weight of the packaging.
Company Waste Prevention and Recycling
We continue to work to prevent waste, redistribute fit for purpose food, increase recycling and divert waste away from landfill. We 
use the Government’s ‘waste hierarchy’ which sets out five steps for dealing with waste ranked by their environmental impact, to 
ensure all waste is dealt with in the most environmentally positive way. Each store and distribution centre participates in recycling 
paper, plastic, cardboard, metal and wood from pallets. We have invested across the estate in balers, instigated waste league 
tables and continually focus on improvements. During the year we increased the volume of waste recycled and sent to recovery 
processes by 11% and reduced waste to landfill by 29% resulting in a recycling level of approximately 85%. 
We have worked with both suppliers and customers to prevent waste across the supply chain. A total of 362 tonnes of product 
waste has been prevented in the year through initiatives such as early warning on short dated stock, improved forecasting and 
fresh promotion management, use of clearance routes by our suppliers and more surplus to animal feed.
We are an active contributor to the Institute of Grocery Distributors Product & Packaging Waste Prevention Group, whose aim is 
to prevent waste throughout the food industry. This has focused on delivering savings against a voluntary industry commitment 
to eliminate 200,000 tonnes of waste by the end of 2014. This target has been exceeded by 30%. 
Business to Business Engagement
In addition to our own achievements, we believe that working on sustainability initiatives with independent businesses in local 
communities can deliver further improvements in sustainability.
Customer Packaging Recycling
In April 2012 our packaging recycling service was launched, and now over 1 1,000 customers are regularly using the service. Volumes 
of cardboard recycled in the year ended 27 March 2015 are up approximately 26% on the prior year at over 14,000 tonnes.
Customer Used Cooking Oil Recycling
Customers deposit used cooking oil at their local business centre or a collection can be arranged from their premises. The Group 
operates a simple rebate scheme per litre recycled. Approximately 9,000 customers are using the service and over 3.8 million 
litres of waste oil have been recycled into sustainable bio fuels in the year ended March 2015. 13
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Strategic Report
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
The Carbon Trust Waste Standard was introduced in 2013 by the Carbon Trust and is awarded to organisations able to demonstrate 
that they are measuring, managing and reducing waste year on year. Following the successful completion of a pilot stage, we 
were one of the first seven companies in the UK (and the first wholesaler) to receive this certification. The Standard was awarded 
for achievements made in improving waste management over the three year period ended March 2013 and lasts for a two year 
period. Initiatives included: customer recycling services, donation of surplus food to local charities, prevention of waste measures, 
diversion of waste food to animal feed and management of waste to landfill. 
Booker was also named ‘National Recycler of the Year’ at the MRW National Recycling Awards in 2014 for our work in the area 
of waste prevention and recycling.
Ethical Sourcing
A number of the ingredients in our own label products are grown in developing countries. We seek to understand, manage and 
mitigate any issues associated with a particular commodity or country.
We use the Fairtrade and Red Tractor Farm Assurance schemes and all prospective own brand suppliers are required to complete 
a sustainability and ethics questionnaire. Examples of our approach are:
Red Tractor Farm Assurance: Red Tractor is a UK food assurance scheme which covers production standards on safety, 
hygiene, animal welfare and the environment. The Red Tractor logo on packs means food or drink has met these responsible 
production standards and is fully traceable back to independently inspected farms in the UK. Red Tractor certifies that food has 
been produced to independently inspected standards right across the food chain – from farm to pack. At 27 March 2015, the 
Group had 89 own label products displaying the Red Tractor logo across its retail and catering ranges and continues to work to 
widen the products covered by this standard.
Fairtrade: The objective of Fairtrade is to achieve better selling prices, decent working conditions, local sustainability and fair 
terms of trade for farmers and workers in the developing world. Fairtrade is an independent mark found on products where 
ingredients in the product have been produced by small-scale farmers that meet Fairtrade’s social, economic and environmental 
standards. The standards include the protection of workers’ rights and the environment, payment of a Fairtrade minimum price 
and an additional premium to invest in the farmers’ and workers’ community. The Group continues to expand its range of catering 
products that are certified as being Fairtrade, with all Chef’s Larder tea and coffee products now being Fairtrade accredited. The 
Lichfield Fairtrade range now has 24 products across tea, coffee, sugar and biscuits. During the year the Group contributed the 
equivalent of £65,000 through Fairtrade premiums to help coffee growers. 
Sustainable Palm Oil: Palm oil production has been well documented as a cause of substantial damage to the natural environment. 
Its impact includes deforestation, habitat loss of critically endangered species and a significant increase in greenhouse gas 
emissions. Although palm oil is only an extremely small input into the production by suppliers of our own label products, all 
Chef’s Larder, Happy Shopper and Euroshopper ranges of biscuits and snack products contribute to the production of certified 
sustainable palm oil. 14

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Board reviews annually the material financial and non financial risks facing the business and, on a rolling cycle basis, reviews 
the effectiveness of the risk management process and the resources that our business devotes to them.
The principal risks and corresponding mitigation set out below represent the principal uncertainties that the Board believes may 
impact the Group’s ability to deliver effectively its strategy in the future. The list does not include all risks that the Group faces and 
it does not list the risks in any order of priority.
Risk Impact Mitigating factors
Increasing price 
competition in the  
UK grocery and 
discount sectors
A decline in selling prices could have an 
adverse impact on the Group’s sales, 
operating profits and cashflow.
We will continue to improve the choice, price and service to  
our customers.
Failure to respond  
to competition
This could have an adverse impact  
on the Group’s sales, operating profits  
and cashflow.
The industry is extremely competitive with the market being 
served by numerous competitors, ranging from national 
multiple retailers to regional independent wholesalers. We 
compete by closely monitoring the activities of our competitors 
and ensuring we continue to improve the choice, price and  
service to our customers.
Changes in 
regulation
Changing legislation may impact our 
ability to market or sell certain products  
or could cause the Group to incur 
additional costs or liabilities that  
could adversely affect its business.
The Group operates in an environment governed by strict 
regulations to ensure the safety and protection of customers, 
shareholders, employees and other stakeholders and the 
operation of an open and competitive market. These regulations 
include food hygiene, health and safety, data protection, the 
rules of the London Stock Exchange and competition law. 
In all cases, the Board takes its responsibilities seriously, 
and recognises that any breach of regulation could cause 
reputational and financial damage to the Group.
Product quality  
and safety
This could have an adverse impact on  
the Group’s reputation, sales, operating 
profits and cashflow.
The quality and safety of our products is of critical importance 
and any failure in this regard would affect the confidence of 
our customers in us. We work with our suppliers to ensure the 
integrity of the products supplied. Food hygiene practices are 
taken seriously throughout the Group, and are monitored both 
through internal audit procedures and by external bodies, such 
as environmental health departments, within local authorities. 
We have well prepared procedures for crisis management in 
order to act quickly when required. We are aware that if we 
fail, or are perceived to have failed, to deliver to our customers’ 
satisfaction the expected standards of quality and safety in our 
products, their loyalty to us may be potentially impacted. This 
in turn could adversely impact on our market share and our 
financial results.
Employee 
engagement  
and retention
The continued success of the Group  
relies on the investment in the training  
and development of our employees. 
The Group’s employment policies, remuneration and benefits 
packages are designed to be competitive, as well as providing 
colleagues with fulfilling career opportunities. The Group 
continually engages with employees across the business to 
ensure that we keep strengthening our team at every level.
Supplier credit Availability of supplier credit is essential for 
the Group’s financial performance. If the 
providers of credit insurance withdraw or 
materially reduce the levels of cover they 
provide to the Group’s trade creditors in 
respect of the Group, this might affect the 
Group’s ability to obtain products from 
those suppliers on existing credit terms 
and could worsen the Group’s cashflow. 
The Group Finance Director regularly meets the key credit 
insurers to ensure that they have an up to date understanding  
of the Group’s financial position. 15
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Strategic Report
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Risk Impact Mitigating factors
Pension funding A worsening funding position may require 
the Group to pay cash contributions  
or provide further assurance to cover 
future liabilities. This could worsen the 
Group’s cashflow.
The Group seeks to agree appropriate investment policies with 
the Trustee and closely monitors the funding position of the 
Pension Scheme with the Trustee. Both the Company and the 
Trustee take advice from independent qualified actuaries.
Failure of the 
Group’s information 
technology systems
The maintenance and development of 
information technology systems may result 
in system failures, including cyber security 
breaches which may adversely impact the 
Group’s ability to operate, which could 
affect the Group’s sales, operating profits 
and cashflow. 
The Group has appropriate controls in place to mitigate the 
risk of systems failure, including systems back up procedures 
and disaster recovery plans, and also has appropriate virus 
protection and network security controls.
Health and  
Safety risks
A health and safety related incident could 
result in serious injury to the Group’s 
employees, contractors, customers and 
visitors, which could adversely affect 
our operations and result in reputational 
damage, criminal prosecution and civil 
litigation. This could affect the Group’s 
reputation, with a potentially adverse affect 
on sales, operating profits and cashflow.
The Group has developed an effective health and safety 
management system to ensure compliance with all legal duties 
placed on the organisation by law. All systems are subject to 
regular review with training provided as appropriate.
The Group employs a Health and Safety manager to maintain 
the management system, along with the identification and 
remediation of specific risks, and ensuring employees are aware 
of regulatory requirements.
Environmental 
management
A long term increase in energy prices 
could have an adverse effect on the 
Group's sales, operating profits and 
cashflow with an increasing cost to 
operations to adapt to climate change  
and mitigate impact.
The Group has a continual focus on reducing our environmental 
impact and implementing changes to our operations to 
maximise opportunities such as recycling more waste and using 
more renewable sources of fuel.
Greenhouse gas emissions are measured and reported annually.
Substantial investment is made to improve environmental risk 
management, with a focus on energy efficiency when investing  
in new capital projects.

The Company is proposing to implement a capital return to shareholders of 3.50 pence per ordinary share (at a cost of 
approximately £62m based on the amount of issued share capital of the Company). It is proposed that this is achieved by the 
issue of a new class of B Shares which shareholders will be able to redeem for cash.
Interests of Directors in Contracts
During the period no Director had any material interest in any significant contract to which the Company or any subsidiary was a party.
Changes of Control
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating to a change of control. Outstanding options and awards normally 
vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time. The 
Company is not a party to any other significant agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control following 
a takeover bid other than its bank facility agreement, which provides that on a change of control the lender shall not be obliged 
to fund a utilisation (except for a rollover loan) and, if it so requires, may cancel its commitment and declare its participation in all 
outstanding utilisations immediately due and payable. Further the Company is not party to any agreement with the Directors or 
employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy or 
otherwise) that occurs as a result of a takeover bid other than with Charles Wilson, in that in the event of a change of control of 
the Company, Charles Wilson has the right to terminate his employment on 30 days’ notice and to receive a payment equal to his 
gross salary for his contractual notice period.

Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance
The Company maintains appropriate directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect of itself and its Directors and Officers. 
The Directors may also be indemnified in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and to the maximum extent 
permitted by law, although no such indemnities are currently in place. The insurance does not, and any indemnities if granted 
would not, provide cover where the relevant Director or Officer has acted fraudulently or dishonestly. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Governance

value of 1 pence per share. The rights and obligations attaching to these shares are contained in the Company’s Articles of Association.  
Each Ordinary Share carries the right to one vote on a poll, and to attend and speak at a general meeting of the Company, to appoint 
proxies to exercise full voting rights and to participate in any distribution of income or capital. There are no restrictions on transfer or 
limitations on the holding of the Ordinary Shares, nor are there any requirements for prior approval for their transfer.
At the Annual General Meeting held in 2014, the Company was granted authority by shareholders to purchase up to 174.3 million 
Ordinary Shares, representing less than 10% of the Company’s ordinary share capital as at 28 May 2014. No Ordinary Shares

Group’s and Company’s financial statements. Further information in relation to the Directors’ assessment of going concern is 
contained in note 1f to the financial statements.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
Throughout the year ended 27 March 2015 and to the date of this document, the Company complied with the provisions and 
applied the Main Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 (the ‘Code’).
This Corporate Governance Report, together with the Audit Committee Report, the Nomination Committee Report and the 
Remuneration Report, describes how the Company has complied with the provisions of the Code.
The Role of the Board and its Committees 
The Company is led and controlled by the Board of Directors (the ‘Board’) chaired by Richard Rose. The Board currently consists 
of four Executive Directors and six Non-Executive Directors. 
Richard Rose was an Executive Director and Chairman of Blueheath immediately prior to the reverse acquisition of Blueheath by 
the Booker Group in 2007 and became Non-Executive Chairman of the Company upon completion of the merger. The Group’s 
combined business is significantly different to and larger than Blueheath and there is a division of responsibilities between Richard 
and the Executive Directors and, in particular, Charles Wilson as Chief Executive, such that his current and former roles can be 
considered incomparable. Having regard to all the circumstances, including the independence Richard has demonstrated as 
Chairman, the Board is satisfied and has determined that Richard is independent.
Consequently, all the Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Board to be independent of management and free from any 
business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement in accordance with 
the Code. The independence of Non-Executive Directors is considered at least annually and is based on the criteria suggested 
in the Code. The Non-Executive Directors provide constructive challenge and bring independence to the Board and its decision 
making process.
The Board believes that it is appropriate to have a Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and Lord Bilimoria fulfils this role. 
He is available to shareholders where concerns have not been resolved through the normal channels and for when such contact 
would be inappropriate. 
The Board believes that it has sufficient members to contain a balance of skills and experience, but it is not so large as to be 
unwieldy. The Board contains a balance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors such that no individual, or group of individuals 
can dominate the Board’s decision making. No one individual has unfettered powers of decision. 
Details of the skills and experience of the Directors are contained in the Directors’ biographies on pages 18 and 19.
The Board meets regularly on at least twelve scheduled occasions during each year and more frequently if necessary. There 
were twelve Board meetings, eight Audit Committee meetings, two Nomination Committee meetings and five Remuneration 
Committee meetings held in the year under review and the attendance by Directors was as follows:

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

The Board is responsible to shareholders for ensuring that the Group is appropriately managed and that it achieves its objectives. 
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision by it, thus ensuring that it exercises control 
over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and regulatory issues. At its meetings, the Board reviews trading performance, 
ensures adequate financing, sets and monitors strategy, examines investment and acquisition opportunities and discusses 
reports to shareholders. Matters not specifically reserved for the Board and its committees under its schedule of matters and the 
committees’ terms of reference, or for shareholders in general meeting, are delegated to members of the Executive Committee.
It is the Company’s policy that the roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate, with their roles and responsibilities 
clearly divided and set out in writing. The Chairman’s main responsibility is the leadership and management of the Board and its 
governance. The Chairman’s commitment to the Company is usually two days per month. His other significant commitments are 
disclosed in his biography on page 18. The Board considers that these commitments do not hinder his ability to discharge his 
responsibilities to the Company effectively.
The Chief Executive is responsible for the leadership and day-to-day management of the Group. This includes formulating and 
recommending the Group’s strategy for Board approval in addition to executing the approved strategy.
Recommendations for appointments to the Board are made by the Nomination Committee. The Committee follows Board 
approved procedures (available on our website) which provide a framework for the different types of Board appointments on 
which the Committee may be expected to make recommendations. Appointments are made on merit and against objective 
criteria with due regard to diversity (including skills, experience and gender). Non-Executive appointees are also required to 
demonstrate that they have sufficient time to devote to the role.
Information and Professional Development 
Directors are continually updated on the Group’s businesses, the markets in which they operate and changes to the competitive 
and regulatory environment through briefings to the Board and meetings with senior executives. Board visits to Group business 
locations enable the Directors to meet with local management and employees and to update and maintain their knowledge and 
familiarity with the Group’s operations.
Non-Executive Directors are also encouraged to visit Group operations throughout their tenure to increase their exposure to 
the business.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information. The provision of information 
to the Board was reviewed during the year as part of the performance evaluation exercise referred to below. To ensure that 
adequate time is available for Board discussion and to enable informed decision making, briefing papers are prepared and 
circulated to Directors in the week prior to scheduled Board meetings. All Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to make 
further enquiries as they feel appropriate of the Executive Directors and executives. In addition, Board committees are provided 
with sufficient resources and the power to co-opt such additional support as they may require from time to time, to undertake 
their duties. 
All Directors are entitled to receive independent professional advice at the Company’s expense and have access to the services 
of a professionally qualified and experienced Company Secretary, who is responsible for information flows to the Board and 
advising the Board on corporate governance matters. This ensures compliance with Board procedures and applicable laws and 
regulation. The Board has responsibility for the appointment and removal of the Company Secretary.
On appointment, individual Directors undergo an induction programme covering, amongst other matters:
• the business of the Group;
• their legal and regulatory responsibilities as directors of the Company;
• briefings and presentations from Executive Directors and senior executives;
• opportunities to visit business operations. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Governance

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
Performance Evaluation
An external evaluation process was conducted by the Institute of Directors in April 2013. The next externally facilitated board 
evaluation will be conducted in April 2016. 
During the year, the Board conducted an evaluation of its own performance and that of its three principal committees. The 
individual performance of the Non-Executive Directors was also evaluated through one to one interviews with the Chairman. In 
April 2015, each Director completed a questionnaire prepared by the Chairman and the Company Secretary to rate the collective 
performance of the Board and its committees. The Company Secretary collated the evaluation results and the Chairman then 
reviewed an unattributed executive summary, highlighting key outcomes. A report of the findings was then presented to and 
discussed by the Board. No actions were considered necessary as a result of these evaluations and the Chairman confirms that 
each Director continues to make a valuable contribution to the Board and, where relevant, its Committees and devotes sufficient 
time to the role. 
During the year, the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors met in the absence of the Executive Directors. There was also 
one meeting of the Non-Executive Directors chaired by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director at which the Chairman 
was not present in order to appraise the Chairman’s performance. The Senior Independent Director provided feedback to the 
Chairman of this review.
Board Committees
The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Nomination Committee and a Remuneration Committee to oversee and debate 
issues of policy outside main Board meetings. Throughout the year, the Chairman of each committee provided the Board with 
a summary of key issues considered at the committee meetings. Board committees are authorised to engage the services of 
external advisers as they deem necessary in the furtherance of their duties at the Company’s expense. 
The Audit Committee Report is on pages 25 to 29, the Nomination Committee Report is on pages 30 to 33 and the Remuneration 
Report is on pages 34 to 54.
Re-election of Directors 
All Directors are required by the Company’s Articles of Association to submit themselves to shareholders for re-election at the first 
Annual General Meeting after their appointment and thereafter by rotation at least once every three years. In accordance with the 
Code all directors will, however, stand for re-election annually. 
Relations with Shareholders 
In fulfilling their responsibilities, the Directors believe that they govern the Group in the best interests of shareholders, whilst having 
due regard to the interests of other stakeholders in the Group including customers, employees and suppliers. 
The Code encourages a dialogue with institutional shareholders based on the mutual understanding of objectives. The Executive 
Directors have regular and ongoing communication with major shareholders throughout the year, by participating in investor 
roadshows and presentations to shareholders. Feedback from these visits is reported to the Board. The Executive Directors 
also have regular contact with analysts and brokers. The Chairman, Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and other Non-
Executive Directors receive reports on matters raised at the meetings with shareholders and are offered the opportunity to attend 
meetings with major shareholders. As a result of these procedures, the Non-Executive Directors believe that they are aware of 
shareholders’ views. During the year, the Chairman met with one shareholder. In addition, Lord Bilimoria, the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director, is available to meet with major shareholders.
Arrangements can also be made through the Company Secretary for major shareholders to meet with newly appointed Directors.
The Group maintains a website at www.bookergroup.com which is regularly updated and contains information about the Group. 
The Code encourages boards to use the Annual General Meeting to communicate with investors and to encourage their 
participation. In compliance with the Code, the Board welcomes as many shareholders as possible to attend the Annual General 
Meeting to discuss any interest or concern, including performance, governance or strategy, with the Directors. 
All Directors are expected to attend the Annual General Meeting. The Chairs of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees are available at the Annual General Meeting to answer shareholder questions, through the Chairman of the Board, on 
the responsibilities and activities of their Committees. Shareholders also have the opportunity to meet with the Directors following 
the conclusion of the formal part of the meeting.
In compliance with the Code, at the Annual General Meeting, the Chairman will announce the level of proxies lodged on each 
resolution, the balance for and against and abstentions, and such details will be placed on the Group’s website following the 
meeting. A separate resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting in respect of each substantially separate issue.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Governance

23
Directors’ Conflicts of Interest
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and section 175 of the Companies Act 2006, formal procedures for the 
notification and authorisation of potential and actual conflicts of interest have been approved by the Board. 
These procedures, which enable the Directors to impose limits or conditions when giving or reviewing authorisation, ensure 
that only Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered can authorise conflicts, and require the Board to review 
the register of Directors’ conflicts annually and on an ad-hoc basis when necessary. Any potential conflicts of interest in relation 
to newly appointed Directors are considered by the Board prior to appointment. These procedures have operated effectively 
throughout the current financial period.
Internal controls and risk management 
The Board attaches considerable importance to, and acknowledges its responsibility for, the Group’s systems of internal control 
and risk management and receives regular reports on such matters. The Board’s policy is to have systems in place which 
optimise the Group’s ability to manage risk in an effective and appropriate manner. The Board has delegated to the Executive 
Committee detailed responsibility for identifying, evaluating and monitoring the risks facing the Group and for deciding how these 
are to be managed. In addition to formal reviews of risk management by the Executive Committee, members are expected to 
report to the Executive Committee as necessary the occurrence of any material control issues, serious accidents or events that 
have had a major commercial impact, or any significant new risks which have been identified. Such matters are reported to the 
next Board meeting and/or Audit Committee meeting as appropriate. 
The Group also has in place systems and procedures for exercising control and managing risk in respect of financial reporting 
and the preparation of consolidated accounts which are monitored by the Audit Committee on the Board’s behalf and reviewed 
annually by the Board. These include:
• the formulation and deployment of Group accounting policies and procedures;
• Group policies governing the maintenance of accounting records, transaction reporting and key financial control procedures;
• monthly operational review meetings which include, as necessary, reviews of internal financial reporting issues and financial 
control monitoring; and
• ongoing training and development of financial reporting personnel. 
The Group’s systems and procedures are designed to identify, manage and, where practicable, reduce and mitigate the effects 
of the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. They are not designed to eliminate such risk, recognising that any system can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board formally reviews the operation and effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls on an annual basis. The 
latest review covered the financial year to 27 March 2015. No significant failings or weaknesses were identified from this review. 
The Board has a process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the Group. This process is continual and has 
been in place for the year under review up to the date of this report, and is regularly reviewed by the Board in accordance with 
relevant guidance. There is an established framework of internal controls, which is set out in procedures approved by the Board 
and which include financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management. These procedures are readily accessible 
to staff, who follow their guidance. The more important elements of this framework are as follows: 
Management structure 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Company and the Executive Committee has responsibility for specific aspects of the 
Group’s affairs. The Board and each of its committees operate under a schedule of matters or terms of reference and the Board 
determines how the Chief Executive and the Executive Committee may operate within a framework of delegated authorities and 
reserved powers which seek to ensure that certain transactions which are significant in terms of their size or type, are undertaken 
only after Board review. 
The Executive Committee is chaired by Charles Wilson (Chief Executive) and comprises Jonathan Prentis (Group Finance 
Director), Guy Farrant (Managing Director – Booker Wholesale), Bryn Satherley (Operations Director), Mark Chilton (Company 
Secretary and General Counsel) and other senior executives representing the operational functions within the Group. It meets 
twice a month to discuss operational matters, compliance, health and safety and trading performance. 
Corporate accounting and procedures 
Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the Group as part of the corporate communication procedure. Accounting, 
delegation of authority and authorisation levels, segregation of duties and other control procedures, together with the general 
ethos of the Group are included in these communications, and standardised accounting policies are in place reflecting this policy. 
These procedures are subject to review to ensure that improvements to enhance controls can be made.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Governance
24
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
Quality and integrity of personnel 
The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured through high recruitment standards and subsequent training. Quality 
personnel are seen as an essential part of the control environment and the ethical standards expected are communicated 
through senior members of staff. 
Budgetary process 
Each year the Board approves the annual budget, which includes an assessment of key risk areas. Performance is monitored 
and relevant action taken throughout the year by regular reporting to the Board of updated forecasts together with information 
on key risk areas.
Risk management
The Board assesses risk management throughout the Group aided by detailed reviews of internal controls and risk management 
procedures. The Group’s risk register is reviewed by the Board as part of annual strategic planning and budgetary cycles.
Investment appraisal 
Capital expenditure is regulated by the use of authorisation levels. For all expenditure beyond specified levels, Board approval 
is required. 
Internal audit 
The Group’s internal audit function, which reports to the Group Finance Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee, monitors 
the effectiveness of key internal controls and the adequacy of these controls to manage business risk and to safeguard the Group’s 
assets and resources, in accordance with a work plan approved and monitored by the Audit Committee. Its conclusions are 
communicated to the relevant level of management and the function has a direct reporting responsibility to the Audit Committee.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 20 May 2015.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Chairman’s Introduction to the Audit Committee Report
I am pleased to report on the activities of the Committee for the year ended 27 March 2015. 
This report sets out the Committee's findings and recommendations, including those in relation to the areas highlighted in the 
Code, particularly in:
• Reviewing the effectiveness of internal financial controls, of internal audit and of financial risk management systems;
• Monitoring the integrity of the financial statements and reviewing judgements relating thereto;
• Safeguarding the objectivity and independence of the external audit and monitoring its effectiveness; and
• Recommending appointment of the external auditor and determining their remuneration.
We reported last year that we intended to tender the external audit engagement no later than for the year ending March 2017. 
Our preparations for the tender process are underway now that the UK Competition and Markets Authority’s final Order and the 
EU regulation relating to statutory audit services have been published. We will report on the process and outcome of the tender 
in next year’s annual report. In parallel with the audit tender process, the Committee intends to review our policy on non-audit 
services provided by the External Auditor to ensure that the External Auditor continues to be free from any perceived conflict of 
interest in accordance with the EU Regulation. 
We noted media concern surrounding the recognition of rebates and similar income received by other companies operating 
in the grocery sector from their suppliers during the year. Such types of income are of financial significance to the Group and 
are therefore tightly controlled. Nevertheless, the Committee commissioned a thorough review and remains satisfied with the 
treatment of, and controls over, such items as is explained in this report.
I will be available to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM to answer any questions relating to the role of the Committee.
On behalf of the Board.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Role and Responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee supports the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities in relation to financial reporting; monitoring the integrity of the 
financial statements and other announcements of financial results published by the Group; and reviewing and challenging the 
judgements and actions of management in relation to the financial statements. The Committee reviews the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal financial control and financial risk management systems and the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit 
function. On behalf of the Board, the Committee manages the appointment and remuneration of the external auditor and monitors 
their performance and independence. The Group supports an independent and confidential whistleblowing procedure and the 
Committee monitors the operation of this facility.
In accordance with the Code, the Board requested that the Committee advise whether it believes the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
The Committee’s Terms of Reference reflect this requirement and can be found in the Investor Relations/Investor Centre/Legal 
Documents section of the Group’s website. A copy may be obtained from the Company Secretary.
 
Membership
The Committee is chaired by Andrew Cripps and, during the year, also comprised Lord Bilimoria and Stewart Gilliland. All 
members of the Committee are and were considered by the Board to be independent. 
The Committee members have been selected to provide the wide range of financial and commercial expertise necessary to fulfil 
the Committee’s duties and responsibilities. Andrew Cripps, who is a Chartered Accountant, is considered by the Board to have 
recent and relevant financial experience, as required by the Code. He also has substantial and recent audit committee experience 
and ensures that the Committee remains abreast of accounting and regulatory developments. Lord Bilimoria is also a Chartered 
Accountant and Stewart Gilliland has substantial relevant commercial experience. Details of the skills and experience of the 
Directors are contained in the Directors’ biographies on pages 18 and 19.
The Committee has access to the Group’s finance team, to its internal audit function and to its External Auditor and can seek 
further professional training and advice, at the Group’s cost, as appropriate. 
The quorum necessary for the transaction of business is two, each of whom must be a Non-Executive Director. Only members of 
the Committee have the right to attend Committee meetings, however, during the year, Richard Rose, Chairman, Charles Wilson, 
Chief Executive, Jonathan Prentis, Group Finance Director, the Head of Internal Audit, members of our trading and finance teams 
and representatives from KPMG LLP , the External Auditor, were invited to attend meetings. The Committee also meets separately 
with the Head of Internal Audit and the External Auditor without management being present. 
The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Audit Committee.
Meeting Frequency and Main Activities in the Year
The Committee met on four scheduled occasions during the year ended 27 March 2015. In addition there were four meetings by 
conference call to review quarterly trading statements for recommendation to the Board. All members of the Committee attended 
every scheduled meeting and meetings by conference call except Stewart Gilliland, who was unable to attend a Committee 
meeting by conference call due to a prior business commitment. The members’ attendance record was as follows:
Committee member Number of meetings attended Percentage attendance
Andrew Cripps (Chairman) 8/8 100%
Lord Bilimoria 8/8 100%
Stewart Gilliland 7/8 88%
During the year ended 27 March 2015, the Committee reviewed and made recommendations to the Board on the Preliminary 
Results Announcement for the period to 28 March 2014, the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts, the Interim Results Announcement 
for the period to 12 September 2014 and Interim Management Statements in the twelve weeks to 28 March 2014, the twelve 
weeks to 20 June 2014, the twelve weeks to 12 September 2014 and the sixteen weeks to 2 January 2015.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Governance

Since 27 March 2015, the Committee has met three times to review and make recommendations to the Board on the Interim 
Management Statement for the twelve weeks to 27 March 2015, the Preliminary Results Announcement for the period to 
27 March 2015 and the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts.
In carrying out its reviews during the year, the Committee considered:
• whether the Group had applied appropriate accounting policies and practices both on a year on year basis and across the Group;
• the significant areas in which judgement had been applied in preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the 
accounting policies set out on pages 64 to 69;
• reports from the Group Finance Director and the External Auditor;
• the clarity and completeness of disclosures and compliance with relevant financial reporting standards and corporate 
governance and regulatory requirements; and 
• whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, was fair, balanced and understandable and provided the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.
The Committee also:
• approved the Internal and External Auditor’s work plans for the Group;
• considered regular reports from the Head of Internal Audit on their findings including additional work requested by the 
Committee concerning the recognition of income from suppliers;
• reviewed the Committee’s Terms of Reference;
• reviewed the External Auditor’s independence and objectivity, the effectiveness of the audit process, the re-appointment of 
the External Auditor and approved the External Auditor’s remuneration; and
• approved the appropriateness of the External Auditor providing non-audit services and related fees.
Significant Judgemental Areas
The significant areas of judgement considered by the Committee in relation to the accounts for the year ended 27 March 2015 
and how these were addressed are outlined below. Each of these areas received particular focus from the External Auditor, who 
provided detailed analysis and assessment of the matters in their report to the Committee.
Defined Benefit Pension Scheme Accounting
The Group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements, as outlined in note 19 to the financial statements. 
Although the defined benefit scheme is closed to future accrual, it is sensitive to changes in actuarial assumptions. We challenged 
the valuations prepared by the Group’s pension advisors and, following discussions with management, were satisfied that the 
judgements exercised were appropriate. During their audit, KPMG LLP evaluated the assumptions and methodologies used by the 
Group’s pension advisors and assessed whether the assumptions made were appropriate and not materially different from external 
benchmarks. KPMG LLP reported to us on the assumptions used and the way that our schemes had been accounted for. 
Property Provisions
The Group has recorded property provisions in the sum of £25.4m as outlined in note 20 to the financial statements, which, by 
their nature, are uncertain and highly judgemental. We scrutinised the key elements of judgement with management to assure 
ourselves as to the adequacy and appropriateness of the provisions. Following this review, we were satisfied that the judgements 
exercised were appropriate. As part of the year end audit, KPMG LLP considered the nature of the provisions, the potential 
outcomes, any developments relating to specific claims, and the prior history of lease obligations, provisions and claims in order 
to assess whether the provisions recorded were appropriate.
Following discussions with the External Auditor, and the deliberations set out above, we were satisfied that the financial statements 
dealt appropriately with each of the areas of significant judgement.
The External Auditor also reported to the Committee on any misstatements that they had found in the course of their work. The 
Committee noted their work and were satisfied that no material amounts required adjustment. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Governance

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Fair, Balanced and Understandable Assessment
One of the key compliance requirements of a group’s financial statements is for the Annual Report and Accounts to be fair, 
balanced and understandable. The coordination and review of Group wide contributions into the Annual Report and Accounts 
follows a well established and documented process, which is performed in parallel with the formal process undertaken by the 
External Auditor.
The Committee received a summary of the approach taken by management in the preparation of the 2015 Annual Report 
and Accounts to ensure that it met the requirements of the Code and our Terms of Reference. This, and our own scrutiny of 
the document, enabled the Committee, and then the Board, to confirm that the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts taken as a 
whole, was fair, balanced and understandable and provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Internal Controls and Financial Risk Management Systems
The Committee is responsible, on behalf of the Board, for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal financial controls 
and financial risk management systems. 
In carrying out these responsibilities, the Committee reviewed reports issued by both Internal Audit and the External Auditor and 
held regular discussions with the Group Finance Director, the Head of Internal Audit and representatives of the External Auditor. 
The Committee noted media concern surrounding the recognition of rebates and similar income received by other companies 
operating in the grocery sector from their suppliers. Such types of income are of financial significance to the Group and are therefore 
tightly controlled, as is evidenced from regular inspections by Internal Audit and their reports to the Committee. Nevertheless, 
the Committee promptly commissioned a more detailed review including a written report from management, presentations to 
the Committee from both the trading team and those responsible for recording the terms of trade, and an additional investigation 
by Internal Audit. The Committee reviewed and challenged the findings of these reports, presentations and investigations and is 
satisfied that the treatment of such types of income is both prudent and appropriate, and that controls are robust. The treatment 
of supplier rebates is explained in Note 2, Accounting policies, on page 68.
Internal Audit
The Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the Internal Audit function including 
its focus, work plan, activities and resources.
At the beginning of the financial year, the Committee reviewed and approved the Internal Audit plan for the year having considered 
the principal areas of risk in the business and the adequacy of staffing levels and expertise within the function. During the year, the 
Committee received regular reports from the Head of Internal Audit summarising findings from the work of Internal Audit and the 
responses from management to deal with the findings. The Committee monitors progress on the implementation of any action 
plans arising on significant findings to ensure these are completed satisfactorily and meets with the Head of Internal Audit in the 
absence of management. 
External Audit
It is the responsibility of the Committee to monitor the performance, objectivity and independence of the External Auditor. In 
February 2015, we met with KPMG LLP, the External Auditor, to agree the audit plan for the year, highlighting the key financial 
statement and audit risks, to ensure that the audit was appropriately focused. In addition, KPMG LLP’s letter of engagement was 
reviewed by the Committee in advance of the audit.
In May 2015, in advance of the finalisation of the Group’s financial statements, we received a report from KPMG LLP on their 
key audit findings, which included the key areas of risk and significant judgements referred to above, and discussed the issues 
with them in order for the Committee to form a judgement on the financial statements. In addition, we considered the Letter of 
Representation that the External Auditor requires from the Board.
We meet with the External Auditor privately at least twice a year to discuss any matters they may wish to raise without management 
being present.
Assessment of Effectiveness of External Audit
The Committee reviewed KPMG LLP’s performance and on-going independence, taking into account input from management, 
consideration of responses to questions from the Committee and the audit findings reported to the Committee. As part of the 
process, the Committee reviewed the feedback from the Public Report on the Audit Quality Inspection of KPMG LLP, issued by 
the FRC in May 2014.
The Committee concluded that the external audit process was operating effectively and KPMG LLP continued to prove effective 
in its role as External Auditor. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Governance
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
29
The External Auditor is required to replace its audit partner every five years. The most recent change occurred in the year ended 
March 2011 and, therefore, the existing partner will rotate after the upcoming AGM and a new partner is required in respect of the 
financial year ending 25 March 2016. The Chairman of the Committee and the Group Finance Director requested details of the 
most suitable partners from the External Auditor, conducted interviews and made a joint recommendation which was accepted 
by the Committee. The criteria used for this process included examining experience of public company audits, work with similar 
businesses and absence of potential conflicts. 
The Committee, having completed the activities outlined, remains confident that the effectiveness, objectivity and independence 
of the External Auditor is not impaired in any way. There are no contractual restrictions on the choice of External Auditor. The 
Committee has therefore recommended to the Board and to shareholders that KPMG LLP should be re-appointed as the 
Company’s External Auditor at the AGM on 8 July 2015. 
The Committee is mindful, however, of the requirements of the Code that the audit should be put out to tender every ten years, 
and the UK Competition and Markets Authority's final Order (the ‘Order’) and the EU Regulation which was published in October 
2014 and which will each require mandatory audit tendering (and, as required, rotation) at ten year intervals. The Committee is 
also mindful of the transitional provisions of the EU Regulation which will require the Company to change its External Auditor prior 
to 16 June 2016. The current External Auditor was first appointed for the year ended 1 April 2005 and the external audit has not 
been tendered since then. In order to comply with the transitional provisions of the Order and the EU Regulation, the Committee 
has notified KPMG LLP of its intention to put the audit out to tender during the current financial year, with a view to the successful 
audit firm being appointed to audit the Group’s financial statements for the year commencing 25 March 2016. 
Non-Audit Services
The Committee recognises the potential for any non-audit services to compromise auditor independence and the External 
Auditor is not permitted to conduct any assignment which may affect objectivity or independence. Subject to this, where it is 
helpful to the Group for KPMG to provide assistance, the Committee monitors the services provided and fees charged.
Non-audit work comprised the interim review, for which fees of £41,000 were charged, and other small assignments to assist 
with tax compliance and other matters for aggregate fees of £24,000. The Committee believes that there are sound commercial 
and practical reasons for this work being conducted by the External Auditor and that it is not of a nature which would affect their 
independence as External Auditor. 
The Committee intends, at the same time as the audit tender, to review its policy on non audit services provided by the External 
Auditor to ensure that the External Auditor remains free from any perceived conflict of interest.
Whistleblowing Programme
The Group has a whistleblowing programme in all of its operations whereby employees can, in confidence, report on matters 
where they feel a malpractice has taken or is taking place, or if health and safety standards have been or are being compromised. 
Additional areas that are addressed by this procedure include criminal activities, improper or unethical behaviour and risks to 
the environment.
The programme allows employees to raise their concerns with their line manager or, if that is inappropriate, to raise them on a 
confidential basis. An externally facilitated confidential helpline and confidential email facility are provided to protect the identity of 
employees in these circumstances. Any concerns are investigated on a confidential basis by the Human Resources Department 
and/or the Company Secretary and feedback is given to the person making the complaint as appropriate via the confidential 
email facility. An official written record is kept of each stage of the procedure and reported to the Committee. 
Committee Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Committee is reviewed on an annual basis by both the Board and the Committee itself. Both reviews 
concluded that the Committee continued to operate effectively and efficiently.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 20 May 2015.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
I am pleased to present the Report of the Nomination Committee for 2015. This Report provides shareholders with an overview 
of the activities carried out during the year.
 
On 2 April 2015, it was announced that after nine years as Chairman of Blueheath and then Booker Group Plc, I had decided to 
retire on conclusion of the forthcoming AGM. I should like to thank my fellow directors for all their support over the past nine years 
and to wish the Company continued success in the future. 
In relation to the appointment of my successor as Chairman, Lord Bilimoria, the Company's Senior Independent Director, has 
chaired the Committee and the Board when dealing with the appointment of my successor as Chairman of the Company. The 
search is ongoing and it is expected that an announcement will be made as to my successor prior to the forthcoming AGM. To 
assist it in the search for a new Chairman, the Committee has engaged The Zygos Partnership.
During the year the Committee focused on reviewing the Company’s succession plans for appointments to the Board to ensure 
that an appropriate balance of skills, experience and diversity is achieved and having regard to the need to ensure the progressive 
refreshing of the Board. This issue was of particular relevance given that Andrew Cripps and Lord Bilimoria will have completed 
over 9 years of service on the Board in 2016. 
As a consequence of this review, we have decided to refresh the composition of our Board and of various Board committees 
in order to strengthen the Board in advance of any potential retirements and to aid future succession planning. The Committee 
has engaged The Zygos Partnership to undertake a search for a candidate with the appropriate skills and experience to join the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director and ultimately to succeed Andrew Cripps as Chairman of the Audit Committee in due course. 
This search is ongoing.
Separately, membership of this Committee has been refreshed, with Karen Jones being appointed as a member with effect from 
4 February 2015. In addition, Lord Bilimoria will replace me as Chairman of the Committee with effect from the conclusion of the 
forthcoming AGM. 
Looking forward, the Committee will continue to review long term succession plans for the Board, with the aim of ensuring that 
an appropriate balance of skills, experience and diversity is maintained and that there is progressive refreshing of the Board over 
the next few years.
I will be available to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM to answer any questions relating to the role of the Committee. 
On behalf of the Board.

Role and Responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee has defined Terms of Reference which can be found in the Investor Relations/Legal Documents section of the 
Group’s website. A copy may be obtained from the Company Secretary. The Committee is responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board on the appointment of additional Directors and for reviewing the size, structure and composition (including the skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity) of the Board and the membership of Board committees to ensure that they have the necessary 
range of competencies, knowledge and experience required for the direction and oversight of the business.
Membership
The Committee during the year from 29 March 2014 until 4 February 2015 comprised Richard Rose (Chairman), Lord Bilimoria 
and Andrew Cripps. From 4 February 2015 the Committee comprised Richard Rose (Chairman), Lord Bilimoria, Andrew Cripps, 
and Karen Jones. All members of the Committee are considered to be independent Non-Executive Directors. Richard Rose did 
not chair the Committee when it dealt with the search for and selection of his successor and no other member of the Committee 
put themselves forward as a potential candidate for the Chairmanship. 
No member of the Committee nor any other Director participates in discussions concerning or votes on his or her own re-
election or evaluation of his own performance. Details of the skills and experience of the Directors are contained in the Directors’ 
biographies on pages 18 and 19. Their remuneration is set out in the Remuneration Report. 
The quorum necessary for the transaction of business is two, each of whom must be a Non-Executive Director. Only members 
of the Committee have the right to attend Committee meetings, however, during the year, Charles Wilson (Chief Executive) was 
invited to attend meetings. 
The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee.
Board Composition/Succession
The Board plans for its own succession, with the support of the Committee. 
The Committee remains focused, on behalf of the Board, on Board succession planning for both Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee aims to ensure that:
• the succession pipeline for senior executive and business critical roles in the organisation is adequate;
• processes are in place to identify potential successors and manage succession activity;
• there is a structured approach to developing and preparing possible successors; and
• processes are in place to identify ‘at risk’ posts.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Governance
32
Meeting Frequency and Main Activities in the Year
The Nomination Committee met twice during the year ended 27 March 2015 to:
• Review the size, structure and composition of the Board.
• Recommend to the Board that Karen Jones, whose three-year tenure expired in February of this year, be re-appointed as a 
Non-Executive Director for a further three-year term subject to re-election by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM;
• Recommend to the Board that all of the Directors who have indicated their willingness to stand for re-election be proposed for 
re-election as Directors at the forthcoming AGM; 
• Commence the search for a candidate to succeed Richard Rose as Chairman of the Company from the conclusion of the AGM 
on 8 July 2015. That search is ongoing;
• Embark on a search for a new Non-Executive Director with appropriate skills and experience who it is intended will ultimately 
succeed Andrew Cripps as Chairman of the Audit Committee in due course. This search commenced at the beginning of 
February this year and is ongoing;
• Review the Committee’s report within the 2014 Annual Report and recommend its approval to the Board. 
In preparing the job specification, assessing the time commitment expected and agreeing the skills and experience desired for 
a potential successor Chairman, considerable emphasis has been placed on identifying a candidate with considerable/recent 
experience of the grocery and wholesale/retail sectors generally and the ability to work closely and effectively with the Chief 
Executive in delivering the Company’s strategy whilst providing the necessary degree of independence and challenge. The 
search for a suitable candidate began within the Board. The search has then been widened through the use of an external agency, 
The Zygos Partnership. The Zygos Partnership does not have any connection to the Group other than in respect of the provision 
of these services. 
The Chairman’s commitment to the Company will usually be two days per month. 
To assist it in the search for a new Non-Executive Director, the Committee has again engaged The Zygos Partnership. The Zygos 
Partnership has been provided with a detailed brief of the desired candidate profile based on merit and against objective criteria 
(including an assessment of the time commitment expected) and their services are being used to conduct a thorough search 
to identify suitable candidates. The Committee has been considering a list of potential candidates and the skills, knowledge, 
independence and diversity in its widest sense (gender, nationality, age, experience, ethnicity and background) which would 
benefit the Company. 
The search for a new Non-Executive Director who it is intended will ultimately succeed Andrew Cripps as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee is ongoing.
The Company did not use open advertising to search for suitable candidates for the roles of Chairman or Non-Executive Director, 
as we believe that the optimal way of recruiting for these positions is generally to use targeted recruitment based on the skills and 
experience required.
The Committee also considered the membership of the Board and each of its Committees. The Committee continues to actively 
review the long term succession planning process for Directors to ensure the structure, size and composition of the Board and its 
Committees continues to be effective, thus ensuring appropriate levels of corporate governance and best practice and support 
for the Company as it pursues its strategy. As part of its review, the Committee considered the performance and independence 
of Karen Jones, Helena Andreas, Stewart Gilliland, Andrew Cripps and Lord Bilimoria, each of them having confirmed their 
willingness to stand for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.
Following a rigorous review, the Committee concluded that, notwithstanding Karen Jones, Andrew Cripps and Lord Bilimoria’s 
length of service (over six years as Non-Executive Directors of the Company), they were each still independent in character and 
judgement and they each continued to devote sufficient time to the Company in order to perform their duties.
The Committee considered that the performance of each of Karen Jones, Helena Andreas, Stewart Gilliland, Andrew Cripps and 
Lord Bilimoria was effective and accordingly recommended to the Board that they each be proposed for re-election as a Director 
of the Company at the forthcoming AGM. 
Membership of this Committee was also refreshed during the year, with Karen Jones being appointed as a member in February 
2015. In addition, Lord Bilimoria will replace Richard Rose as Chairman of the Committee with effect from the conclusion of the 
forthcoming AGM.

Diversity
We value diversity in the Boardroom and see it as a wider topic than simply gender. Our Directors come from different 
backgrounds and each brings unique capabilities and perspectives to our discussions, with a wide range of professional and 
geographical backgrounds. We are committed to maintaining a diverse Board. Appointments to the Board and throughout 
the Group will continue to be made on merit and overall suitability for the role against objective criteria with due regard to the 
benefits of diversity (including, but not limited to, experience and gender). Whilst the Committee has not determined to set 
targets for the number of women on the Board, we continue to consider and make appointments based on merit, just as was 
the case when our first female Director was appointed in 2009. When recruiting, we require any search agency to have signed 
up to the ‘Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms’ setting out the seven key principles of best practice to abide 
by throughout the recruitment process.
Statistical gender diversity employment data for the Group can be found in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report on page 10.
Committee Performance and Effectiveness
The Board additionally undertook an annual review of the Committee’s performance and effectiveness and concluded that the 
Committee operated effectively.

I am pleased to present the Report of the Remuneration Committee for 2015, which sets out the remuneration paid to the 
Directors in the financial year ended 27 March 2015 and the policy for the forthcoming year.
This is my second report under the new regulations for the reporting of directors’ remuneration.
The Committee’s approach to remuneration is that it should be kept as simple and comprehensible as possible. As such, our 
Remuneration Policy remains unchanged from last year. The remuneration policies of the Company are intended to ensure: 
• Incentives for Executive Directors and executives should be closely linked to performance, thus aligning the interests of 
Executive Directors, executives and shareholders; 
• Executive Directors’ rewards should be correlated with those received by other employees of the business; and
• Executive Directors are not rewarded for failure.
The Committee is of the view that we have a structure of reasonable base pay, bonuses and long term incentives which are 
aligned to growing long term shareholder value. We are satisfied that the outcomes to date have reflected business performance 
and that the targets set are stretching in the context of the market in which we operate and, if delivered, will have added significant 
value for shareholders. 
Moreover, we believe that the remuneration policy and incentive framework in place is working well to support the Company’s 
strategy and is helping to retain, recruit and motivate our management team.
In the context of our future performance goals the Committee will continue to keep under review the targets attached to PSP 
awards to be granted in 2015.
We look forward to hearing your views in the future and hope to receive your continued support at this year’s AGM.
This Remuneration Report was approved by the Board on 20 May 2015.

Role of the Committee
The Remuneration Committee has defined Terms of Reference which were reviewed in November 2013 and can be found in the 
Investor Relations/Investor Centre/Legal Documents section of the Group’s website. A copy may be obtained from the Company 
Secretary. The Remuneration Committee advises the Board and makes recommendations:
• on the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and executives including remuneration, share incentives and  
other benefits;
• on the terms of service contracts with Executive Directors and executives and any compensation arrangements resulting from 
the termination of an Executive Director or executive’s service contract; and 
• concerning the grant and vesting of awards under the PSP.
Membership
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Karen Jones and also comprises Lord Bilimoria and Andrew Cripps, all of whom 
are independent Non-Executive Directors. Details of the skills and experience of the Directors are contained in the Directors’ 
biographies on pages 18 and 19. Their remuneration is set out later in this Report. The quorum necessary for the transaction 
of business is two, each of whom must be a Non-Executive Director. Only members of the Committee have the right to attend 
committee meetings, however, during the year, Richard Rose (Chairman), Charles Wilson (Chief Executive) and the Group 
Human Resources director were invited to attend meetings (although never during the discussion of any item affecting their own 
remuneration or employment). 
The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.

Key Remuneration Principles
The principles supporting the Executive Directors’ reward packages are reviewed each year to ensure that they continue to 
underpin the Group’s strategy. 
The Committee’s overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration packages. The Company 
wishes to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and executives of the requisite quality. Accordingly, the Committee’s 
policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which reward Executive Directors and executives fairly for 
their contribution. The Committee will take into account the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees when 
determining Executive Directors’ remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases. 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The policy for Executive Directors remuneration, set out below, took effect from the date of the 2014 AGM, and is available to 
view in the Investor Relations/Investor Centre/Legal Documents section of the Group’s website. A copy may be obtained from 
the Company Secretary.
The Committee considers the remuneration policy annually to ensure that it continues to underpin the Group’s strategy. It is, 
however, intended that the policy set out below will apply for three years from the 2014 AGM.

Reviewed annually and fixed for 
12 months from 1 April. 
Committee considers:
•  Business and individual 
performance;
•  Current remuneration 
against internal and external 
benchmarks; and
•  Average salary increases for  
the wider Company workforce.
When external benchmarking  
is used, the comparator groups 
are chosen having regard to:
•  Size – market capitalisation, 
turnover, profits and the  
number of employees;
•  Diversity and complexity  
of the business.
Over the policy period, salaries 
for current Executive Directors will 
broadly increase in line with the 
range of increases applying to the 
employee population, other than 
where there is a change in role 
or responsibility, where there are 
major changes within the Group 
or where a significant variance to 
the market arises that warrants a 
more significant increase, or where 
the Committee judges that there 
is a risk in relation to attracting 
or retaining Executive Directors. 
Any such changes, should they 
occur, will be fully explained 
to shareholders in the next 
Remuneration Report.
Newly promoted or recruited 
Executive Directors may on 
occasion have their salaries set 
below the benchmark policy level 
while they become established 
in the role. In such cases, salary 
increases may be higher than 
the employee population until the

Notes to Future Policy Table
Bonus 
The Earnings before interest and tax (‘EBIT’) bonus scheme, which is consistent with the FY14 bonus scheme, covers Executive 
Directors, executives, branch managers and sales teams, comprising approximately 1,700 colleagues of the Group. The aggregate 
bonus pool is determined each year by the level of improvement in Group EBIT year on year and no bonus is paid unless 
there is an improvement. The maximum bonus achievable for an Executive Director is 100% of basic salary. Charles Wilson, 
Chief Executive, does not participate in this bonus scheme. The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with 
shareholder interests which arise from his significant shareholding in the Company. Payments to Executive Directors are based 
upon a percentage of basic salary and do not form part of pensionable earnings. The proportion of the bonus pool accruing to 
Executive Directors is less than 15%. 
PSP 
The PSP scheme allows Executive Directors and approximately 1,000 employees to receive share awards, subject to the 
achievement of performance targets set by the Committee, measured over a three year period. Awards are made annually and, 
other than in exceptional circumstances, will not be more than 150% of annual salary for Executive Directors.
For the 2011/14 PSP cycle, the performance measures were share price based. Details of structure and outcome are set out on 
page 48.
For the 2012/15, 2013/16 and 2014/17 PSP cycle, the Committee resolved to grant maximum awards at 150% of base salary 
for the Executive Directors. Vesting for points between Threshold and Maximum is calculated on a straight line basis, as follows:
• 50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute TSR performance target with 25% of this element vesting at 8% growth per 
annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting for 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 3 years from 
the award date.
• 50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving 
Absolute EPS growth of 6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as 
measured between March 2012 and March 2015, March 2013 and March 2016 and March 2014 and March 2017.
In setting the TSR performance target, the Committee has taken into account the TSR returns achieved by companies in the 
FTSE350 commencing with the three year period to May 2002 and then walking forward on a weekly basis with the last data point 
being the returns of each company through to July 2012.
There is no re-testing of performance targets under the PSP, and awards lapse if they are not met.
The Committee will review the performance measures for the 2015/18 cycle for the Executive Directors (excluding Charles 
Wilson), in the context of our future performance goals. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Governance
40
Fixed and Variable Pay Mix
Individual reward elements for all Executive Directors (excluding Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, who does not participate in 
any incentive schemes) are designed to provide a balance between fixed remuneration and variable ‘at risk’ reward, linked to 
the performance of the Company. Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, has chosen from the outset not to participate in the bonus 
scheme and does not participate in the PSP. The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder 
interests which arises from his significant shareholding in the Company. 
Illustrative scenarios
Below is an illustration of the value that could be received by each Executive Director under the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
in respect of 2015/16, showing:
• minimum, which comprises base salary, benefits and employer pension contributions only (equivalent to 15% of base salary) 
(total fixed pay);
• on-target, which includes total fixed pay and assumes an on-target award for the Bonus (50% of salary) and 50% of maximum 
PSP vesting; and
• maximum, which includes total fixed pay and a maximum award under the Bonus (100% of salary) and 100% of maximum 
PSP vesting. 
The salaries included are those that will apply from 1 April 2015. The benefit values included are estimates. The amounts shown in 
relation to Bonus and PSP do not take account of any share price appreciation or depreciation and the PSP vesting is calculated 
using a share price of 147.70p being the closing share price on 27 March 2015.

Use of Discretion by Remuneration Committee
Malus in Incentive Plans
The Committee has the discretion under both the Bonus scheme and the PSP to claw back bonus and unvested share awards 
in the following circumstances:
• misconduct that causes significant damage or potential damage to the Company’s prospects, finances or brand reputation; 
and/or
• actions that lead to material misstatement or restatement of accounts.
This feature helps ensure alignment between executive rewards and shareholder returns.
Other Uses of Discretion
The Committee will operate the Company’s incentive plans according to their respective rules, the policy set out in the table above 
and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
The Committee retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the incentive plans. These 
include, but are not limited to, determining who participates in the incentive plans, the time and size of awards, measurement of 
performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction and the adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. 
rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends). The discretions that can be applied in the 
case of leavers under the Bonus and PSP are set out in the section on ‘Policy on Payment for Loss of Office’ on page 42.
Any exercises of discretion by the Committee will be fully disclosed and explained in the relevant year’s Remuneration Report.
The Committee will also use its judgement as to what is appropriate within the terms of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy,  
to make decisions that do not involve the exercise of discretion.
Approach to Recruitment Remuneration
The remuneration of any new Executive Director will be determined in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and 
the elements that would be considered by the Company for inclusion are:
• salary and benefits, including defined contribution pension participation and relocation costs, where appropriate;
• participation in the Bonus: pro-rated for the year of recruitment to reflect the proportion of the year remaining after the date of 
commencement of employment. 
• participation in the PSP: awards would be granted on the same terms and subject to the same performance conditions as 
those which apply to PSP awards granted to existing Executive Directors in the year of recruitment.
The maximum annual level of variable remuneration that may be granted to a newly recruited Executive Director (excluding any 
awards to compensate for incentives forgone on recruitment) would be in line with that of the existing Executive Directors:
• Bonus award: maximum 100% of salary; and
• PSP award: maximum 400% of salary for a full PSP cycle commencing after appointment, plus pro-rated awards in relation to 
PSP cycles outstanding at the time of recruitment (up to a further 150% of salary).
In addition, the Committee may, in its discretion, compensate a newly recruited Executive Director for incentives forgone from 
a previous employment as a result of their resignation. The Committee would seek validation of the value of any potential 
incentives forgone.
Awards made by way of compensation for incentives forgone would be made on a comparable basis, taking account of 
performance achieved (or likely to be achieved), the proportion of the performance period remaining and the form of the award. 
Compensation would, as far as possible, be in the form of awards under the PSP in order to immediately align a new Executive 
Director with Company performance. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Governance
42
Policy on Payment for Loss of Office
Contractual Notice Period and Pay in Lieu
All current Executive Directors have a rolling service contract with a notice period from the company of 12 months. As an 
alternative, the Company may, at its discretion, pay in lieu of that notice. Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given 
in the event of gross misconduct.
Payment in lieu of notice could potentially include up to 12 months’ salary and the cash equivalent of 12 months’ pension 
contributions, and other contractual benefits. Where possible, the Company will seek to ensure that where a leaver mitigates 
their losses by, for example, finding new employment, there will be a corresponding reduction in compensation payable for loss 
of office. The Company’s approach to the termination of contracts of service of Executive Directors is dictated by the relevant 
events, bearing in mind the circumstances of termination and the interests of the Company. A bonus element is not normally 
included in the termination payment, however, if the Company enforces the non-compete clause, up to 12 months on target 
bonus will be payable.
An Executive Director may have an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under relevant employment 
legislation in the UK.
Under Charles Wilson’s contract, in the event of a change of control of the Company, Charles Wilson has the right to terminate his 
employment on 30 days’ notice and to receive a payment equal to his gross salary for his contractual notice period. 
Termination by Mutual Agreement
In certain circumstances it can be in the best interests of the Company for the Board to proactively manage succession planning 
and the development of the senior talent pipeline. In such circumstances, the Board may agree that an executive’s departure will 
be by mutual agreement. In order for this to apply, the Committee will need to be satisfied that the executive has demonstrated 
performance in line with expectations and where required they should have contributed to an orderly succession. The Company’s 
experience is that this approach is successful and has previously enabled the Company to recruit a former Executive Director to 
lead Makro on an interim basis immediately after its acquisition.
An Executive Director terminated by mutual agreement will be treated as a ‘good leaver’ for the purposes of the Bonus and PSP 
plans. If the termination date falls during the financial year, they will be eligible to be paid a pro-rated on target bonus and if they 
are employed at the end of the financial year, the bonus payable would be based on actual results.
Other than as set out above, the Committee does not anticipate using the discretion provided by the Bonus and PSP plan rules 
in respect of termination payments. There may, however, be unforeseen circumstances where this is in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders. Where such discretion is exercised, explanations will be provided in the next Remuneration 
Report and will comply with the Company’s overall remuneration policy aim that Directors should not be rewarded for failure.

The Committee would only exercise the discretions available in the Bonus and PSP plan rules relating to:
• whether an award is made or an unvested award forfeited; and
• the extent and timing of any such award or forfeiture in exceptional circumstances, for example permanent disablement.
Notice periods would not usually be included when calculating the pro-rata amount of Bonus and PSP awards that vest. The 
Committee would only exercise its discretion to include some or all of the notice period in such calculation in exceptional 
circumstances, such as ill health, and would not do so in circumstances of poor performance.
The Committee has the discretion to determine that an individual should be treated as a Good Leaver for the purposes of the 
PSP. In exercising such discretion the Committee will consider factors such as personal performance and conduct, overall Group 
performance and the specific circumstances of the Executive Director’s departure including, but not restricted to, whether the 
Executive Director is leaving by mutual agreement with the Company. If an individual is not a Good Leaver then they will be treated 
as an Other Leaver, as set out above.
Committee Interaction with Stakeholders
The Committee engages with shareholders on remuneration matters. Discussions were held with a number of shareholders and 
with shareholder representative organisations over the year. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Governance
44
Legacy Arrangements
The Committee reserves the right to honour any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office not in line with the policy 
set out above where the terms of those payments were (i) entered into with current or former directors before this policy came 
into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant executive was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, 
the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. 
For these purposes ‘payments’ includes payments of variable remuneration under the Bonus scheme and the PSP in line with the 
terms of the payment agreed at the time the award was granted.
The Committee may make minor changes to this policy, which do not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid its operation 
or implementation taking into account the interests of shareholders but without the need to seek shareholder approval.
Consideration of Employment Conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group when determining 
remuneration for its Executive Directors. 
Salary increases for Executive Directors will broadly increase in line with the general workforce other than when there is a change 
in role or responsibility, or a significant variance to the market arises, warranting a larger increase.
Newly promoted or recruited Executive Directors to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set below the benchmark 
policy level while they become established in role. In such cases, salary increases may be higher than the general workforce until 
the target positioning is achieved.
Group employees’ salaries are compared to cross-industry standards to ensure fair pay for that job. The Company does 
not directly consult with employees as part of the process of determining Directors’ remuneration. While formal comparison 
measurements were not used in determining Executive Director remuneration, the Committee made decisions in the knowledge 
of incentive arrangements of the rest of the Group, upon which the Committee is briefed regularly.
Remuneration Policy for Other Employees
The Company’s policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors is consistent with that of other senior employees. This group of 
approximately 1,700 people also participates in and receives payments under the EBIT Bonus scheme. Eligibility to participate in 
the PSP extends to a similar set of around 1,000 employees in total.
Outside the senior employees’ group, the composition of remuneration differs. Of the Group’s average 13,000 employees, 
over 9,000 employees are eligible for a bonus payment based on ‘customer satisfaction’. Customer satisfaction is measured 
independently by calling 10,000 customers selected at random covering retailers, caterers, delivered and collect across our 202 
branches each quarter to ask them to rate key areas of service. 
Around 1,300 logistics employees are eligible for a quarterly bonus payment based on achieving productivity and efficiency 
targets at the site at which they are employed. 
In addition from time to time certain incentive arrangements may be introduced for executives and colleagues in order to achieve 
particular objectives.
Eligibility for, and participation in, benefits and incentive plans differs depending on location, seniority, length of service and 
other factors.

Service Contracts and Notice Periods for Executive Directors
The Committee’s policy is for all Executive Directors to have rolling service contracts with a notice period of 12 months. All new 
appointments will have 12 month notice periods, unless, on an exceptional basis to complete an external recruitment successfully, 
a longer initial notice period reducing to 12 months is used.
This is in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
All Executive Directors’ appointments and subsequent re-appointments are subject to election and annual re-election by 
shareholders at the AGM.

The Board has determined that the time commitment of Non-Executive Directors should be 12 days per annum, other than the 
Chairman whose time commitment should be 24 days per annum. The time commitment for Non-Executive Directors is set out 
in the relevant Non-Executive Director’s letter of appointment. 
Non-Executive Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their duties as 
Directors of the Company. 
Details of Letters of Appointment and Notice Periods for Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years subject to termination on one month’s

Salary (audited information)
In 2015, the Committee conducted a review of Executive Director salaries in light of approaches made to Executive Directors. 
That review confirmed the number of criteria outlined in the Remuneration Policy that must apply in order for a salary increase to 
be considered had been met, particularly:
• where there is a change in role or responsibility;
• where there are major changes within the Group or where a significant variance to the market arises. 
As a consequence, the Committee reviewed basic salaries for the Executive Directors. The Committee revisited the benchmarking 
undertaken by PwC in April 2012 based on a company with a market capitalisation of £1.5bn (i.e. considerably smaller than 
Booker’s current market capitalisation) and increased the comparator salaries by 6% to reflect the 2 years that had passed since 
that benchmarking report. Based on that benchmarking information, the Committee approved salary increases of circa 10% for 
each of the Executive Directors (excluding Charles Wilson). 
Whilst these increases are significant, the Committee considers that the increases are fully necessary to ensure the Company 
continues to prosper in a challenging trading environment.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Governance

Bonus (audited information)
The level of pre-bonus earnings before interest and tax (‘EBIT’) achieved in 2015 gave rise to the following awards to the 
Executive Directors:
Director EBIT award as % of salary
Jonathan Prentis 51.98%
Mark Aylwin 51.98%
Guy Farrant 51.98%
Bryn Satherley 51.98%
The EBIT bonus scheme covers approximately 1,600 colleagues, including the Executive Directors (other than Charles Wilson). 
The scheme has been in operation since 2007 (albeit that up to 2012 it was based on increases in earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) and is targeted on increasing the Group EBIT year on year. The Group EBIT increase of £19.9m to 
£140.3m resulted in a bonus being awarded to Executive Directors of 51.98% of salary. The maximum bonus payable under the 
scheme to Executive Directors was 100% of salary, had the Group EBIT exceeded £187.0m, an uplift on prior year of £60.3m. If 
EBIT had not increased year on year no bonus would have been paid. Bonus is paid on basic salary as at 31 March each year. The 
proportion of the total scheme bonus pool accruing to Executive Directors was less than 15%, in accordance with the Company’s 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
Bonus payments awarded to each Executive Director, other than Charles Wilson who received no bonus, as a proportion of salary 
in the three previous financial years:
Financial Year Bonus Payment
2014 61.20%
2013 55.26%
2012 58.16%
Share Incentives (audited information)
The performance measures for each three year PSP cycle are set by the Committee. Awards are made annually and eligible 
employees will receive shares at the end of the cycle, subject to achievement of the performance measures. 
a) PSP Options Granted in 2011
In November 2011, the Company granted options under the PSP in relation to a total of 7.0m new Ordinary Shares. The options 
vested and became exercisable three years from the date of the award subject to continued employment and the performance 
conditions being satisfied.  The performance conditions specified that a fifth of each option would vest upon reaching each of the 
share prices of 85.8p, 89.4p, 100.1p, 128.7p and 153.0p, in each case sustained over a consecutive 60-day period. All five share 
price conditions were met in full. The options will lapse if not exercised within ten years of the date of award.

In October 2014, the Company made awards under the PSP in relation to a total of 8.6m new Ordinary Shares.
The options granted will vest and become exercisable three years from the date of award, subject to continued employment and 
the performance conditions outlined above being satisfied and will lapse if not exercised within 10 years of the date of award.

Participation
As well as the Executive Directors, approximately 1,000 employees have been granted PSP options. In addition 3,069 employees 
participate in the 2014 SAYE scheme, 2,888 employees participate in the 2013 SAYE scheme and 1,576 participate in the 2012 
SAYE scheme. The Executive Directors have chosen not to participate in any of the current SAYE schemes. 
The high number of employees participating in these schemes is consistent with the Group’s policy of ensuring that the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors is aligned with that of the overall workforce and with the interests of shareholders. 
Since 2007, when the reverse takeover of Blueheath was completed and the Company became admitted to trading on AIM, the 
equity value of the Company has increased from approximately £300m to over £2.6bn as at 20 May. The value of the PSP options 
awarded has been equivalent to 2% of the value generated.
Statement of Directors’ Shareholdings (audited information)
Alignment to shareholder interests is a key element of the Group’s remuneration policy which maintains commitment over the 
long term and ensures that the interests of the Executive Directors are aligned with those of shareholders. The Committee sets 
shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors. The current guideline is to build and maintain, over time, a personal (and/or 
spousal) holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least the Executive Director’s annual base salary. All of the 
Executive Directors currently meet these guidelines. Details of the share interests of all Executive Directors are shown below.

Relative Performance Graph
The Company’s performance from 27 March 2009 to 27 March 2015 measured by Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), is 
compared in the chart below with the performance of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts). This is considered the  
most appropriate index against which to measure performance following the Company’s inclusion in the FTSE 250 Index in 
December 2009. 
TSR is defined as the return a shareholder would receive if they held a notional number of shares and received dividends over 
a period of time. Assuming dividends are reinvested into the Company’s shares, it measures the percentage growth in the 
Company’s share price together with any dividends paid. 
The closing mid market price of an Ordinary Share on 27 March 2015 was 147.70p and the price range during the year was 
115.00p to 165.00p.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year.  Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.  
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period.  In preparing each of the 
Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Report that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
• the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
to the members of Booker Group plc only
Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is 
unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Booker Group plc 
for the period ended 27 March 2015 set out on pages 58 to 
92. In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs 
as at 27 March 2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements 
the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit were as follows:
Valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme
Refer to page 27 (Audit Committee Report), page 65 
(accounting policy) and page 82 (financial disclosures).
The risk – Significant estimates are made in valuing the 
Group’s post-retirement defined benefit scheme, including in 
particular the discount rate used to discount the retirement 
benefit obligation, the inflation assumptions adopted and the 
assumptions in respect of mortality. Small changes in the 
assumptions used in the valuation of the Group’s net pension 
deficit could have a significant effect on the results and financial 
position of the Group.
Our response – In this area our audit procedures included 
testing of the controls over the maintenance of the scheme’s 
membership data, as well as sample testing from that data 
to the source documentation establishing the obligation to 
members, and vice versa. With the support of our own actuarial 
specialists, we then challenged the key assumptions applied 
to that data to determine the Group’s net deficit. This included 
a comparison of these key assumptions against external 
market data, where appropriate, such as bond yield curves 
of comparable duration to the Group’s scheme. In addition, 
we developed an expectation for the amount of benefits paid 
in the year and compared that with the amount actually paid. 
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
in relation to the pension scheme.
 
Measurement of onerous lease provisions
Refer to page 27 (Audit Committee Report), page 68 
(accounting policy) and page 84 (financial disclosures).
The risk – The Group has recorded provisions at the year 
end in respect of onerous leases for vacant properties. The 
estimation of these provisions at each period end requires a 
significant degree of judgement and the application of certain 
assumptions, including the expected cash flows associated 
with the properties over the remaining lease term, the expected 
utilisation of the properties, and the rate used to discount future 
cash flows to account for the time value of money. As such there 
is a risk that the provision, and associated charges or credits 
in the statement of comprehensive income, are materially 
misstated through the use of inappropriate assumptions.
Our response – Our procedures included, for a sample of 
properties, critically evaluating the underlying assumptions 
applied by the Directors. In doing so we compared the 
underlying assumptions described above to the Group’s 
supporting information, including the individual circumstances 
relevant to each property and the Directors’ expectations going 
forward. We read Board minutes to compare the assumptions 
in relation to the proposed usage of the properties with the 
documented plans noted in those minutes, where available. 
We held enquiries with the Group’s internal qualified property 
specialists in relation to the key assumptions within the 
calculations, including the discount rate and the forecasts 
for sublet income within the calculations where the Directors’ 
are expecting to sublet vacant properties to third parties. 
We critically evaluated the discount rate used to discount 
forecast cash flows associated with the properties, through 
the utilisation of our valuation specialist, and by evaluating 
the sensitivity of the provisions to changes in the rate used. 
We performed additional sensitivity analysis to understand 
the impact of changes to other key assumptions within the 
calculation of the provisions, including forecast cash outflow 
and inflow assumptions and property utilisation rates. We also 
re-performed the calculation of the provisions to ensure that 
they had been calculated correctly and that the discounting of 
the cash flows had been correctly performed.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Financial Statements

3. Our application of materiality and an overview of 
the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £7.1m, determined with reference to a benchmark of 
Group profit before tax of £138.8m, of which it represents 5.1%. 
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected 
identified misstatements exceeding £0.35m, in addition to 
other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. 
Of the Group’s seven reporting components, we subjected 
three to audits for Group reporting purposes and the remaining 
four to reviews (including enquiry) of financial information. The 
latter were not individually financially significant enough to 
require an audit for Group reporting purposes, but provided us 
with additional audit coverage. Our work covered 100% of the 
Group’s profit before tax, revenues and total assets. 
The Group audit team carried out the work on all the components 
at the Group’s offices in Wellingborough, Deeside and Eccles. 
Component materialities ranged between £5m and £6m.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
5. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters 
on which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you 
if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have identified other information in the annual report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or 
that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion: 
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 17, in relation to 
going concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 
20 relating to the Company’s compliance with the ten 
provisions of the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 55, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description 
of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided 
on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.
org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely 
to the Company’s members as a body and is subject to 
important explanations and disclaimers regarding our 
responsibilities, published on our website at www.kpmg.com/
uk/auditscopeukco2014a, which are incorporated into this 
report as if set out in full and should be read to provide an 
understanding of the purpose of this report, the work we have 
undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. General information
a) Overview
Booker Group plc is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom (Registration number 05145685). The Company is 
domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered address is Equity House, Irthlingborough Road, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, 
NN8 1LT. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic and Directors’ Reports.
b) Basis of accounting
In accordance with EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002), the group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) adopted for use in the EU as at 27 March 2015 (‘adopted IFRS’), International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company has elected to prepare its parent company accounts in accordance with UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (‘UK GAAP’).
The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). The 
parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling and rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. 
The financial statements for the current period have been prepared for a 52 week period to reflect internal management reporting.
c) Basis of consolidation
On 4 June 2007 the Company, then named Blueheath Holdings plc, became the legal parent company of Giant Topco Limited in 
a share-for-share transaction. Due to the relative values of the companies, the former Giant Topco Limited shareholders became 
the majority shareholders with 90.36% of the enlarged share capital. As part of the business combination Blueheath Holdings 
plc changed its name to Booker Group plc and changed its accounting reference date to 31 March. Following the transaction, 
the Company’s continuing operations and executive management were predominantly those of Giant Topco Limited. IFRS 3 
‘Business Combinations’ defines the acquirer in a business combination as the entity that obtains control. Accordingly, the 
combination was accounted as a reverse acquisition i.e. as if Giant Topco Limited had acquired Blueheath Holdings plc in return 
for consideration equal to the fair value of the shares issued.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with an entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities. 
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the 
date that control ceases.
In July 2012, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Makro Holding Limited (‘Makro’). The transaction was subject to 
Competition Commission approval and, whilst this process was in progress, the investment was held as an available for sale 
financial asset and cash subsequently advanced from Makro was shown within creditors. Full clearance to the acquisition of 
Makro was received from the Competition Commission on 19 April 2013 and Makro has been consolidated from this date, being 
the date that control passed to the Group. See notes 9 and 13 for more details.

d) Accounting standards adopted in the period
The Group has adopted the following new standards: 
• IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ 
• IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’
• IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’
The Group has adopted the following amendments and interpretations: 
• IAS 27 (revised 2011) ‘Separate Financial Statements’
• IAS 28 (revised 2011) ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’
• Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’
• Improvements to IFRS 2013
• IAS 36 ‘Recoverable amount disclosures for Non Financial Assets’
• Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’ 
The new standards, amendments and interpretations adopted have not had a significant impact on the financial statements.
 
e) New IFRS and amendments to IAS and interpretations
There are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are effective 
for financial statements after this reporting period but have not yet been endorsed by the European Union. The following have not 
been adopted early by the Group:
Effective for 
accounting  
periods starting  
on or after
IFRS 14 ‘Regulatory Deferral Accounts’ 1 January 2016
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 ‘Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception’ 1 January 2016
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 28 ‘Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation’ 1 January 2016
Amendments to IFRS 11 ‘Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations’ 1 January 2016
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 1 January 2017
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ 1 January 2018
   
The application of these standards and interpretations is not anticipated to have a material effect on the Group’s financial statements.
f) Going concern
The risks noted in the Strategic Report are those known to the Directors at the date of this Report which the Directors consider 
to be material to the Group, but these do not necessarily comprise all the risks to which the Group is exposed. In particular, the 
Group’s performance could be adversely affected by poor economic conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties currently 
unknown to the Directors, or which the Directors currently believe are immaterial, may also have a material adverse effect on the 
business, financial condition or prospects of the Group.
In July 2011, the Group negotiated an unsecured bank facility of £120m for a period of 5 years. A new facility is expected to 
be negotiated in the near future, in advance of the facility ending in July 2016. At the period end, the Group had net cash of 
£147m and during the year to 27 March 2015, the Group did not draw on this facility. In addition, the Group complied with all its 
covenants during the year. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of possible changes in trading performance 
and considering the risks identified, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its bank facility. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Group and Company financial statements. 
  NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Financial Statements

1. General information continued
g) Use of assumptions and estimates
The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income 
and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying 
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
Some of these policies require a high level of judgement and the Directors believe that the most critical accounting policies and 
significant areas of judgement and estimation arise from the accounting for:
• IAS37 ‘Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets’. The Group is party to a number of leases on properties that are 
no longer required for trading. Whilst every effort is made to profitably sub-let these properties, it is not always possible to do 
so. Where a lease is onerous to the Group, a provision is established for the difference between amounts contractually payable 
to the landlord and amounts contractually receivable from the tenant (if any) for the period up until the point it is judged that the 
lease will no longer be onerous. In addition, provisions exist for the expected future dilapidation cost on leasehold properties 
and the expected future costs of removing asbestos from leasehold properties. The Directors believe that their estimates, 
which are based upon the advice of an in-house property department who monitor the UK property market, are appropriate. 
• IAS19 ‘Employee benefits’. Defined benefit schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of an independent 
qualified actuary but significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, 
inflation, investment returns and mortality that underpin their valuations. Sensitivities in relation to key assumptions are 
disclosed in note 19.
• IAS36 ‘Impairment of assets’. In testing for impairment of goodwill and other assets, the Directors have made certain 
assumptions concerning the future development of the business that are consistent with its annual budget and forecast into 
perpetuity. Should these assumptions regarding the discount rate or growth in the profitability be unfounded then it is possible 
that goodwill included in the balance sheet could be impaired. At 27 March 2015, the Directors do not consider that any 
reasonably likely changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the goodwill to become impaired. Sensitivities 
in relation to key assumptions are disclosed in note 11.
• IAS12 ‘Income Taxes’. In applying the Group’s accounting policy in relation to deferred tax, as set out below, the Directors are 
required to make assumptions regarding the Group’s ability to utilise historical tax assets following an assessment of the likely 
quantum and timing of future taxable profits. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that the Directors are confident 
that the Group’s future profits will utilise historical tax assets.
 
2. Accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
Group financial statements. 
Intangible assets
a) Business combinations and goodwill
Subject to the transitional relief in IFRS 1, all business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill 
represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 April 
2006, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired. Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of 
whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is capitalised and is subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that its carrying value 
may not be recoverable.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Financial Statements
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
65
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
• the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement. Costs related to the 
acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred. Any contingent 
consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is 
not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
b) Other intangibles
Customer relationships and know-how are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over 5 years and charged to 
administrative expenses.
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised when goods are received by the customer and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to them. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods net 
of discounts, volume rebates and value added tax. Discounts are accounted for in the period they are earned. Provision is made 
for expected customer returns.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales represents all costs incurred up to the point of sale including the operating expenses of the trading outlets.
Employee benefits
a) Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement  
as incurred.
b) Defined benefit plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit 
that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its 
present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet 
date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Group’s obligations. The defined benefit 
obligation calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses were recognised as at 1 April 2006, the date of transition to Adopted IFRSs. In respect of actuarial 
gains and losses that arise subsequent to 1 April 2006 the Group recognises them in the period they occur directly in other 
comprehensive income.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any future refunds 
from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Under IAS 19 (2011), the Group determines the net interest expense/(income) for the period on the net defined benefit liability/
asset by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the net defined 
benefit liability/asset at the beginning of the period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability/asset during 
the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. 
c) Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed as the related service is provided. An accrual is recognised for the amount 
expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Financial Statements

2. Accounting policies continued
Financial instruments
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: 
(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets 
or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and 
(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Company’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so 
classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up 
share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares. 
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments associated 
with financial instruments that are classified in equity are treated as distributions and are recorded directly in equity.
 
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, available for sale financial assets, cash and cash 
equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
a) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
b) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method.
c) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and deposits repayable on demand. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on 
demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
d) Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest bearing borrowings are recognised in the balance sheet at amortised cost. Costs associated with extending the bank 
facility have been recognised in the income statement. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the 
period in which they are incurred.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at 
that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of 
the transaction.
Guarantees
Third party property guarantees are initially recognised as a financial liability under IAS 37 ’Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets’. These are measured and recognised at fair value. These property guarantees are included within ‘Provisions’ 
on the balance sheet. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Financial Statements
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
67
Impairment 
The carrying values of the Group’s assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet 
date to determine whether there is any impairment. In performing the impairment reviews, the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount and is 
recognised in the income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on either the weighted average principle or 
the replacement cost and includes certain warehousing and distribution costs incurred in bringing the inventory to their existing 
location less supplier volume rebates. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of disposal.
Investment in joint ventures
The Group conducts its joint venture arrangements through jointly controlled entities and accounts for them using the equity 
method of accounting. The Group records its share of the joint controlled entities’ post tax profit or loss within the income 
statement and its share of the net assets within investments. Where the Group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, 
unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture.
Leases
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
lease. Where a lease has a minimum fixed increase, the total minimum lease payments are spread over the lease term. The total 
amount payable over the life of the lease remains unchanged but the timing of the income statement charge relative to the lease 
payments change. The excess of the rent charged over the cash payment in any period will be held on the balance sheet within 
‘Accruals and deferred income’.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Net financing costs
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
Operating segments
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires that segments should be reported on the same basis as the internal reporting information 
that is provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’). The CODM has been identified as the CEO. In accordance with 
IFRS 8, the Group may aggregate operating segments into one reportable segment to the extent that the criteria for aggregation 
in IFRS 8 are met. These criteria include consideration of whether the operating segments have similar economic characteristics; 
similar nature of products and services; similar type or class of customers; similar methods used to distribute products or provide 
services; and similar regulatory environments.
The CODM receives turnover information analysed in a number of different ways (for example by customer and product types, 
by delivery channels and between Booker Wholesale, Booker Direct, Chef Direct, Classic Drinks, Ritter-Courivaud and Makro). 
However, none of these ‘possible’ segments have a unique management structure, products share the same supply chain and 
distribution channels, and there are a large amount of supplier rebates, expenses and assets/(liabilities) that are not specific. It is 
therefore not possible to analyse, and the CODM does not receive, information in respect of profitability or balance sheets in the 
same way in which turnover is analysed. Internal reports reviewed regularly by the CODM focus on the operations of the Group 
as a whole and report the results and financial position on an IFRS basis. 
As a result, the Group has not disclosed discrete financial information about any of the ‘possible segments’, which in any event 
would meet the criteria for aggregation under IFRS 8, separately in these financial statements.  NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

2. Accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Where parts of an 
item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant 
and equipment. Labour and associated costs that have been incurred specifically on the ‘Extra’ business centre conversions 
have been capitalised in leasehold improvements and are being depreciated over the lesser of 10 years or the number of years 
remaining on the lease.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as 
finance leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately 
from that of the buildings. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their 
fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of 
property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
• Freehold buildings   30 years
• Leasehold improvements   lesser of the unexpired term of the lease and 50 years
• Plant and equipment   3–20 years
• Motor vehicles    4 years
Freehold land is not depreciated. 
Depreciation expense is primarily charged in cost of sales with an immaterial amount in administrative expenses.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected, risk adjusted, future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Share based payments
The Group has issued equity settled share based payments to certain employees in exchange for services rendered by them. The 
fair value is measured using an option valuation model at the date of grant and is recognised as an employee expense over the 
period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options, with a corresponding increase in equity, shown in 
a separate share option reserve. This valuation is based on estimates of the number of options that will eventually vest, taking into 
account service conditions and market performance.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
Supplier rebates
A number of different types of rebate are negotiated with suppliers in connection with the purchase of goods for resale. Such rebates 
are only recognised when earned by the Group, which occurs when all obligations conditional for earning the rebate have been 
discharged, and the rebate can be measured reliably based on the terms of the contract. These rebates are recognised as a credit 
within cost of sales and, to the extent that the rebate relates to unsold stock purchases, as a reduction in the cost of inventory.
There are two main types of supplier rebates:
a)  Terms, which are generally annual agreements (not always coterminous with the Group’s year end), are signed by the Group 
and the supplier. Rebates are determined relative to volumes purchased or by other conditional arrangements as follows:
• Volume based rebates include overriders, advertising allowances and targeted income. Rebates are accrued based on the 
Group’s purchasing volumes and the current agreement with the supplier. Amounts are recognised once confirmation of 
agreement to that rebate has been received from the supplier.
• Non-volume based rebates include marketing support, range promotion and product development. Amounts are recognised 
when the rebate is earned through the completion of any required obligations and confirmed by suppliers.
Invoices are issued to suppliers periodically, quarterly or annually, depending on the terms of the agreement. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Financial Statements
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
69
b)  Promotional funding, which relates to price investments by suppliers through promotional activity. The calculation of funding 
is mechanical and based on a formula agreed in advance of each promotion with the supplier. Funding is recognised in the 
Income Statement as units are sold and is invoiced throughout the year, shortly after each promotion has ended.
Amounts relating to supplier rebates appear in a number of different balance sheet headings at the year end:
• Inventories: Where the rebate earned relates to inventories which are held by the Group at year end, the rebates are deducted 
from the cost of those inventories.
• Trade receivables: Billed supplier rebates outstanding at the period end where the Group has no legal right to offset against 
trade payables.
• Trade payables: Billed supplier rebates outstanding when the Group has a legal right to offset against payables.
• Prepayments and accrued income: amounts due from suppliers in relation to supplier rebates which has been recognised but 
not yet invoiced.
• Accruals and deferred income: amounts received in relation to supplier rebates that have not been earned at the year end.
Taxation
Tax expense included in the Income Statement comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity, or to the extent it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised 
in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets (excluding goodwill) and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent 
that, following an assessment of the quantum and timing of future taxable profits, it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and the amount which is recognised is increased 
or reduced to the extent that it is then probable or no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part 
of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when they relate to income taxes levied 
by the same tax jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
 
3. Segmental reporting
The Group has considered the principles of IFRS 8 as well as its internal reporting, management and operating structure. The 
Directors’ conclusion is that the Group has a single reportable segment, that of wholesaling activities.
Other than the operation in India (which is immaterial), all of the Group’s revenue originates from the UK. The functional currency 
of the Indian operation is Rupees.
The Group has no significant reliance on any individual customers. NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012 respectively. Further reductions to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and 
20% (effective from 1 April 2015) were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. 
This will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly and the deferred tax assets/liabilities at 27 March 2015 have 
been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
8. Earnings per share
a) Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to the owners of the Group by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
2015 2014
Profit for the period attributable to the owners of the Group (£m) 117.7 105.2
Weighted average number of shares (m) 1,748.1 1,735.9
Basic earnings per share (pence) 6.73p 6.06p
b) Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted by dilutive outstanding 
share options and dilutive shares issuable under the Group’s share plans. The number of shares included in the diluted EPS in 
relation to the SAYE and the share option schemes has been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 ‘Earnings per Share’.

9. Business combination
In July 2012, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Makro Holding Limited which had two subsidiaries: Makro Properties 
Limited and Makro Self Service Wholesalers Limited (‘Makro’). The transaction was subject to Competition Commission approval. 
Full clearance to the acquisition of Makro was received on 19 April 2013 and Makro was consolidated from this date, being the 
date that control passed to the Group.
Through Booker and Makro coming together, the Group seeks to become the UK’s leading wholesaler to caterers, retailers and 
small businesses by:
• combining the best ranges from Makro and Booker to improve overall choice;
• consolidating buying volumes to improve prices for customers;
• improving service due to an increased capacity for delivery; and
• improving availability by integrating the supply chain.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities as at 19 April 2013:

Net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities 131.5 24.6 156.1
Gain on bargain purchase (included in exceptional items) 11.2
Total consideration 144.9
The fair value adjustments made on acquisition have had the effect of:
• increasing the property valuations;
• providing for onerous contracts; and
• recognising a deferred tax asset in relation to accelerated capital allowances.
The fair value of the consideration is based upon the fair value of the investment held in Makro prior to the date of consolidation. 
The investment was measured at fair value in accordance with IAS39 as it was an available for sale financial asset. The fair value 
was initially determined by reference to the consideration transferred as set out below at completion, and the subsequent fair 
value was considered to be unchanged at both 29 March 2013 and 19 April 2013 and therefore there was no valuation gain or 
loss recorded in comprehensive income. The subsequent investment fair value was measured by reference to the performance 
of Makro compared to expectations and the underlying market value of the assets of the business, predominantly properties.
Consideration for purchase of investment comprised of: £m
Issue of 156,621,525 new ordinary shares – determined by reference to the share price of Booker Group plc at 
the date of completion, taking into account a discount to reflect the restrictions preventing the shares from being 
sold for one year after the date of completion 124.2
Cash consideration 15.8
Cash paid to reflect a targeted cash and working capital position as at 30 June 2012 4.9
144.9
The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired was higher than the fair value of consideration paid, resulting in a ‘gain on bargain 
purchase’ of £11.2m, which was included in exceptional items. The Directors considered whether this indicated inappropriate fair 
values underlying the acquisition accounting and concluded that all the fair values were reasonable.
In accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, the hindsight adjustment period for the acquisition of Makro Holding Limited 
and its subsidiaries ended on 19 April 2014. There have been no further changes to the fair value of the consideration or the net 
assets acquired. NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

During the period, the Group paid £1m, with a further £1m of contingent consideration payable, in accordance with the procurement 
agreement with Provenance Too Limited which holds the intellectual property in Provenance Limited. Provenance Too Limited has 
no other assets or liabilities and the entire consideration has been classified as know-how, since the Group has acquired expertise 
in the sourcing and supply of ‘Fruit and vegetables’.
Goodwill arose in the Group from the following:
• the acquisition of the Big Food Group Limited by Giant Topco Limited in 2005; and
• the acquisition of Ritter-Courivaud Limited in 2010.
Under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, the Group is required to test its fixed assets for impairment at least annually, or more 
frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Impairment reviews compare the carrying value of goodwill, other intangible fixed 
assets and tangible fixed assets contained in each cash generating unit (‘CGU’) with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is considered to be its value in use, calculated by reference to the pre tax cash flow 
projections of each CGU based on the Group’s approved budget for 2016 and plan for 2017. Cash flows beyond this period are 
extrapolated into perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2% (2014: 2%), being the Directors’ estimated view of the long term 
compound growth in the economy. This is considered appropriate because the CGU is considered to be a long term business. 
The discount rate used reflects the market assumptions for the risk free rate and equity risk premium and also takes into account 
the cost of debt.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based include the level of sales, gross margin and expenses within 
the business and have been set by the Directors based on their past experience of the business and its industry together with 
their expectations of the market. The level of sales depends upon the size of the markets in which the Group operates together 
with the Directors’ estimations of its market share and competitive pressures. Gross margin is dependent upon the net costs to 
the business of purchasing products together with the level of supplier rebates and income to support sales activities. Expenses 
are based on the current cost base of the Group adjusted for variable costs and known plans for the business.  NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

11. Intangible assets continued 
The Directors believe that three CGUs exist within the Group:
a) Ritter (intangible assets of £12.5m and tangible assets of £0.8m)
A pre tax discount rate of 9.7% (2014: 10.4%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions. With all other assumptions 
held constant, neither a 10% increase in the pre tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 10% into perpetuity, would require 
an impairment to be made.
b) Makro (tangible assets of £130.3m)
A pre tax discount rate of 9.7% (2014: 10.4%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions. With all other assumptions 
held constant, neither a 5% increase in the pre tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 5% into perpetuity, would require an 
impairment to be made.
c) Remaining business (intangible assets of £427.3m and tangible assets of £75.5m)
A pre tax discount rate of 9.7% (2014: 10.5%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions. With all other assumptions 
held constant, neither a 10% increase in the pre tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 10% into perpetuity, would require 
an impairment to be made.
The Directors believe that the assumptions on which the carrying value of intangible and tangible fixed assets is supported are 
reasonable and that no impairment to fixed assets is required.

In July 2012, the Group acquired Makro Holding Limited from Metro AG in exchange for 156,621,525 new ordinary shares and 
a cash consideration of £15.8m. Makro Holding Limited had two subsidiaries; Makro Properties Limited and Makro Self Service 
Wholesalers Limited.
This was held as an investment at 29 March 2013, while the transaction was subject to Competition Commission approval and, 
whilst this process was in progress, the Group was required to hold Makro separate from the rest of Booker in accordance with 
undertakings given to the competition authorities in the normal way. As a result, the Group had neither control nor significant 
influence over Makro at the 2013 year end, and therefore it did not meet the requirements for consolidation as set out in IFRS3 
(revised) ‘Business Combinations’ and IAS27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’. In accordance with IAS39 
‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, the investment was initially held as an available for sale financial asset. 
Full clearance to the transaction was received by the Competition Commission on 19 April 2013 and Makro was consolidated 
from this date, being the date that control passed to the Group.

Loans and other receivables represent amounts receivable from the sale of goods, together with amounts due from supplier 
rebates (see note 16) and are initially measured at fair value and then subsequently held at amortised cost.
Fair value of property guarantees have been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and 
maturity and risk of each guarantee crystallising. NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value, into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique 
used to determine fair value:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Liquidity risk
The Group will finance operations and growth from existing cash resources, finance leases and committed borrowing facilities 
to ensure the constant availability of an appropriate amount of reasonably priced funding to meet both current and future 
forecast requirements.
 
In July 2011, the Group negotiated an unsecured bank facility of £120m for a period of 5 years. The revolving credit facility bears 
floating interest rates linked to LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25%. In the event of default of covenants on the bank facility, any drawn 
facility and any interest accrued are repayable on demand.

It is not possible to quantify the timing of the cash flows relating to the property guarantees.
The undiscounted cash flows for borrowings differ from their carrying value in the balance sheet due to the inclusion of contractual 
interest payments and the adjustment for non cash items including unamortised borrowing costs. The undiscounted cash flows 
for financial instruments reflect the amounts payable on these instruments which differs from the fair value recorded on the 
balance sheet. There is no difference between the discounted and undiscounted cash flows associated with trade payables due 
to their short term nature. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Financial Statements
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
81
Credit risk
The Group is predominantly a cash sales business with low levels of trade receivables in comparison to total sales for the year and 
has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers. It is the Group’s policy that 
all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. The Group has an accounting policy 
to provide for certain overdue trade receivables based on past experience, and believe that there are no significant unprovided 
overdue financial assets.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is relatively small to the Group, as there are no fixed borrowings and the revolving credit facility is only partially 
drawn for a small part of the year. Therefore the Group has chosen not to hedge its borrowings. 
 
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders; and
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it 
in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In assessing the level of capital 
all components of equity are taken into account (i.e. share capital and retained earnings). The Group has £147.0m of net cash as 
at 27 March 2015 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. Management of capital therefore focuses around 
its ability to generate cash from its operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds. The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for 
managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to 
shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
Foreign currency risk
Less than 1% of purchases are denominated in foreign currencies.
The majority of sales are denominated in sterling, with the exception of sales made from the Group’s Indian operation which are 
denominated in rupees.
The Directors do not consider that the Group has significant exposure to movements in foreign exchange and the Group does 
not hold any foreign exchange contracts. NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

19. Post employment benefits
The Group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements, covering both funded defined benefit and funded 
defined contribution schemes to provide benefits to both full-time and part-time employees. 
Defined contribution schemes
Pension contributions of £5.3m (2014: £5.0m) were charged to defined contribution schemes in the period. Included within 
accruals is £0.4m (2014: £0.4m) of outstanding pension contributions.
Defined benefit schemes
The Booker Pension Scheme (‘the Scheme’) is a funded pension arrangement based on final salary and was closed to new 
entrants in 2001 with benefits ceasing to accrue from 2002. However, active members’ benefits retain a link to their final salaries. 
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group and are invested by independent fund managers appointed 
by the Trustees. 
The benefit obligations as at 27 March 2015 have been calculated by an independent actuary on an IAS 19 basis using the results 
of the 31 March 2013 triennial actuarial valuation which has then been updated to 27 March 2015. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method.
(a) Major assumptions used by the actuary
 2015 2014
Discount rate 3.40% 4.45%
RPI inflation 2.95% 3.20%
CPI inflation 1.95% 2.20%
Rate of increase in salaries 1.95% 3.20%
Pension increases in payment 2.90% 3.15%
For pension increases in payment, the most significant assumption is for increases which are linked to RPI inflation capped at 6% 
each year. This assumption is disclosed in the table above.
The average life expectancy in years of a member is as follows:
 2015 2014
Aged 65 retiring immediately (current pensioner) Male 21.5 21.5
Female 23.7 23.7
Aged 40 retiring at 65 (future pensioner) Male 22.7 22.7
Female 25.1 25.1
At 27 March 2015, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is approximately 16 years.

The bid value of the assets was provided by each of the various fund managers in which the Scheme is invested. All scheme assets 
have quoted prices. Based on the Scheme’s current liability and membership profile, as well as the Company’s objectives, the 
Trustee has chosen to retain a strategic allocation of approximately 48% to growth assets and 52% to matching assets until 2028. 
The Scheme does not hold any of the Group’s financial instruments or property as plan assets.

Defined benefit schemes continued
(g) Sensitivities
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are the discount rate, RPI inflation, pension 
increases, and life expectancy. The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the 
reporting period of reasonably possible changes in these assumptions, which have been determined in isolation whilst holding 
all other assumptions constant:
Life expectancy for current and future pensioners +/- 1 year  Increase/decrease in liabilities by £22m
Discount rate     +/- 0.1%  Decrease/increase in liabilities by £10m
RPI inflation rate     +/- 0.1%  Increase/decrease in liabilities by £8m
Pension increases in payment   +/- 0.1%  Increase/decrease in liabilities by £5m
Changes in RPI inflation impact pension increases both before retirement and in payment.
(h) Contributions to be paid
The Trustees have completed their 31 March 2013 triennial valuation of the Scheme, at which time they assessed the funding 
position to be a shortfall of approximately £24m. This shortfall was expected to be recovered through Company deficit 
contributions (£9.6m paid into the Scheme in the year ending 31 March 2014 and £2.4m paid into the Scheme in the year ending 
31 March 2015) and the returns achievable on the assets of the Scheme.
No further contributions to the Scheme are expected to be made until the funding position is reviewed following the next actuarial 
valuation of Scheme, which is scheduled for 31 March 2016.

• the expected future dilapidation cost on leasehold properties; and
• the expected future costs of removing asbestos from leasehold properties. Although not a health risk, the Group is legally 
required to undertake a programme of removal.
Property provisions are discounted at 7.0% (2014: 7.0%), being the long term expected yield for the Group’s leased properties and 
are expected to be utilised over the terms of the leases, with approximately £3.0m expected to be utilised in the year to March 2016.
Other provisions relate to third party property guarantees, for which the timing and quantum of payments is uncertain. Payment 
could be made on demand and the provision represents management’s current estimate of the future liability. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Financial Statements

during the year. 
22. Share capital and reserves
For movements in share capital and reserves please refer to the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The merger reserve represents the capital adjustment required to reserves to effect the reverse acquisition.
The capital redemption reserve relates to the redemption of B shares, as described in note 23.
The other reserve represents the premium over the nominal value of the shares issued in relation to acquisitions less any returns 
of capital.
The share option reserve comprises the fair value of outstanding share options charged to the profit and loss account.

The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 3.14 pence per share, which will absorb £55m of distributable reserves. Subject 
to shareholder approval at the AGM, to be held on 8 July 2015, the dividend will be paid on 10 July 2015 to shareholders on the 
register at 12 June 2015. The shares will go ex-dividend on 11 June 2015. 
Return of Capital
On 21 July 2014 the Company issued 1,743,934,763 B shares that were redeemable by the shareholder.
On 22 July 2014 the Company redeemed 1,740,934,613 B shares for 3.5 pence per share (a total of £60.9m) and the shares 
were cancelled.
The 3,000,150 remaining B shares (a total of £0.1m) have been classified as a financial liability in accruals and deferred income, 
and were redeemed on 30 April 2015 for 3.5 pence per share. Following the redemption, such B shares were cancelled.
The Board is proposing to implement another capital return to shareholders of 3.50 pence per ordinary share (at a cost of 
approximately £62m, based on the current issued share capital of the company). It is proposed that this is achieved by the issue of a 
new class of ‘B’ shares. The return of capital requires the approval of shareholders, which will be sought at the AGM on 8 July 2015.  NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

24. Share based payments
The Group has a number of share schemes for employees. The total charge for the period relating to employee share-based 
payments was £5.3m (2014: £4.3m), all of which related to equity-settled share based payment transactions.
a) Sharesave schemes
The Sharesave scheme has been in operation since 2008 and all employees are eligible to participate once the necessary service 
requirements have been met. Options are offered at a discount of 20% to the average of the market value of a share on the 
three dealing days immediately preceding the offer. Options are exercisable three years after the commencement of the savings 
contract and not more than six months thereafter. The options granted have been fair valued using the Black Scholes option 
pricing model, using the following assumptions:

b) Performance Share Plans (PSP)
In 2008 a discretionary PSP for the benefit of certain employees was established by the Remuneration Committee. The awards are 
free share-based awards and normally vest three years after the grant date, provided relevant performance criteria have been met.
PSP 2012, 2013 and 2014
The options granted in November 2012 (6.0 million options), October 2013 (4.2 million options) and October 2014 ( 6.9 million 
options) to senior employees all had the same conditions. They will vest and become exercisable three years from the date of the 
award subject to continued employment and the performance conditions mentioned below being satisfied and will lapse if not 
exercised within ten years of the date of award. The awards are granted in two tranches:
i) Earnings Per Share (EPS) condition 
50% of each award will be linked to an absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving growth of 
6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as measured at the year end 
prior to the grant and then 3 years later.
ii) Total Shareholder Return (TSR) condition
50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute TSR performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving growth 
of 8% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 3 
years from the grant date.
 
PSP 2011
The awards under the PSP 2011 have vested and 4.2 million remain to be exercised.
PSP 2010 (a)
The awards under the PSP 2010 (a) have vested and 5.2 million remain to be exercised.
PSP 2010 (b)
In connection with his appointment to the board, Guy Farrant was granted a special performance share award (in the form of a 
nil-cost option) over 3.9 million shares. The award has now vested and 2.5 million remain to be exercised.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’). The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing 
with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting its 
own profit and loss account.
The Company has taken the exemption in FRS1 (5a) and consequently no cash flow is presented for the Company.
Guarantees
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, 
the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats 
the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make 
a payment under the guarantee.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value. The carrying values of investments are reviewed for 
impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Share based payments
The Company has issued equity settled share based payments to employees of a subsidiary. The fair value is measured using 
an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. This fair value is 
accounted as an investment in the subsidiary with a corresponding increase in equity.
2. Profit and loss account
In accordance with the exemption permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the 
Company is not presented separately. The profit recognised for the 52 weeks ended 27 March 2015 was £150.0m (52 weeks 
ended 28 March 2014: profit £119.9m).
 
The audit fee of £0.1m (2014: £0.1m) for the current and prior period was borne by another group undertaking without recharge.

The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 3.14 pence per share, which will absorb £55m of distributable reserves. Subject 
to shareholder approval at the AGM, to be held on 8 July 2015, the dividend will be paid on 10 July 2014 to shareholders on the 
register at 12 June 2015. The shares will go ex-dividend on 11 June 2015. 
Return of Capital
On 21 July 2014 the Company issued 1,743,934,763 B shares that were redeemable by the shareholder.
On 22 July 2014 the Company redeemed 1,740,934,613 B shares for 3.5 pence per share (a total of £60.9m) and the shares 
were cancelled.
The 3,000,150 remaining B shares (a total of £0.1m) have been classified as a financial liability in accruals and deferred income, 
and were redeemed on 30 April 2015 for 3.5 pence per share. Following the redemption, such B shares were cancelled.
The Board is proposing to implement another capital return to shareholders of 3.50 pence per ordinary share (at a cost of 
approximately £62m, based on the current issued share capital of the company). It is proposed that this is achieved by the issue 
of a new class of ‘B’ shares. The return of capital requires the approval of shareholders, which will be sought at the AGM on 8 July 
2015.

HIGH-IMPACT AFRICAN DRILLING CAMPAIGN
January 2014 saw the beginning of our highly prospective 
African drilling campaign, as the Cap Juby well spudded  
in Morocco. The Noble Paul Romano rig, which has been 
contracted to Genel Energy for two years, will shortly begin 
drilling offshore Malta, before moving on to drill in Morocco.  
All of the wells in our portfolio offer the potential for 
substantial finds.
In total, the African portfolio comprises gross unrisked 
prospective resources of 5.5 bnboe. We will continue to 
carefully screen new opportunities to enhance our resource 
hopper in line with our stated strategy of securing high-quality 
exploration opportunities targeting material resources.
Existing operating cash flows fund our development and 
exploration programme in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq,  
where exploration and appraisal continues to target  
significant resources with the potential to further bolster  
our world-class finds. 2014 will see wells drilled on the  
Taq Taq, Tawke, Chia Surkh and Ber Bahr licences.

CONTINUING SUCCESS IN THE KRI
During the first half of 2013 Genel Energy announced a  
number of material exploration successes in the KRI. All  
three exploration wells we drilled were successful, with oil  
and gas discovered on the Chia Surkh field and discoveries  
made at both Ber Bahr and Tawke Deep. 
The Tawke Deep well was drilled to a depth of 4,775 metres  
and in one test flowed 1,500 bopd of 26-28 degree API crude  
oil from an Upper Jurassic reservoir 200 metres below the 
producing Cretaceous reservoir in the field. This result,  
and continued appraisal and development drilling success,  
bodes well for future reserves growth.
Bina Bawi also delivered significant exploration and  
appraisal success in 2013. A Competent Persons Report 
commissioned from RPS Energy confirmed Bina Bawi as  
a major gas discovery, with the gross mean gas resource 
associated with the field at 4.9 tcf.

DEVELOPING WORLD-CLASS KRI OIL ASSETS
Our world-class Taq Taq and Tawke fields have combined  
gross proven, probable and possible reserves of over 1.8 bnboe. 
Work will continue across our KRI assets in order to convert 
discoveries into revenue generating, stable production.
TRANSFORMATIONAL KRI GAS BUSINESS
Appraisal success at Bina Bawi and Miran has created a 
transformational gas business, with an estimated 8.4 tcf of gross 
mean contingent resource. The close relationship between the 
Kurdistan Regional Government and the Turkish government  
led to a Gas Sales Agreement being signed from which we are 
uniquely placed to benefit, leveraging our Turkish heritage.
The GSA, governing the export of natural gas from the KRI  
to Turkey, calls for an initial 4 bcma of gas exports from 2017, 
rising to 10 bcma by 2020 and 20 bcma by the middle of the 
next decade, giving Genel Energy access to one of the world’s 
largest and fastest growing gas markets and positioning Miran 
and Bina Bawi as anchor suppliers to Turkey. This is a very 
significant milestone in the commercialisation of Genel 
Energy’s gas resources. 
Discussions with the KRG have already commenced with the 
objective of finalising a Gas Sales Offtake Agreement for the 
Miran field in the second half of 2014. In parallel, we continue 
to screen a number of development concepts, incorporating 
both domestic and export supply options.

COMPLETION OF THE KRI- TURKEY OIL PIPELINE
During the fourth quarter of 2013, the final phase of the  
KRI independent export pipeline infrastructure from Dohuk  
to Fishkabur was completed and tied-in to the Iraq-Turkey 
pipeline via a new metering station within the KRI. 
Commissioning of the system is ongoing and is expected  
to continue through the first half of 2014.
The pipeline, once fully operational, will enable a significant 
increase in our international exports, which were limited in 
2013 due to a reliance on trucking oil from Taq Taq. It also 
delivers lower transit risk and greater access to international 
pricing. The opening of the pipeline will allow volumes exported 
via Turkey to keep pace with our production growth.
At Taq Taq, construction of the second central processing 
facility is progressing and, once complete in the fourth quarter of 
2014, will boost processing capacity to 200,000 bopd. Similarly, 
at Tawke work is planned to raise the capacity of facilities from 
100,000 bopd to 200,000 bopd by the end of 2014.

OUR RESPONSIBLE APPROACH
Supporting and sustaining the communities in which we operate 
is fundamental to Genel Energy’s success and our commitment  
to being a sustainable business. 
We are committed to conducting operations in an ethical manner 
that embraces safety, responsible environmental management, 
and the development of positive and enduring relationships with 
the people and communities in those areas in which we operate. 
Our operations are supported by an extensive community 
investment programme which aims to improve the lives of the 
communities with whom we work.
OUR MARKETS
The signing of an energy agreement between the Turkish 
government and the Kurdistan Regional Government in 
November 2013 helped to solidify the increasingly close 
relationship between the KRG and Turkey, and clarified the  
route to market for our world-class oil and gas resources. 
The Iraq-Turkey pipeline is currently being commissioned, and  
the Gas Sales Agreement illustrates a clear path to export for  
our internationally significant Miran and Bina Bawi gas resources. 
With a leading resource position, our strong track record in the 
KRI and our Turkish roots, Genel Energy is uniquely positioned  
to convert this resource base into a very valuable, material new 
business. Turkish growth in gas demand has averaged 10% a year 
over the last 10 years – the highest of any country in Europe and 
Eurasia. Miran and Bina Bawi are set to provide this huge market 
with 20% of its total gas need. 
OUR BUSINESS
We explore for, develop and produce oil and gas, focusing on areas 
where we can achieve material positions in world-class assets.
OUR STRATEGY
We aim to maximise the potential from our existing assets in  
the Kurdistan Region of Iraq on a broadly cash flow neutral  
basis, building a high-impact exploration portfolio and creating 
significant value with the drill bit. While maintaining the highest 
level of corporate governance, we retain a clear focus on 
maximising shareholder returns through monetising at all points  
in the exploration, development and production cycle – with the 
potential of returning any excess cash to shareholders. In so doing 
our objective is to build a world-class independent E&P company.
OUR MANAGEMENT
We have a top-quality management team with the operational and 
technical capability to deliver our strategy, from the identification 
of new geographies to increasing production capacity.
GOVERNANCE
We operate our business to the highest standards of corporate 
governance, in full compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We seek the best possible performance in this area and 
continually review our approach.
RISK
We work to manage and appropriately mitigate the risks within 
our control, ensuring we have a deep understanding of the 
countries and regions in which we operate.
REMUNERATION
We have a strong, independent Remuneration Committee  
to ensure that we meet the high standards we have set for 
ourselves. The executive management team is provided with 
appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance  
and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their 
individual contributions to the success of Genel Energy.
OUR REACH
We have material positions in four world-class fields in the 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq, where we are the largest independent  
oil producer and largest holder of gas resources, and have 
assembled a high-impact African exploration portfolio.
We have significant positions across Africa, with a portfolio  
of exploration assets in Morocco, Malta, Somaliland, Ethiopia  
and Côte d’Ivoire. A multi-well drilling programme on these  
assets is now underway, targeting world-class finds.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I AM PLEASED TO WELCOME YOU TO GENEL ENERGY’S THIRD ANNUAL REPORT , 
DETAILING WHAT HAS BEEN A LANDMARK YEAR IN OUR GOAL OF BECOMING  
A MAJOR INDEPENDENT E&P COMPANY . WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH 
IN THE BUSINESS IN 2013, UNLOCKING VALUE IN OUR ASSETS AND BOOSTING 
OUR OPERATING CAPABILITIES, WHILE NEVER LOSING OUR FOCUS ON 
MAINTAINING THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
AND OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE. 15
www.genelenergy.com
STRATEGIC REPORT
UNLOCKING V ALUE
2013 was an important year for Genel 
Energy. Positive political momentum in  
the Kurdistan Region of Iraq has continued  
to build, and as we move into 2014 we  
do so with the prospect of sustainable 
pipeline exports to international markets 
bringing in predictable revenues at 
international prices. As an Anglo-Turkish 
company with the leading asset position  
in the KRI, we are well positioned to 
capitalise on the solidifying relationship 
between Turkey and the KRI, providing  
a more stable operating environment –  
as evidenced by the signing of long-term 
energy supply agreements between the 
two governments. 
The landmark Turkey-KRG Energy 
Agreement confirms that natural 
resources from Kurdistan will help provide 
energy hungry Turkey with the significant 
resources required to meet its energy 
needs. Turkey will take an initial 4 bcma  
of gas from the KRI, rising to 10 bcma, and 
potentially 20 bcma by the middle of the 
next decade. Over time, our Miran and 
Bina Bawi assets are set to meet 20%  
of Turkey’s gas requirements, in turn 
unlocking value for our shareholders.
As political developments in the KRI  
help to confirm the route to long-term 
monetisation of our KRI reserves, in 
parallel we are now looking to unlock  
value from our African assets. As I write, 
exploration is under way in Morocco,  
and the Noble Paul Romano rig is set to 
begin an exciting two year exploration 
campaign with a well offshore Malta. Each 
well of the campaign has the potential to 
create material shareholder value.
BUILDING A MAJOR EXPLORATION  
AND PRODUCTION COMPANY
The growth of our business reflects the 
KRI’s rapid emergence as not just a major 
oil producing region, but also as a very 
significant gas province. The completion  
of the Miran transaction in January 2013 
gave us operatorship of the field, an asset 
which, when taken together with Bina Bawi, 
provides us with a world-class gas resource. 
As we have done in the KRI oil sector, we 
have established the leading gas resource 
position and we are now well placed to be 
at the forefront of building this into a 
major business in its own right.
Outside the KRI, we continue to construct 
a portfolio of high-impact African assets, 
with four wells set to be drilled in 2014.
As the business continues to move 
forward, we are mindful of growing our 
capabilities in line with our expansion.  
We continue to attract the highest calibre  
of personnel, and I am confident that the 
people we have in place driving Genel 
Energy forward are ideally qualified  
and skilled to help grow us into a  
major E&P force. 
GOVERNANCE AND RISK
A key part of our strategy is looking  
to make material discoveries in areas 
underexplored due to perceived political  
or technical risk. With this risk comes 
challenges, and our chosen areas of 
operation require a deep understanding  
of regional issues. We carefully monitor 
risk across all operations, working with 
regional authorities and local communities 
in order to maintain a strong reputation 
locally while giving the highest priority to 
the safety of our staff and contractors.
We have strong, independent audit  
and remuneration committees to ensure 
that we meet the highest standards of 
corporate governance. More on these, and 
the diversity of our business, is detailed in 
the Governance section of this report.
RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS
The way we do business is just as 
important as the business we do, and  
we measure our success on more than  
just the growth in our operational and 
financial key performance indicators.  
The development of positive and 
enduring relationships with the people  
and communities in the areas in which  
we operate is of key importance to  
Genel Energy. Indeed, positive regional 
relationships are vital to our ongoing 
growth as a business. In September, we 
were proud to launch our first Community 
Engagement and Investment Report.  
This is something on which we will build  
in the future.
CAPITALISING ON OUR OPPORTUNITIES 
Because of the strength of our balance 
sheet and the cash generated through our 
KRI operations, we are well positioned to 
capitalise on the potential of our current 
portfolio. We will continue to evolve our 
capital structure to reflect the future 
financial requirements of the business.
Our extensive exploration programme 
offers the potential for near-term value 
creation, with the stability of our core  
KRI operations providing a bedrock for  
this growth. These are exciting times  
for Genel Energy, and I look forward  
to updating you on your company’s 
further progress.
RODNEY CHASE,

Genel Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
A JOINT STATEMENT FROM THE  
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRESIDENT
2013 HAS BEEN ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL YEAR FOR GENEL ENERGY . WE 
CONTINUED TO DELIVER OUR STRA TEGY AND AGAIN GREW OUR REVENUES  
AND RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, THE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL OF OUR  
WORLD CLASS OIL AND GAS PORTFOLIO HAS BEEN FURTHER CLARIFIED  
BY POSITIVE POLITICAL MOMENTUM IN THE KURDISTAN REGION OF IRAQ. 
BEYOND THE KRI, WE ALSO COMMENCED OUR HIGH-IMPACT AFRICAN 
EXPLORATION DRILLING CAMPAIGN.  17
www.genelenergy.com
STRATEGIC REPORT
DELIVERING ON OUR STRATEGY
Our strategy is composed of four pillars:
• Maintain the highest level of  
corporate governance
• Continue to create value with  
the drill bit
• Maximise the potential of our KRI 
business on a broadly cash flow  
neutral basis
• Maximise shareholder returns by 
monetising at all points in the 
exploration, development and 
production cycle 
In 2013, we continued to take significant 
strides towards reaching our goal of 
building a major independent E&P 
company. Working interest production  
in the year averaged 44,000 bopd and  
for the first time we received payments 
directly for oil exports made by truck 
through Turkey. This was a landmark 
event for both the Kurdistan Region of 
Iraq and Genel Energy, illustrating the 
political advances made between the  
KRI and Turkey over the year.
In line with our strategy, we continued to 
develop further our KRI assets on a cash 
flow neutral basis, enabling us to deploy 
the capital on our balance sheet to expand 
our high-impact exploration portfolio in 
the Middle East and Africa. The strength  
of our balance sheet continues to give  
us a strong competitive advantage, and  
we are leveraging that advantage to 
enable us to create substantial value for 
our shareholders over the short, medium 
and long-term. 
In 2013, appraisal success at Bina Bawi  
and Tawke added material resources. In 
addition, we enjoyed 100% exploration 
success with three out of three wells 
drilled finding resources: a new oil and  
gas discovery was made on the Chia Surkh 
field and there were further discoveries at 
both Ber Bahr and Tawke Deep. In total, 
our activities with the drill bit added over 
270 mmboe of contingent resources. Our 
continuing programme of exploration and 
development, boosted by the significant 
potential in our African assets, provides 
exciting opportunities in 2014.
MOMENTUM IN THE KRI AND  
THE BUSINESS
Positive political developments this  
year between the KRI and Turkey have  
laid a clearer route to market for our 
resources, with operational progress  
on the ground helping us to take 
advantage of this. The signing of an 
Energy Framework Agreement between 
Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional 
Government has further enhanced the 
relationship between the two governments 
and led to the commencement of exports 
of KRI crude oil by truck to Ceyhan, on  
the Mediterranean coast in Turkey. From 
there, the crude is sold by the KRG on the 
international market. This resulted in the 
receipt of our first direct payment for 
Genel Energy oil exports. 
Trucked exports from Taq Taq to 
international markets via Turkey 
commenced in January 2013 and steadily 
increased, with exports on individual  
days towards the end of the year totalling 
some 70,000 bopd. This was a landmark  
event, confirming that oil companies 
operating in the KRI, including Genel 
Energy, can export crude to world  
markets and receive regular payments  
for these barrels. 
The mechanical completion of the  
KRI-Turkey pipeline provides the 
foundation for a further step change  
in Genel Energy’s scale and financial 
strength, and will allow a significant 
increase in our international exports once 
commissioning is complete. By removing 
trucks it will lower transportation cost and 
improve operational efficiency, providing a 
boost to revenue and cash flow. Although 
the pipeline may not reach capacity until 
the second half of the year, production –  
which averaged 44,000 bopd in 2013 – is 
expected to average 60-70,000 boepd in 
2014 due to additional production capacity 
coming onstream, with the infrastructure 
to utilise this increased capacity. 
The strengthening relationship between 
the KRG and their counterparts in Ankara 
is rapidly clarifying the route to market  
for our world-class resources, with the 
pipeline its clearest physical manifestation. 
Two key agreements this year clearly 
illustrate the political progress made in 
2013: the wide-ranging energy agreement 
signed between the KRG and Government 
of Turkey in November, and a Gas Sales 
Agreement governing the export of 
natural gas from the KRI to Turkey –  
of particular importance for Genel Energy 
due to the steps we have taken in building  
a very material world-class gas business. 
The GSA calls for an initial 4 bcma of  
gas exports from 2017, rising to 10 bcma 
by 2020 and potentially 20 bcma by  
the middle of the next decade. This is  
a very significant milestone in the 
commercialisation of our gas resources, 
giving us access to one of the world’s 
largest and fastest growing gas markets 
and positioning Miran and Bina Bawi as 
anchor suppliers to Turkey as the country 
continues to grow its energy requirements.
BUILDING A MAJOR E&P COMPANY
OPERATIONAL PROGRESS
Significant operational progress was  
made on the ground in our KRI acreage. 
Successful exploration and appraisal 
drilling at Bina Bawi, Chia Surkh and  
Ber Bahr added to our contingent 
resources. The first two horizontal  
wells on the Tawke field, Tawke-20 and 
Tawke-23, were brought onstream at  
rates of 25,000 bopd and 32,500 bopd, 
materially exceeding expectations. 
Net working interest production for 2013 
averaged 44,000 bopd, in line with 2012, 
with gross Taq Taq production in 2013 
averaging 77,000 bopd. Over the course of 
the year, exports from Taq Taq averaged 
around 20,000 bopd, with the remainder 
routed to domestic deliveries (including  
the Bazian refinery).
Capacity upgrades are currently being 
progressed at both Taq Taq and Tawke. 
The construction of the second central 
processing facility at Taq Taq is underway 
and is planned for completion and 
commissioning in the fourth quarter of 
2014. This will raise production capacity 
from 120,000 bopd to 200,000 bopd.  
At Tawke, planning is underway to  
double the current processing capacity  
of 100,000 bopd by the end of 2014.
In parallel with the development of our oil 
assets, we continued with the development 
of our major gas resources in the Miran 
and Bina Bawi fields.  18
KRG- TURKEY ENERGY AGREEMENT
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE KURDISTAN REGION OF IRAQ AND TURKEY 
HAS CONTINUED TO DEEPEN, CULMINATING IN THE SIGNING OF THE LANDMARK 
KRG- TURKEY ENERGY AGREEMENT ON 27TH NOVEMBER 2013. 
 
Genel Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
A JOINT STATEMENT FROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER & PRESIDENT 
CONTINUED
A Declaration of Commerciality for the 
Miran field, which we estimate contains 
around 8 tcf of gross recoverable contingent 
and unrisked prospective resources, was 
approved by the Ministry of Natural 
Resources of the KRG in September 2013. 
In February 2014 the KRG exercised their 
right to back into 25% of the Miran 
licence. Discussions with the KRG are now 
underway to finalise a gas sales offtake 
agreement for the Miran field. In parallel, 
we continued to screen a number of 
development concepts, incorporating  
both export and domestic supply options. 
In the KRI, we believe that the domestic  
gas market represents a significant 
opportunity for Genel Energy: the 
combination of growing demand, low  
cost projects and short lead times has  
the potential to deliver attractive returns. 
In recognition of this opportunity, in 
September 2013 with our partners on  
the Dohuk licence, we signed a gas sales 
and purchase agreement with the KRG  
to supply gas from the Summail field to  
a local power station – the first contract  
of its kind in the KRI.
A HIGH-IMPACT DRILLING CAMPAIGN
Having built a highly prospective portfolio 
of assets in Africa, we are excited that 
drilling has now begun. In line with our 
strategy, we have a material position  
in each asset in our portfolio, offering  
us – and our shareholders – a significant 
opportunity. In total, we expect five 
high-impact well results in 2014,  
targeting gross 1.2 bnboe.
This included a Gas Sales Agreement, 
calling for an initial 4 bcma of gas 
exports from 2017, rising thereafter. 
The Miran and Bina Bawi fields  
will deliver the gas supply to 
underpin this agreement, 
making the signature a 
significant milestone in the 
commercialisation of our 
major gas resources.
The most prominent, 
physical manifestation of  
the strength of the KRI-Turkey 
relationship has been the KRI 
export pipeline infrastructure,  
which is now mechanically complete. 
Commissioning of the system is 
ongoing and is expected to continue 
through the first half of 2014. 
The first KRI pipeline oil  
has arrived at Ceyhan  
in Turkey and volumes 
continue to grow in 
storage. Discussions 
between the KRG and 
Baghdad continue in order  
to reach an agreement on oil 
exports and revenue sharing 
from exports through the pipeline.

STRATEGIC REPORT
The first well in the Africa exploration 
programme spudded in early January 2014 
on the Juby Maritime licence offshore 
Morocco, and exploration drilling offshore 
Malta is anticipated to start  around the 
end of the first quarter of 2014. The Maltese 
well, on the Hagar Qim prospect, will be 
the first to utilise the Noble Paul Romano 
deepwater semi-submersible rig, which  
we have secured for a two year period. 
This portfolio contains tremendous 
potential that we will look to build upon  
as we continue to seek acquisitions that  
fit our strict criteria. Each transaction  
that we execute is the result of careful 
screening and a robust internal process. 
Guiding all our decisions is the fact that  
we will not contemplate any transaction  
that could negatively impact the overall  
quality of our world-class portfolio. 
In addition to the exciting prospects in  
our African portfolio, there still remains 
significant potential in our KRI exploration 
portfolio, particularly the Miran Deep and 
Chia Surkh prospects.
GROWING PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY
As our operations expand and progress, 
we are concurrently growing the 
operational and technical capacity of our 
workforce by securing the highest quality 
personnel to drive our business forward. 
Importantly, we have been able to secure 
people with senior-level experience at 
major companies, with a number of new 
senior management hires made in 2013. 
As our exploration campaign ramps  
up in Africa, we have also added to  
the capabilities of our technical team.  
We have created a bespoke drilling team, 
providing us with the means to deliver  
on the potential of this asset base. Our 
subsurface function now has considerable 
relevant experience of the geology and 
regions in which we operate, analysing  
and ascertaining the best locations for  
our drill sites, maximising the potential  
for successful discoveries and creating 
value for shareholders. 
OPERATING SUSTAINABL Y
Supporting and sustaining the communities 
in which we operate is fundamental  
to Genel Energy’s success and our 
commitment to being a sustainable 
business. Our operations in the KRI are 
supported by an extensive community 
investment programme which aims to 
improve the lives of the communities with 
whom we work, working in partnership  
to identify and meet community needs. 
One of our great strengths is our decade-
long legacy of positive engagement with 
local communities in the KRI: over this 
time we have carried out more than 100 
community investment projects focused 
on health, education and cultural activities. 
As we expand our presence in Africa,  
we will be informed by this experience. 
Reflecting our efforts to date, we issued 
our first Community Engagement and 
Investment Report in 2013, providing  
an overview of our past activities and 
plans for the future. It is available to  
read at www.genelenergy.com. In 2015,  
we will expand this report and issue it 
concurrently with our Annual Report.
OUTLOOK 
2013 was a transformational year for 
Genel Energy, with the progress we have 
made across all aspects of our portfolio 
placing us in a very strong position as we 
commence 2014. In the near-term, we will 
see further progress in the development  
of our KRI asset base, with increased oil 
production and export volumes and in the 
development of our world-class gas assets. 
The commencement of drilling on our 
African exploration portfolio heralds  
the start of another exciting phase of 
activity, success at any of our scheduled 
exploration wells in 2014 has the prospect  
of making a positive material impact on 
our already significant reserve and 
resource base.
Looking further ahead, the strength of  
our balance sheet ideally positions us  
to capitalise on any value-accretive 
opportunities that meet our strict criteria. 
Overall, 2014 is set to be another very 
exciting year for Genel Energy.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FINANCIAL STRENGTH
The strength of our balance sheet provides Genel Energy with significant 
flexibility, bringing with it material competitive advantage for a company of  
our size. Our capital expenditure on the exploration, appraisal and development 
programme in the KRI is funded from operating cash flow, while our strong 
balance sheet supports our exciting African drilling campaign. We will continue  
to evolve our capital structure to reflect the future needs of the business, 
ensuring that we run an appropriate balance sheet going forward.
By having the capacity to execute our substantial exploration, development  
and appraisal plans we are able to meet our vision of becoming a major  
E&P company.

TURKISH HERITAGE AND STRONG LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS
Being the only independent Turkish oil and gas company, we are in a unique 
position to benefit from our leading position in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq  
and its proximity to the energy hungry Turkish market. Our heritage also  
plays an important part in assisting us in expanding our footprint across  
our chosen regions of operation. 
Genel Energy has made a direct contribution to the economic development  
and wellbeing of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, benefiting Turkey, the KRI  
and our business.
Strong local relationships are vital across all of our operations, as we  
endeavour to be a partner of choice in the Middle East and Africa.
WORLD-CLASS ASSETS
Although an independent E&P company, the quality of our assets are more 
typically owned by the majors, and we are focused on establishing material 
positions in high-quality resource assets.
This objective is encapsulated in our activity in the KRI, where we are the largest 
producer and the largest holder of reserves. In 2013 we built on our leadership 
position, growing our reserves through a successful exploration campaign, 
including three discoveries. Our high-impact African drilling campaign is now 
underway, with the potential for hugely significant discoveries.
Our experienced subsurface technical team helps to maximise the value of our 
discoveries, while also identifying those exploration prospects that have the 
potential to materially move the dial for Genel Energy.
OPERATING RESPONSIBL Y 
Genel Energy is committed to conducting its operations in an ethical manner that 
embraces safety, responsible environmental management, and the development 
of positive and enduring relationships with the people and communities in the 
areas in which we operate.
Our reputation is built on our business achievements, the way we conduct 
ourselves with our employees and partners, our engagement with our host 
communities and governments, and our approach and record on health, safety 
and the environment. An excellent reputation in all these areas assists us in 
accessing new opportunities and building a sustainable business.
Genel Energy continues to be fully committed to adhering to all aspects of 
governance best practice through a robust and rigorous governance structure 
and world-class Board with extensive business and industry experience. 22
OUR STRATEGY
GENEL ENERGY AIMS TO BUILD A MAJOR REGIONAL E&P COMPANY , IN TURN 
CREATING SIGNIFICANT VALUE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS, THROUGH THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR EXISTING ASSETS IN THE KRI AND AFRICA AND BY 
ACCESSING ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXPANSION VIA LICENCE 
ROUNDS, FARM-INS AND ACQUISITIONS.
OUR STRATEGIC  
PRIORITIES
MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST LEVEL  
OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board believes that effective 
governance is key to operating 
successfully in the global business 
environment. Genel Energy is 
committed to the highest standards 
of corporate governance, standards 
which are vital to maintain both 
investor confidence and the integrity  
of the company.
MAXIMISE THE POTENTIAL  
FROM OUR EXISTING ASSETS  
IN THE KURDISTAN REGION  
OF IRAQ ON A BROADL Y  
CASH FLOW NEUTRAL BASIS
The ongoing development and 
exploration of our assets in the 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq will be 
funded from proceeds received  
from export and local sales.
CREATE V ALUE WITH  
THE DRILL BIT
We are committed to realising the value 
in our portfolio through a significant 
drilling programme to explore, appraise 
and develop our assets.
We aim to make material discoveries  
in areas underexplored due to 
perceived political or technical risk.
MONETISING AT ALL POINTS IN  
THE EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT 
AND PRODUCTION CYCLE
The significant strength of our balance 
sheet and flexibility in our capital 
structure provides both corporate 
opportunities and the potential to 
return excess capital to investors.
PROGRESS  
AGAINST 2013
Senior management continue to 
demonstrate a strong compliance 
culture and leadership. There  
have been significant changes  
to the regulations that govern  
how companies report on their 
remuneration arrangements, which  
in the interest of good governance  
we choose to comply with voluntarily 
despite being based in Jersey. 
We published our first Community 
Engagement and Investment Report 
in September 2013 demonstrating  
our commitment to the communities 
in which we operate.
Exports by the KRG via truck to 
international markets diversified our 
revenue stream, and we continued to 
progress operations while remaining 
broadly cash flow neutral.
Political momentum continued  
to support the development of 
Genel’s KRI business. The signing  
of the framework Turkey-KRG  
Energy Agreement in March was  
a key moment, clarifying the route  
to market for our resources,  
resulting in the KRI oil pipeline 
becoming operational at the end  
of the year and the Gas Sales 
Agreement being signed. 
In 2013, exploration and appraisal 
success grew our reserves and added 
to our leadership position in the KRI. 
Three discoveries were made at  
Chia Surkh, Tawke Deep and Ber Bahr, 
and there were material resource 
additions at Bina Bawi and Tawke. 
Strong progress was made on our 
African portfolio, including the 
acquisition of seismic on four licences, 
and we expanded the portfolio with 
prospective acreage in Ethiopia.
Our financial strength has been  
key in building a high-impact, 
world-class portfolio of assets,  
while also providing the potential  
to progress their development. 
Investment in 2013 has delivered 
increased production and revenue  
at our producing fields, and boosted 
the value of assets through adding 
and derisking reserves. This derisking, 
supported by the positive political 
momentum in the KRI, has provided a 
number of monetisation opportunities. 
TARGETS  
FOR 2014
Building on the 2013 external 
effectiveness review, in 2014 we 
completed an internal review of  
our effectiveness. We will implement 
the recommendations arising from 
that review, including in the areas  
of CSR, risk, board composition  
and development, which continue  
to evolve as the Company grows.
We will continue to monitor closely 
the major risks in the regions in  
which we operate.
We will continue to progress  
the Taq Taq and Tawke field 
developments and increase 
production capacity, with the  
pipeline infrastructure increasingly  
able to export this capacity. In turn, 
growing revenues will help fund the 
continuing exploration, appraisal and 
development of our key assets.
Signing of a Gas Sales Offtake 
Agreement with the KRG will help to 
unlock the potential of our gas assets 
and, once completed, we will make 
the final investment decision on the 
first phase of the gas development.
In 2014 activity will continue across 
our assets. Drilling on our African 
portfolio, which we estimate contains 
gross prospective resources of  
5.5 bnboe, begins in earnest, with  
the Cap Juby well in Morocco having 
commenced drilling in January, and  
a further three wells scheduled to  
do so by the end of the year.
Material exploration upside also 
remains in the KRI.
We will continue to evaluate and 
evolve our capital structure to  
reflect the future needs of the 
business, ensuring that we run  
an appropriate balance sheet for  
an E&P company of our size.
As our Miran project matures, at the 
right time we will seek a partnering 
solution to bring in additional financial 
capability and complementary skills 
and experience. This will provide us 
with significant financial optionality.

TOTAL NET RESERVES  
AND UNRISKED RESOURCES
Total net reserves and unrisked 
resources increased by 10%, 
boosted by a 70% increase in 
contingent resources at Bina Bawi, 
where exploration and appraisal 
success confirmed the field as a 
major gas discovery, and the 
inclusion of Miran Deep following 
delineation of the prospect. 
Unrisked resources at Chia Surkh  
also increased following successful 
drilling at CS-10 and 11.
NET PRODUCTION
Production growth is an indicator  
of the realisation of the potential  
of our producing assets in the 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq. It 
represents a combination of  
the success of both the Group’s 
capital development spend and  
its operational performance,  
albeit affected by the availability  
of export markets. Net production  
is calculated on a working interest 
basis and is measured in average 
barrels of oil produced daily (bopd). 
In 2013 production was in line with 
2012, notably with the beginning of 
exports to Turkey from Taq Taq by 
truck. The completion of the KRI 
independent pipeline infrastructure 
has paved the way for steadily rising 
oil export volumes from Taq Taq 
and Tawke over the course of 2014.
NET 2P RESERVES  
AND RESOURCES
Our strategy is to enhance the  
value of our commercial oil and  
gas assets through drilling and to 
explore for and discover additional 
oil and gas resources. Genel also 
undertakes acquisitions to access 
additional resources. Our exploration 
and appraisal programmes seek  
to convert unrisked prospective 
resources into commercially viable 
reserves. In 2013 2P reserves 
increased, offsetting the production 
at Taq Taq and Tawke, due in part  
to the conversion of Dohuk gas 
resources from 2C to 2P following 
the signed gas sales agreement  
and field development plan. 25

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Derisking and increasing the  
value of the assets of the  
Company by capital development 
and exploration spend is a key 
component of our strategy, with 
total capital expenditure being a key 
performance indicator. Success of 
this capital expenditure is measured 
by production capacity growth and 
reserves growth. Capital expenditure 
is measured in US dollar millions.
Capital expenditure in 2013  
totalled $564 million of which  
some $480 million was KRI spend, 
notably progressing the second 
central processing facility at Taq 
Taq, Tawke development drilling,  
the successful drilling at Chia Surkh 
and appraisal of our major gas 
assets at Miran and Bina Bawi.  
The balance was spent on the  
Africa exploration portfolio.
F ATALITIES AND L TI
The Board and management are 
committed to running safe and 
reliable operations and maintaining 
zero fatalities is of the highest 
importance. A low LTI, with no 
fatalities, indicates how successful 
our safety programmes are in 
preventing injury. LTI measures the 
number of hours lost due to injury 
 per million work hours across all of 
our sites where we are operator.
In 2013 the low level of LTIs 
indicates the Group’s continued 
focus on running our operations in 
accordance with our strategy. We 
have included, for the first time, 
TTOPCO’s performance data as  
well as Genel Energy’s in line with 
OGP’s reporting guidelines. 
SPILLS – LOSS OF PRIMARY 
CONTAINMENT (LOPC)
Asset integrity is a major priority for 
the Group and we plan and execute 
the operations of our business and 
our engagement of subcontractors 
so as to minimise risk and mitigate 
potential impact.
A key measure of our success  
in achieving asset integrity is 
minimising the number of incidents 
where there has been a loss of 
primary containment. LoPC records 
any unplanned or uncontrolled 
release of material (excluding small 
or non-hazardous releases such as 
water) from a piece of equipment 
used for containment – for example 
a pipe, vessel or tank.
Genel Energy remains focused  
on keeping LoPCs to a minimum, 
ensuring that all incidents are 
investigated thoroughly to ensure 
best practice processes are in place.

GENEL ENERGY’S AVERAGE NET WORKING INTEREST PRODUCTION FOR  
THE FULL YEAR 2013 WAS 44,000 BOPD, IN LINE WITH 2012. PRODUCTION

PRODUCTION
Net working interest production in 2013 
averaged 44,000 bopd, slightly below the  
lower end of the Company’s guidance range  
of 45,000 – 55,000 bopd. This was primarily  
as a result of lower than anticipated production 
in the fourth quarter of 2013. Two factors 
caused this effect. Taq Taq operated at a 
reduced rate through much of November and 
December following a fire at the field’s tanker 
loading station. Full operating capability was 
restored towards end 2013. At Tawke, volumes 
in the fourth quarter of 2013 were reduced 
relative to the previous quarter due to pricing 
sensitivity in the domestic market.
During the year, production from Taq Taq  
and Tawke was sold into both domestic and 
export markets. In early 2013, we received 
permission from the Kurdistan Regional 
Government to export crude oil from the  
Taq Taq field to international markets through 
Turkey. Although initial volumes were modest, 
exports ramped up over the course of the year 
and averaged approximately 20,000 bopd 
during 2013. It is expected that truck exports  
will continue during the commissioning of the 
new KRI export pipeline.
Production guidance for 2014 is set at 60 – 
70,000 boepd, translating into a revenue 
guidance range of between $500-600 million. 
Production volumes are expected to grow 
significantly year on year as the new KRI  
export pipeline comes into operation.
RESERVES AND RESOURCES
At 31 December 2013, Genel Energy’s proven 
and probable (2P) working interest reserves 
were 453 mmboe (2012: 445 mmboe), a 2% 
increase year on year. This results in a reserves 
replacement ratio of 147% in 2013. Production 
from Taq Taq and Tawke of 15 mmbbls was 
more than offset by the booking of reserves  
(21 mmboe net) at the Summail field following 
project sanction and an intra-year reserve 
upgrade at Tawke (2mmbbls net).
Following strong growth in 2012, we saw a 
further increase in our contingent resource  
base in 2013. The Bina Bawi field saw a 70% 
upgrade in mean contingent resources due to  
the significant success at the Bina Bawi-4 & 5 
appraisal wells. We estimate the Chia Surkh 
discovery holds gross contingent resource  
of 250 mmboe ahead of further exploration  
and appraisal activity. Overall, contingent 
resources increased from 810 mmboe at 
year-end 2012 to 1,088 mmboe at year-end  
2013, an increase of 34%.

TAQ TAQ
The Taq Taq field produced an average  
of 77,000 bopd in 2013, compared to 
75,500 bopd in 2012. Trucked exports  
to international markets via Turkey 
commenced in January 2013 and steadily 
increased over the year, and on certain 
days in the second half of 2013 reached 
approximately 70,000 bopd. Over the 
course of the year exports averaged 
around 20,000 bopd. The remainder of 
production was sold into the local market. 
Domestic market demand for Taq Taq 
crude remains robust. However, sales 
were impacted in the fourth quarter of 
2013 by a fire at the tanker loading station. 
As a consequence the facility operated at 
a reduced rate through much of November 
and December. Full operating capability 
was restored towards the end of the year. 
Processing capacity currently stands  
at 120,000 bopd, with a total wellhead 
production capacity in excess of 150,000 
bopd. Upgrades to expand the tanker 
loading station were recently completed, 
raising capacity from 120,000 bopd to 
150,000 bopd. The 2014 activity plan 
envisages the drilling of four further 
production wells, including a highly 
deviated well and the first horizontal well  
in the field. Construction of the second 
central processing facility is progressing 
and is targeted for completion in the 
fourth quarter, at which point processing 
capacity will increase to 200,000 bopd. 
The Taq Taq Deep well, targeting Jurassic 
and Triassic intervals beneath the main 
producing Cretaceous oil reservoirs in  
the field, is drilling ahead. The well reached 
a depth of 4,600 metres in February 2014 
and has encountered around 300 metres of 
gas shows and condensate in the Jurassic. 
Unfortunately, mechanical difficulties 
necessitated pulling back to 4,100 metres 
and side-tracking to drill onto the deeper 
Triassic targets. 
The well is currently at 4,500 metres,  
and the forward plan is to drill to a 
maximum target depth of 5,400 metres.  
A testing programme is planned after 
drilling operations finish.
KRI PIPELINE INFRASTRUCTURE
During 2013, the KRG completed  
the construction of its export pipeline 
infrastructure, giving it a route to export 
its oil production to world markets. The 
first section, a 20-inch diameter pipeline 
from the Taq Taq field to Khurmala, 
became operational in the first half of 
2013. This section has initial capacity  
of 150,000 bopd, with the potential to 
increase to 200,000 bopd. The second 
section, from Khurmala to Dohuk, involved 
the conversion of a 36-inch pipeline 
originally intended to be a gas pipeline. 
The final section, from Dohuk to the KRI 
border with Turkey, was completed in the 
third quarter of 2013. This was tied into the 
existing 40-inch section of the Iraq-Turkey 
pipeline through a new metering station 
within KRI territory. Commissioning work 
has been progressing since the fourth 
quarter of 2013. This process has identified 
the need for an upgrade to pumping 
stations in KRI territory. These works  
are expected to be completed in time  
to allow for full commissioning of the 
pipeline during the second half of 2014. 
In January 2014, the KRG announced  
that initial quantities of crude oil from  
the Tawke field had flowed through the 
pipeline system and arrived into storage  
at the port of Ceyhan in Turkey.
TAWKE
The Tawke field produced an average of 
39,000 bopd in 2013, compared to 45,000 
bopd in 2012. Production was reduced year 
on year as export markets remained 
closed and domestic market demand 
decreased due to pricing sensitivity.
During the year, the first two horizontal 
development wells were drilled on the field 
with outstanding results. In July, it was 
announced that the Tawke-20 well flowed 
at an average of 8,000 bopd from each  
of the ten fracture corridors intersected 
by the well. It was subsequently brought 
onstream at a record rate for the field of 
25,000 bopd. The second horizontal well 
in the programme, Tawke-23, flowed at  
an average rate of 9,000 bopd from ten 
separate fracture corridors intersected  
by the well. It was subsequently brought 
onstream at 32,500 bopd, another record. 
Drilling operations on the third and fourth 
wells in the programme, Tawke-21 and 
Tawke-22, are progressing with results 
expected towards the end of first quarter.
At end 2013, the Tawke field had wellhead 
production capacity of 155,000 bopd. 
Current processing capacity stands at 
100,000 bopd, with this level being 
successfully tested over a 72-hour period 
in May 2013. Surface processing capacity 
is planned to increase to 200,000 bopd by 
year-end 2014 through the utilisation of 
early production facilities. Success in the 
2014 horizontal drilling programme could 
lead to further increases in processing 
capacity going forward. To facilitate the 
higher volumes, a new 24-inch pipeline  
is planned from the field to the Tawke 
partners’ Fishkabur export facility. The 
Tawke partners also plan further drilling 
on the Peshkabir discovery during 2014, 
which will appraise the discovered 
resource and test upside potential.
In June 2013, it was announced that the 
Tawke-17 (Tawke Deep) well tested 1,500 
bopd of 26-28 degree API crude from an 
Upper Jurassic reservoir underlying the 
main producing Cretaceous horizons in the 
field. Further data acquisition and analysis 
of the Tawke Jurassic discovery is planned 
in 2014 ahead of spudding the Tawke-29 
Jurassic appraisal well in the third quarter.

STRATEGIC REPORT
www.genelenergy.com
In November 2013, the Government  
of Turkey and the KRG signed a GSA 
governing the export of natural gas from 
the KRI to Turkey. The GSA calls for an 
initial 4 bcma of gas exports from 2017, 
rising to 10 bcma by 2020 and the option 
of increasing to 20 bcma thereafter.  
Miran and Bina Bawi will be anchor 
suppliers under the GSA – a significant 
milestone in the commercialisation of  
the major gas resource in both fields.
MIRAN
Genel Energy has a 75% interest in  
the Miran discovery, which is one of the 
largest undeveloped gas discoveries in the 
KRI. The field has independently audited 
mean contingent resources of 3.5 tcf of 
gas and 95 mmbbls of oil and condensate. 
On 1 September 2013, the KRG approved 
the Declaration of Commerciality for the 
Miran field. On 23 February 2014, the KRG 
notified the Company of its intention to 
exercise its option to take a 25% interest 
in the Miran PSC, thereby reducing Genel 
Energy’s interest from 100% to 75%. 
Building on the success of the Turkey-KRG 
GSA, discussions with the KRG have 
commenced with the aim of finalising  
a Gas Sales Offtake Agreement for the 
Miran field in the second half of 2014. In 
parallel, we continue to screen a number 
of development concepts, incorporating 
both domestic and export supply options. 
The Miran West-5 (MW-5) appraisal  
well was spudded on 4 July 2013 but 
mechanical difficulties resulted in the well 
being suspended. A decision was made to 
swap rigs before recommencing drilling, 
and results from the MW-5 well are now 
expected in the third quarter of 2014, to  
be followed by an extended well test. 
The primary gas bearing reservoir in the 
Miran is the Jurassic. Technical work has 
established the potential for deeper gas 
bearing zones in the Triassic and Permian 
in a separate structure. These targets 
comprise the Miran Deep prospect which  
is expected to be drilled in 2015. 
An Extended Well Test on the oil  
bearing lower Cretaceous reservoirs  
was commissioned in early 2013, with  
the Miran-1 well flowing at rates over 
4,000 bopd. Given this encouragement,  
an Early Production Facility (EPF) was 
sanctioned and commissioned in August 
2013, producing at 500-1,500 bopd. The 
EPF is to be suspended in the first quarter 
of 2014 in preparation for drilling the first 
horizontal development well into the Miran 
oil reservoir. Spud is expected around 
mid-year 2014, and the results of this  
well will be important in shaping future  
oil development on the licence.
BINA BAWI
Genel Energy has a 44% non-operated 
stake in the Bina Bawi licence, which lies 
immediately northwest of the Taq Taq 
licence. A Declaration of Commerciality 
was submitted to the Ministry of Natural 
Resources of the KRG in March. An 
extended well test on the Bina Bawi-3 well 
commenced production in March 2013.
In 2013, two very successful appraisal wells 
were completed which led to a significant 
upgrade in contingent gas resources. The 
Bina Bawi-4 well reached a target depth  
of 4,700 metres, while Bina Bawi-5 
reached target depth at 3,400 metres.  
An extensive testing programme on  
both wells was completed in the second 
quarter of 2013. Testing has confirmed a 
continuous, hydraulically connected gas 
column in excess of 1,100 metres in both 
wells. The top of the Triassic Kurra Chine 
Engineers at Bina Bawi
formation is 400 metres down-dip from 
the crest of the Bina Bawi structure, as 
tested by the Bina Bawi-3 well. In total,  
this confirms a minimum gas column of  
at least 1,500 metres on the structure. 
There is the potential for up to an 
additional 500 metres of hydrocarbon 
column, below the basal test in Bina 
Bawi-4 down to the structural spill point.
The Drill Stem Tests (DST) were completed 
over the full extent of the drilled Triassic 
interval, including the Geli Khana and 
across the entire Kurra Chine section. 
Observed productivity was high over 
perforated zones of 30 to 60 metres. 
Across the Kurra Chine, rates of around 
20 mmscfd were recorded in the three 
separate zones with the highest achieved 
rates limited by tubing and surface test 
equipment. Cumulative production across 
the Kurra Chine sections was 60 mmscfd. 
In the Geli Khana, a non-acidised stabilised 
flow rate of 10 mmscfd was achieved. 
A Competent Person’s Report 
commissioned from RPS Energy  
estimates gross mean contingent  
gas resource for Bina Bawi at 4.9 tcf, 
confirming the world-class scale of the 
field. Management believes that, when 
combined with Miran, Bina Bawi is well 
placed to anchor the 10 bcma of export 
volumes from the KRI to Turkey by 2020, 
as envisaged in the GSA signed between 
Turkey and the KRG in November 2013.
DOHUK
Genel Energy has a 40% non-operated 
interest in the Dohuk licence. The Summail 
discovery, made in 2011, contains gas in 
Cretaceous aged reservoirs and heavy oil 
in Jurassic aged reservoirs. In September 
2013, the Dohuk licence partners signed  
a Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement 
(GSPA) with the KRG to supply gas from 
the Summail field to a local power station.
The field development envisages the 
completion of the Summail-1 well as a 
producer as well as the drilling of up to 
three further production wells. A gas 
processing facility will also be installed at 
the field and a pipeline will be constructed 
to deliver gas to the nearby Dohuk power 
station. Initial deliveries will be 30 to  
50 mmscfd, increasing towards 100  
to 120 mmscfd as new wells are drilled  
and additional facilities are installed.  
First gas from the Summail-1 well is 
targeted for the first quarter of 2014.
At year end 2013, Genel Energy booked  
its share of the 2P reserves associated 
with the Summail GSPA, which amounted  
to 21 mmboe. 32

LICENCE MADE A SIGNIFICANT LIGHT OIL AND  
GAS DISCOVERY IN 2013. FURTHER DRILLING IS 
PLANNED IN 2014 TO APPRAISE THE RESOURCE 
POTENTIAL OF THE LICENCE.
CHIA SURKH
Genel Energy has a 60% operated interest 
in the Chia Surkh licence, which is located 
in the southeast of the KRI. The Chia Surkh 
10 exploration well was spudded in 
October 2012 and was announced as a 
significant discovery in April 2013. The  
well was drilled to a depth of 1,696 metres 
in the Oligo-Miocene section, and on test, 
flowed at up to 11,950 bopd of 41 degree 
API and 15 mmscfd of gas. A second  
DST was carried out in the Miocene, and 
flowed at sustained rates of 3,200 bopd  
of 38 degree API oil and 8.4 mmscfd  
of gas. CS 10 has been suspended as  
a future producer.
The Chia Surkh discovery was appraised 
by the CS-11 well, which was drilled 3km  
to the northwest of CS-10 and 85 metres 
down-dip on the structure. It penetrated a 
gross hydrocarbon column of 170 metres 
in Miocene and Oligocene aged reservoirs. 
The Miocene Jeribe formation previously 
tested in CS-10 flowed at a cumulative rate 
of 3,550 bpd of 50 degree API oil and  
21 mmscfd of gas from two zones. Deeper 
Miocene and Oligocene formations not 
penetrated in the CS-10 well flowed at  
a combined rate of 3,660 bpd of light  
oil and 25 mmscfd of gas. 
Based on current data and ahead of 
further exploration and appraisal activity, 
gross 2C contingent resources on the  
Chia Surkh structure are estimated at  
250 mmboe. The acquisition of 300 km
2
  
of new 3D seismic over the Chia Surkh 
licence has recently been completed and  
is being processed. One appraisal well  
is planned on the greater Chia Surkh 
structure in 2014. Further E&A activity, 
including a potential exploration well on  
the Qalami structure, is planned for 2015.
BER BAHR 
During 2012, the Ber Bahr-1 well made an 
oil discovery in Jurassic aged reservoirs, 
although two drill stem tests over the 
interval failed to flow. The well was 
successfully side-tracked in the first half  
of 2013 and tested 2,100 bpd of 15 degree 
API oil from the Sargelu formation. A 3D 
seismic survey is planned for completion 
by mid-year 2014. Ber Bahr-2, an appraisal 
well, is planned to spud in the fourth 
quarter of 2014.

AFRICAN EXPLORATION PORTFOLIO
In total, four wells are planned in 2014, including three offshore Morocco and the first well offshore Malta. In May 2013, Genel Energy 
announced that it had contracted the Noble Paul Romano semi-submersible rig on a two-year contract, to underpin our ambition  
to drill five high-impact wells per annum. 
MOROCCO
Genel Energy’s acreage position offshore Morocco consists  
of three licences, Juby Maritime, Sidi Moussa and Mir Left, 
spanning some 16,500km
2
. Exploration activity to date has 
focused on the potential for oil accumulations in Jurassic aged 
carbonates, although a deeper pre-salt play in the Triassic is  
also under evaluation. In total, around 1,940km
2
 of 3D seismic  
has been acquired across the Morocco licence position ahead  
of the drilling campaign.
In January 2014, the partners on the Juby Maritime licence 
spudded the JM-1 well, which is targeting the Cap Juby prospect. 
The well is currently at 3,100 metres, with 600 metres left to  
drill to the prognosed Middle Jurassic primary target. In the 
Upper Jurassic, the well has confirmed the presence of oil as 
originally tested in the 1968 MO-2 well, some 2km from the  
JM-1 well location.
Exploration wells are planned on both the Sidi Moussa and  
Mir Left licences during 2014 using the Noble Paul Romano 
semi-submersible rig. On the Sidi Moussa licence, the most  
likely target is the Nour prospect. On Mir Left, prospect 
maturation is currently ongoing.

MAL TA
Genel Energy has a 75% operated stake in the Area 4 licence 
where we and our partner are initially targeting the potential 
extension of the proven Tertiary play offshore Tunisia into 
Maltese waters. We plan to commence drilling a well on the  
Hagar Qim prospect around the end of the first quarter of 2014.  
A deeper Cretaceous play is also thought to exist, which could  
be the northern extension of the prolific Sirte basin onshore 
Libya. Further analysis of reprocessed seismic is planned for  
2014 to assess the prospectivity in sub-Tertiary intervals.

Net cash ($million) 699.7 1,001.3
Net assets ($million) 4,104.2 3,920.1
1. Free cash flow is cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure.
RESUL TS FOR THE PERIOD
In 2013, the Group reported revenue  
of $347.9 million (2012: $333.4 million),  
an operating profit of $183.5 million  
(2012: $60.3 million) and earnings per 
share of 66.24 cents (2012: 27.18 cents). 
Free cash flow for the period was an 
outflow of $252.6 million compared to  
an inflow of $73.5 million in 2012.
REVENUE
Revenue of $347.9 million  
(2012: $333.4 million) is comprised 
primarily of petroleum sales in the 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq with full 
entitlement received for sales made to 
domestic customers and to the KRG. 
OPERATING COSTS
Cost of sales of $140.7 million  
(2012: $208.4 million) includes 
depreciation charges of $94.4 million  
(2012: $168.4 million) and production  
costs of $46.3 million (2012: $40.0 million). 
The basis of the depreciation charge  
was changed during the year in order  
to depreciate the cost of assets based on 
physical production volumes rather than 
derive depreciation from revenue. Had the 
basis remained the same as prior years, 
the charge for the first half would have 
been $137.3 million higher at $231.7 million 
(see note 3 in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements for further details).
An exploration credit of $3.1 million for  
the year (2012: expense of $29.7 million) 
represents the reversal of a $22.2 million 
provision for impairment made in 2012 
following encouraging results for the 
sidetrack work on the Ber Bahr licence, 
offset by $19.1 million of exploration  
costs following the suspension of  
activities in Somaliland. 
Other operating costs amounted to  
$26.8 million (2012: $35.0 million)  
for the period and included $6.2 million 
(2012: $13.3 million) of costs relating to 
acquisitions and pre-licence activity,  
with the remaining $20.6 million  
(2012: $21.7 million) classified as  
general administration costs.
FINANCE INCOME
Finance income of $3.0 million  
(2012: $15.6 million) represents  
principally interest income received  
on cash and loan balances. 
TAXATION
All corporation tax due has been paid on 
behalf of the Group by the KRG from the 
KRG’s own share of revenues and there is 
no tax payment required or expected to be 
made by the Group other than some small 
amounts paid in respect of the Group’s 
service companies in Turkey and the UK.  37

STRATEGIC REPORT
DIVIDEND
In line with the Group strategy to deploy 
cash to acquire and develop high quality 
assets, no dividend (2012: nil) will be paid 
for the year ended 31 December 2013. 
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Capital expenditure in the year amounted  
to $563.9 million (2012: $233.5 million). 
Exploration spend in KRI amounted to 
$348.4 million (2012: $143.1 million) with a 
further $128.1 million (2012: $73.7 million) 
incurred on the development of existing 
producing assets in KRI. Capital 
expenditure in Africa amounted to  
$82.1 million (2012: $12.0 million).
CASH FLOW
Net cash flow from operations amounted 
to $311.3 million (2012: $307.0 million), 
which together with capex spend of 
$563.9 million (2012: $233.5 million) 
resulted in a free cash outflow of  
$252.6 million (2012: $73.5 million inflow). 
Acquisition spend was $43.0 million  
(2012: $984.0 million) and the purchase  
of shares for employee share plans 
amounted to $6.0 million (2012: $1.2 million) 
leaving a net cash outflow of $301.6 million 
(2012: $911.6 million). The net cash balance 
at the end of the year was $699.7 million 
(2012: $1,001.3 million). 
NET CASH
At 31 December 2013, the Group had  
a net cash balance of $699.7 million  
(2012: $1,001.3 million). 
ACQUISITIONS
The Group spent a total of $43.0 million  
on acquisitions in the year, $30.0 million  
of which represented the previously 
announced payment to the KRG in respect 
of the Miran transaction, which completed 
on 23 January 2013. In February the 
Company acquired a 75% stake in a block 
offshore Malta through the acquisition  
of 75% of the share capital of Phoenicia 
Energy Company Limited for $11.7 million. 
In March the Group acquired a 60% 
working interest in the Sidi Moussa licence 
in Morocco for $1.3 million.
NET ASSETS 
Net assets at 31 December 2013 amounted 
to $4,104.2 million (2012: $3,920.1 million) 
and consist primarily of oil and gas assets 
of $1,998.4 million (2012: $1,928.7 million), 
exploration and evaluation assets of 
$1,630.9 million (2012: $1,171.2 million) and 
cash of $699.7 million (2012: $1,001.3 million).
LIQUIDITY / COUNTERPARTY  
RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Group monitors its cash position, cash 
forecasts and liquidity on a regular basis. 
The Group takes a conservative approach 
to cash management, with surplus cash 
held in government gilts or treasury bills 
or on time deposits with a number of 
major financial institutions. Suitability of 
banks is assessed using a combination of 
sovereign risk, credit default swap pricing 
and credit rating.
GOING CONCERN
The directors have assessed that the  
cash balance held provides the Group  
with adequate headroom over forecast 
operational and potential acquisition 
expenditure for the 12 months following 
the signing of the Annual Report for the 
period ended 31 December 2013 for the 
Group to be considered a going concern.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
UK listed companies are required to 
comply with the European regulation  
to report consolidated statements  
that conform to International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted  
by the European Union. Principal 
accounting policies adopted by the  
Group and applicable for the period  
ended 31 December 2013 can be found  
in note 1 to the financial statements.  
No new accounting policies were 
implemented during the year.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
SUPPORTING AND SUSTAINING THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE 
IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR SUCCESS AND OUR COMMITMENT TO BEING A 
SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS. WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE PRODUCED OUR FIRST 
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT REPORT IN SEPTEMBER 2013, WHICH 
DEMONSTRATES THE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE IN THIS AREA.
IN THE KRI WE HAVE INVESTED $14 MILLION SINCE 2005 IN 
OVER 100 SOCIAL PROJECTS. WE HAVE IMPROVED WATER 
SUPPLIES, PROVIDED EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING TO SCHOOLS 
AND UNIVERSITIES, AND SUPPORTED HEAL TH PROGRAMMES 
AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES. AS WE EXPAND OUR 
OPERA TIONS, WE ARE EXTENDING OUR CORPORA TE SOCIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY WORK TO OUR NEWER ASSETS, INCLUDING 
THOSE IN AFRICA.
In addition, we responded to the humanitarian crisis affecting 
Northern Iraq as a result of the Syrian conflict, with a $1 million 
donation in December 2013 to Save the Children to assist Syrian 
refugees and affected local communities in Kurdistan. The 
donation will make a significant impact on the programmes  
Save the Children is delivering to Syrian refugees. 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY MANAGEMENT
We continue to strive to work to the highest levels of corporate 
governance and are developing a corporate social responsibility 
policy and social investment guidelines. These documents will 
describe the approach we take to investment in social and 
community programmes and our strategy to support and sustain 
the communities in which we operate. The approach we take to 
human rights is also key, as we work towards incorporating 
recognised international conventions on human rights, including 
the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, into our business 
processes. Our approach will be described in more detail in our 
next Community Engagement and Investment report.

Genel Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
HEAL TH, SAFETY AND SECURITY
GENEL ENERGY IS FIRML Y OF THE VIEW THAT ALL ACCIDENTS 
ARE PREVENTABLE AND IS COMMITTED TO THE GOAL OF ZERO 
INJURIES ACROSS ALL ITS OPERATIONS.
HIGHLIGHTS
We are pleased to report that during 2013, we suffered no loss  
of life and only three lost time incidents (LTIs) within Genel 
Energy and three within TTOPCO (the joint venture company  
at Taq Taq). We also;
• completed a full review of the HSE management system
• commissioned a third-party review of occupational health 
systems and on-site service provisions of our environmental 
management system
HEAL TH & SAFETY
The safety of our employees is of the utmost importance and  
we are pleased to report no LTIs during the second half of 2013,  
a result of our focus on improving in this area and our enhanced 
on-site leadership and more effective management of contractors.
As a result of a fire at the tanker loading facility at Taq Taq, we 
suffered one related LTI at TTOPCO. We have investigated this 
incident in detail and developed and implemented an action plan. 
HSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
In 2013 we reviewed and updated the Genel Energy HSE  
strategy and we regularly monitor progress against it. The HSE 
management system has been reviewed and revised with the 
objective of ensuring a clear understanding and ownership by 
both staff and contractors. 
PROCESS SAFETY
The safety of our operations is paramount to effective operations. 
We have made good progress on the integration of process safety 
into the earliest stages of the project life cycle, seeking to ensure 
that effective risk management solutions are embedded into the 
project design and operational procedures throughout the entire 
project life cycle.
ON-SITE
We continue to focus on rigorous and consistent on-site 
implementation of our HSE policies and procedures. During  
2013, improvements have been made to our on-site leadership  
and supervision leading to more effective management of 
contractors. These changes have led to a significant improvement  
in HSE performance during the second half of 2013. 
REVIEW OF OCCUPATIONAL HEAL TH PROVISION 
During 2013, we commissioned a third-party review of our 
occupational health systems and on-site service provision. The 
key recommendations from this review have been included as 
part of the updated HSE Strategy. 
MEASURING OUR HSE PERFORMANCE 
Our focus during 2013 was to improve our HSE reporting in line 
with the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (OGP). 
In this context, the 2013 HSE performance data for TTOPCO has 
(for the first time) been consolidated into the Genel Energy 
performance data and we are now reporting on both. This is in 
line with OGP reporting guidelines for joint venture operations.  
All losses and incidents are investigated and measures to prevent 
accidents are put in place and evaluated. As reported above, the  
fire at the Taq Taq loading station has been subject to such a review 
and progress against the actions identified in such review will be 
closely monitored. Additionally, all potential causes of accidents  
are identified, reported and measured to reduce the risk of 
accidents occurring.
PEOPLE
HAVING A STRONG COMMITMENT TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND 
ENHANCEMENT OF OUR PEOPLE CREATES A MOTIVATIONAL 
ENVIRONMENT WHERE EVERYONE CAN PERFORM AT THEIR 
BEST . PUTTING PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF OUR AGENDA ENSURES 
THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGH-CALIBRE 
INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL ADD VALUE AND HELP US TO ACHIEVE 
OUR STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL GOALS.
HIGHLIGHTS
At 31 December 2013, Genel employed 264 people, an increase of 
119 over the past year. Of these 264 employees, 115 are based in 
Turkey, 94 in the Kurdistan Region, five in our Africa operations 
and 50 in London.
TRAINING AND SKILLS
The ongoing technical and personal development of our people 
allows us to achieve success both now and into the future. Having 
the right people, with the right skills, in the right place underpins 
our delivery model and ensures a sustainable business platform 
for whatever challenges are ahead. 
CONDUCT
The existence of a culture that engenders open, honest and 
ethical business etiquette is one that we are committed to 
creating, thereby establishing a positive reputation and high 
level of trust with our stakeholders and bringing a sense of  
pride to our employees and contractors. 
PA Y AND BENEFITS
Through a transparent and competitive reward framework,  
we are able to attract and retain a highly skilled employee base.  
The opportunity to receive performance-related-pay is available 
to all our staff, in line with a well structured and clearly defined 
performance management process.
DIVERSITY
We are committed to employing a diverse and balanced 
workforce. Diversity of ideas, skills, knowledge, experience, 
culture, ethnicity and gender are important when building an 
effective and talented workforce at all levels of the organisation, 
including the Board.
As an international company we employ staff from many diverse 
cultures and our recruitment policy is to appoint individuals  
based on their skills, experience and suitability to the role. We  
also recognise the valuable contribution that women make to our 
business and as such, 35% (93 employees) of our workforce are 
women. Of those 17% hold senior management positions within 
our organisation and we have two female representatives on our 
executive committee from a total of 12.

HIGHLIGHTS
• Working with the local NGO Civil Development Organisation, 
Genel Energy invested near to $170,000 to implement an 
equipment for schools project for the villages surrounding  
our Chia Surkh site. As part of our focus on educational 
development in the local communities, nine local schools were 
given essential equipment and materials such as stationery, 
water coolers and computers to help facilitate a better working 
environment for the students 
• As part of our health development programme for 2013, we 
committed $70,000 for two ambulances which were donated  
to the Barda Qaraman clinic located near the Miran site and 
Qourto clinic near Chia Surkh. Neither clinic previously had an 
ambulance to send out in response to medical emergencies  
in nearby villages
SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
We appreciate our responsibility to help people in the areas  
in which we operate to develop the skills to participate in, and 
ultimately run, major projects. Accordingly, we are committed  
to increasing the proportion of local employees on our staff  
and procuring locally when possible.
As at 31 December 2013, Genel Energy had a workforce of 264 
employees. 94 employees are based in the KRI, just over 47% of 
whom are locally employed. TTOPCO, our joint venture company 
at Taq Taq, employs some 600 people, of whom approximately 
75% are from the local area. Genel Energy also employs local 
people through service contracts at our operations in Miran and 
Chia Surkh. Our spending on local suppliers has increased from 
some $15 million in 2012 to around $70 million in 2013. 
MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY RELATIONS
We work to ensure local communities understand and collaborate 
in the development of infrastructure that can both support our 
operations and add value to the surrounding area. In addition, 
issues around land acquisition are particularly important. Our 
local community relations teams are in regular contact with the 
communities located near our assets and work to facilitate timely 
and open dialogue and to address issues local people face. In 
addition, we continue to support a variety of recreational and 
cultural activities. 
LOCAL AND REGIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING 
Besides the on-the-job training and skills development we  
provide to our employees, we have given support to a number  
of projects designed to help build capacity among local people. 
Since 2005, we have focused on educational programmes  
and have invested in kindergardens and schools, supported 
universities and students through scholarships, provided  
on-site training at our assets for 250 university students and 
funded 20 scholarships at the Middle East Technical University  
in Ankara and Istanbul.
ENVIRONMENT
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW 
During 2013 we commissioned a third-party review of our 
environmental management system and associated onsite 
practices. The key recommendations from this review have  
been included in the 2013-2015 HSE Strategy. 
In line with our approach to comply with UK governance 
requirements, Genel Energy intends to comply with the UK 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013 in relation to greenhouse gas emissions 
reporting. We are engaging with consultants and expect to 
include this data in our 2014 Annual Report.
Mountains at T awke
IMPROVED COMMUNITY HEAL TH
Our operations are often in regions that can be remote and have 
a lower level of socio-economic development. As a result, they 
can lack regular access to medical services and infrastructure.  
In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Genel Energy has supported 
health outreach programmes, and in 2013 our programmes have 
included constructing sewerage lines and garbage collection 
in seven villages, in conjunction with local authorities, as well as 
providing medical equipment to clinics in the Chia Surkh area. 42
The Board is responsible for setting the 
overall risk appetite of the Group and  
the assessment of what level of risk is 
acceptable for the Group to bear. The 
Board, its committees and the senior 
management team are actively engaged in 
monitoring and, where possible, mitigating 
the risks to which the Group is exposed.
The Audit Committee oversees the 
Group’s risk management systems.  
These provide the framework for the 
identification, assessment and, where 
possible, mitigation of the risks and  
future risks that are central to the Group 
achieving its strategy, annual business  
plan and near-term objectives.
RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
The Board and its committees approve 
policies on key risks and provide direction  
on risk management and appropriate  
risk mitigation. Policies, procedures and 
guidelines are reviewed and updated as 
appropriate and cascaded down through 
line managers and via training sessions. 
Genel Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
RISK MANAGEMENT
Operating effectiveness of controls and 
compliance with policies, procedures  
and guidelines are monitored and 
assessed by the risk owner, with 
independent reviews performed by  
third parties where necessary under  
the Group’s assurance programme.
The Group has a robust system of 
delegated authorities, which ensures 
appropriate senior management  
oversight and involvement in risk 
assessment and decision making.
• Close senior management oversight  
of key areas of the business and  
its day-to-day operations 
• Regular assessment of risk at 
executive committee meetings
• Assignment of the relevant  
executive committee member  
as risk owner for each risk. Risk 
owners are accountable for the 
oversight, assessment and reporting  
of the risk and for monitoring the 
operating effectiveness of any 
mitigating controls
• Regular reporting by risk owners  
to relevant Board committees  
on assessment of risk and any  
relevant controls
• The Board and its committees  
provide specialist oversight of  
the identification, assessment  
and management of relevant risks
• All committees report formally  
to the Board annually on  
risk management and any  
relevant controls

STRATEGIC REPORT

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
In summary, the risks fall into four 
broad categories:
• Commercial risks in relation to the 
business environment in which the 
Group operates
• Political risks in relation to the political, 
social and economic environment of  
the KRI, Iraq and other countries where 
the Group has operations
• Legal and regulatory risks in relation  
to the frameworks governing the 
Group’s operations
• Health, security, safety and environment 
risks which may prevent the Group  
from maintaining positive relationships 
with stakeholders 
It should be noted for completeness, that 
there may be additional risks unknown  
to the Group and other risks, currently 
believed to be immaterial, which could  
turn out to be material. In addition, it 
should be noted that not all of the risks 
and uncertainties set out below are within 
our control.
COMMERCIAL RISKS
THE GROUP’S ESTIMATES OF ITS 
CONTINGENT RESOURCES AND 
PROSPECTIVE RESOURCES CAN 
CHANGE WITH TIME, AND THERE CAN 
BE NO GUARANTEE THAT THE GROUP 
WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP THESE 
RESOURCES COMMERCIALL Y .
The Group operates in a competitive 
industry and its ability to generate returns 
depends on its ability to exploit, develop 
and commercialise present assets, as well 
as to select and acquire suitable assets  
for exploitation, development and 
commercialisation in the future.
If the Group is unable to develop its 
contingent and prospective resources 
there may be material and adverse  
effects on its business, financial conditions, 
results of operations and prospects.
THE GROUP RELIES ON ITS ABILITY  
TO COMPLETE MAJOR PROJECTS ON 
TIME AND WITHIN BUDGET .
The Group is reliant on its completion of 
major projects to maintain its projected 
growth levels. In particular, there is a  
need to ensure projects (including the 
delivery by contractors and suppliers)  
are managed on time and within budget, 
using efficient technologies to achieve  
the required specifications. If projects are 
not executed on time and to budget, the 
planned growth and profitability of the 
Group will not be achieved.
The Group continues to monitor  
the progress of all major projects as 
appropriate. Review outcomes and key 
concerns are reported to the executive 
team, and appropriate actions are agreed. 
Third-party contractor performance is 
continually monitored. However, if a  
third-party fails to meet the Group’s 
performance requirements, there can  
be no guarantee that the Group will be 
able to replace such third party without 
further disruption to the project.
F AILURE OF THE GROUP’S 
EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES TO  
ADD ADDITIONAL COMMERCIALL Y 
VIABLE RESERVES COULD AFFECT  
THE GROUP’S LONG- TERM  
GROWTH STRATEGY .
The Group intends to execute a  
high-impact drilling programme  
over its exploration assets in order  
to de-risk its assets and discover 
commercial hydrocarbons.
Failure to discover commercially viable 
hydrocarbons could have an impact on  
the valuation of the Group and returns 
made to its shareholders.
THE GROUP CANNOT GUARANTEE 
SUCCESSFUL IDENTIFICATION AND 
ACQUISITION OF APPROPRIA TE ASSETS.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had 
significant cash of $700 million and 
intends to use an element of this to 
acquire high-quality assets at an 
appropriate price.
A failure to identify appropriately valued 
high-quality assets could have an impact 
on the valuation of the Group.
POLITICAL RISKS
THE IRAQ OIL MINISTRY HAS 
HISTORICALL Y DISPUTED THE V ALIDITY 
OF PSCS ENTERED INTO BY THE KRG.
The Group has title to assets in the KRI 
pursuant to seven PSCs entered into  
with the KRG. Based on legal advice 
obtained by the Company, the directors 
believe that the Company has good title  
to its oil and gas assets.
However, if the validity of the Groups’ 
PSCs were successfully challenged, the 
Group could be required by the KRG  
to accept contractor entitlements that  
are materially less favourable than the 
current PSCs.
THE GROUP’S PRINCIPAL PRODUCING 
ASSETS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE 
A V AILABILITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND SERVICES, INCLUDING PIPELINES, 
UTILITIES AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES 
IN THE KURDISTAN REGION.
Historically, the Group’s oil production 
from the Taq Taq and Tawke fields  
has been mostly transported by truck, 
which is potentially less safe, secure and 
environmentally sound than transport  
by pipeline. If a major accident causes 
environmental damage, or the KRG 
revokes or amends licences, the Group 
may be restricted from transporting oil  
by truck.
There is a limit to the capacity that can  
be transported by truck from Taq Taq  
and Tawke. If production at either field 
exceeds that limit, the Group may not be 
able to maximise the potential benefits  
of this increase without the new pipeline 
network. The KRG has constructed a new 
pipeline network. The KRG has announced 
that exports through this pipeline are  
likely to begin in the first half of 2014.  
If the availability of the pipeline or other 
infrastructure related to the export route 
is delayed, it could have a material adverse 
impact on the cash flow of the Group.
SET OUT BELOW ARE WHAT WE BELIEVE AT THIS TIME TO BE THE PRINCIPAL 
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD AFFECT THE GROUP . IN RESPECT 
OF EACH OF THESE RISKS, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE 
STRATEGY OF THE GROUP AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT .  44
Genel Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts
The Group has put in place health, safety 
and other procedures to minimise the 
impact of unexpected disruptions to the 
supply of essential services. Disruptions  
in the supply of essential utility services, 
such as water and electricity, could halt or 
delay the Group’s production. Unexpected 
disruptions to the supply of essential utility 
services may cause loss of life, damage to 
the Group’s equipment and delay to the 
recommencement of operations.
THE KRI AND IRAQ HA VE A  
PUBLICISED HISTORY OF POLITICAL 
AND SOCIAL INSTABILITY , WHICH  
IF IT DETERIORATED WOULD 
REPRESENT AN INCREASED RISK TO 
THE OPERA TIONS, REVENUE, SECURITY 
AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE GROUP . 
The Group assesses political, social,  
legal and economic risks as part of its 
evaluation of potential projects. The  
Group actively monitors developments in 
Iraq and the KRI, as well as the economic 
and political relationship between Turkey 
and the KRG. 
The Group continues to have a regular 
dialogue with the KRG and to date has 
established arrangements that have 
provided consistent and reliable revenue 
streams that have allowed the Group to 
operate and develop its existing assets.
The Group has taken measures to protect 
its employees, equipment and other  
assets from security risks. Steps include 
the provision of security personnel and 
surveillance equipment, and the imposition 
of security checks and procedures at the 
sites that it operates. However, there can 
be no guarantee that such measures will 
prove effective against all safety risks.
Should security in the KRI decline or 
diplomatic relations between the KRG,  
Iraq or Turkey deteriorate, this may  
have a negative impact on the Group’s 
operations and potentially impact the  
cash flows, planned growth and valuation  
of the Group. 
F AILURE TO MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS 
WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES, GO VERNMENT 
AND NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANISA TIONS 
COULD ADVERSEL Y AFFECT THE GROUP .
As a consequence of public concerns  
about the perceived ill-effects of  
economic globalisation, businesses 
generally, and large multinational 
corporations in particular, the Group  
faces increasing public scrutiny of its 
activities. The Group’s operations may  
be located in or near communities that 
may regard its operations as detrimental 
to their environmental, economic or  
social circumstances.
Negative community reaction could have  
a negative impact on the Group’s ability to 
operate efficiently or its ability to finance 
an operation. Such reactions could also 
lead to disputes with national or local 
governments or with local communities 
and give rise to disruption to projects or 
operations, or cause material reputational 
damage, which could in turn affect the 
Group’s revenues, results of operations 
and cash flows. 
LEGAL AND  
REGULATORY RISKS
THERE REMAINS AN ONGOING DISPUTE 
BETWEEN THE KRG AND THE IRAQ 
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN RELATION 
TO BOTH MONIES OWED TO THE  
KRG FOR PAST EXPORTS AND THE 
AWARDING OF NEW PSCS. NEW LAWS 
MA Y BE ENACTED IN THE FUTURE, 
GOVERNING THE REGULATION OF  
IRAQI OIL AND GAS RESOURCES.
The dispute between the KRG and Iraqi 
Central Government may require new  
laws and regulations to be introduced to 
resolve the situation. The enactment of 
any new law may alter the regulation  
of oil and gas resources in Iraq and the 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq, reduce the value 
of the Group’s existing PSCs and increase 
the regulatory requirements placed on  
the Group. Additionally, depending on the 
content of any future enacted law, the 
Group’s existing PSCs with the KRG may 
be subject to review or revision of terms. 
Increased legislative requirements could 
mean that the Group incurs additional 
expenditure obligations and have a 
material and adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, financial conditions, results of 
operations and prospects.
THE GROUP MA Y BE UNABLE TO 
OBT AIN OR RENEW REQUIRED DRILLING 
RIGHTS, CONCESSIONS, LICENCES, 
PERMITS AND OTHER AUTHORISA TIONS 
(TOGETHER, LICENCES) OR SUCH 
LICENCES MA Y BE SUSPENDED, 
TERMINATED OR REVOKED PRIOR  
TO THEIR EXPIRATION.
The Group conducts its exploration, 
development and production operations 
pursuant to drilling rights under a  
wide variety of licences. There can  
be no assurance that the KRG will not 
significantly alter the conditions of, or  
that any third-party will not challenge,  
the licences held by the Group.
The Group continues to maintain a  
regular dialogue with its key stakeholders  
in the region, such as the KRG, the  
Turkish government and other regional 
public bodies, and expects to obtain and 
maintain all approvals necessary to 
operate its business.
HSSE RISKS
THE GROUP’S OPERATIONS ARE 
SUBJECT TO GENERAL AND SPECIFIC 
REGULATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS 
GOVERNING WORKPLACE HEAL TH  
AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS, 
ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS, 
SOCIAL IMPACTS, AND OTHER LAWS 
AND REGULATIONS.
The Group’s primary operational safety 
risks are those inherent in the oil and  
gas industry, including the release of 
hydrogen sulphide gas during flaring  
at the Taq Taq field, fires, blowouts, 
explosions, equipment or system  
failures and transportation accidents, 
which may result in death or injury  
to staff or local residents.
Certain of the Group’s operations may  
also create environmental risks in the  
form of spills, the release of gas or soil 
contamination from site operations, 
recycling and waste disposal. 
A health, safety, security or environmental 
incident could lead to the Group having to 
make material changes to its facilities or 
processes and pay compensation to any 
injured parties. There can be no assurance 
that the Group will not incur substantial 
financial obligations, which may lead to  
an adverse effect on the Group’s business, 
financial condition and prospects.
The Group has implemented health,  
safety and environmental policies and 
complies with international environmental 
guidelines for crude oil exploration and 
production, for example those issued by 
the World Health Organization. The Group 
monitors compliance with its health, safety 
and environment policies regularly 
through a reporting system, inspections, 
third-party audits and management site 
inspections as overseen by the Group 
HSSE Committee.

Genel Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The UK Corporate Governance Code was updated in 2012 and  
as a result of the revisions, there are some additional reporting  
and compliance requirements which require companies to give 
enhanced consideration to diversity and environmental matters 
and requires additional reporting by the Audit Committee. There 
have also been significant changes to the regulations that govern 
how companies report on their remuneration arrangements, with 
the introduction of a binding vote on the remuneration policy. As  
a Jersey registered company, we are not required to comply with 
these regulations; however, in the interest of good governance we 
choose to do so voluntarily. The Board and the relevant committees 
have considered the new requirements in detail as part of their 
work during the year. Further details of how they have done so 
are included within the Corporate Governance Report.
We published our first Community Engagement and Investment 
Report in September 2013 demonstrating our commitment to 
the communities in which we operate. We continue to develop  
our policies and framework in this area and plan to publish our 
second report with the Annual Report in 2015.
During 2012, we appointed an independent external consultant  
to assess how the Board and its committees had performed in 
their first year, and to highlight any areas where improvements 
could be made. During 2013, we have taken steps to implement 
the recommended improvements. We continue to monitor our 
effectiveness and this year have completed an internal review 
which builds on the recommendations from the 2012 independent 
review. More details are set out in this report.
RODNEY CHASE, 
CHAIRMAN
HAVING COMPLETED OUR SECOND FULL YEAR OF OPERATION, WE REMAIN COMMITTED 
TO OPERATING TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE TO SUPPORT 
US IN DELIVERING ON OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. THE BOARD, ASSISTED BY THE WORK 
OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE, KEEPS UNDER REVIEW THE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK, RISK 
MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS.
INTRODUCTION FROM  
THE CHAIRMAN 53

GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Our objective remains to create long-term value for shareholders 
through the exploration, development and production of oil and 
gas resources. We have unique assets that are important to the 
growth of many of the world’s economies. In doing this, we have 
committed to a high level of governance and to developing a 
culture that values exemplary ethical standards, personal and 
corporate integrity and respect for others. The Board governs  
the Group consistent with our business strategy and commitment  
to a transparent and high-quality governance system.
Our view is that governance is not just a matter for the Board and 
that a strong governance culture must be fostered throughout 
the organisation. Our expectations of our employees and of  
those with whom we contract business are set out in our Code  
of Conduct, which is summarised below and available on our  
website at www.genelenergy.com
This report aims to provide shareholders with a comprehensive 
summary of the Group’s governance arrangements and an 
explanation of how the Company has complied with the main 
principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code during 2013.
Genel Energy plc is a Jersey-incorporated company with a 
standard listing on the London Stock Exchange. Notwithstanding 
our standard listing, we are committed to complying with the 
regulatory requirements in both Jersey and the UK, together with 
prevailing standards of best practice as if we were a premium 
listed company. We are in full compliance with the provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and intend to comply with 
the provisions of the revised Code during 2014. A copy of the 
Code can be found at www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.cfm
As corporate governance principles continue to evolve, we will 
continue to adopt best practice guidelines as appropriate to our 
business. For example, in 2013 we completed a detailed review of 
our remuneration policy following the changes to The Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the Regulations). We intend  
to comply with these regulations as if we were a UK registered 
company and will be putting our remuneration policy forward  
for approval by shareholders at our upcoming AGM in 2014.
MODEL CODE
We have voluntarily adopted the Model Code for share dealing  
as set out in the Listing Rules. The Board is responsible for  
taking all proper and reasonable steps to ensure compliance  
with the Model Code.
CODE OF CONDUCT
Our Code of Conduct defines what we stand for as a company  
and sets out the principles that guide all of our business  
activities. We strive for operational excellence and aim to  
conduct our business in a responsible, ethical and safe manner  
with the highest standards of financial reporting, corporate 
governance, and compliance with applicable laws. The Code of 
Conduct sets the principles by which we conduct our business  
and how we expect our Board, employees, suppliers, partners  
and others to behave.
SPEAKUP
All employees are encouraged to raise any concerns they may 
have and to report any suspected or known violations of the  
Code of Conduct without fear of retaliation. We operate an 
independently run confidential speak up hotline. All issues  
raised via this route are reported to the Audit Committee.
BUSINESS CONDUCT
We conduct our business in an open, honest and ethical manner.  
We do not tolerate any form of bribery. We aim to ensure that all 
financial and non-financial information created within the Group  
is complete and accurate, and we strive to provide accurate and 
timely information to external stakeholders, including governments 
in the locations in which we operate. We take steps to protect 
against inappropriate use of confidential and privileged information, 
and we aim to protect and use our business assets appropriately.
Our policy is not to make political donations and we have not 
done so in the period under review (2012: nil).

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
We seek to avoid conflicts of interest. We believe it is  
important that the decision making process is not impaired by 
an individual being conflicted by either an actual or a potential 
conflict. However, we recognise that from time to time situations 
may arise which could result in actual or potential conflicts and, 
accordingly, we have a formal system in place enabling directors 
and members of the executive team to declare any such conflicts 
and for those conflicts to be reviewed and, if appropriate, 
authorised by the Board. A register of conflicts is maintained  
by the Company Secretary. The Audit Committee and the Board 
have applied the principles and processes set out above during 
2013 and confirm that they have operated effectively. 
BUSINESS PARTNERS
We maintain high standards of business conduct in our  
dealings with all business partners, to promote mutually  
beneficial relationships and our reputation. We do not seek to  
win or maintain business by acting illegally or contrary to our 
contractual agreements. Our relationships with customers and 
suppliers are conducted on a fair and honest basis. We expect  
our business partners to maintain the same standards of  
business conduct as we adhere to. 
COMMUNITIES AND ENVIRONMENT
Protecting and sustaining the communities and environment  
in which we operate are fundamental to maintaining our 
operating licences and to creating a long-term sustainable 
business. We strive to maintain high standards of environmental 
protection and we do not compromise our environmental values  
for profit or production. We seek to maintain proactive and 
constructive engagement with the local communities affected  
by our operations and assets, and invest to help them develop  
in a sustainable manner. We contribute to socio-economic 
development and provide transparency in respect of our 
contributions and their impact. Further information on how  
we engage with communities can be found in our Community 
Engagement and Investment Report which is available on  
our website at www.genelenergy.com
THE ROLE OF THE BOARD
The Board’s role is to provide leadership in ensuring the  
long-term success of the Company. It is responsible for approving 
the Company’s strategy and the business plan and keeping under 
review the financial and operational resources of the Company.  
It monitors the performance of the business against those 
strategic objectives with the overall objective of creating and 
delivering value to shareholders.
The performance of the Board and the contributions of directors 
to the Board’s decision making processes are essential to fulfilling 
this role. The directors may exercise all the powers of the Company 
subject to the provisions of relevant law, the Company’s articles  
and any special resolution of the Company in the furtherance  
of their role. The Board has reserved certain matters for its  
own consideration and decision making. Authorities have been 
delegated to Board committees and these are set out clearly in each 
Committee’s terms of reference which are available on the website. 
Specific matters reserved for the Board include setting the 
Company’s objectives and business strategy and its overall 
supervision. Significant acquisitions, divestments and other 
strategic decisions will all be considered and determined by the 
Board in accordance with the Company’s delegated authorities 
matrix. The Board provides leadership within a framework of 
prudent and effective controls.

GOVERNANCE
The Board reviews the matters reserved for its decision  
annually, subject to the limitations imposed by the Company’s 
constitutional documents and applicable law.
The Board and its committees have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary and the General Counsel  
and may seek advice from independent experts at the expense  
of the Company as appropriate. Individual directors may also  
seek independent legal advice at the expense of the Company,  
in accordance with the Board’s agreed procedure.
In addition, the Board has extensive access to members of senior 
management, who regularly attend Board meetings by invitation, 
and present to the Board on the performance of the business.
BOARD COMPOSITION 
There are 12 directors on the Board, of whom two are  
executive and ten (including the Chairman) non-executive.  
Seven are independent under the code (including the Chairman 
who was independent on appointment) and five are considered 
not independent.
Further details of the directors and their experience are set out 
on pages 46 to 49 of this Annual Report.
MEETINGS OF THE BOARD
The Board meets around six times each year and schedules  
other meetings as necessary to fulfil its role. During the year  
we held seven meetings in various locations. The Board receives 
regular updates from management on the performance of the 
business against the agreed strategy and on its operations. It has  
a rolling agenda that sets out the key topics for consideration at 
each meeting.
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
There is a clear division of roles between the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Senior Independent Director and the President  
of the Company. 
RODNEY CHASE
CHAIRMAN
Rodney Chase is the Chairman. The Chairman reports  
to the Board and is responsible for the leadership and  
overall effectiveness of the Board and for setting the  
Board’s agenda. Specific responsibilities of the Chairman 
include ensuring the effective running of the Board,  
ensuring that the Board agenda is forward-looking  
with an emphasis on strategic issues and ensuring the 
performance of the Board and its Committees is effective  
and in line with best practice. A culture of openness and 
debate should be encouraged by the Chairman through 
ensuring constructive relations between executive  
and non-executive directors and ensuring effective 
communication between the Group and its shareholders. 
TONY HA YWARD
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Tony Hayward is the Chief Executive Officer. The  
Chief Executive Officer is responsible for all executive 
management matters of the Group. He reports to the 
Chairman and to the Board directly. All of Tony Hayward’s 
direct reports are members of the executive committee 
including the President. Specific responsibilities of the Chief 
Executive Officer include the day-to-day management of  
the Group within delegated authority limits, identifying and 
executing strategic opportunities, managing the Group’s  
risk profile and ensuring appropriate internal controls, 
maintaining a dialogue with the Chairman and the Board  
on important and strategic issues, ensuring the proper 
development of executive directors and senior executives 
and succession planning for executive positions.
JIM LENG
SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
Jim Leng is the Senior Independent Director. The Senior 
Independent Director is available to shareholders who have 
concerns that cannot be addressed through the normal 
channels of the Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer.  
He chairs the Nomination Committee when it is considering 
succession to the role of Chairman and acts as a sounding 
Board for the Chairman and an intermediary for other 
directors if necessary. 
MEHMET SEPIL 
PRESIDENT
Mehmet Sepil currently holds the position of President,  
which he will retain while he holds an executive position 
within the Group. As President, Mr Sepil provides the 
Company with a combination of local expertise, industry 
knowledge and strategic relationships. He plays a leading  
role in government and public affairs and in communications 
and relationships with key stakeholders, such as the KRG,  
the Turkish government and other regional public 
authorities. The President is not a director. He has a full-time 
executive role and reports to the Chief Executive Officer.  56
Genel Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
INDEPENDENCE OF THE BOARD
The independent non-executive directors (Jim Leng, Sir Graham 
Hearne, George Rose, Mark Parris, Chakib Sbiti and Mehmet 
Ög ˘ütçü) make up exactly half the Board and are responsible for 
ensuring that the management and decisions of the Board are 
properly checked and balanced. Rodney Chase (as Chairman)  
was considered independent at the time of his appointment.  
In order to ensure the strongest possible governance the 
independent directors (plus the Chairman) have a voting majority 
over the directors who are not independent. The independent 
directors meet in private session at the end of each scheduled 
Board meeting. 
The directors who are not independent include the founders  
of the Company (Nathaniel Rothschild, Non-Executive Director; 
Tony Hayward, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer; 
and Julian Metherell, Executive Director and Chief Financial 
Officer) plus Gulsun Nazli Karamehmet Williams and Murat Yazici 
who have been nominated for appointment to the Board by Focus 
Investments and Elysion, respectively. 
The Board considers that there is an appropriate balance between 
executive and non-executive, independent and non-independent 
directors, with a view to promoting shareholder interests and 
governing the business effectively. 
BOARD COMPOSITION
There have been no changes to Board composition during the year.
SKILLS, KNOWLEDGE, EXPERIENCE AND ATTRIBUTES  
OF DIRECTORS
The Board considers that a diversity of skills, backgrounds, 
knowledge, experience, perspective and gender is required in 
order to govern the business effectively. The Board and its 
Committees work actively to ensure that the executive and 
non-executive directors continue to have the right balance  
of skills, experience, independence and Group knowledge 
necessary to discharge their responsibilities in accordance  
with the highest standards of governance.
The non-executive directors bring with them international and 
operational experience gained both in the sectors in which we 
operate and in other areas of business and public life. The 
executive directors bring additional perspectives to the Board’s 
work through a deep understanding of the Group’s business. 
Together they oversee strategy for the Group and monitor the 
pursuit of the corporate strategy. All directors are required to 
devote sufficient time and demonstrate commitment to their role.
During the year, Rodney Chase was appointed a director of  
Hess Corporation. Following this appointment, he continues to 
demonstrate a high level of commitment to the Company and to 
devote sufficient time to his role as Chairman of the Company. 
Tony Hayward was appointed interim Non-Executive Chairman  
of Glencore Xstrata plc in May 2013 having previously been the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. This is a temporary 
appointment and the Chairman keeps under review the impact 
this may have on his commitment as CEO of the Company.
OPERATION OF THE BOARD
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that the Board operates 
effectively. The Board has an open style of communication and 
debates issues openly and constructively within an environment 
that encourages healthy debate and challenge both inside and 
outside the boardroom.
The directors receive Board papers and other relevant information 
in a timely manner ahead of meetings. Board papers are delivered 
through an electronic portal that enables directors to access them 
wherever they are in the world. The timely provision of relevant 
information to directors is vital in ensuring they are able to fulfil 
their role of effective oversight and challenge, and for enabling  
the Board to make effective decisions.
DIRECTORS’ INDUCTION AND ONGOING DEVELOPMENT
In order to govern the Group effectively, non-executive directors 
must have a clear understanding of the Group’s overall strategy, 
together with a sound knowledge of the Group and the industry 
within which it operates. 
The Chairman, together with the Company Secretary, is 
responsible for ensuring that all new non-executive directors 
receive a full, formal and tailored induction upon appointment  
to the Board. This includes a detailed overview of the Company 
and its governance practices and meetings with key personnel 
from across the Group in order to develop a full understanding  
of the business, its strategy and business priorities in each area. 
SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE OF THE BOARD 
Oil and Gas – 7 directors
Managing and leading – 11 directors
Governance – 7 directors 
Legal – 2 directors
Financial / Capital Markets – 7 directors
HSSE – 6 directors

GOVERNANCE
BOARD EFFECTIVENESS 
In 2012, we commissioned an independent review of the effectiveness of the Board, its committees and each of the directors, including 
the Chairman. In 2013, we have conducted an internal review of effectiveness which builds on the findings of the 2012 independent 
review. The 2013 review was facilitated by the Company Secretary.
2012 ACTIONS FOR THE YEAR PROGRESS MADE AGAINST THE ACTIONS
BOARD COMPOSITION  
AND BALANCE
Existing Board composition was found  
to be working well and reflected a diverse 
range of depth and breadth of experience 
from existing Board members. It was 
agreed that should the opportunity arise  
to refresh the Board, the Nomination 
Committee would use the opportunity to 
increase the E&P experience and possibly 
female representation on the Board.
The Nomination Committee has continued  
to monitor Board composition during  
the year. A diversity policy has been 
developed that reflects the strong diverse 
culture of the Company, including female 
representation at all levels.
RISK MONITORING  
AND REPORTING
While good progress had been made during 
the year in this area, it was recognised that 
further enhancements could be made to 
the risk reporting process up to the Audit 
Committee and the Board.
A structured risk reporting process up  
to the Audit Committee and Board has  
been developed and regular updates  
are provided by management on the risk 
profile of the Group. The Audit Committee 
chairman is invited to attend committee 
meetings to facilitate oversight of the risks 
and responsibilities assigned to each of 
those committees as part of the risk 
framework of the Group.
STRATEGY It was recognised that the business  
has a clear strategic agenda for business 
development and growth. It was felt that 
the Board would benefit from a half-day 
strategy day to review the current and 
future strategic direction of the business, 
with a particular focus on CSR strategy.
A half-day strategy day was held in 
September 2013, at which the Board 
received a detailed presentation on  
the medium-term strategy. The Board  
was provided with the opportunity to 
challenge and debate the strategy with  
the management team. The Board has 
received a detailed presentation on CSR 
during the year, and the Company’s first 
Community Engagement and Investment 
report was published in September 2013.
BOARD DEVELOPMENT The directors agreed that they would 
benefit from additional education sessions 
throughout the year on both industry and 
business specific matters. These would be 
scheduled into the Board annual calendar 
throughout the year as appropriate. 
Two education sessions were held  
during the year which all directors  
were invited to attend.
2013 ACTIONS FOR THE YEAR
BOARD COMPOSITION  
AND BALANCE
It was agreed that the Nomination Committee would continue to keep Board composition  
under review, including the diversity of the Board and the E&P experience at Board level.
STRATEGY The Board has a clear strategic agenda, against which it continues to deliver. However, it  
was felt that the continued development of its CSR strategy during the year was important. 
BOARD DEVELOPMENT It was felt that the directors would benefit from additional site visits to our assets. It was  
agreed that directors would be invited to accompany management as appropriate.
  58
Genel Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Following the review of each of the directors, the Board  
remains satisfied that all directors remain competent and 
committed to their roles and will therefore be recommending  
that all directors be put forward for re-election at the Company’s 
forthcoming AGM. 
RISK MONITORING AND REPORTING
The Group keeps under constant scrutiny the major risks to  
which its operations in all regions are exposed by leveraging its 
local expertise, industry knowledge and strategic relationships.  
In particular, the Group continues to have a regular dialogue  
with its key stakeholders in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, such  
as the KRG, the Turkish government and other regional public 
bodies. We are forging similar relationships within the Africa 
region to ensure the risks across the Group as a whole are fully 
understood and mitigated.
The Group’s risk management process, established by the 
Executive Committee and endorsed by the Board, is used to 
identify the key risks to the business, the controls by which  
these are managed and how these controls are monitored.  
The Executive Committee reviews and updates the risk 
management process and the risks identified on a quarterly  
basis and the Board reviews these bi-annually.
Further details of the principal risks and uncertainties to which 
the Company’s operations are exposed, and the actions taken  
to manage those risks and uncertainties, are set out at pages 43 
and 44 of this Annual Report.
INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Board is responsible for maintaining and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control. These 
systems are designed to identify, evaluate and manage the 
significant risks to which the Group is exposed. The Board has 
established processes to meet the expectations of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Turnbull Guidance and those  
of a premium listed company. These processes include having 
clear lines of responsibility, documented levels of delegated 
authority and appropriate operating procedures. We recognise 
that the system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate,  
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only 
provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
misstatement or loss. 
The Audit Committee supports the Board in the performance  
of its responsibilities by reviewing those procedures that relate  
to risk management processes and financial controls. The Audit 
Committee considers the reports of the external auditor and 
reports to the Board on such matters as it feels should be  
brought to the Board’s attention.
A detailed budget is produced annually in accordance with our 
financial processes and reviewed and approved by the Board in 
November. Operational reports are provided to the Executive 
Committee on a monthly basis and performance against the 
budget kept under regular review in accordance with the Group’s 
financial procedures manual. The Chief Executive Officer reports  
to the Board on performance and key issues as they arise.
The assessment of controls and risk management processes 
provides a reasonable basis for the Board to make proper 
judgements on an ongoing basis as to the financial position  
and prospects of the Group.
The Board has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the 
system of internal controls for the year ended 31 December 2013 
and up to the date of the signing of the financial statements, and  
is satisfied that it remains appropriate to the business.
COMMUNICATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS
Part of the Group’s Code of Conduct sets a framework for how  
it partners with and invests in communities (local, regional and 
global) to achieve mutual long-term benefits. The Company 
contributes to socio-economic development through taxes, 
royalties and other local payments and donations. Further  
details on our community programmes can be found on  
pages 38 to 41 of this Annual Report and in our Community 
Engagement and Investment Report.
2014 AGM
The 2014 AGM will be held on Tuesday, 22 April 2014 at the  
Sofitel St James, 6 Waterloo Place, London SW1Y 4AN UK at 
11.00am. The Notice of AGM accompanies this Annual Report  
and sets out the business to be considered at the meeting.  
The AGM will provide an opportunity for shareholders to meet 
with the directors and senior management. Both this Annual 
Report and the Notice of AGM are available on our website at 
www.genelenergy.com.
COMMUNICATION WITH INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS
We believe in regular communication with all our shareholders 
and schedule regular presentations, calls and investor trips  
with our investors. We also maintain a dialogue with them  
on an ad hoc basis as and when questions arise.
Our major shareholders are also invited to meet with the 
Chairman to discuss any matters that they would like to raise 
outside the formal investor calendar. Several such meetings  
took place during the year and we welcome an open dialogue  
with our investors. 
The Board receives investor relations updates at each scheduled 
Board meeting covering key investor meetings and activities,  
as well as shareholder and investor feedback. 
We also engage with our shareholders at our AGM and our 
website at www.genelenergy.com
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has established five committees: the Audit Committee, 
the Remuneration Committee, the Nomination Committee,  
the Health, Safety, Security and Environment Committee and  
the Political Risk Committee. These committees have adopted 
terms of reference under which authority is delegated by the 
Board and copies of which are available on our website at 
www.genelenergy.com. Each committee consists only of 
independent non-executive directors.

OBJECTIVES:
• To increase shareholder confidence by ensuring the 
integrity and objectivity of published financial information
• To advise the Board on whether the Annual Report  
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable,  
and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, business model  
and strategy
• To assist the Board in meeting its financial reporting,  
risk management and internal control responsibilities
• To assist the Board in ensuring the effectiveness of the

conflicts of interest between members of the Group and 
the directors, President and/or certain senior managers  
of the Company
PROGRESS:
• Reviewed and received reports from the external auditors 
on the annual financial statements and other published 
financial information; in doing so, the Audit Committee has 
reviewed and discussed the preliminary results and annual 
financial statements with management and the external 
auditors, focusing particularly on:
 — the quality and acceptability of the accounting policies 
and practices and financial reporting disclosures and 
changes thereto
 — areas involving significant judgement, estimation  
or uncertainty
 — the basis for the going concern assumption; 
 — compliance with financial reporting standards and 
relevant financial and governance requirements
 — review of reserves and resources
 — whether the Annual Report taken as a whole is fair 
balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
• Monitored the work of internal audit and received the 
output from audits performed in the period
• Monitored the effectiveness and independence of  
the external auditor
• Reviewed key accounting policies and practices to  
ensure they remain appropriate
• Reviewed the conflicts of interests of directors and  
senior executives
• Reviewed the operation and compliance of the  
Speak Up arrangements for the Group
• Monitored the Company’s Anti-Bribery Policy and  
endorsed the Trade Sanctions Policy
• Reviewed its effectiveness and terms of reference
All the members of the Committee are independent non-
executive directors. The Chairman, George Rose has recent  
and relevant financial experience.
The Committee relies on information and support from 
management to enable it to carry out its duties and 
responsibilities effectively.
The Audit Committee has detailed terms of reference  
which set out its areas of responsibility as detailed above.  
The Company also operates an independent ‘SpeakUp’ hotline  
for all staff and the Committee reviews annually the number  
of matters reported and the outcome of any investigations. 
The significant issues considered by the Committee in relation  
to the 2013 accounts and how these were addressed were:
• depreciation, depletion and amortisation – the Committee 
considered and approved a change in the basis of the 
depreciation charge for oil and gas assets. The Group continues  
to use the unit of production method but now uses the Group’s 
share of actual production as the basis for depreciation rather 
than deriving an estimate of the Group’s share of production  
from revenue entitlement
•  risk reporting – the Committee considered and endorsed a 
paper prepared by management setting out the process for 
oversight and the reporting of risk, controls and assurance  
to the Committee and the Board 
• reserves and resources – a review of the reserves and  
resources was conducted as part of the year-end review 
process. A detailed discussion on process and key judgements 
took place between management and certain non-executives 
directors with industry knowledge. Following the review the 
Committee was satisfied that reserves and resources are 
appropriately reported
INTERNAL AUDIT
KPMG acted as internal auditor to the Company. The Board and 
the Committee together with management have reviewed the 
Company’s approach to internal audit taking into consideration 
the increasing size and complexity of the Group. The current 
arrangements are considered appropriate however, these  
will be kept under regular review during the year. During 2013,  
the Committee received regular reports from KPMG on the 
Group’s internal audit plan and monitored progress against it.  
The Committee meets privately with KPMG without the presence 
of management.
EXTERNAL AUDIT
The effectiveness and the independence of the external auditor  
are key to ensuring the integrity of the Group’s published financial 
information. Prior to the commencement of the audit, the Committee 
reviews and approves the audit plan. PwC present to the Committee 
their proposed plan of work which is designed to ensure that 
there are no material misstatements in the financial statements. 
The Committee monitors and approves the provision of non-audit 
services by the Company’s external auditors. During the year the 
provision of non-audit services policy was updated and supports 
the Committee’s responsibility for monitoring the provision of 
non-audit services and safeguarding the independence of the 
external auditor. The provision of non-audit services is generally 
limited to services that are closely connected to the external audit 
or to projects that require a detailed understanding of the Group 
(for example, taxation advice) which require pre-authorisation by 
the Committee under the terms of the Policy. 60
Genel Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The level of non-audit fees for 2013 was $0.6 million, further 
details of which can be found on page 98 of the notes to the 
financial statements. These fees reflect the services and advice 
provided by PwC in respect of tax and other services during  
the year. PwC have been appointed as the Company’s auditors  
for the past three years following a tendering process in 2011. 
When considering the reappointment of the Company’s external 
auditors, the Committee reviewed the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity and the overall effectiveness  
of the audit process.
At its meeting in February 2014, the Committee reviewed  
the effectiveness of the external audit process. It reviewed  
papers from both management and the external auditors,  
which set out the planning and execution of the audit process.

OBJECTIVES:
• To contribute to the continuance of a high-calibre Board, by:
 — Reviewing the structure, size and composition of the 
Board, having due regard to the Company’s strategic, 
operational and commercial requirements and overall 
diversity of Board members
 — Identifying and nominating suitably qualified candidates 
for appointment to the Board
 — Annually reviewing the time required from non-executive 
directors and making recommendations as to their 
reappointment at the AGM 
 — Keeping under review succession plans for directors  
and other senior executives
 — Reviewing Board committee membership
PROGRESS:
• Developed a diversity policy having due regard to the 
existing cultural diversity within the Company
• Considered executive director succession planning
The Committee meets formally at least twice a year. In between 
formal meetings it provides regular updates to the Board on 
matters of relevance. All the members of the Nomination 
Committee are independent non-executive directors.
The Nomination Committee keeps under review the composition 
and balance of the Board. It assists the Board in ensuring that  
the Board consists of high-calibre individuals whose background, 
skills, experience and personal characteristics will augment the 
present Board and meet its future needs and diversity aspirations. 
Currently there is one female director on the Board and, when 
and if the opportunity arises in the future, we will consider 
candidates based on merit with due regard for the benefits  
of diversity on the Board.
When considering candidates for appointment to the Board, the 
Committee undertakes a comprehensive search process using an 
independent external search agency to consider candidates from 
a wide range of backgrounds and to consider candidates on merit 
and against objective criteria and with due regard for the benefits 
of diversity on the Board. 
The Board and the Company are committed to employing a diverse 
and balanced workforce. Diversity of ideas, skills, knowledge, 
experience, culture, ethnicity and gender are important when 
building an effective and talented workforce at all levels of the 
organisation, including the Board.
The Audit Committee met privately with the external auditors in 
the absence of management for further discussions. Following  
this review, the Audit Committee was satisfied that the external 
auditor remains both effective and independent and on that  
basis we will be recommending their reappointment at the 
forthcoming AGM. 
The Committee reviewed its effectiveness during the year.  
The Committee has also reviewed its terms of reference following 
the publication of the revised UK Corporate Governance Code  
to ensure they reflect its responsibilities in the context of the 
review of internal financial control systems and financial risk 
management systems. The Committee terms of reference  
can be found on our website at www.genelenergy.com 61

GOVERNANCE
All the members of the Committee are independent  
non-executive directors.
Chakib Sbiti was appointed Chairman of the Committee on  
22 April 2013. 
A new Head of HSSE was appointed during the year following  
which a full strategic review of our HSSE strategy and policies  
was completed. The Committee endorsed the updated HSSE 
mid-term strategy and receives regular updates from 
management on progress against that strategy. The HSSE  
policy reflects international best practice including but not  
limited to the IFC Performance Standard and ICMM Sustainable 
Development Framework.
Progress has been made on our CSR strategy during the year  
and we were pleased to have published our first Community 
Engagement and Investment Report in 2013. Regular reports  
on CSR strategy and progress are provided by management  
at each meeting. 
We recognise that good management and governance include  
a strong moral and social commitment to all health, safety and 
environmental matters. As such, the Company’s health, safety 
and environment management system defines the Company’s 
approach to managing its standards across all of its facilities and 
activities. The Committee receives reports from management on 
performance against those systems. 
All the members of the Committee are independent  
non-executive directors. 
Political risk is one of the highest duties of the Board, the  
focus and rigour of which is overseen by the Committee. The 
Committee discusses the changing political landscape in depth 
both at formal meetings and between meetings as appropriate. 
As part of this oversight the Committee Chairman is in regular 
dialogue with management.

JIM LENG,
CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
INTRODUCTION FROM 
THE CHAIRMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE, I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT  
THE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2013.
As a Jersey registered company there is no legal requirement  
for us to prepare our report in accordance with the new UK 
legislation on the disclosure of executive remuneration. However,  
as it is the policy of Genel Energy to comply with the highest 
standards of corporate governance we have chosen to do so 
voluntarily. Consequently we have prepared our report in 
accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended),  
as well as the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code  
and the UK Listing Rules as they apply to premium listed companies. 
We hope that you find this approach both clear and informative.
Our remuneration policy remains unchanged from 2013 in that  
we continue to offer a clear remuneration structure for our 
executives with four components: base salary, a cash supplement  
in lieu of all benefits including pension, an annual cash bonus and 
awards under the Performance Share Plan (PSP).
This remuneration policy has been designed to appropriately 
support the delivery of our strategic objectives. Both the annual 
bonus and PSP have stretching performance targets aligned  
to the Company’s strategy. In addition to provide continuing 
alignment with our shareholders any shares that do vest under 
the PSP are currently subject to a retention period of three years 
following the date of any vesting. 
REMUNERATION FOR 2013
Details of our remuneration decisions for 2013 are set out  
below in the Directors’ Annual Report on Remuneration on  
pages 70 to 74. 
For the year ended 31 December 2013 profit before tax was 
$186.5 million, a 145% increase over the prior year and the 
Company delivered an increase in revenue growth of 4%, which 
was in the middle of market guidance of $300-400 million. 
Additionally, very good progress was also recorded against  
the Company’s strategic priorities. This included a reserve 
replacement ratio of 147%, adding some 280 mmboe of contingent 
resource and net 23 mmboe of 2P resource. Also announced were 
successful discoveries from three exploration wells at Chia Surkh, 
Ber Bahr and Tawke Deep.
Another notable and strategically important milestone was  
the completion of the construction of the KRI pipeline with the 
commencement of oil flowing in December. Three exploration 
wells were also completed in the region. Strong progress on  
the African portfolio included the completion of seismic on  
four licences and spudding the first well in Morocco. None  
of this progress could have been achieved without further  63

GOVERNANCE
REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
This part of the report sets out our Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the Policy). This Policy will be put forward for binding shareholder 
approval at the 2014 AGM as outlined above in the Introduction from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. The effective date 
of this Policy is the date on which the Policy is approved by shareholder vote (i.e. the date of our 2014 AGM). Further details regarding 
the operation of the Policy can be found on pages 70 to 74 of this Annual Report.
The Committee will keep the Policy under review to ensure that it continues to promote the attraction, retention and motivation of  
the high performing executive talent required to deliver the business strategy. It is the Committee’s intention that the Policy be put  
to shareholders for approval every three years. Should any changes be required before the end of a three-year period, the amended 
policy will be put to shareholders, following shareholder consultation as appropriate.
Furthermore, in the event that in any year the Directors’ Annual Report on Remuneration is not approved by shareholders, the 
Committee’s intention is that the Policy will be reviewed and resubmitted to shareholders for approval at the next general meeting.
The Company is incorporated in Jersey rather than the UK. Accordingly, the Company does not have the benefit of the statutory 
protections afforded by the UK Companies Act 2006 in the event that there were to be any inconsistency between this Policy and  
any contractual entitlement or other rights of a director. Therefore, in the event that there were to be any payment which was 
inconsistent with this Policy, the Company would not have the statutory right, under section 226E of the UK Companies Act 2006,  
to recover such payments from its directors.

NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments and payments for loss of office notwithstanding that  
they are not in line with the Policy set out above, where the  
terms of that payment were agreed:
• Before the Policy came into effect; or 
•  At a time when the relevant individual was not a director  
of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the 
payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming  
a director of the Company.
For these purposes “payments” includes the Committee 
satisfying awards of variable remuneration (including awards 
under any of the Company’s share plans) and, in relation to  
an award or option over shares, the terms are “agreed” at the 
time the award is granted.
PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND TARGETS
ANNUAL BONUS
The annual bonus performance measures are designed to provide 
an appropriate balance between incentivising executive directors  
to meet financial targets for the year and to deliver specific 
strategic, operational and personal goals. This balance allows  
the Committee to review the Company’s performance in the 
round against the key elements of our strategy and appropriately 
incentivise and reward the executive directors.
Bonus targets are set by the Committee each year to ensure  
that executive directors are focused on the key objectives for  
the next 12 months. In doing so, the Committee takes into account  
a number of internal and external reference points, including the 
Company’s business plan.
PSP
The ultimate goal of our strategy is to provide long-term 
sustainable returns to shareholders. The Committee currently 
considers that relative TSR is the most appropriate measure  
to assess the underlying financial performance of the business 
while creating maximum alignment with shareholders and 
encouraging long-term value creation. 
MALUS PROVISIONS
Under the PSP and RSP, prior to vesting, the Committee may 
cancel or reduce the number of shares awarded or impose 
additional conditions on an award in circumstances where the 
Committee considers it to be appropriate. Such circumstances  
may include a material misstatement of the Company’s  
audited financial results, a material breach of health and  
safety regulations, a material failure of risk management  
or serious reputational damage to the Company.
Malus provisions are not currently included in the operation  
of the annual bonus. The Committee retains the flexibility to 
introduce this in the future.
PLAN RULES
The PSP and RSP shall be operated in accordance with the rules 
of the plans as approved by shareholders and amended from  
time to time in accordance with those rules. In particular:
• The plan rules provide for adjustments in certain circumstances, 
for example, awards may be adjusted in the event of variation 
of the Company’s share capital, demerger, special dividend, 
reorganisation or similar event;
• In the event of a change of control of the Company, existing 
share awards will vest in line with the plan rules to the extent 
the Committee determines, taking into account the extent to 
which any performance conditions (where applicable) have 
been satisfied and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, 
the time elapsed since that time. The Committee may, in the 
event of a winding-up of the Company, demerger, delisting, 
special dividend or other event which the Committee considers 
may affect the price of shares, allow awards to vest on the 
same basis;
• The performance conditions may be replaced or varied if an 
event occurs or circumstances arise which cause the Committee, 
acting fairly and reasonably, to determine that a substituted or 
amended performance condition would be more appropriate 
(taking into account the interests of the shareholders of the 
Company) provided that the amended performance condition 
would not be materially less difficult to satisfy; and
• The Committee may elect, prior to vesting or exercise in the 
case of options, to deliver the value of vested awards as cash.
REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY
The remuneration policy for our executive directors is designed in 
line with the remuneration principles that underpin remuneration 
across the Group. When making decisions in respect of the 
executive director remuneration arrangements, the Committee 
takes into consideration the pay and conditions for employees 
throughout the Group, including the local inflationary impact for 
the countries in which we operate. As stated in the policy table, 
salary increases are normally made with reference to the average 
increase for the wider employee population.
The Company places a significant focus on variable remuneration, 
ensuring that a meaningful proportion of remuneration across  
all employees is based on performance, through its operation  
of the annual bonus plan throughout the Group and participation 
in share incentive plans.
Genel is committed to strengthening and widening employee 
share ownership by the use of share incentives granted under  
the RSP and the Share Option Plan. As a result approximately 
90% of employees participate in our share plans.
The Committee does not directly consult with our employees  
as part of the process of determining executive pay. However, 
there is wide employee participation in our share plans.  66

RECRUITMENT POLICY
In determining remuneration for new appointments to the Board, 
the Committee will consider all relevant factors including, but not 
limited to, the calibre of the individual and their existing package, 
the external market and the existing arrangements for the 
Company’s current executive directors, with a view that any 
arrangements offered are in the best interests of the Company 
and shareholders and without paying any more than is necessary.
Where the new appointment is replacing a previous executive 
director, salaries and total remuneration opportunity may be 
higher or lower than the previous incumbent. If the appointee  
is expected to develop into the role, the Committee may decide  
to appoint the new executive director to the Board at a lower  
than typical salary. Larger increases (above those of the wider 
employee population) may be awarded over a period of time  
to move closer to market level as their experience develops.  67

GOVERNANCE
Benefits will normally be limited to those outlined in the 
remuneration policy table above. However, additional benefits 
may be provided by the Company where the Committee considers  
it reasonable and necessary to do so. Such circumstances may 
include where an executive director is required to relocate in 
order to fulfil their duties. In such cases, a cash payment higher 
than the 25% of salary that is ordinarily paid would normally be 
provided under the Company’s standard expatriate policy in lieu 
of certain benefits, which may include the provision of a housing 
allowance, education support, health insurance, tax advice, a 
relocation or repatriation allowance and a home leave allowance.
It is expected that the structure and quantum of the variable  
pay elements would reflect those set out in the policy table  
above. However, the Committee recognises that as an 
independent oil and gas company, it is competing with global  
firms for its talent. As a result, the Committee considers it 
important that the recruitment policy has sufficient flexibility  
in order to attract the calibre of individual that the Company 
requires to grow a successful business. Therefore:
• Under the annual bonus, the Committee reserves the right  
to provide either a one-off or ongoing maximum bonus 
opportunity of up to 200% of salary if this is required to  
secure an external appointment
• The Committee would also retain the discretion to flex the 
balance between annual and long-term incentives and the 
measures used to assess performance for these elements, 
whilst maintaining the intention that a significant portion of 
variable pay would be delivered in shares 
• Variable pay could, in exceptional circumstances, be delivered via 
alternative structures, again with the intention that a significant 
portion would be share-based, but in all circumstances subject 
to an ongoing over-riding cap of 600% of salary. This cap 
excludes any awards made to compensate the director for 
incentive awards or any other remuneration arrangements 
forfeited from their previous employer (see below).
The above flexibility will only be used if the Committee believes 
such action is absolutely necessary to recruit and motivate a 
candidate from the global market. The Committee commits  
to explain to shareholders the rationale for the relevant 
arrangements following any appointment. 
Where an executive director is appointed from within the  
Group, the normal policy of the Company is that any legacy 
arrangements would be honoured in line with the original terms  
and conditions. Similarly, if an executive director is appointed 
following an acquisition of or merger with another company, 
legacy terms and conditions would be honoured. 
The Committee retains the discretion to make appropriate 
remuneration decisions outside the standard policy to meet  
the individual circumstances of the recruitment, when an  
interim appointment to fill an executive director role is made  
on a short-term basis or a non-executive director or the  
Chairman takes on an executive function on a short-term basis.
BUY-OUTS
In order to facilitate recruitment, the Committee may  
make a one-off award to ‘buy-out’ incentive awards and any  
other compensation arrangements that a new hire has had  
to forfeit on leaving their previous employer. In doing so, the 
Committee will take into account all relevant factors including  
any performance conditions attached to the forfeited awards,  
the likelihood of those conditions being met, the proportion of  
the vesting/performance period remaining and the form of the 
award (e.g. cash or shares). Where possible, the forfeited awards  
will normally be bought out on an estimated like-for-like basis. 
The Committee is at all times conscious of the need to pay no 
more than is necessary, particularly when determining any 
possible buy-out arrangements.
RECRUITMENT OF CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
In the event of the appointment of a new chairman and/or 
non-executive director, remuneration arrangements will normally  
be in line with those detailed in the relevant table above. 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SERVICE CONTRACTS
The key employment terms and other conditions of the current executive directors, as stipulated in their service contracts are  
set out below.
PROVISION POLICY
NOTICE PERIOD • 12 months’ notice by either the Company or the executive director. This is also the policy for new recruits.
TERMINATION PA YMENT • It is the Company’s policy for new service contracts that it may terminate employment by making  
a payment in lieu of notice (PILON) equivalent to (i) 12 months’ base salary and (ii) the executive 
director’s annual benefit allowance.
• For the current executive directors (Tony Hayward and Julian Metherell) any termination payment  
in lieu of notice is capped at a sum equal to (i) 12 months’ base salary, (ii) the executive director’s 
annual benefit allowance, and (iii) time pro-rated annual bonus, subject to performance conditions 
being met.
• Upon termination by the Company, an executive director has a duty to mitigate, and use reasonable 
endeavours to secure alternative employment as soon as reasonably practicable. In Tony Hayward  
and Julian Metherell’s service contracts, there are specific provisions requiring a reduction in any 
phased PILON payments in the event that they find alternative employment.
REMUNERATION  
AND BENEFITS
• Participation in all incentive plans, including the annual bonus and the PSP, is non-contractual. 
• Outstanding awards will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules. 68
Genel Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The service contract of an executive director may also be 
terminated immediately and with no liability to make payment  
in certain circumstances, such as the executive director bringing 
the Group into disrepute or committing a fundamental breach  
of their employment obligations.
Unless otherwise approved, executive directors may accept only 
one position as a non-executive director of another publicly  
listed company that is not a competitor of the Company, subject  
to prior notification to the Chairman of the Company and the 
approval of the Board or duly authorised committee thereof.
POLICY ON PA YMENT FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
In the event that the employment of an executive director is 
terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in 
accordance with the terms of the service contract between  
the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any 
incentive plans. 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
The Company considers a variety of factors when considering 
leaving arrangements for an executive director, including 
individual and business performance, the obligation for  
the director to mitigate loss (for example by gaining new 
employment) and other relevant circumstances (e.g. ill health).
If the executive director’s employment is terminated by the 
Company, the executive director may receive a time pro-rated 
bonus, subject to Remuneration Committee discretion.
The treatment of the outstanding share awards is governed by 
the relevant share plan rules. The following table summarises the 
leaver provisions of share plans under which executive directors 
may currently hold awards.

• The vesting date for such awards will  
normally be the original vesting date,  
although the Committee has the flexibility  
to determine that awards can vest upon 
cessation of employment
• In the event of death, all unvested awards  
will normally vest at that time to the extent

CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT
The Chairman and non-executive directors have letters of appointment which set out their duties and responsibilities. They do not have 
service contracts with either the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 
The key terms of the appointments are set out in the table below.
PROVISION POLICY
PERIOD • In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Chairman and all non-executive directors are subject to 
annual re-election by shareholders at each AGM
• After the initial three-year term, the Chairman and the non-executive directors are typically expected to serve  
a further three-year term
TERMINATION • The appointment of the Chairman and non-executive directors is terminable by either the Company or the 
director by giving three months’ notice 
• The Chairman and non-executive directors are not entitled to any compensation upon leaving office 69

(a)   For non-executive directors, the amount shown in the table represents the fees paid by the Company in respect of the 2013 financial year , regardless of the time of 
payment. At the time of the IPO, the Chairman and certain independent non-executive directors subscribed for placing shares at the placing price of £10 per share. 
They all elected to use their own funds and a proportion of their standard basic fee for the first two years of appointment to pay the subscription price. Accordingly, 
they were not eligible to receive the standard basic fee until 2 June 2013. They remained eligible to receive additional Committee Chairmanship fees during that 
period where applicable. The Chairman of the Board received the difference between his current fee of £260,000 p.a. and his original fee of £150,000 p.a.
(b)  Chakib Sbiti was appointed on 19 April 2012.
Tony Hayward serves as the interim Non-Executive Chairman of Glencore Xstrata plc for which he received and retained fees of 
£508,693 in 2013. Julian Metherell is non-executive director of GASLOG LNG Shipping for which he received and retained fees of

ANNUAL BONUS
The 2013 annual bonus was measured against five key areas as 
shown in the table below:
Bonus performance measures Percentage
Operational and financial 35%
Strategic objectives specific to the individual 30%
Safety and environment 15%
Build operational capability through people 15%
Corporate social responsibility 5%
Based on the Company’s strong performance against  
operational and financial targets and a high level of individual 
performance from both executive directors in achieving key 
strategic milestones, the Committee determined that bonuses  
for 2013 should be awarded at 95% of maximum.
The specific targets are considered commercially sensitive so 
have not been disclosed. However, the Committee is committed 
to providing shareholders with as much context as possible on 
performance against the targets and the resulting outturns  
within commercial constraints. 
Therefore the diagram below provides an indication of performance 
against each of the five key areas and further detail on performance 
is set out in the Introduction from the Remuneration Committee 
Chairman and in the Strategic Report. There was maximum 
performance in four areas, but the safety and environmental 
element did not pay out in full.

SCHEME INTERESTS AWARDED DURING THE FINANCIAL YEAR
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN AWARDS
PSP awards are granted in the form of nil-cost options over 
shares in the Company with the number of options granted 
determined by reference to a percentage of base salary. The  
2013 awards were based on a face value of 150% of salary for  
the CEO and 140% of salary for the CFO at the time of award.
The Committee decided that, for the 2013 awards, it will continue  
to measure the performance of the Company against that of its 
sectoral peers using a relative TSR measure. The Committee 
consider that TSR is the most appropriate measure to create 
maximum alignment with shareholders and encourage long-term 
value creation. The sectoral peer group for the 2013 PSP awards 
consisted of the constituents of the FTSE 350 Oil and Gas 
Producers Index as at the time of award, namely:
Afren Essar Energy Royal Dutch Shell
BG Group Heritage Oil Salamander Energy
BP Ophir Energy SOCO International
Cairn Energy Premier Oil Tullow Oil

The percentage change in annual bonus for all employees

effect of reducing the average percentage change in annual 
bonus for all employees. 
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPEND ON PA Y
The table below illustrates the current year and prior year  
overall expenditure on pay. The regulations require that we 
report distributions received by shareholders. It is currently  
the Company’s policy not to pay dividends and accordingly  
there is no basis for making this comparison. 
The figures presented have been calculated on the  
following bases:
• Overall expenditure on pay – represents total staff costs from

IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2014
This section provides an overview of how the Committee is 
proposing to implement our remuneration policy in 2014.
BASE SALARY
In determining executive director salary increases for 2014, the 
Committee took into consideration a number of factors including:
• The individual’s skills and experience
• Business performance
•  Salary levels for similar roles within the industry
•  Pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee has decided that a salary increase of 3% would 
be made with effect from 1 January 2014 in line with other 
employees. The table below shows base salaries from that date.
Base salary from 
1 Jan 2014
T ony Hayward £685,000
Julian Metherell £475,000
BENEFITS
As outlined above, executive directors receive an additional 
payment in lieu of all benefits, including pension, private  
health insurance, life assurance and company car provision.
For 2014, the cash allowance remains set at 25% of base salary. 
The table below shows the resulting cash allowances for 2014.
Benefits 
allowance
£
T ony Hayward £171,250
Julian Metherell £118,750
ANNUAL BONUS
The target bonus for executive directors for 2014 remains at 
100% of base salary, with a maximum opportunity of 150% of 
base salary.
For 2014, the performance of each executive director will  
be measured 70% against Group metrics and 30% against 
individual performance. The Group metrics will be measured 
against four key areas as shown in the following table:
Bonus performance measures Percentage
Operational and financial 35%
Safety and environment 15%
Build operational capability through people 15%
Corporate Social Responsibility 5%
The specific targets are considered commercially sensitive so 
have not been disclosed. However, the Committee is committed 
to providing shareholders with as much context as possible on 
performance against the targets and the resulting outcomes 
within commercial constraints.
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
PSP awards are granted in the form of nil-cost options over 
shares in the Company with the number of options granted 
determined by reference to a percentage of base salary. 
The 2014 awards, as for prior awards, will be based on a face 
value of 150% of base salary for the CEO and 140% of base  
salary for the CFO at the time of award.
The Committee continues to consider that TSR is the most 
appropriate measure to create maximum alignment with 
shareholders and encourage long-term value creation. The 
vesting of the award will therefore again be determined  
based on the Company’s relative TSR to a sectoral peer  
group consisting of the constituents of the FTSE 350 Oil  
and Gas Producers Index as at the time of award.
The vesting schedule will remain the same as for awards  
made in 2013, as outlined on page 71. 74

ADVISERS TO THE COMMITTEE
The Committee has appointed Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”)  
to provide independent advice on remuneration matters  
under consideration by the Committee. They were appointed  
by the Committee as it was felt they had the most relevant 
experience and expertise to advise the Committee on 
remuneration related matters. During 2013, this included the 
review of the Remuneration Policy under the new regulations,  
the review of executive salary levels against the market and 
performance monitoring of the Group’s Share Plans. 
Deloitte is a leading remuneration advisor and a member of  
the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such voluntarily 
operates under the Code of Conduct in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting in the UK. Deloitte have also provided 
support and advice to the company in respect of employment 
arrangements for new employees below Board level during the 
year. The Committee is satisfied that the advice they have 
received has been objective and independent. Deloitte’s fees in 
respect of the advice to the Committee in the year under review 
were £64,050 and were charged on the basis of their standard 
terms of business for the advice provided.
The Committee also consulted during the year with the Chairman 
(Rodney Chase), CEO (Tony Hayward), CFO (Julian Metherell)  
HR Director (Martha Desmond), the General Counsel (Stephen 
Mitchell) and the Company Secretary (Sarah Robertson).  
No member of the Committee nor any party from whom  
advice was sought participated in discussions regarding their  
own remuneration.

GOVERNANCE
FOUNDER SECURITIES
FOUNDER SECURITIES
Prior to admission, the founders (including Nathaniel Rothschild, 
Tony Hayward and Julian Metherell) were issued C shares in 
Vallares Holding Company Limited (since renamed Genel Energy 
Holding Company Limited), known as founder securities.
These founder securities were put in place to encourage the 
founders to grow the Company following an acquisition in order 
to maximise value for holders of ordinary shares by entitling the 
founders to a share of the upside in the Company’s value once 
certain performance has been achieved. The performance 
conditions are summarised below. 
If within four years of the acquisition of Genel Enerji AS (i.e. by  
21 November 2015) the closing price per ordinary share of the 
Company reaches for the period of any 20 trading days out of  
30 successive days the higher of:
• a compound rate of return of 8.5% on the admission value  
of £10, measured from the date of the completion of the 
acquisition; or
• an increase of 25% from the admission value of £10, adjusted 
for any matters which have an impact on the capital structure 
of the Company,
(in each case, the Threshold Price), or there is a change of control  
in the Company resulting from an offer above the Threshold Price 
the founders have the right to exchange their founder securities  
for ordinary shares in the Company to a value of 15% of the 
increase in value from the placing admission value of £10. The 
performance condition is also deemed satisfied if a founder is 
removed from the Board other than for cause. The Company  
has the option to settle founder securities by issuing shares  
or the equivalent in cash.
The founder securities were deemed to have vested immediately 
as no performance conditions exist in relation to their vesting. 
However, as explained above, there are performance conditions 
which need to be met prior to exchanging the founder securities 
for ordinary shares. 
The interests of the directors in the founder securities as at  
31 December 2013 are set out in the table below:
Interests in founder securities

at 31 December 2013
No. of  
founder

Percentage of

T ony Hayward 560,000 5.6
Julian Metherell 560,000 5.6
Nathaniel Rothschild 5,313,825 53.14
Other 3,566,175 35.66
1.  Genel Holding, Focus Investments and certain other former investors 
in Genel Enerji AS (sellers) held 3,000,000 founder securities as of  
31 December 2013, representing 30% of the issued founder securities.  
If the market price of the ordinary shares exceeds £20 per share for 
20 trading days out of any 30 successive trading days, the aggregate 
interests of the sellers in the founder securities will be increased from 
30% to 40% and the interests of the other persons interested in  
founder securities will be reduced accordingly.
There have been no changes to directors’ interests in founder 
securities between 31 December 2013 and 5 March 2014. 76

(i)  a transfer of voting ordinary shares to a person who is  
not a Seller or an Affiliate of any Seller; or

of suspended voting ordinary shares as referred to below, as

memorandum or articles of association. Accordingly, the 
memorandum of association of a Jersey company does  
not contain an objects clause. 
Certain provisions have been incorporated into the articles  
of association to enshrine rights that are not conferred by  
the Jersey Companies Law, but which the Company believes 
shareholders would expect to see in a company listed on  
the London Stock Exchange.
Provisions in the articles of association also require shareholders 
to make disclosures pursuant to Chapter 5 of the Disclosure  
and Transparency Rules, and require the directors to comply  
with Chapter 3 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and 
themselves to require any persons discharging managerial 
responsibilities (within the meaning ascribed in the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules) in relation to the Company who are  
not Directors to do so, and to use reasonable endeavours to 
procure that their own and such persons’ connected persons  
do so. The articles of association may be amended by a special 
resolution of the shareholders.
The Company is considering making amendments to its articles  
of association. Please see the Notice of Meeting accompanying 
this Annual Report for further details. 
APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF DIRECTORS
The rules for the appointment and replacement of directors  
are set out in the articles of association. Certain additional

AGREEMENTS WITH SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDERS
MERGER AGREEMENT
On 7 September 2011, the Company, Elysion Energy Holding  
B.V. (formerly Genel Energy Holdings B.V.), Focus Investments  
and PRM entered into the Merger Agreement pursuant to  
which the Company agreed to purchase, and the Sellers agreed  
to sell, the entire issued ordinary share capital of Genel Energy 
International Limited in consideration for the issue of 130,632,522 
ordinary shares (the “Consideration Shares”). The Merger 
Agreement was amended by a deed of amendment entered  
into on 29 October 2011.
Due to the size of the interest the Sellers have in the Company 
following completion, the Sellers agreed that part of the 
consideration they received under the Merger Agreement would 
be in the form of suspended voting ordinary shares in order to 
ensure that the Sellers’ aggregate holding of voting ordinary 
shares does not exceed the Maximum Voting Percentage. The 
suspended voting ordinary shares will automatically convert into 
voting ordinary shares in the event of further equity issues by  
the Company, provided that, following conversion, the Sellers’ 
holding of voting ordinary shares does not exceed the Maximum 
Voting Percentage.
Notwithstanding any other restriction or obligation under the 
Merger Agreement, PRM was permitted to distribute all ordinary 
shares owned by it to its shareholders in proportion to the  
shares in PRM held by such shareholders, which it duly made on  
8 April 2013. In connection with this distribution, the relevant PRM 
shareholders agreed to be bound by the terms of the  
Merger Agreement.
RELATIONSHIP AGREEMENT
On 7 September 2011, the Company, Elysion and Focus 
Investments entered into a relationship agreement which  
regulates the ongoing relationship between Elysion, Focus 
Investments and the Company (the “Relationship Agreement”).
The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to

Emin Karamehmet.
The Relationship Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of 
(i) the Company ceasing to have any of its ordinary shares listed

each of its Associates will:
 (i)  conduct all transactions and relationships with any 
member of the Group, and ensure that all arrangements 
and agreements between either of them or any of their 
Associates and the Company or any other member of 
the Group are entered into, on arm’s length terms and 
on a normal commercial basis;
 (ii)  not take any action which precludes or inhibits any 
member of the Group from carrying on its business 
independently of each of Elysion and Focus Investments 
and their respective Associates;
 (iii)  not exercise any of its Voting Rights to procure any 
amendment to the articles of association which would 
be inconsistent with or breach any provision of the 
Relationship Agreement;

Rules applies to the Company, abstain from voting on any 
resolution required by paragraph 11.1.7R(3) of the Listing 
Rules to approve a “related party transaction” (as defined 
in paragraph 11.1.5R of the Listing Rules) involving Elysion  
or Focus Investments or any of their Associates as the  
related party;
 (v)  comply with all provisions of the Listing Rules, the

by the Group in respect of such transaction would exceed 
US$1.5 billion (or its equivalent in any other currency at 
the prevailing exchange rates), unless Elysion and Focus 
Investments otherwise give their prior written consent,

in order to obtain prior approval for the proposed 
transaction from the Company’s shareholders and ensure 
that any agreement effecting the proposed transaction 
is conditional on that approval being obtained; and
(g)  For so long as Elysion or Focus Investments together with

Company shall procure that Elysion and Focus Investments

comply with their legal or tax obligations as a shareholder  
of the Company.

(as defined in the Merger Agreement) of Elysion that 
holds any ordinary shares) ceases to be controlled  
by Mehmet Sepil; or

in aggregate, 10% or more of the Voting Rights.

GOVERNANCE
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
The directors prepare financial statements for each financial  
year. The directors are required by the IAS Regulation to prepare 
the Group Financial Statements under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. 
The directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing the financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a  
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users  
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and 
• make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as  
a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any  
time the financial position of the Group.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in Jersey or the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group  
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole; 
• the management report, which is incorporated into the 
Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development  
and performance of the business and the position of the  
Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation  
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO  
THE MEMBERS OF GENEL ENERGY PLC 
Genel Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
82 
  
OUR OPINION  
In our opinion the Group financial statements (defined below): 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit and cash 
flows for the year then ended; 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the European Union; and 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. 
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say  
in the remainder of this report. 
WHAT WE HAVE AUDITED 
The Group financial statements, which are prepared by  
Genel Energy plc, comprise: 
 the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2013; 
 the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 
the year then ended; 
 the consolidated statement of changes in equity and cash 
flow statement for the year then ended; and 
 the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which 
include a summary of significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union. 
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting 
framework have been presented elsewhere in the Annual 
Report and Accounts (Annual Report), rather than in the 
notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced 
from the financial statements and are identified as audited. 
WHAT AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INVOLVES  
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & Ireland)). 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: 
 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; 
 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and  
 the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited Group financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing  
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the  
implications for our report. 
OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH 
MATERIALITY 
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped  
us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements  
both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole  
of $43.5million which represents approximately 1% of total 
assets. In addition, we applied a materiality of $7million  
to specific items in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report  
to them misstatements identified during our audit above 
$2.2million as well as misstatements below that amount that, 
in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 
OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
The Group is structured along two business segments being 
the geographical areas in which it operates: Kurdistan and 
Africa. The Group financial statements are a consolidation of 
reporting units, comprising the Group’s operating businesses 
in these segments and centralised functions. 
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be performed at 
the reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for 
our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. 
Accordingly, of the Group's 19 reporting units, we identified  
2 which, in our view, required an audit of their complete 
financial information, either due to their size or their risk 
characteristics. Specific audit procedures on certain balances 
and transactions were performed on 6 other reporting units. 
This, together with additional procedures performed at the 
Group level, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion 
on the Group financial statements as a whole. 
AREAS OF PARTICULAR AUDIT FOCUS 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors made  
a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect  
of significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. We primarily focused our work in these areas  
by assessing the directors’ judgements against available 
evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the 
disclosures in the financial statements. 
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using 
sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we 
considered necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us  
to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence through 
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures 
or a combination of both. 
We considered the following areas to be those that required 
particular focus in the current year. This is not a complete list 
of all risks or areas of audit focus identified by our audit.  
We discussed these areas of focus with the Audit Committee. 
Their report on those matters that they considered to be 
significant issues in relation to the financial statements  
is set out on page 59.

STRATEGIC REPORT

Area of focus  How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus 
RISK OF FRAUD IN REVENUE RECOGNITION  
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in  
revenue recognition because of the pressure management 
may feel to achieve the planned results. 
We assessed the design of the Group’s key controls over 
revenue recognition. We tested the timing of revenue 
recognition taking into account the terms of the Production 
Sharing Contracts (PSCs) and in particular considered  
whether the Group appropriately recorded revenue based  
on the terms of the PSCs. 
We assessed judgements made by management for the 
revenue recognition of export revenues. 
We also performed testing on revenue journal entries. 
RISK OF MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF INTERNAL CONTROLS 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this. 
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group
including the ‘tone at the top’ arrangements for staff to 
“whistleblow” inappropriate actions, and interviewed  
senior management. 
We examined the significant accounting estimates and 
judgements relevant to the financial statements for evidence 
of bias by management or the directors that may represent  
a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We also tested 
key reconciliations and manual journal entries, including 
checking whether journals were approved, and whether 
reconciling items and journals were supported by  
appropriate documentation. 
ESTIMATION OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES 
Incorrect estimation of oil and gas reserves, and future 
development costs, as well as net entitlement may lead to 
misstated financial information, in particular, the depletion 
charge calculated based on UoP (unit of production) models 
and management’s assessment of impairment of the  
Group’s oil and gas assets. 
We held discussions with management to understand the 
movement in 2P (proved and probable) reserves.  
To support any movement in reserves, we read reports 
provided by external consultants (competent person reports) 
which showed independent reserve evaluations. We assessed 
the external consultant’s expertise, qualifications, the scope  
of work and the assumptions used. 
We focused our testing on areas of the financial statements 
including the valuation of property plant and equipment  
and intangible assets and the accuracy of the depletion, 
depreciation and amortisation charge (DD&A) where the 
reserves impact is pervasive. 
CHANGE IN BASIS OF THE DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION 
AND AMORTISATION (DD&A) CHARGE 
Depreciation continues to be based on the UoP method but 
now uses the Company’s share of actual production as the 
basis for depreciation rather than deriving an estimate of  
the Company’s share of production from revenue entitlement 
under the PSCs. 
We focused on this because this change in estimate is  
material and involved management judgement. 
We discussed with management the new basis used to 
account for the DD&A charge and evaluated the treatment  
as a change in estimate against the requirements of IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union. In addition, we have tested 
the new and old calculations, including agreement of the 
calculation schedules to supporting evidence such as  
reserves and production figures. 
We compared the old basis of the DD&A charge calculation  
to analyse the effect of the change of estimate and checked 
the disclosure of the change.

GOING CONCERN 
The directors have voluntarily complied with Listing Rule 
9.8.6(3) of the Financial Conduct Authority and provided  
a statement on going concern, set out on page 37, required  
for companies with a premium listing on the London  
Stock Exchange. 
The directors have requested that we review the voluntary 
statement on going concern as if the company were  
a premium listed company. We have nothing to report  
having performed our review. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, set out on page 81, the 
directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the 
Group’s financial statements using the going concern basis of 
accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group 
has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the 
directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date 
the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we 
have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis is appropriate. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to  
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS 
In our opinion: 
 the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements; and 
 the information given in the Corporate Governance 
Statement set out on pages 52 to 61 in the Annual Report 
with respect to internal control and risk management 
systems and about share capital structures is consistent 
with the financial statements. 
OTHER MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED  
TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION 
ADEQUACY OF INFORMATION AND EXPLANATIONS RECEIVED 
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit. We 
have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 
On page 81 of the Annual Report, as required by the Code 
Provision C.1.1, the directors state that they consider the 
Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
members to assess the Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy. On page 59, as required by C.3.8 of the Code, 
the Audit Committee has set out the significant issues that it 
considered in relation to the financial statements, and how 
they were addressed. Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 the statement given by the directors is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group acquired in 
the course of performing our audit; or 
 the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the 
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from  
this responsibility. 
OTHER INFORMATION IN THE ANNUAL REPORT 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to  
you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is: 
 materially inconsistent with the information in the  
audited Group financial statements; or 
 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired  
in the course of performing our audit; or 
 is otherwise misleading. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from  
this responsibility. 
MATTERS ON WHICH WE HAVE AGREED TO REPORT  
BY EXCEPTION 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
The Company voluntarily provides the disclosures relating  
to directors’ remuneration required by the Listing Rules  
of the Financial Conduct Authority as it if were a premium 
listed company and the directors have requested that we 
review the elements of the report to shareholders by the 
Board of directors’ remuneration specified for auditor review 
by the Listing Rules. We have nothing to report having 
performed our review.  
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 
The Company prepares a Corporate Governance Statement  
in accordance with the Disclosure Rules and Transparency 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and has chosen 
voluntarily to comply with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. The directors have requested that we review the  
parts of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to  
the Company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for auditor review by 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority as if the 
Company were a premium listed company. We have nothing  
to report having performed our review. 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL  
STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT  
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND THOSE OF THE DIRECTORS

Statement set out on page 81, the directors are responsible

and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The consolidated financial statements of Genel Energy Plc 
(the Group) have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted  
by the European Union (IFRS) and interpretations issued  
by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) are prepared 
under the historical cost convention and comply with Jersey 
company law. The significant accounting policies are set  
out below and have been consistently applied throughout  
the period. 
Items included in the financial information of each of the 
Group‘s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates 
(the functional currency). The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in US dollars to the nearest  
million ($m) rounded to one decimal place, except where 
otherwise indicated.  
For explanation of the key judgements and estimates made  
by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies, 
refer to significant accounting estimates and judgement on 
pages 93 and 94. 
GOING CONCERN 
At the time of approving the consolidated financial 
statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation  
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and  
therefore its consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis. 
FOREIGN CURRENCY 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the 
functional currency of the relevant entity using the  
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions  
or at the balance sheet date where items are re-measured. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at 
period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income within finance income or 
finance costs, except when deferred in other comprehensive 
income as qualifying cash flow hedges or qualifying net  
investment hedges. 
CONSOLIDATION  
The consolidated financial statements consolidate  
the Company and its subsidiaries and proportionately  
consolidate its interest in joint ventures. These accounting 
policies have been adopted by all Group companies.  
SUBSIDIARIES 
Subsidiaries are the entities that the Group has the power  
to govern the financial and operating policies, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the 
voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting 
rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are 
considered when assessing whether the Group controls 
another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from  
the date on which control is transferred to the Group.  
They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. 
Transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions 
between Group companies are eliminated. 
JOINT VENTURES 
The majority of the Group’s exploration, development and 
production activities are conducted through joint ventures 
with partners under Joint Operating Agreements (JOAs) 
which are contractual arrangements that establish  
shared control. 
Jointly-controlled entities are those entities where the  
sharing of control is established by contractual agreement 
and decisions about the relevant activities require the 
unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The Group 
reports its interests in jointly-controlled entities using the 
proportionate consolidation method of accounting. The 
Group’s proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses of jointly-controlled entities is included within 
the equivalent items in the consolidated financial information 
on a line-by-line basis. 
Jointly-controlled operations are joint arrangements  
whereby the parties that have joint control of the 
arrangement have rights to the gross assets and liabilities  
of the arrangement and where no separate legal entity  
exists. Control is established through contractual agreement 
and decisions about the relevant activities require the 
unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The  
Group’s proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses of jointly controlled operations are included 
within the equivalent items in the consolidated financial 
information on a line-by-line basis. 
ACQUISITIONS 
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting  
to account for business combinations. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed  
in a business combination are measured at their fair  
values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises  
any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value  
at time of recognition or at the non-controlling interest‘s 
proportionate share of net assets. Acquisition-related  
costs are expensed as incurred. 
FARM-IN/FARM-OUT  
Farm-out transactions relate to the relinquishment of an 
interest in oil and gas assets in return for services rendered 
by a third party or where a third party agrees to pay a portion 
of the Group’s share of the development costs (cost-carry). 
Farm-in transactions relate to the acquisition by the Group  
of an interest in oil and gas assets in return for services 
rendered or cost-carry provided by the Group.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
CONTINUED 
 
Farm-in/farm-out transactions undertaken in the development 
or production phase of an oil and gas asset are accounted  
for as an acquisition or disposal of oil and gas assets. The 
consideration given is measured as the fair value of the 
services rendered or cost-carry provided and any gain or  
loss arising on the farm-in/farm-out is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income. A profit is recognised  
for any consideration received in the form of cash to the 
extent that the cash receipt exceeds the carrying value  
of the associated asset. 
Farm-in/farm-out transactions undertaken in the exploration 
phase of an oil and gas asset are accounted for on a no 
gain/no loss basis due to inherent uncertainties in the 
exploration phase and associated difficulties in determining 
fair values reliably prior to the determination of commercially 
recoverable proved reserves. 
Exploration and evaluation assets are recognised in  
respect of cost-carries where the Group is entitled to  
recover the carried costs for its own account through the  
PSC reimbursement mechanism. The recognition of income  
arising from the recognition of exploration and evaluation 
assets in this way is deferred until the asset reaches the 
production phase. 
Where cost-carries are related to the forgiveness of other 
obligations, such as a royalty granted by the third party as 
part of the farm-in arrangement, the associated income is 
recognised in a manner consistent with the related obligation. 
SEGMENTAL REPORTING  
IFRS 8 requires the Group to disclose information about  
its business segments and the geographic areas in which  
it operates. It requires identification of business segments  
on the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed  
by the entity’s chief operating decision maker in order  
to allocate resources to the segment and assess its 
performance. The Group has two reportable business 
segments: Kurdistan and Africa. These are described  
in note 2.  
INTANGIBLE ASSETS  
EXPLORATION ASSETS 
Exploration assets are explained under oil and gas assets 
in property, plant and equipment below. 
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Other intangible assets (predominately software) that are 
acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses. 
Amortisation is charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of intangible assets from the date they are available for use, 
unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an 
indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested  
for impairment at each balance sheet date.  
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
Property, plant and equipment comprises the Group’s tangible 
oil and gas assets together with leasehold improvements  
and other assets and is carried at cost, less any accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost 
includes purchase price and construction costs together  
with borrowing costs where applicable for qualifying assets. 
Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets  
are available for their intended use. 
OIL AND GAS ASSETS 
Costs incurred prior to obtaining legal rights to explore  
are expensed immediately to the statement of  
comprehensive income. 
Exploration, appraisal and development expenditure is 
accounted for under the successful efforts method. Under  
the successful efforts method only costs that relate directly  
to the discovery and development of specific oil and gas 
reserves are capitalised as exploration and evaluation assets 
within intangible assets. Costs of activity that do not identify 
oil and gas reserves are expensed. 
All lease and licence acquisition costs, geological and 
geophysical costs and other direct costs of exploration, 
evaluation and development are capitalised as intangible 
assets or property, plant and equipment according to their 
nature. Intangible assets comprise costs relating to the 
exploration and evaluation of properties which the directors 
consider to be unevaluated until reserves are appraised as 
commercially viable, at which time, following an impairment 
review, they are transferred to property, plant and equipment 
and reclassified as development assets. Where properties are 
appraised to have no commercial value, the associated costs 
are expensed as an impairment loss in the period in which  
the determination is made. 
Development expenditure on producing assets is  
accounted for in accordance with IAS 16 - Property, plant 
and equipment.  
Assets are depreciated once they are available for use  
and are depleted on a field-by-field basis using the unit of 
production method. The depreciation is calculated according 
to the Group’s share of production compared to its share of 
proved and probable reserves under the terms of the relevant 
PSC. The calculation of depreciation under the unit of 
production method takes account of estimated future 
development costs. Changes to depreciation rates as a result 
of changes in reserve quantities and estimates of future 
development expenditure are reflected prospectively.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
91
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost, less 
estimated residual value, over the estimated useful lives  
of the assets using the straight-line method: 
Motor vehicles 5 years 
Computer equipment 3 years 
Other equipment  3-5 years 
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment 
and their residual values are reviewed on an annual basis  
and, if necessary, changes in useful lives are accounted  
for prospectively. The gain or loss arising on the disposal  
or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount  
of the asset and is recognised in the statement  
of comprehensive income for the relevant period. 
SUBSEQUENT COSTS 
The cost of replacing part of an item of property and 
equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item  
if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied 
within the part will flow to the Group, and its cost can be 
measured reliably. The net book value of the replaced  
part is expensed. The costs of the day-to-day servicing  
and maintenance of property, plant and equipment are  
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
LEASES 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards 
of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases  
(net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged 
to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line 
basis over the period of the lease. 
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 
CLASSIFICATION 
The Group assesses the classification of its financial  
assets and liabilities on initial recognition as either at fair 
value through profit and loss, loans and receivables; or 
available for sale. 
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised 
at fair value on the trade-date – the date on which the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans and receivables 
are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.  
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for  
crude oil sales, sales of gas or services performed in the 
ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one 
year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business 
if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they  
are presented as non-current assets. 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value  
and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the  
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. 
 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
In the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement 
of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in 
hand, deposits held on call with banks, other short-term  
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three 
months or less and includes the Group’s share of cash held  
in joint operating ventures. 
INTEREST-BEARING BORROWINGS 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of 
transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
carried at amortised cost; any difference between the 
proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption  
value is recognised in the statement of comprehensive  
income over the period of the borrowings using the  
effective interest method. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are 
recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent  
that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn 
down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down 
occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable 
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee  
is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and 
amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates. 
Borrowings are presented as long or short-term based on  
the maturity of the respective borrowings in accordance with 
the loan or other agreement. Borrowings with maturities of 
less than twelve months are classified as short-term. Amounts 
are classified as long-term where maturity is greater than 
twelve months. Where no objective evidence of maturity 
exists, related amounts are classified as short-term. 
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES 
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair  
value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
PROVISIONS 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable  
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.  
Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate  
of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the 
balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value 
where the effect is material. 
The unwinding of any discount is recognised as finance  
costs in the statement of comprehensive income. 
DECOMMISSIONING 
Provision is made for the cost of decommissioning assets  
at the time when the obligation to decommission arises.  
Such provision represents the estimated discounted liability 
for costs which are expected to be incurred in removing 
production facilities and site restoration at the end of the 
producing life of each field. A corresponding item of property, 
plant and equipment is also created at an amount equal to 
the provision. This is subsequently depreciated as part of the 
capital costs of the production facilities. Any change in the 
present value of the estimated expenditure attributable to 
changes in the estimates of the cash flow or the current 
estimate of the discount rate used are reflected as an 
adjustment to the provision.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
CONTINUED 
OFFSETTING  
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net  
amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there 
is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset  
and settle the liability simultaneously. 
IMPAIRMENT  
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets  
are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment.  
 
If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit  
is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs  
of disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-
tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments  
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
Key assumptions in the discounted cash flows used to assess 
the fair value of property, plant and equipment are oil price, 
reserves and resources, operating expenditure and 
government deductions from revenue. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped 
together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash 
inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of 
the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets  
(cash generating unit). 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount  
of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its  
recoverable amount. 
Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed 
for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. 
FINANCIAL ASSETS 
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any objective evidence that it  
is impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if 
objective evidence indicates that one or more events have 
had a negative effect on the estimate of future cash flows  
of that asset. 
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured  
at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between  
its carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated 
future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest 
rate. All impairment losses are recognised as an expense  
in the statement of comprehensive income. 
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related 
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss 
was recognised.  
SHARE CAPITAL 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
REVENUE 
Sales of petroleum are recognised when the significant risks 
and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer and the 
associated revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is 
measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax (VAT) and  
other sales tax or duty.  
Where income tax arising from the Group’s activities  
under production sharing contracts is settled by a third  
party at no cost and on behalf of the Group and where the 
Group would otherwise be liable for such income tax, the 
associated sales are shown gross including the notional tax 
and a corresponding income tax charge is presented in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
EXPORT SALES – KURDISTAN 
The significant risks and rewards of ownership are deemed  
to have passed on delivery, however, because the payment 
mechanism for crude export sales is developing, the Group 
does not consider that export revenue can be reliably 
measured at the time of delivery and, consequently, 
recognises revenue at the point of cash receipt. 
LOCAL SALES – KURDISTAN 
The significant risks and rewards of ownership are deemed  
to have passed on delivery of crude oil to the customer at  
the point of loading and revenue is recognised accordingly  
to the extent that the receipt of cash is assessed as 
sufficiently probable and the amount of revenue can  
be reliably measured. 
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
SHORT-TERM BENEFITS 
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed to the 
statement of comprehensive income as the related service is 
provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to 
be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans  
if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to 
pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the 
employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans. The economic cost of awarding shares 
and share options to employees is recognised as an expense 
in the statement of comprehensive income equivalent to the 
fair value of the benefit awarded. The fair value is determined 
by reference to option pricing models, principally Monte Carlo 
and adjusted Black-Scholes models. The charge is recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income over the vesting 
period of the award. At each balance sheet date, the Group 
revises its estimate of the number of options that are 
expected to become exercisable. Any revision to the original 
estimates is reflected in the statement of comprehensive 
income with a corresponding adjustment to equity 
immediately to the extent it relates to past service and the 
remainder over the rest of the vesting period. The proceeds 
received net of any directly attributable transaction costs  
are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options are exercised. 
FINANCE INCOME AND FINANCE COSTS 
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested 
and foreign currency gains. Interest income is recognised  
as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
Finance expense comprises interest expense on borrowings, 
and foreign currency losses. Borrowing costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition of a qualifying asset as  
part of the cost of that asset are capitalised over the 
respective assets. 
Borrowing costs, including the accretion of any discount on 
initial recognition of borrowings, incurred for the construction 
of any qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of 
time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for  
its intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are expensed 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
TAXATION 
Under the terms of the Kurdistan PSCs, under which oil sales 
are made, any tax due is paid directly from the government’s 
take of revenues. This would normally be presented for as a 
gross up of revenue with a corresponding taxation expense  
in the statement of comprehensive income. No gross up of 
revenue and presentation of taxation expense has been 
accounted for in the period because, as a consequence of 
the uncertainty over the payment mechanism for oil sales in 
Kurdistan, it has not been possible to measure the quantum  
of taxation that has been paid on behalf of the Group  
by the KRG. 
RELATED PARTIES 
Parties are related if one party has the ability, directly or 
indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant 
influence over the party in making financial or operational 
decisions. Parties are also related if they are subject to 
common control. Transactions between related parties are 
transfers of resources, services or obligations, regardless  
of whether a price is charged and are disclosed separately 
within the notes to the consolidated financial information. 
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS 
Certain critical accounting judgements in applying  
the Group’s accounting policies are described below. 
ESTIMATION OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES 
Oil and gas reserves impact the Group’s financial  
statements principally in the following ways: they are  
key elements in the Group’s investment decision-making 
process and allocation of fair values to acquired assets;  
they are an important element in determining depreciation 
and amortisation; and they impact the timing of 
decommissioning activity and in testing for impairment  
of tangible and intangible oil and gas assets.  
Changes in 2P oil and gas reserves will have a corresponding 
effect on the depreciation and amortisation charge in the 
statement of comprehensive income and on the discounted 
value of any decommissioning provision. Changes in oil and 
gas reserve estimates will affect the assessed valuation of 
capitalised oil and gas assets, which may result in impairment. 
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of 
crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering 
data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable 
in future years from known reservoirs under existing 
economic and operating conditions, that is, prices and  
costs as of the date an estimate is made. 
Probable reserves are those additional reserves which 
analysis of geosciences and engineering data indicate are  
less likely to be recovered than proved reserves, but more 
certain to be recovered than possible reserves. Estimates  
of oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise, require the 
application of judgement and are subject to future revision.  
Accordingly, financial and accounting measures (such as 
depreciation and amortisation charges and provision for 
decommissioning) that are based on proved and probable 
reserves are also subject to change.  
Proved reserves are estimated by reference to available 
reservoir and well information. All proved reserves estimates 
are subject to revision, either upward or downward, based  
on new information such as from development drilling and 
production activities, or from changes in economic factors, 
including product prices, contract terms or development 
plans. In general, changes in the technical maturity of 
hydrocarbon reserves resulting from new information 
becoming available from development and production 
activities have tended to be the most significant cause  
of annual revisions.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
CONTINUED 
In general, estimates of reserves for undeveloped or partially 
developed fields are subject to greater uncertainty over  
their future life than estimates of reserves for fields that are 
substantially developed and being depleted. As a field goes 
into production, the amount of proved reserves will be subject 
to future revision once additional information becomes 
available through, for example, the drilling of additional wells 
or the observation of long-term reservoir performance under 
producing conditions. As those fields are further developed, 
new information may lead to revisions.  
Changes to the Group’s estimates of proved and probable 
reserves also affect the amount of depreciation and 
amortisation recorded in the Group’s financial statements  
for property, plant and equipment related to oil and gas 
production activities. A reduction in proved and probable 
reserves will increase depreciation and amortisation charges 
(assuming constant production) and reduce income.  
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT COSTS USED  
IN DEPRECIATION OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES 
Certain classes of property, plant and equipment related  
to oil and gas exploration and production activities are 
depreciated using a unit-of-production method over 2P 
reserves. Since 2P reserves assume future development  
cost to access the proved and probable reserves, an estimate  
of future development costs is required for the calculation  
of depreciation. 
The Group’s estimation of future development costs is  
based on comparable data of similar companies in the region, 
future petroleum prices and the Group’s plans to increase  
the efficiency of the drilling process. However, actual drilling 
costs may be different from those estimated by the Group  
due to changes in market conditions, business and operating 
environment. Changes in estimates of reserve quantities 
and/or estimates of future development expenditure are 
reflected prospectively in the depreciation and  
amortisation calculation. 
REVENUE RECOGNITION 
The payment mechanism for export sales is developing and,  
in practice, does not follow the contractual provisions of  
the PSCs. As such, there is uncertainty related the timing of 
receipt of that revenue. In addition, the tax provisions of the 
PSCs are subject to interpretation and the associated tax 
filing mechanism is not established, giving  
rise to further uncertainty. 
Export sales are only recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income on the receipt of cash proceeds  
and no gross up is made in respect of the revenue and  
taxes related to the Kurdistan PSCs. 
Revenue for domestic sales is recognised on delivery. 
DECOMMISSIONING COSTS 
Provision for decommissioning represents the present  
value of decommissioning costs relating to the Kurdistan  
oil and gas interests, which are expected to be incurred at  
the end of field life, currently estimated to be in the period 
2031 – 2039. These provisions have been created based on the 
Group’s internal estimates. Assumptions, based on the current 
economic environment, have been made which management 
believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the 
future liability. Those estimates are reviewed regularly to  
take into account any material changes to the assumptions. 
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend 
upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning 
works required, which will reflect market conditions at the 
relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning  
is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at 
economically viable rates. This in turn will depend upon  
future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.  
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
The recognition of business combinations requires the  
excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the net  
book value of assets acquired to be allocated to the assets 
and liabilities of the acquired entity. The Group makes 
judgements and estimates in relation to the fair value 
allocation of the purchase price. 
The fair value exercise is performed at the date of acquisition. 
Owing to the nature of fair value assessments in the oil and 
gas industry, the purchase price allocation exercise and 
acquisition-date fair value determinations require subjective 
judgements based on a wide range of complex variables at  
a point in time. Management uses all available information  
to make the fair value determinations.  
In determining fair value for the acquisition, the Group has 
utilised valuation methodologies including discounted cash 
flow analysis. The assumptions made in performing these 
valuations include assumptions as to discount rates, foreign 
exchange rates, commodity prices, the timing of development, 
capital costs, and future operating costs. Any significant 
change in key assumptions may cause the acquisition 
accounting to be revised. 
NEW STANDARDS 
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and 
interpretations will be effective for annual periods beginning 
after 1 January 2014. None of these standards have been  
early adopted. The new standards are not expected to have  
a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements  
of the Group.

SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
The Group has two reportable business segments, which are its oil and gas exploration and production business in the KRI and 
its oil and gas exploration business in Africa. Capital expenditure decisions for the KRI business segment are considered in the 
context of the cash flows expected to be made from the production and sale of crude oil. Capital expenditure for the African 
segment is considered in the context of the available cash of the Group.  
Finance income is not considered part of a business segment and forms part of the reconciliation to reported numbers.

The basis of the depreciation charge for oil and gas assets was changed in 2013. The Group continues to use the unit of 
production method but now uses the Group’s share of actual production as the basis for depreciation rather than deriving an 
estimate of the Group’s share of production from revenue entitlement. Had the basis remained the same as used in prior years, 
the depreciation charge for the period would have been $137.3 million higher at $231.7 million.

TAXATION 
A taxation charge of $0.9 million (2012: nil) was made in the Turkish and UK services companies. All other corporation tax due 
has been paid on behalf of the Group by the government from the government’s own share of revenues and there is no tax 
payment required or expected to be made by the Group. 
The tax paid by the government in accordance with the terms of the KRI PSCs would usually be presented as a gross up of 
revenue and a corresponding taxation expense in the statement of comprehensive income with no cash outflow. In the Group’s 
results for the periods ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, no presentation of taxation expense with an equivalent 
gross up for revenue has been accounted for because it has not been possible to measure reliably the amount of taxation paid 
on behalf of the Group because of uncertainties over how the amount of taxation should be calculated. This is an accounting 
presentational issue and there is no taxation to be paid. For the same reason, it has not been possible to assess whether it is 
necessary to gross up the acquired assets for deferred tax.

EARNINGS PER SHARE 
BASIC 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the period. 
  2013  2012
Profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the Company ($million)  185.6  75.9

Basic earnings per share (cents per share)  66.24  27.18
DILUTED 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to include all potential 
dilutive ordinary shares. The Group has four types of potential dilutive ordinary shares: 
 Shares granted to directors and employees under the performance share plan, to the extent that performance conditions 
have been met at the period end; 
 Share options granted to employees under the share option plan, where the exercise price is less than the average market 
price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the period; 
 Shares granted to employees under the restricted share plan; 
 Shares and securities issued to the founders of the Company, to the extent that performance conditions have been met  
at the period end. 
Further details of these potentially dilutive shares are shown in note 21.

Exploration and evaluation assets are comprised of the Group’s PSC interests in exploration assets in the Kurdistan Region of  
Iraq and Africa. Exploration and evaluation assets are not amortised as they are not available for use but are assessed for impairment 
indicators under IFRS 6.  
During the period, the Dohuk field was established as commercially viable and $36.0 million of exploration costs were transferred to 
property, plant and equipment.  
The net book value of $3.0 million (2012: $1.5 million) of other assets is principally software.

Non-current provisions cover expected decommissioning and abandonment costs resulting from the net ownership interests in 
petroleum and natural gas assets, including well sites and gathering systems. The decommissioning and abandonment provision 
is based on management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the period.  
The cash flows relating to the decommissioning and abandonment provisions are expected to occur between 2031 and 2039. 
The provision is the discounted present value of the cost, using existing technology at current prices.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 
There were no trade and other receivables past due at the end of the period. All the Group’s financial assets are short-term  
in nature or are repayable on demand and, as such, the fair value of financial assets approximates to their carrying amount. 
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES 
All the Group’s financial liabilities are predominantly short-term in nature or are repayable on demand and, as such, there is  
no difference between contractual cash flows related to the financial liabilities and their carrying amount. 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand.  
Where it is not repayable on demand, then the fair value is estimated at the present value of future cash flows, discounted  
at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date. 
INTEREST-BEARING BORROWINGS 
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate  
of interest at the balance sheet date.  
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS 
CREDIT RISK 
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis, except for credit risk relating to trade and other receivable balances. Credit risk arises 
from cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and other assets.  
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum credit exposure to credit risk 
at 31 December was: 
2013 
$m  
2012
$m
Trade and other receivables   4.4  32.9
Cash and cash equivalents  699.7  1,001.3
    
  704.1  1,034.2
There are no trade and other receivables overdue at the period end and no provision for doubtful debt has been made.  
No interest is charged on receivables. The carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.  
The Group takes a conservative approach to its cash management. Cash is deposited in government gilts, treasury bills or  
term deposits with banks that are assessed as appropriate based on, among other things, sovereign risk, CDS pricing and  
credit rating.  
LIQUIDITY RISK 
The Group is committed to ensuring it has sufficient liquidity to meet its payables as they fall due. At 31 December 2013  
the Group had cash and cash equivalents of $699.7 million (2012: $1,001.3 million). The position of cash and cash equivalent 
balances can be seen in note 15. 
CURRENCY RISK 
As substantially all of the Group’s transactions are measured and denominated in US dollars, the exposure to currency  
risk is not material and therefore no sensitivity analysis has been presented. 
INTEREST RATE RISK  
The Group had no borrowings as at 31 December 2013 and therefore is not exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. 
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it remains sufficiently funded to support its business strategy and maximise 
shareholder value. The Group’s funding needs are met through a combination of cash raised by IPO, cash generated from 
operations and equity. The Group monitors its cash position on an ongoing basis. Capital includes share capital, other  
reserves and accumulated losses.

The range of exercise prices for share options outstanding at the end of the period is 621.15p to 955.2p. The weighted average 
remaining contractual life of the outstanding share options is 2.1 years. The weighted average fair value for PSP awards granted 
in the period is 381p and for RSP awards granted in the period is 934p. 
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model. The model takes into account assumptions regarding 
expected volatility, expected dividends and expected time to exercise. 
 
 
 
 
In the absence of sufficient historical volatility for the Company, expected volatility was estimated by analysing the historical 
volatility of FTSE-listed oil and gas producers over the three years prior to the date of grant. The expected dividend assumption 
was set at 0%, to reflect a prudent approach. The risk-free interest rate incorporated into the model is based on the term 
structure of UK Government zero coupon bonds.  
The inputs into the Black-Scholes pricing model for RSP, PSP and SOP and SOP awards granted in 2013 and fair values per 
share using the model were as follows:

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
CONTINUED 
FOUNDER SHARES  
Prior to placing admission, the founders (being Nathaniel Rothschild, Tony Hayward, Julian Metherell and Tom Daniel)  
were issued B ordinary shares in the Vallares Holding Company Limited (since renamed Genel Energy Holding Company  
Limited, the subsidiary) (B shares or founder Shares). These founder shares reward the founders for their initial  
capital commitment to the Company and for completion of an acquisition through exchange of such founder shares, upon 
completion of an acquisition, for up to 6.67% of the fully-diluted ordinary shares of the Company. These founder shares  
were treated as equity settled share-based payments and were deemed to have vested immediately on grant date as no 
performance conditions are attached to them. They were converted into ordinary shares on 20 January 2012 (note 20). 
The Company has determined that the fair value of these share-based payments is equal to the consideration received  
(£15 million) by the Company. Accordingly no share-based payment expense has been recognised in the consolidated  
statement of comprehensive income. 
FOUNDER SECURITIES 
Prior to admission, the founders were issued C shares in Vallares Holding Company Limited (since renamed Genel Energy 
Holding Company Limited), known as founder securities.  
These founder securities were put in place to encourage the founders to grow the Company following an acquisition in order  
to maximise value for holders of ordinary shares by entitling the founders to a share of the upside in the Company’s value once 
certain performance has been achieved. The performance conditions are summarised below.  
If within four years of the acquisition of Genel Enerji AS (i.e. by 21 November 2015) the closing price per ordinary share of the 
Company reaches for the period of any 20 trading days out of 30 successive days the higher of:  
 a compound rate of return of 8.5% on the admission value of £10, measured from the date of the completion of the 
acquisition; or  
 an increase of 25% from the admission value of £10, adjusted for any matters which have an impact on the capital structure 
of the Company,  
(in each case, the Threshold Price), or there is a change of control in the Company resulting from an offer above the Threshold 
Price the founders have the right to exchange their founder securities for ordinary shares in the Company to a value of 15% of 
the increase in value from the placing admission value of £10. The performance condition is also deemed satisfied if a founder  
is removed from the Board other than for cause. The Company has the option to settle founder securities by issuing shares or 
the equivalent in cash. 
The founder securities were deemed to have vested immediately as no performance conditions exist in relation to their  
vesting. However, as explained above, there are performance conditions which need to be met prior to exchanging the  
founder securities for ordinary shares.  
The Company has determined that the fair value of these share-based payments is equal to the consideration received  
of £5 million. Accordingly no share-based payment expense has been recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.

ACQUISITIONS
On 28 February 2013, the Group completed the acquisition of a 75% stake in a block offshore Malta through the acquisition of 75% of 
the share capital of Phoenicia Energy Company Limited for $11.7 million. On 28 March 2013, the Group acquired a 60% working interest 
in the Sidi Moussa licence in Morocco for $1.3 million. The Group completed the acquisition of an additional interest in the Miran PSC on 
23 January 2013 resulting in further acquisition related costs of $30.0 million.  The completion of the acquisition brought the Group’s 
interest in the Miran PSC to, initially, 100%, reducing to 75% when the KRG exercises its back in right under the PSC to take a 25% 
interest. Because the exercise of the back in right was virtually certain, the acquisition has been recorded to reflect an increase in 
interest to 75%.

OPERATING LEASES 
The Group leases temporary production and office facilities under operating leases. During the period ended 31 December 2013 
$5.8 million (2012: $4.7 million) was expensed to the statement of comprehensive income in respect of these operating leases. 
Drill rigs are leased on a day-rate basis for the purpose of drilling and exploration or development wells. The aggregate 
payments under drilling contracts are determined by the number of days required to drill each well and are capitalised as 
exploration or development assets as appropriate. 
The Group had no material outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating 
leases other than items referred to in note 25. 
 
 
 
CAPITAL COMMITMENTS 
As announced on 1 May 2013, the Group signed a drilling rig contract with Noble Corporation for its African offshore drilling 
programme. The rig will be used to deliver a high impact drilling campaign over an 18 month period committing the Group  
to circa $250 million, after taking into account our partners’ share of costs.  
Under the terms of its PSCs and JOAs, the Group has certain commitments that are defined by activity rather than spend.  
The Group’s capital programme for the next few years is explained in the 2013 Annual Report to be distributed to shareholders 
in March 2014 and is in excess of the activity required by its PSCs and JOAs.

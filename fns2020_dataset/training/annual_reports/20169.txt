3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 “ 2016 has delivered another robust  
result which demonstrates the value  
of our clear, consistent strategy and 
disciplined approach to investment.”
Overview
In my ﬁrst year as Chairman, I am pleased to report that 3i 
delivered another robust result. The Group has a clear, consistent 
strategy and Simon Borrows and the team continue to make 
excellent progress in positioning 3i as a business capable of 
delivering attractive returns throughout the economic cycle. 
Market environment
2015 was marked by considerable turbulence in global markets 
and growth indicators in the US and Europe remained under 
pressure. As a consequence, central bank monetary policy 
continued to be supportive across all the major developed 
economies with interest rates remaining at historic lows. 3i has 
limited direct exposure to companies in the most challenged 
sectors and our portfolio performed well, with our largest and 
strongest investments, including Action, Scandlines and 
3i Infrastructure plc, delivering strong year-on-year 
improvements in performance. 
Performance and dividend 
In FY2016, total return increased by 25% to £824 million 
(2015: £659 million). Net asset value increased to 463 pence 
per share (31 March 2015: 396 pence) and return on opening 
shareholders’ funds was 21.7% (2015: 19.9%). We remained net 
divestors during FY2016 and ended the year with a net cash 
position of £165 million and available liquidity of £1,352 million 
(31 March 2015: net cash of £49 million and liquidity of 
£1,214 million). In light of this strong performance, the Board  
has recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 16 pence per share (2015:  
14 pence per share), resulting in a full year dividend of 22 pence 
per share (2015: 20 pence per share), equivalent to 27% of cash 
realisation proceeds (2015: 23%). This reﬂects the Board’s 
continuing conﬁdence in both the Group’s future prospects and 
its cash generation capability. Subject to shareholder approval, 
we will pay the ﬁnal dividend of 16 pence (2015: 14 pence) in  
July 2016. 
Our current dividend policy, set in May 2012, contemplates 
distributions of between 15–20% of cash realisation proceeds 
(subject to certain criteria on gross debt and gearing described 
below) with a minimum dividend of 8.1 pence per year. As a result 
of the Group’s strong performance and conservative balance 
sheet strategy, actual dividends have exceeded 20% of realised 
proceeds in each of the years the policy has been in operation.
In light of the Group’s continued progress in executing its 
strategy, the quality of its investment portfolio and forecast 
realisation pipeline, the Board has decided that with effect from 
FY2017 , the base dividend will increase to 16 pence per annum, 
with an additional ﬁnal dividend each year taking account of cash 
realisations, the investment pipeline and the balance sheet at  
year end. Consistent with our conservative approach, we will 
maintain our criteria of only paying an additional ﬁnal dividend 
provided gross debt is less than £1 billion and gearing is less than 
20%, but do not expect this to be a practical constraint. Further 
detail on the Group’s approach to capital allocation is provided 
in the Chief Executive’s review.
Outlook
The combination of continuing market volatility and the upcoming 
Brexit referendum is likely to weigh on investor sentiment, with 
reduced M&A volumes and delays in capital investment likely  
to persist while the uncertainty remains. However, I believe that 
3i’s proprietary capital, selective investment approach and 
balance sheet strength positions the Group well to deal with 
these uncertain economic and ﬁnancial conditions. A clear, 
consistent strategy and disciplined approach to investment 
underpin our conﬁdence in the future success of the Group.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016
Chairman’s statement We have continued to execute our 
well established strategy, making good 
progress against our key performance 
indicators, with all three of our 
businesses building on the momentum 
seen in previous years. 3i generated  
an excellent total return on opening 
shareholders’ funds of 21.7% 
(2015: 19.9%) and a NAV per share of 
463 pence (31 March 2015: 396 pence). 
This year’s ﬁnancial and operational 
performance, against a backdrop 
of volatile market sentiment, 
demonstrates the depth of the  
Group’s investment capabilities and 
potential to generate attractive returns 
for investors through the cycle.
Another year of resilient ﬁnancial performance 
Private Equity had an excellent year, generating a gross 
investment return of £1,011 million, or 32% of opening value 
(2015: £719 million, 24%). This reﬂects strong performance 
from our larger investments, particularly Action, Basic-Fit 
and Scandlines. 
Action, the leading non-food discounter in continental Europe, 
had another outstanding year with a 36% increase in EBITDA and 
like-for-like sales growth of 7 .6%. Action continued its successful 
store roll-out programme, opening 141 net new stores in the year, 
and at the end of 2015 had 655 stores in six countries (with a total 
of 410 opened since our investment in 2011). Action’s international 
expansion has been a key driver of its success to date, with 
France and Germany now the main markets for growth. 
In addition, Action entered Austria and Luxembourg in 2015; 
early progress is encouraging and provides further evidence that 
Action’s store concept travels well across borders. To enhance 
Action’s international growth plans, a third distribution centre 
opened north of Paris in early 2016 and a fourth and ﬁfth are 
planned for Toulouse and Mannheim respectively. 2016 promises 
to be another strong year for Action as it plans to open more 
stores than last year. We acquired Action in 2011 as a Benelux 
retailer but in 2015, Action opened more stores in France and 
Germany than in the Benelux and it has now become a truly 
pan-European retailer. 
I joined the Board of Peer Holding BV, Action’s parent company,  
last year in recognition of the importance of this investment to 
3i and in order to foster closer links between the two groups.
Scandlines, a large ferry operator with two high frequency, large 
capacity routes between Germany and Denmark, continues to 
perform well due to strong volume growth and a shift in mix 
towards higher margin booking classes. The Danish Transport 
Ministry has conﬁrmed that the opening date of a competing 
tunnel, the Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link, on Scandlines’ key route 
between Rødby and Puttgarden will be delayed further, which 
is an important development for Scandlines. 
“ 2016 was another strong year for 3i 
and built on the success of our recent 
restructuring. The Group’s performance 
has been resilient in the face of 
challenging macro-economic conditions 
and volatile markets.”

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016
Strategic report
Chief Executive’s review Positive momentum continues at Basic-Fit, the leading discount 
ﬁtness operator in continental Europe, with very good earnings 
growth and ongoing capital investment to upgrade its existing 
gym portfolio and open new units. Basic-Fit is now Europe’s 
largest discount gym chain and had 351 gyms and 1.1 million 
members at 31 March 2016. It is another pan-European business, 
growing strongly in France and Spain, having established market 
leadership in the Netherlands and Belgium. On 17 May 2016, 
Basic-Fit announced its intention to launch an Initial Public 
Offering and Listing on Euronext Amsterdam.
The wider portfolio continues to perform well, notwithstanding 
the slowing macro-economic conditions, with encouraging 
performance from some of our newer investments. Our decision 
in 2012 to focus our Private Equity resources on core sectors 
and geographies has limited the negative impact from broader 
geo-political and economic concerns. Our monthly portfolio 
monitoring means that potential issues are highlighted early and 
any remedial actions put in place promptly. However, we cannot 
be immune to issues in the markets in which we operate. In 
particular, the impact of the lower oil price on the wider energy 
and industrial sectors has impacted our investments in JMJ and 
Dynatect. Reduced capital expenditure by oil and gas companies 
has continued to affect JMJ, which provides consultancy services 
to the sector. It has also had a negative effect on Dynatect,  
a specialist provider of protection equipment. Dynatect has a 
number of large customers which supply the capital goods sector, 
including oil and gas, in the US and suffered from reduced orders 
in 2015. Foreign exchange volatility has also hindered trading for 
a number of our companies and the decline in Russian consumer 
spending has had a negative impact on trading at our lingerie 
retailer, Agent Provocateur. However, the portfolio is performing 
well overall, with only a small minority of our investments seeing 
earnings decline in 2015. Value weighted earnings increased by 
17% (2015: 19%) over the year. 
The ﬂow of realisations has continued and Private Equity realised 
total proceeds of £743 million (2015: £831 million). A supportive 
market for realisations in the ﬁrst half of our ﬁnancial year meant 
that we continued to make good progress in reshaping our 
portfolio. In total we disposed of 11 smaller or older assets in 
the year which freed up investment executive time to focus on 
origination and managing and ultimately maximising value in 
our stronger assets. 
As we noted at the half-year, we have reached a point in the 
evolution of the portfolio where more of our realisations will  
come from our stronger assets. Despite a more challenging 
macro-economic environment for realisations in the second half  
of FY2016, we sold Element Materials Technology (“Element”), 
one of our largest and highest growth investments. Under 3i’s 
ownership, Element completed and successfully integrated  
10 acquisitions which also delivered an increase in EBITDA  
margin from 16% to 26%. As a result, revenue nearly trebled  
to c.US$290 million and EBITDA quadrupled to US$80 million.  
Total cash proceeds to 3i on the sale were £188 million with 
a money multiple of 3.9x (4.5x in euro). In total, cash returns 
were £217 million, including the reﬁnancing completed in 2014. 
This was an excellent result and all credit to the management 
team at Element as well as our own Private Equity team.
Action completed a £1.2 billion senior debt reﬁnancing, despite 
deteriorating conditions in the debt markets, in February 2016. 
Action’s performance and strong cash generation meant it had 
been able to de-lever rapidly since its prior reﬁnancing in 2015. 
Such is the strength of the Action proposition that we have already 
returned a 3.5x euro cash multiple on our original investment 
without reducing our equity ownership. This transaction 
contributed £168 million to the £185 million of realisations 
received from reﬁnancings this year.
We closed the year with a strong realisation pipeline and post year 
end we announced the disposal of Amor, the market leader for 
medium price jewellery in Germany, for estimated proceeds of 
£89 million and 2.5x original euro cost (2.3x in sterling) as well as 
Mayborn, owner of the Tommee Tippee baby products brand,  
for £135 million (3.5x).
We have maintained the investment momentum seen in FY2015. 
In a competitive market, our pricing discipline is paramount but 
we were nevertheless able to secure three interesting new 
investment opportunities through careful and well managed 
processes. We invested £406 million (of which £365 million was  
3i Group proprietary capital) in Weener Plastic Packaging Group 
(“Weener Plastic”), Euro-Diesel and Audley Travel as well as a 
further investment in ATESTEO (formerly known as GIF) through 
the buyout of the founding family’s remaining interest. Further 
details on the new investments can be found on pages 18 and 19. 
The number of portfolio companies in Private Equity was 47 
unquoted assets and ﬁve quoted stakes at 31 March 2016 
(31 March 2015: 61 unquoted assets and four quoted stakes) 
and we remain on target to meet our medium-term objective 
of holding 30–40 Private Equity assets. 
Finally, we reached an important milestone at 31 March 2016 with 
the accounting recognition of carry receivable for Eurofund V. 
This is an excellent achievement as the fund performance has 
recovered from a low point of 0.6x in 2009 to 1.7x at 31 March 2016. 
The Infrastructure team built on FY2015’s excellent performance 
and its core portfolio of European economic infrastructure assets 
continues to perform well and underpins good levels of income 
for the Group. The business generated cash income of £49 million 
(2015: £47 million) through its fund advisory and management 
activities and dividend income from 3i Infrastructure plc (“3iN”). 
The good portfolio performance also resulted in a NAV based 
performance fee for 3i of £20 million (2015: £45 million). In 
addition, 3i received a special dividend of £51 million (2015: nil) 
from 3iN following its sale of Eversholt Rail.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 Against a backdrop of intense competition for infrastructure 
assets, and particularly for large core economic infrastructure 
assets, the team advised 3iN on a revised return target, 
announced in May 2015, and changed their investment focus 
towards mid-market economic infrastructure businesses and 
primary PPP and low-risk energy projects, which offer more 
attractive risk-adjusted returns. The new leadership team has 
made a number of senior hires, including a new origination 
partner, to support the strategic development and momentum 
of the business. The change in focus and high level recruitment 
has led to a material increase in origination activity. Infrastructure 
announced the completion of four new investments (two further 
terminals alongside Oiltanking, ESVAGT, the West of Duddon 
Sands Offshore Transmission Owner and a French PPP investment 
in Condorcet Campus) totalling £193 million in the year. 3iN also 
announced a £75 million investment in Wireless Infrastructure 
Group and a c.£154 million investment in TCR, Europe’s largest 
independent asset owner of airport ground support equipment, 
in April 2016. 
The success of the new investment strategy led to 3iN’s 
announcement on 12 May 2016 of its intention to raise new  
equity of up to £350 million to fund new investments and its  
future pipeline. We have indicated our intention to support the 
transaction, and maintain our 34% interest in 3iN.
The Debt Management business had a successful year of fund 
raising in Europe and the US and AUM increased to £8.1 billion 
(31 March 2015: £7 .2 billion). We closed four CLOs in the year, 
raising AUM of £1.3 billion (2015: £2.2 billion) of CLO AUM before 
negative investor sentiment around oil and gas, commodities and 
utilities effectively closed the US CLO market between January 
and March 2016. The European market, which generally has less 
exposure to these sectors, was impacted to a lesser degree, 
although it was effectively also closed for part of calendar Q1 
2016. This market volatility has reduced the mark to market 
valuation of our CLO portfolio but, as long-term holders of CLO 
equity, our returns are ultimately driven by the cash ﬂows, rather 
than short-term unrealised fair value movements. 
The team continued to make important progress in diversifying 
the business and launched an open-ended senior debt fund,  
the Global Income Fund, with US$75 million of seed money  
from 3i. Both the Global Income Fund and the US Senior Loan  
Fund outperformed their benchmarks in the year. In total,  
Debt Management contributed £38 million of fee income 
(2015: £34 million) to the Group during the year.
One of the key components of our improved ﬁnancial 
performance and resilience since 2012 has been a disciplined 
control over operating expenses. Although we have recruited 
selectively within our Private Equity and Infrastructure teams to 
support origination and business development activity, costs 
remain tightly controlled at 1% of AUM (2015: 1%). Cash income 
increased by 8% to £171 million (2015: £158 million) due to fee 
income and distributions from our three businesses. As a result, 
operating cash proﬁt increased to £37 million (2015: £28 million). 
Fragile market conditions create challenges  
and opportunities
Throughout FY2016, we operated through periods of signiﬁcant 
economic, ﬁnancial and geo-political volatility driven by concerns 
about Chinese growth and the signiﬁcant falls in oil and 
commodity prices. Although the triggering events may change, 
we expect this volatility to continue to be a feature throughout 
FY2017 and beyond. This uncertainty is reducing M&A volumes 
and creates volatility in thin equity markets. Nevertheless,  
the private equity sector raised over $500 billion of new funds, 
increasing uninvested capital, or “dry powder” , to a record level  
of $1.3 trillion in 2015 (source: Bain & Company Inc.). 
In our Private Equity business, our systematic approach to 
planning for realisations allows us to be well prepared to maximise 
value in competitive processes and through the IPO market when 
conditions allow. The same factors drive our emphasis on the 
need to remain selective in making new investments. Our strategy 
of maintaining long-standing geographic teams with strong local 
relationships means we can often originate investments outside 
competitive processes and differentiate ourselves with 
management teams. 
As we do not have the pressure of a future third-party fund 
mandate and timeline, we can step away from aggressive 
processes but act with ﬂexibility and speed using our proprietary 
capital when suitable opportunities that meet our strict 
investment criteria arise. For example, in December 2015, we were 
able to move rapidly to secure the acquisition of Audley Travel  
by using the Group’s strong balance sheet to underwrite the  
debt as well as provide the equity for this fast growing business. 
After securing the acquisition, we reﬁnanced the debt facilities 
with a consortium of banks in January 2016.
Finally, our monthly portfolio monitoring process allows us to 
react promptly and decisively to indications that the wider market 
uncertainty is having a more direct effect on individual investment 
strategies, as it is bound to do given current weak growth in 
many sectors and geographies. This does not mean we can be 
completely immune to the markets in which we operate, but it 
substantially reduces the risk of material and realised losses that 
were a feature of 3i’s past.
Our Infrastructure team has responded to the low yield 
environment by resetting its investment strategy away from the 
larger infrastructure assets and projects, which are attracting 
investors with lower return expectations. This has created a 
much more active pipeline of investment opportunities. 
Debt Management maintains an active trading approach to the 
underlying credit investments in its funds to minimise the risk of 
defaults. This, in turn, reinforces its successful credit management 
track record to support future fund raising.

Well positioned to deliver good returns  
to shareholders 
We are navigating these challenging market conditions with 
a conservative and well-funded balance sheet. Our capital 
allocation approach is unchanged since we announced our 
strategy in 2012 and the progress we have made in how we 
use our cash can be seen in the charts above. 
The majority of our proprietary capital (83%) is invested in Private 
Equity. Our planned rate of new investment in Private Equity 
remains €500–€750 million in four to seven investments per 
annum. After allowing for this, we expect to remain a signiﬁcant 
net divestor throughout the next ﬁve years, through a combination 
of re-shaping the portfolio and, more fundamentally, achieving 
our objective of generating at least a 2x money multiple on 
new investments. 
We ended the year with a healthy cash position, out of which we 
will repay the 2017 €331 million bond (2016: £262 million) which 
matures on 17 March 2017 . As we announced separately today,  
we intend to buy back the bond early to the extent there is 
investor appetite to do so. We also intend to support 3iN’s  
equity fund raising. 
In recognition of this year’s strong performance, we have 
announced an increased total dividend for FY2016 of 22 pence 
per share (2015: 20 pence per share) and our strong balance 
sheet and capital allocation approach underpins the enhancement 
of our dividend policy going forward as set out in the 
Chairman’s statement.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 Outlook 
Our restructuring and simpliﬁed strategy has re-established  
3i as a more resilient business both commercially and ﬁnancially.  
This clear and consistent approach with its emphasis on active 
asset management, cash generation and cost control has 
demonstrated its value over the last 12 months as macro-
economic pressures and volatile debt and equity markets 
dampened market sentiment and challenged individual 
businesses. As an investment company, we also face the continual 
increase in ﬁnancial and governance regulation which is often not 
appropriate for our speciﬁc circumstances and which inevitably 
leads to further cost and complexity for the Group. 
We enter our new ﬁnancial year with those challenging conditions 
still in place, but we remain conﬁdent that we can deliver another 
resilient performance. We must maintain our price and cost 
discipline and use the sector and geographic capabilities within 
our investment platforms to produce consistently strong returns 
for our shareholders and investment partners. This approach, 
along with our strong balance sheet and a proprietorial focus, 
gives us a fundamental competitive advantage in mid-market 
private equity and infrastructure investment and underpins our 
conﬁdence in producing attractive ﬁnancial returns. The mid-market 
is limited in the scale of opportunity within it but the breadth of 
our international platform and the long-term nature of our 
proprietary capital make 3i an attractive partner for management 
teams compared to many of our fund-ﬁnanced competitors. 
This was an excellent year for the Group and I would like to thank 
the 3i team for their good work and rigour. Our disciplined 
approach, capable investment and management teams and 
strong balance sheet underpin our objective of delivering mid 
to high-teens returns to shareholders, accompanied by attractive 
cash distributions.

Chief Executive’s review Action highlights
Since its establishment in 1993, Benelux-based Action has grown into the 
leading European non-food discount retailer with more than 650 stores in  
six countries and over 29,000 employees. This compares to 245 stores across 
the Benelux and Germany and more than 7 ,000 employees when 3i and 
Funds invested in the business in June 201 1. EBITDA has almost tripled 
from €77 million in 2010 to €226 million in 2015. The business now 
generates revenues of c.€2.0 billion per annum, up from €600 million. 
The majority of sales are now outside Action’s home country.
Action’s business model differs from that of more traditional retailers 
because only a third of articles are part of its standard range. Large-scale 
procurement, optimal distribution and a cost-conscious corporate culture 
ensure very low prices. Action was voted European Retailer of the Year  
for the second consecutive year in 2015.

Strategic report
Key performance indicators 2016 progress Key risks
 – Strong performance in Private Equity with GIR of 32% particularly 
from Action, Scandlines, ATESTEO (formerly GIF) and Basic-Fit 
 – Following two years of substantial foreign exchange translation 
losses, the weakening of sterling against the euro led to 
£188m of foreign exchange translation gains on our 
investment portfolio
 – Infrastructure and Debt Management contributed valuable 
cash income to the Group 
 – Investment rates or quality are lower than expected
 – Subdued M&A activity and/or reduced prices in 3i’s core 
sectors could impact timing of exits and cash returns
 – Operational underperformance in the portfolio companies 
impacts earnings growth and exit plans
 – Inability to invest in the right people to support our operations
 – Sterling materially strengthens against the euro and US dollar
 – Realised proceeds of £743m (2015: £831m) from the disposal 
of 12 Private Equity companies, the reﬁnancing of two assets 
and selling down holdings in four quoted stakes
 – Received a £51m special dividend from 3iN following its sale 
of Eversholt Rail 
 – Subdued M&A activity in our core sectors reduces investor 
appetite for our assets
 – Uncertainty around Brexit limits willingness to invest 
 – Invested £365 million of proprietary capital (2015: £369m),  
in three new Private Equity investments in our core industrial and 
consumer sectors, as well as a further investment in ATESTEO 
 – Supported the launch of four CLOs by investing £60m 
in CLO equity 
 – Provided US$75m of seed capital to Debt Management 
to launch its Global Income Fund
 – High prices reduce the attractiveness of potential 
investment opportunities 
 – Failure to attract, invest in and retain the right investment 
executives
 – Failure to develop our Business Leaders Network
 – Market volatility, particularly in buyouts, reduces available 
liquidity to support investment
 – Continued improvement in operating cash proﬁt to £37m 
driven by increase in operating cash income across the 
business lines
 – Good levels of dividend income in Private Equity more than 
offset reduced levels of fee income from managed funds
 – Increased AUM and CLO equity in Debt Management 
 – Disciplined approach to costs, which remain at 1% of AUM
 – Portfolio performance, and therefore portfolio income, is weak
 – Unplanned increase in the cost base; for example legal, 
regulatory or compliance costs
 – Reduction in assets under management in Debt Management
 – Ability to generate interest and dividends in a Private 
Equity structure
 – Investor appetite in a volatile macro-economic environment
 – Good progression in NAV per share to 463p, up 17% 
in the year
 – Strong gross investment return contribution from  
Private Equity 
 – Due in part to concerns over a potential Brexit, sterling 
materially weakened against the euro 
 – Brexit creates uncertainty and further dampens 
investor sentiment 
 – Wider G20 political and economic uncertainty impacts 
3i’s portfolio companies and valuations
 – TSR of (2)% as the ﬁnal FY2015 dividend of 14.0p paid in 
July 2015 and the interim FY2016 dividend of 6.0p paid in 
January 2016 were offset by the fall in the share price to 
456p at 31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: 482p)
 – Our continued net divestment activity and strong balance 
sheet, including a closing net cash position, supported a full 
year dividend of 22.0p per share (2015: 20.0p)
 – Lower NAV due to investment underperformance or political 
and economic uncertainty
 – Investor appetite in a volatile macro-economic environment

 Business performance
Private Equity, the largest contributor to the Group’s returns, 
delivered a strong performance in the year. The gross investment 
return of £1,011 million, or 32% on the opening portfolio 
(2015: £719 million, 24%), reﬂected the robust performance of  
our largest investments. The portfolio proved its resilience against 
a backdrop of volatile markets and difﬁcult macro-economic 
conditions due to its strength and diversiﬁed nature. We continue 
to have no direct exposure to the energy and commodity sectors. 
The impact of the weak oil and commodity prices remains limited 
to a small number of assets with indirect exposure, such as JMJ 
and Dynatect. Weighted average earnings (including the beneﬁt 
of portfolio acquisitions) increased by 17% in the last 12 months 
(2015: 19%) reﬂecting the continued strong growth trajectory in 
Action, as well as encouraging performance in a number of our 
newer investments.
Investment activity
The investment activity seen in FY2015 continued throughout 
FY2016. Although levels of M&A activity have moderated, 
particularly in the ﬁrst quarter of the calendar year 2016,  
valuations remain high as there is still a substantial amount of 
capital searching for new investment opportunities. Importantly, 
we maintained our pricing discipline and invested £406 million,  
of which £365 million was proprietary capital.
We invested in three new businesses in the year; Weener Plastic, 
Euro-Diesel and Audley Travel. Alongside a co-investor who 
contributed €50 million, we invested €201 million in Weener 
Plastic, a manufacturer of plastic packaging systems 
headquartered in Germany. Euro-Diesel is a leading provider of 
stand-by diesel power supply systems, based in Belgium, in which 
we invested €71 million of proprietary capital. In December 2015, 
we invested £156 million in Audley Travel, a luxury provider of 
tailor-made travel experiences based in the UK. The initial 
investment included a £85 million bridging loan whilst Audley’s 
existing facility was reﬁnanced. The loan was repaid in full in 
January 2016; an excellent example of how our strong balance 
sheet can facilitate good investments in more volatile debt 
markets. In addition to these new investments, we also took the 
opportunity to purchase a minority stake in a 2013 investment, 
ATESTEO (formerly known as GIF) from the founding family.
 “ An excellent year with a gross 
investment return of 32%, good 
progress on realisations and three 
important new investments.”

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016
Strategic report
 Business review Realisations activity
Market conditions were favourable for realisations in the ﬁrst half 
of the 2015 calendar year, which enabled us to continue to divest 
11 of our smaller or older assets. As we continue to reshape the 
portfolio, we expect more of our future realisations will be driven 
by our larger, stronger assets. In December 2015, we announced 
the disposal of Element at a euro money multiple of 4.5x  
(3.9x in sterling). 
Realisations and reﬁnancings generated aggregate proceeds 
of £743 million (2015: £831 million) in the year. Excluding 
reﬁnancings of £185 million, which are usually recognised primarily 
as a repayment of shareholder loans or capital and therefore do 
not generate a material increase in value, this represented an 
uplift over opening value of £67 million, or 14% (2015: £144 million, 
27%). The lower uplift reﬂects the fact that the majority of 
disposals were smaller or non-core assets, held on an imminent 
sales basis at 31 March 2015, or were from the quoted portfolio.
At 31 March 2016, there were 47 assets and ﬁve quoted stakes 
in the portfolio, down from 61 assets and four quoted stakes at 
31 March 2015, and we remain on track to meet our longer-term 
objective of holding fewer than 40 Private Equity investments.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 Assets under management
Total AUM decreased to £3.5 billion in the year (31 March 
2015: £3.8 billion), principally due to the continued net divestment 
activity. Encouragingly, the performance of Eurofund V (“EFV”) 
and the Growth Capital Fund continued to improve, with gross 
money multiples at 31 March 2016 of 1.7x and 1.8x respectively 
(31 March 2015: 1.4x, 1.7x). The investments made in EFV’s 
2010–2012 investment period continue to show very strong 
performance, with a money multiple of 3.4x at 31 March 2016 
(31 March 2015: 2.6x). The Growth Capital Fund beneﬁted  
from the realisation of Labco and further disposals of Quintiles,  
a quoted holding. The value of 3i’s Proprietary Capital increased 
to £3.7 billion in the year (31 March 2015: £3.1 billion) and,  
inclusive of third-party funds, increased to €6.8 billion (31 March 
2015: €6.3 billion).
We concluded a review of our resources and investment 
opportunities during the year. As a result, we are planning for a 
reduction in our Nordic team while we seek to increase the size 
of the investment teams in some of our key geographies in 
Europe and the US.
Outlook
We remain focused on the investment pipeline for FY2017 , 
sourcing attractive opportunities through our international team 
and network of advisers and business leaders, whilst maintaining 
price discipline. Conditions for M&A are expected to remain 
volatile and, whilst our portfolio companies cannot be immune 
to macro-economic pressures, our rigorous investment process 
and active portfolio management approach allows us to address 
such issues promptly.

 Business review  “ Infrastructure had a busy year in terms  
of business activity, demonstrating our 
ability to access attractive investment 
opportunities in a competitive market.”
Ben Loomes and Phil White
Managing Partners and Co-heads of Infrastructure
The Infrastructure business performed well in the year, building 
on the strong result in FY2015 driven by the sale of 3iN’s holding 
in Eversholt Rail. Infrastructure delivered a gross investment return 
of £47 million, or 8% on the opening portfolio (2015: £96 million, 
20%). The business generated cash income of £49 million through 
its fund advisory and management activities and dividends 
received from 3iN (2015: £47 million). In addition, 3i received a 
£51 million special dividend from 3iN (2015: nil) following 3iN’s 
sale of Eversholt Rail.
Investment Adviser to 3iN
To reﬂect the compression in market returns and the evolution 
of the composition of 3iN’s underlying investment portfolio, 3iN’s 
total return target was updated to between 8% and 10% to be 
delivered over the medium term (previously a 10% annual target) 
in May 2015. Given the competition for large core assets in the 
global infrastructure sector, the team has focused on sourcing 
mid-market economic infrastructure and greenﬁeld projects 
across Europe. The team made good progress against these 
revised objectives and advised 3iN on four new investments in its 
target markets totalling £193 million (2015: £114 million) as well as 
the £75 million investment in Wireless Infrastructure Group, the 
c.£154 million investment in TCR and the c.£4 million investment 
in Hart van Zuid announced in April 2016. On 12 May 2016, 3iN 
announced its intention to raise new equity of up to £350 million 
to fund new investments and its future pipeline.
3iN has built an attractive portfolio of economic infrastructure 
assets across Europe which performed well and generated a 
strong total return of 14% in FY2016. In particular, the portfolio 
valuation beneﬁted from positive regulatory developments for 
Elenia, an electricity distribution and district heating company 
based in Finland. This performance builds on the strong long-
term performance of 3iN, which has delivered an annualised 
total shareholder return of 11.3% since its IPO in 2007 .
Under the terms of the advisory agreement, 3i received an 
advisory fee of £16 million (2015: £16 million) and a NAV based 
performance fee of £20 million (2015: £45 million) from 3iN, of 
which £15 million (2015: £34 million) was accrued as payable 
to the team. 
Infrastructure
West of Duddon Sands  
Offshore Transmission Owner 
In August 2015, 3iN invested £23 million in a 50% holding in the 
West of Duddon Sands Offshore Transmission Owner (“WODS 
OFTO”) project. This project involves the acquisition, ﬁnancing 
and operation of power transmission cables and associated 
electrical equipment connecting the West of Duddon Sands 
offshore wind farm, located off the coast of Cumbria in the Irish 
Sea, to the onshore grid. The project operates under a licence 
awarded by Ofgem, the UK’s electricity regulator, with a 
20-year revenue entitlement period, providing predictable 
cash ﬂows over the period.
As Investment Adviser to 3iN, 3i used its extensive experience 
in managing OFTO investments, gained through the 
acquisition of the Barclays European Infrastructure business 
in November 2013, to complete the transaction.

 Business performance
3iN performance
In addition to being its investment adviser, 3i holds a 34% 
(31 March 2015: 34%) stake in 3iN. Reﬂecting its strong positioning, 
3iN’s share price continued to perform well in a year of equity 
market volatility and generated a total shareholder return of 13%. 
3i’s investment in 3iN contributed £33 million of unrealised  
value (2015: £77 million) and £21 million of dividend income 
(2015: £20 million). In July 2015, 3iN also paid a £150 million 
special dividend to shareholders, following its sale of Eversholt 
Rail. 3i’s share of the special dividend, £51 million, was treated 
as realised proceeds. 
Assets under management
The Infrastructure AUM decreased to £2.4 billion (31 March 
2015: £2.5 billion) principally due to the payment of the special 
dividend from 3iN. In addition, the performance of the assets 
in the India Infrastructure Fund remained weak; the economic 
environment and ongoing depreciation of the rupee against 
the US dollar, in which the fund is denominated, resulted in a 
£11 million reduction in the value of 3i’s direct share of the 3i India 
Infrastructure Fund to £53 million (31 March 2015: £64 million).
Outlook
The team’s focus on origination and asset management 
capabilities together with a healthy pipeline of attractive 
investment opportunities across our target markets means 
that the business remains well placed to continue its current 
good performance and to grow its assets under management 
through selective investment.

 Business review  Debt Management
 “ A solid year with four new CLOs and  
a new fund launch, despite volatility  
in the credit markets.”
Jeremy Ghose
Managing Partner and CEO, 3i Debt Management
 Business performance
The Debt Management team continued to make good progress 
in fund raising despite more volatile conditions for CLO issuance. 
AUM increased to £8.1 billion (31 March 2015: £7 .2 billion) as good 
levels of fund raising activity and favourable foreign exchange 
rates more than offset the impact of the run off of older funds.  
An important source of operating cash income, the business 
generated £38 million of fee income in the year (2015: £34 million) 
and portfolio income of £35 million (2015: £21 million). 
The pricing of debt instruments has been subject to signiﬁcant 
volatility since the middle of 2015, particularly in the US, due to 
increased credit concerns about speciﬁc sectors such as oil and 
gas, metals and mining, energy and utilities. The European 
market, which generally has more limited exposure to oil and gas 
and metals and mining, experienced less volatility. As long-term 
holders of CLO equity positions, our returns are ultimately driven 
by the cash ﬂows and the realised default and loss rates in the 
portfolio, rather than short-term unrealised fair value movements, 
but we remain subject to the impact of mark-to-market volatility. 
 
3i Global Floating Rate Income Fund 
(“Global Income Fund”) 
The Global Income Fund launched in June 2015 
with US$75 million of seed capital from 3i and total 
assets under management of US$150 million. It aims 
to generate income, preserve capital for investors 
and seeks capital appreciation when market 
opportunities arise. 
The Global Income Fund is managed jointly by  
3i’s London and New York teams, and this supports 
investment in a diverse global portfolio of corporate 
credit assets, with exposure principally to North 
American and western European issuers. The teams 
seek to take advantage of relative value between 
assets, sectors and geographies, and aim to protect 
against downside risk and maintain portfolio 
diversity. At 31 March 2016, the fund had assets 
under management of US$188 million and had 
outperformed its benchmark by over 2% since 
inception.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016  Debt Management
Strategic report
 Business review
Fund raising activity 
Debt Management made good progress, particularly in the  
ﬁrst half of our ﬁnancial year, in generating new AUM. The team 
closed two CLOs in Europe, Harvest XII and Harvest XIV, and two 
in the US, Jamestown VII and Jamestown VIII, raising a total of 
£1.3 billion new CLO AUM. CLO issuance slowed signiﬁcantly in 
the second half of our ﬁnancial year. US CLO issuance in the three 
months to 31 March 2016 was 25% of the prior year CLO volumes. 
However, following an improvement in sentiment from March 
2016, prices are recovering and our latest European CLO,  
Harvest XV, priced at the end of March and closed on 12 May 
2016. We also had an open CLO warehouse vehicle in the US  
in anticipation of launching the ﬁrst US CLO of FY2017 . 
Following on from the successful launch of the European Middle 
Market Loan Fund, we continued to diversify our product offering 
and launched a new Global Income Fund with US$75 million of 
seed capital from 3i. The fund is an open-ended senior debt fund 
that invests across the US and Europe and, as at 31 March 2016, 
had AUM of US$188 million. The US Senior Loan Fund also 
continued to perform strongly, outperforming its benchmarks, 
and AUM increased to US$178 million (31 March 2015: 
US$157 million). 
Proprietary Capital investment
Including the US$75 million seed capital contributed to the Global 
Income Fund, we had £229 million (31 March 2015: £176 million) of 
proprietary capital invested in the Debt Management business at 
31 March 2016. 3i is required to hold a minimum 5% stake in the 
European CLOs it manages. We also structure our US CLOs in 
anticipation of the implementation of similar risk retention rules 
in the US in December 2016. Our ability to comply with the risk 
retention rules is important as it is now a prerequisite for 
managers, even in the US, to demonstrate compliance with the 
regulatory rules. 
In addition to the investments 3i makes in the CLOs for regulatory 
reasons, 3i is also the ﬁrst loss investor in the majority of the 
warehouse facilities used to accumulate loans prior to the launch 
of a CLO. At 31 March 2016, the total invested by 3i in these 
facilities was £17 million (31 March 2015: £43 million).

Outlook
The underlying credit performance of the portfolios underpinning 
our CLOs and other funds remains sound, with metrics 
outperforming market benchmarks despite the challenging year. 
Given our strong relationships with investors and ability to meet 
current and future fund risk retention requirements, we are in a 
good position to continue launching new CLOs and raising funds, 
if market conditions permit and returns are sufﬁciently attractive.
26
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 Effective risk management underpins 
the successful delivery of our strategy. 
Integrity, rigour and accountability are 
central to our values and culture at 3i 
and are embedded in our approach 
to risk management.
Understanding our risk appetite and culture
As both an investor and asset manager, 3i is in the business of 
taking risk in order to seek to achieve its targeted returns for 
investors and shareholders. The Board approves the strategic 
objectives that determine the level and types of risk that 3i is 
prepared to accept. The Board reviews 3i’s strategic objectives 
and risk appetite at least annually. 
In order to support its institutional asset management capability, 
3i’s risk appetite policy is built on rigorous and comprehensive 
investment procedures and conservative capital management. 
Culture
Integrity, rigour and accountability are central to our values and 
culture and are embedded in our approach to risk management. 
Our Investment Committee which has oversight of the investment 
pipeline development and approves new investments, signiﬁcant 
portfolio changes and divestments, is integral to embedding  
our institutional approach across the business. It ensures 
consistency and compliance with 3i’s ﬁnancial and strategic 
requirements, cultural values and appropriate investment 
behaviours. Members of the Executive Committee have 
responsibility for their own business or functional areas and the 
Group expects individual behaviours to meet the Group’s high 
standards of conduct. All employees share the responsibility 
for upholding 3i’s strong control culture and supporting effective 
risk management. Senior managers, typically those who report 
to Executive Committee members, are required to conﬁrm their 
individual and business area compliance. In addition, all staff are 
assessed on their compliance with the Group values as part of 
their annual appraisal. 
The following sections explain how we control and manage the 
risks in our business. It outlines the key risks, our assessment of 
their potential impact on our business in the context of the current 
environment and how we seek to mitigate them. 
3i Group’s Pillar 3 document  
can be found at
 www.3i.com
Risk appetite
3i’s risk appetite is deﬁned by its objective to invest proprietary 
capital in assets that generate sufﬁcient proceeds to fund new 
opportunities and allow material shareholder distributions as 
well as good levels of cash income. 
Investment risk 
The substantial majority of the Group’s capital is invested in 
Private Equity. Private Equity investments are subject to a range 
of factors which include:
 – Return objective: individually assessed but subject to a target 
2x money multiple over three to ﬁve years
 – Geographic focus: core markets of northern Europe and 
North America
 – Sector expertise: focus on Business Services, Consumer 
and Industrials
 – Vintage: invest c.€500 million–€750 million per annum in four 
to seven new investments in companies with an enterprise 
value range of €100 million–€500 million at investment
Our other two businesses are more modest users of 
proprietary capital but each investment is subject to 
rigorous review. 
Capital management
3i adopts a conservative approach to managing its capital 
resources. There is no appetite for signiﬁcant structural gearing 
at the Group level although short-term tactical gearing will be 
used. In addition, we have a limited appetite for the dilution of 
capital returns as a result of operating and interest expenses. 
All three of our business lines, Private Equity, Infrastructure  
and Debt Management also generate cash income to 
mitigate this risk.

Risk governance structure
Approach to risk governance
The Board is responsible for risk assessment, the risk 
management process and for the protection of the Group’s 
reputation and brand integrity. It considers the most signiﬁcant 
risks facing the Group and uses quantitative analyses, such as  
the vintage control which considers the portfolio concentration  
by revenue, geography and sector, and liquidity reporting,  
where appropriate. 
Non-executive oversight is also exercised through the Audit and 
Compliance Committee which focuses on upholding standards of 
integrity, ﬁnancial reporting, risk management, going concern and 
internal control. The Audit and Compliance Committee’s activities 
are discussed further on pages 75 to 78. 
28
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016
Strategic report
Risk management The Board has delegated the responsibility for risk oversight to 
the Chief Executive. He is assisted by the Group Risk Committee 
(“GRC”) in managing this responsibility, guided by the Board’s 
appetite for risk and any speciﬁc limits set. The GRC maintains the 
Group risk review, which summarises the Group’s principal risks, 
associated mitigating actions and key risk indicators, and 
identiﬁes any changes to the Group’s risk proﬁle. The risk review  
is updated quarterly and the Chief Executive provides quarterly 
updates to each Audit and Compliance Committee meeting 
where the Committee members contribute views and raise 
questions. The last risk review was completed in May 2016.
The risk framework is further augmented by a separate Risk 
Management Function which has speciﬁc responsibilities under 
the European Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 
(“AIFMD”). It meets ahead of the GRC meetings to consider the 
key risks impacting the Group, and any changes in the relevant 
period where appropriate. It also considers the separate risk 
reports for each AIF managed by the Group, including areas such 
as portfolio composition, portfolio valuation, operational updates 
and team changes, which are then considered by the GRC. 
Assurance over the robustness and effectiveness of the Group’s 
overarching risk management processes and compliance with 
relevant policies is provided to the Audit and Compliance 
Committee through the independent assessment by Internal 
Audit and the work of Group Compliance on regulatory risks. 
Assurance over the robustness of the Group’s valuation policy 
is provided by the Valuations Committee whose report can be 
found on pages 79 to 81.
In addition to the above, a number of other committees 
contribute to the Group’s overall risk governance structure, 
as set out on page 28.
Risk management framework
The Group’s risk management framework is designed to support 
the delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives.
The key principles that underpin risk management in the 
Group are:
 – The Board and the Executive Committee promote a culture 
in which risks are identiﬁed, assessed and reported in an open, 
transparent and objective manner; and
 – The over-riding priority is to protect the Group’s long-term 
viability and reputation and produce sustainable, medium 
to long-term cash-to-cash returns. 
Managing the Group’s Environmental, Social and Governance 
(“ESG”) risks is central to how we do business and a key part of 
our risk management framework. It also forms part of our half-
yearly portfolio company reviews as described in the Valuations 
Committee report on page 79. 
In practice, the Group operates a “three lines of defence” 
framework for managing and identifying risk. The ﬁrst line of 
defence against outcomes outside our risk appetite is the 
business function and the respective Managing Partners across 
Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management. 
Line management is supported by oversight and control functions 
such as ﬁnance, human resources and legal which constitute the 
second line of defence. The Compliance function is also in the 
second line of defence; its duties include reviewing the effective 
operation of our processes in meeting regulatory requirements. 
Internal Audit provides independent assurance over the operation 
of controls and is the third line of defence. The internal audit 
programme includes the review of risk management processes 
and recommendations to improve the internal control 
environment. 
Risk review process
The Group risk review process includes the monitoring of key 
strategic and ﬁnancial metrics considered to be indicators of 
potential changes in the Group’s risk proﬁle. The review includes, 
but is not limited to, the following reference data:
 – Financial performance and strategic dashboards
 – Vintage control and asset allocation analysis
 – Macro-economic and M&A market overview
 – Liquidity management
 – Capital adequacy, including stress testing
 – Operating expenses
 – Portfolio performance reports for Private Equity, Infrastructure 
and Debt Management
 – Risk reports for managed AIFs
 – Quarterly Group risk log
In addition to the above, the GRC considers the impact of any 
changes and developments in its risk proﬁle, strategic delivery 
and reputation quarterly.
The GRC uses the above to identify a number of key risks. It then 
evaluates the impact and likelihood of each key risk, with reference 
to associated measures and key performance indicators. 
The adequacy of the mitigation plans is then assessed and, 
if necessary, additional actions are agreed and then reviewed 
at the subsequent meeting. 
A number of focus topics are also agreed in advance of each 
meeting. In FY2016, the GRC covered the update to the Group’s 
IT strategy; 3i’s approach to ESG especially with respect to its 
portfolio companies; business continuity and cyber security; an 
update on the implementation of Infrastructure’s revised strategy, 
as well as the changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and relevant risks for 3i associated with the UK EU referendum. 
There were no signiﬁcant changes to the Group’s approach to 
risk governance or its operation in FY2016 but we have continued 
to reﬁne our framework for risk management and reporting 
where appropriate.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 Review of principal risks
The disclosures on the following pages are not an exhaustive 
list of risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, but rather a 
summary of those principal risks which are under active review 
by the GRC and Board, and are believed to have the potential 
to affect materially the achievement of the Group’s strategic 
objectives and impact its ﬁnancial performance, reputation 
and brand integrity. 
The Group’s risk proﬁle and appetite remain broadly stable. 
Although the economic outlook deteriorated and market volatility 
and uncertainty increased in the second half of our ﬁnancial year, 
the Group’s overall risk proﬁle has not changed signiﬁcantly. 
The Group believes that its consistent strategy of focusing on core 
sectors and geographies, its institutional process-led approach to 
investment and strong culture have helped it to maintain its stable 
risk proﬁle. A number of risks have been consolidated year on year 
in the Principal risks and mitigations table to best reﬂect their 
impact on the Group.
External
The external environment remains difﬁcult. There has been a 
signiﬁcant amount of uncertainty in the Eurozone and the wider 
emerging markets’ economies fuelled by a challenging global 
macro-economic context and ongoing geo-political tensions, 
including the UK referendum on EU membership. In addition, 
there is also some evidence of softening of US and Eurozone 
growth rates. The Group continues to monitor all of these 
events closely. 
The Group is subject to a range of regulatory and tax reporting 
requirements which continue to evolve. These include the AIFMD, 
regulations under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation 
(“EMIR”), Capital Requirements Directive IV (“CRDIV”), the FCA’s 
Client Asset rules (“CASS”), the Foreign Account Tax Compliance 
Act (“FATCA”) and the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard. 
These developments have resulted in increased reporting 
requirements, operational complexity and operational cost to 
the business. Managing these regulatory requirements is a key 
priority and they are the subject of regular updates to Executive 
Committee and the Board. To date, they have had limited 
practical impact on 3i’s ability to deliver its strategy. 
Looking forward, although the Base Erosion and Proﬁt Shifting 
(“BEPS”) proposals have now been published, it is not clear 
how individual countries will implement these proposals and 
the timing and extent of implementation as they do. The UK is 
already in the process of changing its domestic tax rules and 
implementing certain BEPS actions such as country-by-country 
reporting and limiting the tax deductibility for interest expense. 
The OECD has indicated that further detail on some of the 
proposals will be published in 2016. The Group continues to 
monitor developments carefully and intends to comply with 
new rules as and when they are implemented.
Investment
Being an investment company, there are a number of signiﬁcant 
risks that impact our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. 
Firstly our ability to source attractive investment opportunities 
at the right price is critical. The investment case presented at 
the outset will include the expected beneﬁt of operational 
improvements, growth initiatives and M&A activity that will be 
driven by our active management approach, together with the 
portfolio company’s management team. It will also include a 
view on the likely exit strategy and timing. The execution of this 
investment case is monitored through our monthly portfolio 
monitoring and our semi-annual reviews which focus on longer 
term and strategic developments. Alongside this we need to 
recognise the need to plan and execute a successful exit at the 
optimum time for the portfolio company’s development after 
taking account of market conditions. These risks are closely linked 
to the economic environment noted above. To mitigate these 
risks, we focus on sectors and geographies where our expertise 
and network can drive signiﬁcant outperformance. 
In addition, there are a number of risks speciﬁc to each business 
line as follows:
Private Equity
Regular and robust portfolio monitoring procedures remain 
critical given the volatile economic backdrop and as the 
investment portfolio becomes more concentrated. The Private 
Equity partners hold a detailed monthly portfolio monitoring 
meeting that is attended by the Group Chief Executive and the 
Group Finance Director. In addition, the Valuations Committee 
reviews the valuation assumptions of our more material assets 
quarterly. Individual portfolio company failures could have 
adverse reputational consequences for the Group, even though 
the value impact may not be material.
Infrastructure
3iN announced an amended total return target of 8% – 10% per 
annum over the medium term in May 2015 (previously a 10% 
annual target) as strong investor demand for yield was impacting 
the business’ ability to maintain investment rates in quality assets. 
Infrastructure remains focused on investing selectively within its 
target sectors and developing both organic and inorganic growth 
opportunities. In addition, its engaged asset management 
approach supports many of the investments in the economic 
infrastructure and project portfolios.

with its business plan and to mitigate negative impact on returns. 
The business is exposed to volatility in the credit markets and the 
challenging market conditions in the US have negatively impacted 
valuations of our CLO equity in FY2016. Our teams manage the 
underlying credit portfolios very actively which, in some cases, 
might include taking early losses in volatile markets, if appropriate. 
Due to the introduction of risk retention rules in Europe (effective 
2011) and the US (effective December 2016), we are required,  
as managers, to take minimum positions in the CLO funds we 
manage. In addition, during the warehouse phase of establishing 
CLOs, the Group is exposed to market volatilities and the 
potential for further capital calls.
Operational
One of the key areas of increased potential operational risk is 
cyber security. In response to this growing threat, management 
engaged KPMG to conduct an independent review of the 
adequacy of the Group’s ability to prevent, detect and respond to 
cyber security threats. In addition, the Group rolled out a cyber 
security training course for all staff and refreshed information 
security policies and incident management processes. The Group 
also conducted a wider review of its business continuity and 
resilience capabilities. The ﬁndings and proposed enhancements 
from these various workstreams were discussed at GRC and are 
being implemented across the Group.
The Board also received regular updates on ESG risks and 
whether our investors’ skill sets and business development 
capabilities could support the Group’s strategic delivery. 
Detailed resource plans are in place at the business line level 
and the Board conducts an annual review of the Group’s 
organisational capability and succession plans (which include 
contingencies against loss of key staff). The last review was 
conducted in September 2015. 
Viability statement
The Directors have assessed 3i’s viability over a three-year 
period to March 2019. 3i conducts its strategic planning over 
a ﬁve-year period; this statement is based on the ﬁrst three 
years, which provides more certainty over the forecasting 
assumptions used. 3i’s strategic plan, Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process (“ICAAP”) and associated 
principal risks (as set out on pages 32 to 35 of the Strategic 
report) are the foundation of the Directors’ assessment. 
The Directors reviewed an assessment of the potential 
effects of 3i’s principal risks on its current portfolio and 
forecast investment and realisation activity. They considered 
the consequent impact on 3i’s capital and liquidity in a 
number of severe but plausible scenarios.
Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet all their liabilities as they 
fall due up to March 2019.

Basis
3i prepares its statutory ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
IFRS. The introduction of IFRS 10 in 2014 was important for 
investment companies such as 3i, as the investment entity 
exception it contained eliminated the risk of having to consolidate 
portfolio investments. However, consistent with previous years, 
we also report using a non-GAAP “Investment basis” , as we 
believe it aids users of our report to assess the Group’s 
underlying operating performance. Total return and net assets 
are the same under the Investment basis and IFRS and we 
provide more detail on IFRS 10, as well as a reconciliation of 
our Investment basis ﬁnancial statements to the IFRS ﬁnancial 
statements, from page 48.
Total return
The Group generated a total return of £824 million, or a proﬁt 
on opening shareholders’ funds of 21.7% (2015: £659 million or 
19.9%) in the year as the robust performance of its underlying 
portfolio more than offset the impact of volatile market 
conditions. The Proprietary Capital business delivered a gross 
investment return of £1,069 million (2015: £805 million) and an 
operating proﬁt before carry of £920 million (2015: £721 million), 
underpinned by the strong performance of its portfolio 
companies as well as by the strengthening of the euro and US 
dollar against sterling. Fund Management operating proﬁt before 
carry was £20 million (2015: £26 million). Further detail regarding 
the performance during the year is provided below.

Portfolio and other information
37
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 Proprietary capital returns
Operating proﬁt before carry on our Proprietary Capital was 
£920 million (2015: £721 million) and was underpinned by strong 
value growth in the portfolio and positive foreign exchange 
movements which partly reversed negative foreign exchange 
movements incurred in 2014 and 2015. 
By business line, gross investment return on opening portfolio 
value was 32% for Private Equity (2015: 24%), 8% for Infrastructure 
(2015: 20%) and 6% for Debt Management (2015: loss of 7%). 
Private Equity accounted for 83% of the Proprietary Capital 
portfolio at 31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: 81%) and remains 
the primary driver of Proprietary Capital returns. 
Realised proﬁts
Exit momentum continued in the year to 31 March 2016 with 
realisation proceeds of £796 million (2015: £841 million) generating 
realised proﬁts of £72 million (2015: £162 million). Realisations, 
excluding reﬁnancings, were achieved at an uplift over opening 
value of 13%, (2015: 27%), due to a number of assets being valued 
on an imminent sales basis at the beginning of the year and the 
sale of quoted stakes. 
The majority of the realisations were from the Private Equity 
portfolio, which contributed £743 million (2015: £831 million) 
of this, including £185 million of reﬁnancing proceeds 
(2015: £155 million). Reﬁnancing proceeds of £168 million were 
generated by Action, whose strong cash generation meant it had 
de-levered rapidly since its reﬁnancing in January 2015. Private 
Equity proceeds also included the sale of Element for £179 million 
and £111 million from sales of our quoted stakes. Table 2, in the 
Private Equity section, details the Private Equity realisations in the 
year and sets out the accounting uplift reﬂected in this year’s total 
return and the longer-term cash-to-cash results. The Private 
Equity realisations, including reﬁnancings and partial disposals 
completed in the year, have generated a money multiple of 2.6x 
over their investment life.
Proceeds of £51 million were received from 3iN, via a special 
dividend, following the completion of the sale of its holding 
in Eversholt Rail, and these were treated as realised proceeds. 
Unrealised value movements
The unrealised value movement of £669 million (2015: £684 million) 
was driven by the continued strong performance of a number of 
our key assets, which more than offset market-driven weakness  
in a small number of portfolio companies. Table 8 summarises  
the revaluation movement by category and each category is 
discussed further below.

Private Equity unrealised value growth 
The Private Equity portfolio performed strongly with value 
growth of £690 million in the year (2015: £641 million). This was 
underpinned by good value weighted earnings growth of 17% 
(2015: 19%) and a weighted multiple increase of 10% (2015: 6%), 
following the re-rating of a small number of our assets. Net debt 
declined to 2.9x EBITDA (31 March 2015: 3.1x) notwithstanding 
the fact that Action took advantage of its strong cash generation 
capability to take on additional debt at favourable terms. 
The majority of the portfolio (84% by value, 2015: 93%) grew its 
earnings in the year and our larger and more recent investments 
continue to perform very well.
Performance 
Improvements in the performance of the portfolio valued on an 
earnings basis resulted in an increase in value of £460 million 
(2015: £417 million). Value weighted earnings increased by 17%  
in the year (2015: 19%). Action, our largest asset with over 30% 
earnings growth in the 12 months to December 2015, is the 
biggest contributor to this measure. Excluding Action, the value 
weighted earnings growth was lower at 7% (2015: 16%) principally 
due to the sale of Element, one of our largest assets with high 
growth supported by its buy and build strategy and the impact 
of macro-economic challenges, such as the oil and commodity 
price pressure, seen in a small number of portfolio companies 
(JMJ, Dynatect, Agent Provocateur, AES and Etanco). In addition, 
acquisitions by our portfolio companies were fewer this year and 
therefore the contribution from acquisitions to earnings growth 
in 2016 was lower (2015: 2% of the 19% growth).

earnings data is available. This represents 80% of the Private Equity 
portfolio by value.
The value of a small number of investments was impacted by 
company and geography speciﬁc issues. In total, value reductions 
of £64 million, in relation to seven assets, offset the otherwise 
strong performance (2015: £44 million, seven assets). The largest 
single negative movement related to JMJ, a leading safety 
management consultancy with a particular focus on major capital 
projects for the oil and gas industry. We recognised a £19 million 
value reduction on this investment in the year.
Forecast earnings, used when the outlook is lower than the last 
12 months’ data, were used for only two investments at 31 March 
2016, representing 7% of the portfolio by number and 3% by value 
(31 March 2015: two, 6% by number and 3% by value). Chart 1 
shows the earnings growth rates across the portfolio.
In the case of Action, EBITDA for valuation purposes is adjusted  
to reﬂect its run-rate performance. Action is growing strongly due, 
in part, to its successful store roll-out programme. We consider 
that this run-rate methodology reﬂects fairly the high growth 
characteristics of this business, and therefore its maintainable 
earnings. At £902 million (31 March 2015: £592 million), net of the 
£168 million reﬁnancing in January 2016, Action is the largest 
Private Equity investment by value, representing 24% of the 
Private Equity portfolio (31 March 2015: 19%).
We took the opportunity to reﬁnance the debt of Action and 
Geka, both increasing and extending the maturity of portfolio 
debt, with 82% of the overall portfolio debt now repayable in 2018 
or later (31 March 2015: 81% in 2017 or later). Chart 2 shows the 
ratio of net debt to EBITDA weighted by portfolio value.

Multiple movements 
The weighted average EBITDA multiple of the Private Equity 
portfolio assets valued on an earnings basis increased from  
11.2x at 31 March 2015 to 12.3x at 31 March 2016 before liquidity 
discount, and from 10.5x to 11.5x after liquidity discount,  
resulting in a positive movement in the year of £95 million 
(2015: £64 million). Due to another year of strong performance 
against its comparable set, we reviewed Action’s EBITDA multiple 
and increased it by 0.5x to 14.7x pre-liquidity discount and 14.0x 
post discount (31 March 2015: 14.2x, 13.5x). Based on the run-rate 
earnings and capital structure at 31 March 2016, a 1.0x movement 
in the EBITDA multiple applied would increase or decrease 
Action’s value by £86 million. Excluding Action, the weighted 
average EBITDA multiple increased to 10.8x before liquidity 
discount (31 March 2015: 10.1x) and was 10.1x after liquidity 
discount (31 March 2015: 9.3x). We also increased the multiple 
used to value Basic-Fit to reﬂect its strong performance, 
signiﬁcant capital investment programme and a positive market 
environment for discount gym operators more generally. 
We continued to adjust multiples lower in 17 out of the 29 
companies (31 March 2015: 22 out of 33) valued on an earnings 
basis. As a matter of policy, we select an appropriate multiple for 
each investment based on a comparable set of quoted companies 
and adjust these comparable multiple sets with discounts and 
occasionally premiums to take account of relevant size, sector, 
growth and cycle considerations as appropriate. Against a volatile 
market backdrop, we continued to apply a relatively high level of 
adjustments to reﬂect our caution about longer-term and sector 
multiple trends rather than taking an average of the quoted 
comparable sets.
The pre-discount multiples used to value the portfolio ranged 
between 6.5x and 14.7x and post-discount multiples ranged from 
5.5x to 14.0x.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 Imminent sale
The exit processes for Amor and Mayborn were sufﬁciently 
progressed to value on an imminent sales basis at 31 March 2016. 
The uplift to imminent sale was £13 million (2015: £22 million).  
Both sales were announced post year end and are expected 
to complete by the end of June 2016.
Discounted cash ﬂow
The largest investment valued using DCF in the Private Equity 
portfolio is Scandlines, the Danish/German ferry group, which 
increased in value by £122 million (2015: £94 million). Scandlines’ 
largest ferry route, Rødby-Puttgarden, is expected to have direct 
competition from a new tunnel (the Fehmarn Belt project) at some 
point in the future. In light of recent public commentary and 
developments around expected potential delays to the opening 
of this new tunnel, we revised our assumption as to the tunnel 
opening date by three years since 31 March 2015 and two years 
since 30 September 2015. This change, combined with a reduction 
in the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”), were the 
primary drivers of the increase in the value of our investment in 
Scandlines in the year.
Quoted portfolio
The Private Equity quoted portfolio, including IPOs completed 
in the year, generated an unrealised value reduction of £7 million 
(2015: £46 million gain) principally driven by our holding in Hong 
Kong listed Dphone. Table 9 details the movement in the year 
and closing quoted portfolio. 
Infrastructure unrealised value movement
The Infrastructure portfolio consists primarily of our 34% holding 
in 3iN. 3iN continued to perform well during the year, as it has an 
attractive portfolio of core European assets. 3iN generated value 
growth of £33 million (2015: £77 million) for 3i Group in the year, 
driven by an 8% increase in the share price to 173 pence  
(2015: 160 pence, 19% increase) and a total shareholder return  
of 13%. This was offset by further modest falls in the value of the 
Indian Infrastructure portfolio of £12 million (2015: £9 million) 
as the investments continued to face a number of challenges.
Debt Management unrealised value movement
The Debt Management Proprietary Capital portfolio consists 
principally of CLO equity and at 31 March 2016, 3i had invested 
£151 million of proprietary capital in CLO equity (31 March 
2015: £117 million). The remaining Debt Management portfolio is 
comprised of direct investments in CLO warehouses, the Global 
Income Fund and the Senior Loan fund. 
The mark-to-market valuation of the CLO equity portfolio reduced 
by £43 million (2015: £25 million) and there were a number of  
other factors which contributed to this movement. We received 
£31 million (2015: £16 million) of cash distributions from CLO 
equity, which is included in portfolio income, resulting in an 
associated value reduction. Broker quotes, which are used to 
support CLO valuations, reﬂected general market concerns about 
liquidity and investor risk appetite. In the US in particular, negative 
investor sentiment around the oil and gas, commodities and 
utilities sectors impacted valuations signiﬁcantly. The underlying 
cash ﬂows of the CLOs remain sound, and our longer-term view 
of returns remains positive.

Financial review Portfolio income
Portfolio income increased by 24% to £140 million 
(2015: £113 million) of which £93 million was received in cash 
(2015: £80 million). Dividends of £71 million were received 
(2015: £45 million), including £31 million from CLO investments 
(2015: £16 million), £21 million from 3iN (2015: £20 million) and 
£18 million from Private Equity (2015: £9 million). Interest income 
totalled £63 million (2015: £62 million), with £59 million 
(2015: £56 million) generated from Private Equity investments 
and £4 million (2015: £6 million) generated from investments 
held in Debt Management warehouses. 
Net portfolio fees of £6 million were recognised during the year 
(2015: £6 million) from new Private Equity investments and 
monitoring fees.
Net foreign exchange movements
The net foreign exchange gain of £157 million in the year 
(2015: £114 million loss) reﬂects the translation of non-sterling 
denominated portfolio assets and non-portfolio net assets, 
including cash and gross debt held at the balance sheet date.  
This movement reﬂects the strengthening of the euro (9.1%) 
against sterling over the year. 
The net assets of the Group by currency and the sensitivity for 
further currency movements are shown in Table 10 below.

Proprietary Capital costs
A proportion of the Group’s operating expenses that are 
assessed as having been incurred in running a regulated and 
listed investment trust are allocated to Proprietary Capital. 
These costs include 100% of costs in relation to the CEO and 
Group Finance Director and elements of ﬁnance, IT, property 
and compliance. Operating expenses were broadly stable 
at £31 million (2015: £32 million) as the Group continued 
to manage costs closely. 
Synthetic fees, the internal fee payable to the Fund Management 
business for managing the Group’s Proprietary Capital, of 
£44 million (2015: £45 million) reﬂect the lower level of Proprietary 
Capital being managed as a result of net divestment activity, 
predominantly in Private Equity. 
Net interest payable
Gross interest payable declined to £47 million (2015: £49 million) 
due to the reduced costs associated with the revolving credit 
facility which was reﬁnanced in September 2014. 
The current gross debt position is detailed further in the Balance 
sheet section of this Financial review and in Note 16 of the 
ﬁnancial statements.
Cash interest received increased marginally to £4 million 
(2015: £3 million).
Fund Management returns
This year the Board agreed to remove Fund Management 
proﬁtability as a KPI. While Fund Management proﬁtability is  
still monitored when managing the individual business lines to 
ensure cost discipline, our decision not to raise a new Private 
Equity fund means that it is no longer expected to be a material 
driver of the Group’s performance. 
The Group’s Fund Management income is driven by total 
AUM, which was £14.0 billion at 31 March 2016 (31 March 
2015: £13.5 billion). The closing of four CLOs and the launch  
of the Global Income Fund, and further commitments to the 
European Middle Market Fund and US Senior Loan Fund in the 
Debt Management business offset a fall in AUM arising from 
net divestment activity in Private Equity and the special dividend 
from 3iN. The proportion of third-party assets under management 
increased marginally to 76% (31 March 2015: 75%).
The Fund Management business generated an operating 
proﬁt before carry of £20 million and an operating proﬁt margin  
of 16% (2015: £26 million, 21%). Fee income declined marginally  
to £123 million (2015: £125 million) due to reduced third-party 
Private Equity AUM. Operating expenses increased marginally to 
£103 million (2015: £99 million), principally due to the redundancy 
costs noted in the Private Equity business line section.

Carried interest and performance fees payable
Our largest Private Equity fund, Eurofund V, which includes 
investments made in 2007–12, reached its performance hurdle on 
a valuation basis in FY2016. We have seen a strong recovery in the 
fund’s multiple to 1.7x (31 March 2015: 1.4x) principally due to the 
performance of Action and Scandlines, as well as the realisations 
of Element and Amor. As a result, we are now accruing carried 
interest receivable from this fund for the ﬁrst time and £63 million 
was recognised in the year (2015: nil). This is calculated assuming 
that the portfolio was realised at the 31 March 2016 valuation. 
We pay carried interest to our investment teams on proprietary 
capital invested and share a proportion of carried interest 
receivable from third-party funds. In Private Equity, we typically 
accrue carried interest payable at between 10–15% of gross 
investment return. The improved performance over the last 
12 months means that the majority of assets by value are now held 
in schemes that would have met their performance hurdles, 
assuming that the portfolio was realised at the 31 March 2016 
valuation. We accrued carried interest payable of £171 million 
(2015: £103 million) for Private Equity in the year, of which 
£48 million relates to the team’s share of carry receivable from 
Eurofund V (2015: nil). 
3iN pays a performance fee based on 3iN’s NAV on an annual 
basis, subject to a hurdle rate of return and a high-water mark. 
The continued good performance of the European assets held  
by 3iN resulted in the recognition of £20 million of performance 
fees receivable in the year (2015: £45 million). Carry payable to  
the Infrastructure team of £15 million (2015: £35 million) has  
been accrued. 
Carry is only paid once the hurdles are passed in cash terms and 
the cash proceeds are actually received following a realisation or 
reﬁnancing event. During the year, £15 million was paid 
(2015: £7 million). 
In total at 31 March 2016, balance sheet carried interest and 
performance fees payable increased to £404 million (31 March 
2015: £227 million) and the receivable increased to £122 million 
(31 March 2015: £88 million). 
Pension
The valuation of assets of the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
schemes was impacted by the volatility in ﬁnancial markets during 
the year. The liability of the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
scheme declined in the year following an increase in the 
discount rate. On a net basis, these movements resulted in 
a re-measurement loss of £6 million (2015: £14 million loss) for 
the year. On an IAS19 basis the pension scheme remains 
in a signiﬁcant surplus.
42
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016
Strategic report
Financial review The 2013 triennial valuation of the UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
scheme was completed in March 2014. It resulted in a very small 
surplus and consequently no further contributions were made, 
or are planned, as a result of this valuation. The next triennial 
valuation will be based on the pension scheme’s funding  
position at 30 June 2016.
We launched a programme to offer our members ﬂexibility  
in how they take their pension beneﬁts following the 
implementation of HM Treasury’s “Freedom and Choice in 
Pensions” changes. This included providing ﬁnancial advice  
and a range of options for deferred and pensioner members.
Tax
The Group’s parent company is an approved investment trust 
company for UK tax purposes. Approved investment trust 
companies are used as investment fund vehicles. The tax 
exemption for capital proﬁts from which they beneﬁt ensures that 
investors do not suffer double taxation of their investment returns. 
The majority of our returns are capital returns for tax purposes 
(realised proﬁts, fair value adjustments and impairment losses) 
and are substantially non-taxable. As a result, the Group’s tax 
charge in the year was nil (2015: £4 million).

Operating cash proﬁt 
Third-party fees received remained broadly ﬂat during the year, 
as the launch of four Debt Management CLOs and the Global 
Income Fund largely offset the reduction in fees from our Private 
Equity funds. Increased investment into cash yielding Debt 
Management funds has generated good income and the Private 
Equity portfolio generated a higher level of dividend income. 
Consequently, the Group was able materially to improve its 
operating cash income to £171 million (2015: £158 million) despite 
the net divestment activity in Private Equity. 
Total operating expenses increased by 2% to £134 million 
(2015: £131 million), while restructuring costs, which comprise 
redundancy, ofﬁce closures and organisational changes, increased 
to £5 million (2015: £1 million). Excluding restructuring and 
redundancy costs, operating expenses were stable at £129 million 
(2015: £130 million) despite some strategic recruitment into our 
investment teams in the second half of the year. Operating 
expenses as a percentage of weighted average AUM remained 
stable at 1.0% (2015: 1.0%), as a result of the continuing cost focus. 
We expect costs to rise marginally as we continue to grow the 
business, increase activity and deal with increased regulation, 
but we expect costs to remain at c.1.0% of AUM.
In total, the operating cash proﬁt position, including this year’s 
restructuring costs, increased signiﬁcantly to £37 million 
(2015: £28 million). 
Cash ﬂow
Investment and realisations
Proceeds from realisations were £796 million (2015: £841 million), 
of which £25 million was receivable at 31 March 2016. Cash 
proceeds of £771 million were offset partly by cash investment 
of £453 million (2015: £474 million) and resulted in net cash inﬂow 
of £318 million (2015: £367 million). A further £99 million 
of investment was non-cash due to capitalised interest 
(2015: £140 million) and total investment was £552 million 
(2015: £614 million).
Further detail on investment and realisations is included in the 
relevant business line sections.

Gearing nil nil
The proprietary capital portfolio increased to £4,497 million at 
31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: £3,877 million) as cash investment 
of £453 million, unrealised value growth of £669 million and 
foreign exchange movements of £188 million outweighed the 
good level of realisations.
Gross debt includes a euro denominated bond of £262 million 
(31 March 2015: £240 million) which matures on 17 March 2017 . 
We expect to repay that bond out of cash resources. 
Net divestment activity and an operating cash proﬁt led to cash 
and deposits on the balance sheet increasing to £1,002 million 
(31 March 2015: £864 million). After allowing for an increase in the 
sterling equivalent of the 2017 euro denominated bond, the 
Group was in a net cash position of £165 million at 31 March 2016 
(31 March 2015: £49 million net cash). Gearing remained at nil at 
31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: nil). 
Liquidity
Liquidity remained strong at £1,352 million (31 March 
2015: £1,214 million) and comprised cash and deposits 
of £1,002 million (31 March 2015: £864 million) and undrawn 
facilities of £350 million (31 March 2015: £350 million). 
Foreign exchange hedging
Although derivatives are not used to hedge currency movements 
on a portfolio basis, we do hedge individual investment 
acquisitions or divestments where appropriate. Foreign exchange 
risk is considered an integral part of the investment process. 
Diluted NAV
The diluted NAV per share at 31 March 2016 was 463 pence 
(31 March 2015: 396 pence). This was driven by the total return 
in the year of £824 million (2015: £659 million) and partially offset 
by dividend payments in the year of £190 million, or 20.0 pence 
per share (2015: £183 million, 19.3 pence per share).
Dividend
The Board has declared a total dividend of 22 pence (2015:  
20.0 pence) for 2016. This comprises an 8.1 pence base dividend 
and a 13.9 pence additional dividend. Due to our current net 
divestment activity and robust balance sheet, we have proposed 
an additional dividend above the top end of our 15%–20% 
distribution range, that will result in the total dividend for 2016 
being 27% of gross cash realised proceeds. Following payment  
of an interim dividend of 6.0 pence per share in January 2016,  
and subject to shareholder approval, we will pay the ﬁnal dividend 
of 16.0 pence (2015: 14.0 pence) on 22 July 2016 to shareholders 
on the register at 17 June 2016.
Key accounting judgements and estimates
In preparing these accounts, the key accounting judgement 
estimate relates to the carrying value of our investment assets 
which are stated at fair value.
Given the importance of this area, the Board has a separate 
Valuations Committee to review the valuations policies, process 
and application to individual investments. However, asset 
valuations for non-quoted investments are inherently 
subjective, as they are made on the basis of assumptions which 
may not prove to be accurate. At 31 March 2016, 85% of the 
investment assets were non-quoted (31 March 2015: 80%). 
Accounting for investment entities: an assessment is required 
to determine the degree of control or inﬂuence the Group 
exercises and the form of any control to ensure that the 
ﬁnancial treatment is accurate. IFRS 10 has resulted in a number 
of intermediate holding companies being presented at fair 
value, which has led to reduced transparency of the underlying 
investment performance. As a result, the Group continues to 
present an alternative non-GAAP investment basis set of 
ﬁnancial statements to ensure that the commentary in the 
Strategic report remains fair, balanced and understandable.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016
Investment basis Background to Investment basis 
ﬁnancial statements
The Group makes investments in portfolio companies directly, 
held by 3i Group plc, and indirectly, held through intermediate 
holding company and partnership structures (“Investment entity 
subsidiaries”). It also has other operational subsidiaries which 
provide services and other activities such as employment, 
regulatory activities, management and advice (“Trading 
subsidiaries”). The application of IFRS 10 requires us to fair value 
a number of intermediate holding companies that were previously 
consolidated line by line. This fair value approach, applied at the 
intermediate holding company level, effectively obscures the 
performance of our proprietary capital investments and 
associated transactions occurring in the intermediate holding 
companies. The ﬁnancial effect of the underlying portfolio 
companies and fee income, operating expenses and carried 
interest transactions occurring in Investment entity subsidiaries 
are aggregated into a single value. Other items which were 
previously eliminated on consolidation are now 
included separately.
As a result we introduced separate non-GAAP “Investment basis” 
Statements of comprehensive income, ﬁnancial position and cash 
ﬂow in our 2014 Annual report and accounts to aid understanding 
of our results. The Strategic report is also prepared using the 
Investment basis as we believe it provides a more understandable 
view of our performance. Total return and net assets are equal 
under the Investment basis and IFRS; the Investment basis is 
simply a “look through” of IFRS 10 to present the underlying 
performance. The two diagrams below illustrate these changes, 
together with an illustrative example to show how information can 
be aggregated.
Reconciliation between Investment basis and IFRS

Notes:
1 Applying IFRS 10 to the Statement of comprehensive income consolidates the line items of a number of previously consolidated subsidiaries into a single  
line item “Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries”. In the “Investment basis” accounts we have disaggregated these line items to analyse  
our total return as if these Investment entity subsidiaries were fully consolidated, consistent with prior years. The adjustments simply reclassify the  
Statement of comprehensive income of the Group, and the total return is equal under the Investment basis and the IFRS basis. 
2 Realised proﬁts, unrealised proﬁts, and portfolio income shown in the IFRS accounts only relate to portfolio companies that are held directly by 3i Group 
plc and not those portfolio companies held through Investment entity subsidiaries. Realised proﬁts, unrealised proﬁts, and portfolio income in relation to 
portfolio companies held through Investment entity subsidiaries are aggregated into the single “Fair value movement on investment entity subsidiaries”  
line. This is the most signiﬁcant reduction of information in our IFRS accounts. 
3 Foreign exchange movements have been reclassiﬁed under the Investment basis as foreign currency asset and liability movements. Movements within the 
Investment entity subsidiaries are included within “Fair value movements on investment entities”.
4 Other items also aggregated into the “Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries” line include fees receivable from external funds, audit fees, 
custodian fees, bank charges, other general and administration expenses, carried interest and tax.
The IFRS basis is audited and the Investment basis is unaudited. The external Auditor states in its Audit report on pages 140 to 145 that the information given 
in the FY2016 Strategic report and the Corporate Governance report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.

Reconciliation of Investment basis to IFRS Notes:
1 Applying IFRS 10 to the Statement of ﬁnancial position aggregates the line items into the single line item “Investment in investment entities”. In the 
Investment basis we have disaggregated these items to analyse our net assets as if the Investment entity subsidiaries were consolidated. The adjustment 
reclassiﬁes items in the Statement of ﬁnancial position. There is no change to the net assets, although for reasons explained below, gross assets and gross 
liabilities are different. 
 The disclosure relating to portfolio companies is signiﬁcantly reduced by the aggregation, as the fair value of all investments held by Investment entity 
subsidiaries is aggregated into the “Investments in investment entities” line. We have disaggregated this fair value and disclosed the underlying portfolio 
holding in the relevant line item, ie, quoted equity investments or unquoted equity investments. 
 Other items which may be aggregated are carried interest and other payables, and the Investment basis presentation again disaggregates these items.
2 Cash balances held in Investment entity subsidiaries are also aggregated into the “Investment in investment entities” line. At 31 March 2016 £5 million 
(2015: £3 million) of cash was held in subsidiaries that are now classiﬁed as Investment entity subsidiaries and is therefore included in the “Investment in 
investment entities” line. 
3 Intercompany balances between Investment entity subsidiaries and trading subsidiaries also impact the transparency of our results under the IFRS 
basis. If an Investment entity subsidiary has an intercompany balance with a consolidated trading subsidiary of the Group, then the asset or liability of 
the Investment entity subsidiary will be aggregated into its fair value, while the asset or liability of the consolidated trading subsidiary will be disclosed 
as an asset or liability in the Statement of ﬁnancial position for the Group. Prior to the adoption of IFRS 10, these balances would have been eliminated 
on consolidation. 
4 Investment basis ﬁnancial statements are prepared for performance measurement and therefore reserves are not analysed separately under this basis.
The IFRS basis is audited and the Investment basis is unaudited. The external Auditor states in its Audit report on pages 140 to 145 that the information given 
in the FY2016 Strategic report and the Corporate Governance report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.

Notes:
1 The Consolidated cash ﬂow statement is impacted by the application of IFRS 10 as cash ﬂows to and from Investment entity subsidiaries are disclosed, 
rather than the cash ﬂows to and from the underlying portfolio. 
 Therefore in our Investment basis ﬁnancial statements, we have disclosed our cash ﬂow statement on a “look through” basis, in order to reﬂect the 
underlying sources and uses of cash ﬂows and disclose the underlying investment activity.
2 There is a difference between the change in cash and cash equivalents of the Investment basis ﬁnancial statements and the IFRS ﬁnancial statements 
because there are cash balances held in Investment entity subsidiary vehicles. Cash held within Investment entity subsidiaries will not be shown in the 
IFRS statements but will be seen in the Investment basis statements.
The IFRS basis is audited and the Investment basis is unaudited. The external Auditor states in its Audit report on pages 140 to 145 that the information given 
in the FY2016 Strategic report and the Corporate Governance report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.

Governance
Good corporate governance is fundamental to 3i and its activities 
and is critical to the delivery of value to our stakeholders. For full 
details of our governance structure and processes, please see the 
Corporate Governance section of this report.
Transparency
As a publicly-listed company, 3i operates within a framework 
of formal legal and regulatory disclosure requirements as well 
as meeting the high expectations for transparency of our 
shareholders, fund investors, staff and the media. We are 
committed to communicating both our ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial 
performance in a clear, open and comprehensive manner.
Anti-bribery and corruption
3i does not offer, pay or accept bribes and we only work with third 
parties whose standards of business integrity are substantively 
consistent with ours. We expect the businesses we invest in to 
operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and, 
where appropriate, work towards meeting relevant international 
standards where these are more stringent. This includes, in 
particular, upholding high standards of business integrity, avoiding 
corruption in all its forms and complying with applicable anti-
bribery, anti-fraud and anti-money laundering laws and regulations.
Environmental impact
This section has been prepared in accordance with our regulatory 
obligation to report greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions pursuant 
to Section 7 of the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. 
During the year to 31 March 2016, our measured Scope 1 and 2 
emissions (location-based) totalled 1,106.6 tCO
2
e. This comprised:
Scope FY2016
FY2015 
(restated)
1 252.4 tCO 2e 247 .3 tCO 2e
2Location-based 854.2 tCO 2e 899.0 tCO 2e

544.4 tCO 2 N/A
1 Emissions from the consumption of electricity outside the UK and emissions 
from purchased electricity are calculated using the market-based approach 
using supplier-speciﬁc emission factors are reported in tCO 2 rather than 
tCO 2e due to the availability of emission factors. 
This is equivalent to 4.0 tCO
2
e per full-time equivalent employee, 
based on an average of 276 employees during the year (2015: 4.2 
tCO
2
e; 271 employees). 
We have restated the emissions ﬁgures for the year to 31 March 
2015 to reﬂect improved data collection. Overall our Scope 1 and 
2 emissions decreased by 3% in the year. 
Our emissions have been veriﬁed by an external third party 
according to the ISO 14064-3 standard.

Corporate responsibility
3i is committed to acting as a 
responsible company, a responsible 
employer and a responsible investor. 
We take responsibility for our actions, 
carefully consider how others will be 
affected by our choices and ensure 
that our values and ethics are 
integrated into our formal business 
policies, practices and plans.
This section aims to provide a brief summary of our 
approach to corporate responsibility.
For more information, please see our Corporate 
responsibility report, available on our website. 
Further information on our approach to corporate 
responsibility, including summaries of relevant policies, 
can also be found on our website.
 
3i.com/corporate-responsibility We quantify and report our organisational GHG emissions in 
alignment with the World Resources Institute’s Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and in 
alignment with the new Scope 2 Guidance, which is the most 
signiﬁcant update to the Corporate Standard since its inception. 
We consolidate our organisational boundary according to the 
operational control approach, which includes all our ofﬁces. 
We have adopted a materiality threshold of 5% for GHG reporting 
purposes. The GHG sources that constituted our operational 
boundary for the year to 31 March 2016 are: 
 – Scope 1: natural gas combustion within boilers and fuel 
combustion within leased vehicles; and
 – Scope 2: purchased electricity and heat consumption for our 
own use.
In some cases, where data is missing, values have been estimated 
using either extrapolation of available data or data from the 
previous year as a proxy. 
The new Scope 2 Guidance requires that we quantify and report 
Scope 2 emissions according to two different methodologies 
(“dual reporting”): (i) the location-based method, using average 
emissions factors for the country in which the reported operations 
take place; and (ii) the market-based method, which uses the 
actual emissions factors of the energy procured. 
Whilst we have a very low footprint on the environment, we are 
committed to reducing it further. In our London ofﬁce, where 
approximately two-thirds of our employees are based, we are 
supplied by EDF Energy, which has a cleaner fuel mix than the UK 
average. The dual reporting of our emissions demonstrates the 
impact that procuring energy from suppliers with lower emissions 
has on our greenhouse gas emissions, as reﬂected in our lower 
Scope 2 market-based emissions ﬁgure. 
As part of compliance with the UK Energy Savings Opportunities 
Scheme (“ESOS”), we have identiﬁed further savings which 
could lead to a reduction in electricity consumption at our 
London ofﬁce. 
Our efforts to minimise our carbon footprint have been 
recognised externally and 3i was the recipient of a Bronze Award 
from the London Mayor’s 2015 Business Energy Challenge, which 
recognises businesses’ efforts to cut energy use from their 
London locations.
We report our GHG emissions and climate change data to the 
CDP . In addition to this, we are preparing to report in accordance 
with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Sustainability 
Reporting Framework, G4, at the Core level for the year ending 
31 March 2017 .
Community
We focus our charitable activities on the disadvantaged, on young 
people and on education. Charities are supported on the basis of 
their effectiveness and impact. We also support staff giving and 
sponsorship through matching donations. Our charitable giving 
for the year to 31 March 2016 totalled £324,009. For more 
information, see our Corporate responsibility report.
A responsible employer
Human rights
Whilst 3i does not have a formal human rights policy, our policies 
are consistent with internationally-proclaimed human rights 
principles. In particular, 3i is an equal opportunities employer and 
has clear grievance and disciplinary procedures, an employee 
assistance programme and an independent, external “whistle 
blowing” hotline service.
We are committed to ensuring that the businesses we invest in 
comply with all applicable laws in relation to their employees 
(amongst other things) and, where appropriate, that they work 
towards meeting relevant international standards (such as the 
ILO Fundamental Conventions) where those are more stringent. 
Summaries of relevant 3i policies, including our policies on 
people, recruitment and selection, equal opportunities and 
diversity, health and safety and responsible investment are 
available at www.3i.com. 3i will publish on its website a slavery 
and human trafﬁcking statement, as required by section 54 of the 
Modern Slavery Act 2015, on or before 30 September 2016.
At 31 March 2016, 3i had a total of 281 employees (calculated under 
the investment basis). The breakdown by gender is as follows:

Corporate responsibility Employee engagement
Honest communication with our staff is important to us. To this 
end, we encourage a culture of open communication between 
our employees and senior and executive management. We 
beneﬁt from being a small organisation, operating in a relatively 
ﬂat structure, with few hierarchies. The members of our Executive 
Committee have an open-door policy and know most employees 
by name. 
We promote and facilitate the ownership of 3i shares among 
employees through variable compensation or share investment 
plans. As a result, most of our employees are shareholders in the 
Company and feel invested in the success of the organisation.
We pride ourselves on the engagement and the sense of 
ownership we have fostered over the years, which has resulted in 
low unplanned turnover rates. 
Graduate training scheme
We launched our new graduate recruitment scheme in 2015, 
which is designed to develop our next generation of world-class 
investment professionals and business leaders. Our ﬁrst ﬁve 
graduate analysts joined us in 2015, and a further ﬁve will join us in 
September 2016. The programme consists of comprehensive and 
high-quality training, followed by rotations through each of our 
Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management businesses 
as well as our Strategy and Finance teams.
A responsible investor
As a company, we have a relatively small footprint on many 
corporate responsibility issues. However, with assets under 
management of £14 billion, we recognise that our decisions as an 
investor potentially matter to a broad range of people. 
We believe that:
 – the effective assessment of ESG matters has a positive effect  
on the value of our investee companies and of 3i Group itself;
 – compliance with local laws and regulations may not be enough 
to meet global expectations, deliver value and enhance our 
reputation and licence to operate; and
 – it is vital that we seek to identify all material ESG risks and 
opportunities through our due diligence and effectively 
manage them during the period of 3i’s investment.
UNPRI
Since 2011, we have been signatories to the UN Principles for 
Responsible Investment. We also have a clear and comprehensive 
Responsible Investment policy which is embedded into our 
investment and portfolio monitoring processes. In our experience, 
companies with high ESG standards are typically better run, 
create fewer business risks and ultimately deliver better value.
Our Responsible Investment policy
Our detailed Responsible Investment policy sets out the 
businesses and activities in which 3i will not invest, as well as 
minimum standards in relation to ESG matters which we expect 
potential new portfolio companies to meet, or to commit to 
meeting over a reasonable time period. 
We will use our inﬂuence as an investor to promote a commitment 
in our investee companies to:
 – comply, as a minimum, with applicable local and international 
laws and regulations and, where appropriate, relevant 
international standards (such as the IFC Performance Standards 
and the ILO Fundamental Conventions), where these are more 
stringent than applicable laws;
 – mitigate any adverse environmental and social impacts and 
enhance positive effects on the environment, workers and 
relevant stakeholders; and
 – uphold high standards of business integrity and good corporate 
governance. 
Our Responsible Investment policy has been integrated into our 
investment and portfolio management processes and procedures 
and is supported by detailed guidance notes, a global network 
of specialist external advisers and dedicated internal resource. 
A summary of our Responsible Investment policy is available on 
our website.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016
Strategic report
Corporate responsibility This section of the report describes how 3i is 
governed and managed. It gives details on our 
Board and Executive Committee members and 
explains how the Board is organised and operates. 
It also explains the roles and composition of Board 
Committees and the division of responsibilities 
between the Directors, including between the 
Chairman and Chief Executive. This section 
also includes the Directors’ remuneration report 
and reports from the Audit and Compliance 
Committee, the Valuations Committee and 
the Nominations Committee.
Good corporate governance is fundamental to 3i and its activities. 
Governance and oversight of the Group’s business model and 
strategy are critical to the delivery of value to the Group’s 
stakeholders. This is more important than ever given the volatile 
and uncertain economic and political environment and the 
changing regulatory landscape that our sector faces. 
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the overall 
management and oversight of the Group and for its long-term 
success. In particular, the Board is responsible for agreeing the 
Group’s strategy, monitoring ﬁnancial performance, setting and 
monitoring the Group’s risk appetite and maintaining an effective 
system of internal controls.
It is the Board’s responsibility to ensure that the Group has a clear 
strategy and that the necessary people, resources and structures 
are in place to support the delivery of this strategy.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 How the Board operates
The Chairman leads the Board and ensures its effectiveness. 
He organises its business and sets its agenda. In addition to the 
Chairman, there are currently ﬁve non-executive Directors with 
a range of strong and complementary skills. 
Attendance at Board and Committee meetings during the year is 
shown on page 68. Before each Board and Committee meeting, 
relevant reports and papers, including ﬁnancial performance data 
and detailed updates on the progress and implementation of 
the strategic plan where appropriate, are circulated to Directors. 
The Board is able to discuss these reports and updates and to 
challenge directly the Executive Directors and other senior 
management, who attend all or part of the Board meetings 
where relevant. 
The key responsibilities and areas of focus for the Board are: 
 – Strategy – contribute to the development of, and agree, the 
Group’s strategy. This includes through review and discussion 
of reports and updates at Board meetings as well as through 
the annual strategy conference which is attended by the Board 
and, where relevant, members of the Executive Committee.
 – Group ﬁnancial and operational performance – review and 
monitor the performance of the Group, including through 
regular reporting and discussions with the Executive 
Committee and other senior management. 
 – Senior management – ensure that the Executive Committee 
has the skills and resources to deliver the strategy and that 
appropriate succession and contingency planning is in place. 
 – Evaluation and composition – review the performance of the 
Board and its Committees to ensure that they are effective. 
Ensure that the Board and its Committees comprise competent 
and capable individuals with a range of skills and experience 
who bring independent views to the decisions being made. 
 – Internal controls – maintain an appropriate internal control 
framework.
 – Risk – ensure that there are effective risk management 
policies and processes in place and an appropriate 
governance structure. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it and its 
duly authorised Committees for decision. This is described on 
page 67 . Matters delegated by the Board to management include 
implementation of the Board approved strategy, day-to-day 
management and operation of the business, the appointment 
and remuneration of staff below the Executive Committee and 
the formulation and implementation of risk management policies 
and processes. 
Effectiveness 
During the year, the Board conducted its annual evaluation of 
its own performance and that of its Committees and individual 
Directors. On this occasion, the process was externally facilitated 
by Lintstock Limited. Lintstock Limited has no other connections 
with the Company. The evaluation consisted of a questionnaire, 
completed by all Board members plus the other six members  
of the Executive Committee, one-to-one interviews, and a 
subsequent report and action plan that was discussed and  
agreed at the Board. Overall, the evaluation concluded that  
the Board is performing well, but some areas for further 
improvement were identiﬁed and agreed. 
The evaluation included the following topics: consideration of 
Board composition, expertise and dynamics; time management 
and Board support; the performance of the Board’s Committees; 
the Board’s strategic and operational oversight; succession 
planning and human resources management; and priorities for 
change. During the review Directors identiﬁed areas for further 
broadening of the Board’s experience and expertise through 
recruitment as opportunities arise. Areas requiring increased 
focus, debate and, in some cases, reporting were identiﬁed and 
additional opportunities for Directors to interact with senior 
personnel beyond the Executive Committee were agreed. 
In his role as Senior Independent Director, Mr J P Asquith led a 
review by the Directors of the performance of the Chairman and 
subsequently reported back to the Board and provided feedback 
to the Chairman.

Corporate Governance
The role of the Board Investment policy
The current investment policy is set out below. 
The UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules require 3i, as a 
closed-ended investment fund, to publish an investment policy. 
Shareholder approval is required for material changes to this 
policy. Non-material changes can be made by the Board. Since 
publication of the Annual report and accounts 2015 the Board 
has made one non-material change to the ﬁrst paragraph of the 
investment policy by changing “across” to “in” in the phrase 
“across Europe, Asia and the Americas” . This change was made so 
as to better reﬂect the Group’s current areas of investment focus. 
Tax and investment company status
The Company is an investment company under section 833 of 
the Companies Act 2006. HM Revenue & Customs has approved 
the Company as an investment trust under section 1158 of the 
Corporation Tax Act 2010 and the Company directs its affairs 
to enable it to continue to remain so approved.
Regulation and management arrangements
3i Investments plc, 3i Debt Management Investments Limited, 
3i BIFM Investments Limited, 3i Europe plc and 3i Nordic plc 
(all of which are subsidiaries of the Company) are authorised and 
regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) under the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Where applicable, 
certain Group subsidiaries’ businesses outside the United 
Kingdom are regulated locally by relevant authorities, including 
two subsidiaries registered as investment advisers with the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission.
3i Investments plc acts as investment manager to the Company 
and certain of its subsidiaries. Contracts for these investment 
management and other services, for which regulatory 
authorisation is required, provide for fees based on the work done 
and costs incurred in providing such services. These contracts 
may be terminated by either party on reasonable notice.
3i Investments plc also acts as investment adviser to 3i 
Infrastructure plc. These services (and related fees) are set out 
in contracts containing detailed provisions. 
3i plc provides the Group with certain corporate and 
administrative services, for which no regulatory authorisation is 
required, under contracts which provide for fees based on the 
work done and costs incurred in providing such services together 
with a performance fee based on realised proﬁts on the sale 
of assets. 
3i Investments plc is authorised by the FCA to, among other 
things, manage Alternative Investment Funds (“AIFs”). It is 
currently the Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”) 
of ﬁve AIFs, namely, 3i Group plc, 3i Growth Capital Fund, 3i 
Eurofund V, the 3i European Middle Market Loan Fund and the 
3i Global Income Fund. In compliance with regulatory requirements, 
3i Investments plc has ensured that a depository has been 
appointed for each AIF. This is Citibank Europe plc, UK Branch  
for all AIFs with the exception of the 3i Global Income Fund  
which has appointed Citi Depositary Services Ireland Limited.  
Investment policy
 – 3i is an investment company which aims to provide its 
shareholders with quoted access to private equity, 
infrastructure and debt management investment returns. 
Currently, its main focus is on making quoted and unquoted 
equity and/or debt investments in businesses and funds  
in Europe, Asia and the Americas. The geographies, 
economic sectors, funds and asset classes in which 3i  
invests continue to evolve as opportunities are identiﬁed. 
Proposed investments are assessed individually and all 
signiﬁcant investments require approval from the Group’s 
Investment Committee. Overall investment targets are 
subject to periodic reviews and the investment portfolio is 
also reviewed to monitor exposure to speciﬁc geographies, 
economic sectors and asset classes.
 – 3i seeks to diversify risk through signiﬁcant dispersion of 
investments by geography, economic sector, asset class 
and size as well as through the maturity proﬁle of its 
investment portfolio.
 – Although 3i does not set maximum exposure limits for asset 
allocations, it does have a maximum exposure limit that, save 
as mentioned below, no investment will be made unless its 
cost does not exceed 15% of the investment portfolio value 
as shown in the last published valuation. A further investment 
may be made in an existing investee company provided the 
aggregate cost of that investment and of all other 
investments in that investee company does not exceed 15% 
of the investment portfolio value as shown in the last 
published valuation. A higher limit of 30% will apply to the 
Company’s investment in 3i Infrastructure plc. For the 
avoidance of doubt, 3i may retain an investment even if its 
carrying value is greater than 15% or 30% (as the case may 
be) of the portfolio value at the time of an updated valuation. 
 – Investments are generally funded with a mixture of debt and 
shareholders’ funds with a view to maximising returns to 
shareholders, whilst maintaining a strong capital base. 3i’s 
gearing depends not only on its level of debt, but also on  
the impact of market movements and other factors on the 
value of its investments. The Board takes this into account 
when, as required, it sets a precise maximum level of gearing. 
The Board has therefore set the maximum level of gearing at 
150% and has set no minimum level of gearing. If the gearing 
ratio should exceed the 150% maximum limit, the Board will 
take steps to reduce the gearing ratio to below that limit as 
soon as practicable thereafter. 3i is committed to achieving 
balance sheet efﬁciency.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016
Statutory and corporate  
governance information The Annual report and accounts meet the investor disclosure 
requirements as set out in FUND 3.2.2R, 3.2.3R, 3.2.5R and 3.2.6R 
of the FCA’s Investment Funds sourcebook for 3i Group plc as a 
standalone entity. The Company’s proﬁt for the year is stated in 
its Statement of changes in equity and its Financial position is 
shown on page 97 . The Company performs substantially all of 
its investment related activities through its subsidiaries and 
therefore the Group’s Consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income is considered to be more useful to investors than a 
Company statement.
Furthermore, in some instances the relevant FUND disclosures 
have been made in relation to the Group on a consolidated basis 
rather than in respect of 3i Group plc as a standalone entity. This 
is because 3i Group plc, as a standalone entity, operates through 
its group subsidiaries and therefore reporting on the Group’s 
activities provides more relevant information on the Company 
and its position. There have been no material changes to the 
Company’s operations in the past year. 
Although the disclosures required by FUND 3.2.2R, 3.2.3R, 3.2.5R 
and 3.2.6R of the FCA’s Investment Funds sourcebook are covered 
in this Annual report they are also, for convenience, summarised 
on the 3i website at www.3i.com. This will be updated as required 
and changes noted in future Annual reports.
The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive requires 
3i to comply with certain reporting obligations. A summary of 
the remuneration policy of 3i can be found on the 
Company’s website.
The total amount of remuneration paid by 3i to its staff for the 
year was £83 million, of which £41 million was ﬁxed remuneration 
and £42 million was variable remuneration. The aggregate total 
remuneration paid to AIFM Identiﬁed Staff for the year was 
£17 million, of which £14 million was paid to Senior Management 
and £3 million was paid to other AIFM Identiﬁed Staff.
Results and dividends
Total comprehensive income for the year was £824 million 
(2015: £659 million). An interim dividend of 6.0 pence (comprising 
a base dividend of 2.7 pence and an additional dividend of 3.3 
pence) per ordinary share in respect of the year to 31 March 2016 
was paid on 7 January 2016. The Directors recommend a ﬁnal 
dividend of 16 pence (comprising a base dividend of 5.4 pence 
and an additional dividend of 10.6 pence) per ordinary share be 
paid in respect of the year to 31 March 2016 to shareholders on 
the Register at the close of business on 17 June 2016.
The trustee of The 3i Group Employee Trust (“the Employee 
Trust”) has waived (subject to certain minor exceptions) dividends 
declared on shares in the Company held by the Employee Trust 
and the Trustee of The 3i Group Share Incentive Plan has waived 
dividends on unallocated shares in the Company held by it.
Share capital and debentures
The issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 1 April 
2015 was 972,453,819 ordinary shares and at 31 March 2016 was 
972,661,444 ordinary shares of 73
19/22 
pence each. It increased over 
the year by 207 ,625 ordinary shares on the issue of shares to the 
trustee of The 3i Group Share Incentive Plan and on the issue 
of shares under The 3i Group Discretionary Share Plan. 
At the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) on 25 June 2015, the 
Directors were authorised to repurchase up to 97 ,000,000 ordinary 
shares in the Company (representing approximately 10% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 11 May 2015) until 
the Company’s AGM in 2016 or 24 September 2016, if earlier. 
This authority was not exercised in the year. 
As detailed in Note 16 to the Accounts, as at 31 March 2016 
the Company had in issue Notes issued under the 3i Group plc 
£2,000 million Note Issuance Programme. 
Directors’ conﬂicts of interests and Directors’ 
indemnities 
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid conﬂicts of interest with 
the Company. The Company’s Articles of Association enable 
Directors to approve conﬂicts of interest and include other conﬂict 
of interest provisions. The Company has implemented processes 
to identify potential and actual conﬂicts of interest. Such conﬂicts 
are then considered for approval by the Board, subject, if 
necessary, to appropriate conditions. 
As permitted by the Company’s Articles of Association during 
the year and as at the date of this Directors’ report, there were 
in place Qualifying Third-Party Indemnity Provisions 
(as deﬁned under relevant legislation) for the beneﬁt of the 
Company’s Directors and for the beneﬁt of Directors 
of one associated company. 
Employment 
The employment policy of the Group is one of equal opportunity 
in the selection, training, career development and promotion of 
employees, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic 
origin, religion and whether disabled or otherwise.
3i treats applicants and employees with disabilities fairly and 
provides facilities, equipment and training to assist disabled 
employees to do their jobs. Arrangements are made as necessary 
to ensure support to job applicants who happen to be disabled 
and who respond to requests to inform the Company of any 
requirements. Should an employee become disabled during their 
employment, efforts would be made to retain them in their 
current employment or to explore the opportunities for their 
retraining or redeployment within 3i. Financial support is also 
provided by 3i to support disabled employees who are unable 
to work, as appropriate to local market conditions.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016
Corporate Governance
Statutory and corporate governance information 3i’s principal means of keeping in touch with the views of its 
employees is through employee appraisals, informal 
consultations, team brieﬁngs and staff conferences. Managers 
throughout 3i have a continuing responsibility to keep their staff 
informed of developments and to communicate ﬁnancial results 
and other matters of interest. This is achieved by structured 
communication including regular meetings of employees. 
3i is an equal opportunities employer and has clear grievance 
and disciplinary procedures in place. 3i also has an employee 
assistance programme which provides a conﬁdential, free and 
independent counselling service and is available to all UK staff 
and their families in the UK. 
3i’s employment policies are designed to provide a competitive 
reward package which will attract and retain high quality staff, 
whilst ensuring that the relevant costs remain at an 
appropriate level. 
3i’s remuneration policy is inﬂuenced by 3i’s ﬁnancial and other 
performance conditions and market practices in the countries 
in which it operates. All employees receive a base salary and are 
also eligible to be considered for a performance-related annual 
variable incentive award. For those members of staff receiving 
higher levels of annual variable incentive awards, a proportion 
of such awards is delivered in 3i shares, vesting over a number 
of years. Remuneration policy is reviewed by the 3i Group plc 
Remuneration Committee, comprising 3i Group plc non-
executive Directors.
Where appropriate, employees are eligible to participate in 3i 
share schemes to encourage employees’ involvement in 3i’s 
performance. Investment executives in the Private Equity business 
line may also participate in carried interest schemes, which allow 
executives to share directly in future proﬁts on investments. 
Similarly, investment executives in the Infrastructure and Debt 
Management business lines may participate in asset-linked and/
or fee-linked incentive arrangements. Employees participate 
in local state or company pension schemes as appropriate to 
local market conditions. 
Political donations 
In line with Group policy, during the year to 31 March 2016 no 
donations were made to political parties or organisations, or 
independent election candidates, and no political expenditure 
was incurred.
Signiﬁcant agreements 
As at 31 March 2016, the Company was party to one agreement 
subject to a renegotiation period on a change of control of 
the Company following a takeover bid. This agreement is a 
£350 million multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility Agreement 
dated 5 September 2014, between the Company, Barclays Bank 
PLC and 11 other banks. The Company is required to notify 
Barclays Bank PLC, as agent bank, within ﬁve days, of a change 
of control. This opens a 20-day negotiation period to determine 
if the Majority Lenders (as deﬁned in the agreement) are willing 
to continue the facility. Failing agreement, amounts outstanding 
would be repayable and the facility cancelled.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and 
accounts in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and 
those International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) which 
have been adopted by the European Union. 
Under Company Law the Directors must not approve the Group 
ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that they present 
fairly the ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows 
of the Group for that period. The Directors consider that this 
Annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy. In preparing the Group ﬁnancial statements 
the Directors: 
(a) select suitable accounting policies in accordance with 
International Accounting Standard 8: Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then apply 
them consistently; 
(b) present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
(c) provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs as adopted by the EU is insufﬁcient 
to enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s ﬁnancial 
position and ﬁnancial performance; 
(d) state that the Group has complied with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the ﬁnancial statements; and 
(e) make judgements and estimates that are reasonable.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 The Directors have a responsibility for ensuring that proper 
accounting records are kept which are sufﬁcient to show and 
explain the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the Group ﬁnancial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
In accordance with the FCA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules, 
the Directors conﬁrm to the best of their knowledge that: 
(a) the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with 
applicable accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and 
(b) the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face. 
The Directors of the Company and their functions are listed in the 
Board of Directors and Executive Committee section. 
Going concern
The Directors have acknowledged their responsibilities in relation 
to the ﬁnancial statements for the year to 31 March 2016.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the Business review section. The ﬁnancial position of the 
Group, its capital structure, gearing and liquidity positions are 
described in the Financial review section. The Group’s policies 
on risk management and the Directors’ viability statement are 
contained in the Risk management section. Further details are 
contained in the Financial statements and Notes including, in 
particular, details on ﬁnancial risk management.
The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage  
its business risks successfully. The Directors have considered the 
uncertainties inherent in current and expected future market 
conditions, their possible impact upon the ﬁnancial performance 
of the Group and a report from the Group Finance Director  
on the outlook for liquidity. After consideration, the Directors  
are satisﬁed that the Company has and will maintain sufﬁcient 
ﬁnancial resources to enable it to continue operating in the 
foreseeable future, which is at least 12 months from the date of 
the accounts, and therefore continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual report and accounts.
Audit information
Pursuant to section 418(2) of the Companies Act 2006, each of the 
Directors conﬁrms that:
(a) so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s Auditor is unaware; and
(b) they have taken all steps they ought to have taken to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s Auditor is aware of such information.
Appointment of auditor
In accordance with section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, 
a resolution proposing the reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP 
as the Company’s Auditor will be put to members at the 
forthcoming AGM.

the ﬁeld of corporate governance. The Board has adopted core 
values and global policies which set out the behaviour expected 
of staff in their dealings with shareholders, customers, colleagues, 
suppliers and others who engage with the Company.
Throughout the year, the Company complied with the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) published 
by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2014 which is

The Board’s responsibilities and processes
The Board’s key responsibilities are described on page 60. It is 
responsible for the overall management of the Group and may 
exercise all the powers of the Company subject to the provisions 
of relevant statutes, the Company’s Articles of Association and 
any directions given by special resolution of the shareholders. 
The Articles of Association empower the Board to offer, allot,

own shares if the purchase has ﬁrst been authorised by a resolution

At the AGM in June 2015, shareholders renewed the Board’s 
authority to allot ordinary shares and to repurchase ordinary 
shares on behalf of the Company subject to certain limits. Details 
of the authorities which the Board will be seeking at the 2016 
AGM are set out in the 2016 Notice of AGM.
The Articles of Association also speciﬁcally empower the Board 
to exercise the Company’s powers to borrow money and to 
mortgage or charge the Company’s assets and any uncalled 
capital and to issue debentures and other securities.

it and its duly authorised Committees for decision. These include:

operation of the business, the appointment and remuneration of 
executives below the Executive Committee and the formulation 
and execution of risk management policies and procedures. 
A succession and contingency plan for executive leadership is 
prepared by management and reviewed periodically by the 
Board. The purpose of this plan is to identify suitable candidates 
for succession to key senior management positions, agree their 
training and development needs, and ensure the necessary 
human resources are in place for the Company to meet 
its objectives.

Appointment and re-election of Directors
Subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, the Companies 
Acts and satisfactory performance evaluation, non-executive 
Directors are appointed for an initial three-year term. Before the 
third and sixth anniversaries of ﬁrst appointment, the Director 
discusses with the Board whether it is appropriate for a further 
three-year term to be served.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, the minimum 
number of Directors is two and the maximum is 20, unless 
otherwise determined by the Company by ordinary resolution. 
Directors are appointed by ordinary resolution of shareholders or 
by the Board. The Company’s Articles of Association provide for 
Directors to retire by rotation at an AGM if they were appointed 
by the Board since the preceding AGM, they held ofﬁce during 
the two preceding AGMs but did not retire at either of them, they 
held non-executive ofﬁce for a continuous period of nine years or 
more at the date of that AGM, or they choose to retire from ofﬁce. 
Shareholders can remove any Director by special resolution 
and appoint another person to be a director in their place by 
ordinary resolution.
Subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, retiring 
Directors are eligible for reappointment. The ofﬁce of Director is 
vacated if the Director resigns, becomes bankrupt or is prohibited 
by law from being a Director or where the Board so resolves 
following the Director suffering from ill-health or being absent 
from Board meetings for 12 months without the Board’s 
permission.
In accordance with the Code, all Directors are subject to 
reappointment every year. Accordingly, at the AGM to be held 
on 30 June 2016, all the Directors will retire from ofﬁce. All the 
Directors are eligible for and seek reappointment. The Board’s 
recommendation for the reappointment of Directors is set out 
in the 2016 Notice of AGM.
The roles of the Chairman, Chief Executive 
and Senior Independent Director
The Board approved division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive is described on 
page 60. Mr J P Asquith served as Senior Independent Director 
throughout the year.
68
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016
Corporate Governance
Corporate governance statement Directors
Directors’ biographical details are set out on page 58. The Board 
currently comprises the Chairman, ﬁve non-executive Directors 
and two Executive Directors. Mr J P Asquith, Ms C J Banszky, 
Mr S A Borrows, Mr D A M Hutchison, Ms M G Verluyten and 
Mrs J S Wilson served as Directors throughout the year under 
review. Sir Adrian Montague served as a Director until 25 June 
2015 and Mr A R Cox served as a Director until 10 November 2015. 
Mr S R Thompson was appointed as a non-executive Director  
on 13 April 2015 (and became Chairman on 25 June 2015) and  
Mr P Grosch was appointed as a non-executive Director on 
1 November 2015. 
In addition to fulﬁlling their legal responsibilities as Directors, 
non-executive Directors are expected to bring an independent 
judgement to bear on issues of strategy, performance, resources 
and standards of conduct, and to help the Board provide the 
Company with effective leadership. Further details of their role 
are set out on page 60. Non-executive Directors are expected to 
make available sufﬁcient time to meet the requirements of the 
appointment. The average time commitment is expected to be 
around 15 days a year together with additional time for serving 
on the Board’s committees.
The Board’s discussions, and its approval of the Group’s strategic 
plan and annual budget, provide the non-executive Directors with 
the opportunity to contribute to and validate management’s plans 
and assist in the development of strategy. The non-executive 
Directors receive regular management accounts, reports and 
information which enable them to scrutinise the Company’s 
and management’s performance against agreed objectives.
Directors’ independence 
All the non-executive Directors (other than the Chairman (who was 
independent on appointment) and Mr P Grosch) were considered 
by the Board to be independent for the purposes of the Code in 
the year to 31 March 2016. Mr P Grosch is not considered 
independent because of his links with the Group’s Private Equity 
business including his position as chairman of Euro-Diesel, a 3i 
investee company.
The Board reviews non-executive Director independence at  
least annually, having regard to the potential relevance and 
materiality of a Director’s interests and relationships. Other than 
for Mr P Grosch, no Director was materially interested in any 
contract or arrangement subsisting during or at the end of the 
ﬁnancial period that was signiﬁcant in relation to the business of 
the Company. Mr Grosch receives director’s fees from and is a 
shareholder in Euro-Diesel, a company in which the Group  
is invested.
Directors’ employment contracts 
Mr S A Borrows and Mrs J S Wilson each have employment 
contracts with the Group with notice periods of 12 months where 
notice is given by the Group and six months where notice is given 
by the Director. Save for these notice periods their employment 
contracts have no unexpired terms. None of the other Directors 
has a service contract with the Company.
Training and development 
The Company has a training policy which provides a framework 
within which training for Directors is planned with the objective of 
ensuring Directors understand the duties and responsibilities of 
being a director of a listed company. All Directors are required to 
keep their skills up to date and maintain their familiarity with the 
Company and its business continually. Presentations on different 
aspects of the Company’s business are made regularly to the 
Board. On appointment, all non-executive Directors have 
discussions with the Chairman and the Chief Executive following 
which appropriate brieﬁngs on the responsibilities of Directors, 
the Company’s business and the Company’s procedures are 
arranged. The Company provides opportunities for non-executive 
Directors to obtain a thorough understanding of the Company’s 
business by meeting members of the senior management 
team who in turn arrange, as required, visits to investment 
or support teams. 
The Company has procedures for Directors to take independent 
legal or other professional advice in relation to the performance 
of their duties. 
The Board’s committees 
As described on page 60, the Board is assisted by various 
principal committees of the Board which report regularly to it. 
The membership and activities of the Audit and Compliance 
Committee, the Remuneration Committee, the Valuations 
Committee and the Nominations Committee are described 
in their separate reports on pages 74 to 92.
The Board discontinued its Brand and Values Committee. The 
work previously done by that Committee (including review of 
3i’s values, responsible investing policy and other reputational 
matters) was considered sufﬁciently core to the Group that it 
was more appropriate for it to be dealt with by the full Board.
The Company Secretary 
Directors have access to the advice and services of the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary, who advises the Board, through 
the Chairman, on governance matters. The Company’s Articles of 
Association and the schedule of matters reserved to the Board or 
its duly authorised committees for decision provide that the 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter 
for the full Board.

Relations with shareholders and potential investors
Approach to Investor Relations
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining a purposeful 
relationship with shareholders. The Group has a comprehensive 
Investor Relations programme to help existing and potential 
investors to understand its activities, strategy and ﬁnancial 
performance. The Chief Executive and the Group Finance 
Director meet with the Company’s principal shareholders to 
discuss relevant issues as they arise. The Chairman maintains a 
dialogue with shareholders on strategy, corporate governance 
and Directors’ remuneration as required. The Board receives 
reports from the Company’s brokers on shareholder issues and 
non-executive Directors are invited to attend the Company’s 
presentations to analysts and are offered the opportunity to 
meet shareholders.
Board oversight
The Executive Directors brief the Board on a regular basis on the 
implementation of the Investor Relations programme and on 
feedback received from analysts and investors. Any signiﬁcant 
concern raised by shareholders in relation to the Group is also 
communicated to the Board. In addition, research reports 
published by investment banks on 3i are circulated to the Board 
on a regular basis. 
The Board also receives periodic feedback from existing 
shareholders and potential investors through 3i’s corporate 
brokers, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays. 
Institutional investor programme
Meetings with principal shareholders
The Executive Directors meet with the Group’s principal 
shareholders on a twice yearly basis, following the publication of 
annual and half-yearly results and as required during the year. The 
Chairman and Senior Independent Director are also available to 
meet with shareholders as required. The Investor Relations team 
also manages a programme of engagement with smaller 
shareholders, implemented through regular presentations 
and meetings. 
Meetings with potential investors
During the year, the Executive Directors and the Investor Relations 
team held regular meetings with potential investors internationally 
to communicate the strategy and performance of 3i. 
Annual and half-yearly results presentations
The Executive Directors present the annual and half-yearly results 
to a broad group of institutional investors and analysts. These 
presentations are webcast live on 3i’s website, and the on-demand 
webcast remains available on the website for a period of 
12 months. 
Capital markets day
The 2015 capital markets day, held in June, consisted of a 
presentation to signiﬁcant shareholders and analysts by senior 
3i executives and the management teams of Scandlines and 
Basic-Fit, two of the investments in our Private Equity portfolio. 
This event was held in London. The presentations were focused 
on the Scandlines and Basic-Fit business model and strategy and 
on their recent ﬁnancial performance. The presentation materials 
used on the day were made available on 3i’s website to enable 
those investors and analysts that could not attend to access the 
information provided at the meeting. 
Industry conferences
Throughout the year, the Executive Directors also participated in 
a number of industry conferences organised by investment banks 
for their institutional investor base. These included conferences 
organised by Morgan Stanley, Société Générale, KBW, Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Cazenove and Citi. 
Individual investors
Individual investors are encouraged to engage with the Group 
and provide feedback through the Investor Relations team and 
the Company Secretary, whose contact details are available on 
the website.

news and historical ﬁnancial information on the Group and details 
of forthcoming events for shareholders and analysts. Annual and 
half-year results presentations are also webcast live and on-
demand on 3i’s website. 
Annual General Meeting
The Company also uses its AGM as an opportunity to 
communicate with its shareholders. At the Meeting, business 
presentations are generally made by the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive. The Chairmen of the Remuneration, Audit and 
Compliance, and Nominations Committees are generally 
available to answer shareholders’ questions. Business to be 
discussed at the meeting is notiﬁed to shareholders in advance 
through the Notice of Meeting and covers matters such as the 
annual election of Directors, the appointment of the Auditors and 
the dividend declaration. During the meeting, shareholders are 
also asked to approve the ﬁnancial statement and report of the 
Directors and Auditors. In addition, shareholders are asked to 
approve the Directors’ remuneration report. 
The 2015 Notice of AGM was dispatched to shareholders not less 
than 20 working days before the Meeting. At that Meeting, voting 
on each resolution was taken on a poll and the poll results were 
made available on the Company’s website.
Rights and restrictions attaching to shares
A summary of the rights and restrictions attaching to shares as at 
31 March 2016 is set out below.
The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by 
special resolution of the shareholders in a general meeting. 
Holders of ordinary shares enjoy the rights set out in the Articles 
of Association of the Company and under the laws of England and 
Wales. Any share may be issued with or have attached to it such 
rights and restrictions as the Company by ordinary resolution or, 
failing such resolution, the Board may decide.
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend, speak and vote 
at general meetings and to appoint proxies and, in the case of 
corporations, corporate representatives to attend, speak and vote 
at such meetings on their behalf. To attend and vote at a general 
meeting a shareholder must be entered on the register of 
members at such time (not being earlier than 48 hours before the 
meeting) as stated in the Notice of general meeting. On a poll, 
holders of ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each 
share held. 
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s 
Annual report and accounts, to receive such dividends and other 
distributions as may lawfully be paid or declared on such shares 
and, on any liquidation of the Company, to share in the surplus 
assets of the Company after satisfaction of the entitlements of the 
holders of any shares with preferred rights as may then be in issue.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of fully paid shares in the 
Company, save as follows. The Board may decline to register: a 
transfer of uncertiﬁcated shares in the circumstances set out in the 
Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001; a transfer to more than 
four joint holders; a transfer of certiﬁcated shares which is not 
in respect of only one class of share; a transfer which is not 
accompanied by the certiﬁcate for the shares to which it relates; 
a transfer which is not duly stamped in circumstances where a duly 
stamped instrument is required; or a transfer where in accordance 
with section 794 of the Companies Act 2006 a notice (under 
section 793 of that Act) has been served by the Company on a 
shareholder who has then failed to give the information required 
within the speciﬁed time. In the latter circumstances the Company 
may make the relevant shares subject to certain restrictions 
(including in respect of the ability to exercise voting rights, to 
transfer the shares validly and, except in the case of a liquidation, 
to receive the payment of sums due from the Company). 
There are no shares carrying special rights with regard to control 
of the Company. There are no restrictions placed on voting rights 
of fully paid shares, save where in accordance with Article 12 of the 
Company’s Articles of Association a restriction notice has been 
served by the Company in respect of shares for failure to comply 
with statutory notices or where a transfer notice (as described 
below) has been served in respect of shares and has not yet been 
complied with. Where shares are held on behalf of former or 
current employees under employee share schemes, those 
participants can give instructions to the holder of such shares 
as to how votes attached to such shares should be exercised.
In the circumstances speciﬁed in Article 38 of the Company’s 
Articles of Association the Company may serve a transfer notice 
on holders of shares. The relevant circumstances relate to: (a) 
potential tax disadvantage to the Company, (b) the number of 
“United States Residents” who own or hold shares becoming 75 
or more, or (c) the Company being required to be registered as an 
investment company under relevant US legislation. The notice 
would require the transfer of relevant shares and pending such 
transfer the rights and privileges attaching to those shares would

policy is to exercise voting rights on all matters affecting 
its interests.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 Risk management and internal control 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for risk management and 
internal control, including for the determination of the nature 
and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take to achieve its 
strategic objectives and for ensuring that an appropriate 
culture has been embedded throughout the organisation. Risk 
management and internal control systems cannot eliminate all 
risks but it is the role of the Board to ensure such systems are 
robust and effective and take account of such risks. In addition 
such systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide 
only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
Through the regular meetings of the Board and the schedule of 
matters reserved to the Board or its duly authorised committees 
for decision, the Board aims to maintain full and effective control 
over appropriate strategic, ﬁnancial, operational and 
compliance issues. 
The Board has put in place an organisational structure with clearly 
deﬁned lines of responsibility and delegation of authority. The 
Board considers and approves a strategic plan and budget on 
an annual basis and receives regular updates. In addition, there 
are established procedures and processes for planning and 
controlling expenditure and the making of investments. There 
are also information and reporting systems for monitoring the 
Group’s businesses and their performance. 
The Group Risk Committee is a management committee formed 
by the Chief Executive and its purpose is to identify and assess 
the principal risks faced by the business, in the context of the 
Group’s risk appetite, and oversee the mitigation or management 
of those risks. This process was in place for the year to 31 March 
2016 and up to the date of this report. Details of the risk 
management framework can be found in the Risk section. 
The overall risk management and internal control process is 
regularly reviewed by the Board and the Audit and Compliance 
Committee and complies with the Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting issued by the Financial Reporting Council. The Audit 
and Compliance Committee performed its annual review of the 
system’s effectiveness and reported its conclusions to the Board. 
The process has been in place for the year under review and up to 
the date of approval of this Annual report and accounts 2016. 
The internal control process established for the Group includes: 
Policies 
 – Core values and global policies together comprising the 
Group’s high-level principles and controls, with which all staff 
are expected to comply; 
 – Detailed policies and procedures, with processes for reporting 
weaknesses and for monitoring corrective action; and 
 – A Compliance manual, with procedures for reporting 
compliance therewith. 
Processes and procedures
 – Appointment of experienced and professional staff, both by 
recruitment and promotion, of the necessary calibre to fulﬁl 
their allotted responsibilities; 
 – A planning framework which incorporates a Board approved 
strategic plan, with objectives for each business unit; 
 – Formal business risk reviews performed by management which 
evaluate the potential ﬁnancial impact and likelihood of 
identiﬁed risks and possible new risk areas; 
 – The setting of control, mitigation and monitoring procedures 
and the review of actual occurrences, identifying lessons to 
be learnt; 
 – A comprehensive system of ﬁnancial reporting to the Board, 
based on an annual budget with monthly reporting of actual 
results, analysis of variances, scrutiny of key performance 
indicators and regular re-forecasting; 
 – Regular reports to the Board, which analyse funding 
requirements, track the generation and use of capital and the 
volume of liquidity, measure the Group’s exposure to exchange 
rate movements and record the level of compliance with the 
Group’s funding objectives; 
 – A reward process designed to align behaviours with the Group’s 
risk appetite;
 – A Group Compliance function whose role is to integrate 
regulatory compliance procedures and best practices into 
the Group’s systems; 
 – Well deﬁned procedures governing the appraisal and approval 
of investments, including detailed investment and divestment 
approval procedures, incorporating appropriate levels of 
authority and regular post-investment reviews; and
 – Regular risk reviews, including an assessment of risks to reliable 
ﬁnancial reporting covering people, processes and systems, 
and updates on the management of identiﬁed risks or actual 
incidents.

During the year, the Nominations Committee held three 
meetings. Attendance of members at those meetings is shown 
on the table on page 68. 
The Committee completed the process commenced in the previous 
year of identifying and recommending to the Board a candidate 
to succeed Sir Adrian Montague as chairman of the Board. This 
process was led by Mr Asquith as Senior Independent Director.
The Committee also considered a number of candidates for 
appointment as non-executive Director and recommended to 
the Board the appointment of Mr Grosch who was subsequently 
appointed as a Director on 1 November 2015. 
In its work the Committee keeps in mind the balance and 
composition of the Board, including succession planning, and the 
needs of the Company in terms of the desirable experience and 
qualiﬁcations of future appointees as non-executive Directors. 
The Company has a formal, rigorous and transparent process for 
the appointment of Directors with the objective of identifying the 
skills and experience proﬁle required of new Directors and 
identifying suitable candidates. The procedure includes the 
appraisal and selection of potential candidates by the Committee, 
including (in the case of non-executive Directors) whether they 
have sufﬁcient time to fulﬁl their roles. Specialist recruitment 
consultants assist the Committee to identify suitable candidates 
for appointment. The Committee’s recommendations for 
appointment are put to the full Board for approval. 
Further to the publication of the Davies Report on Women on 
Boards, and Code Provision B.2.4, the Board strongly supports 
the principle of boardroom diversity, of which gender is one 
important aspect. The Board’s aim is to have a diverse Board 
in terms of gender, industry experience, skills and educational 
background, and nationality. The Board makes appointments on 
merit and against objective criteria. External search consultancies 
engaged by the Company are instructed to put forward for all 
Board positions a diversity of candidates including women 
candidates. External search consultancies engaged by the 
Committee during the year were Egon Zehnder and The Zygos 
Partnership. Egon Zehnder also provided other recruitment 
services to the Group during the year. The Zygos Partnership 
had no other connections with the Company during the year.
“ The Nominations Committee has a vital 
role to play in ensuring the Board has 
the right balance of skills and experience 
to lead the Company.”

Director’s experience can be found in the Directors’ biographies 
on page 58. 
Throughout the year, the Committee received regular reports on 
a number of matters including the valuation of the investment 
portfolio, internal audit ﬁndings and follow-up work, accounting 
issues and judgements, and legal and regulatory matters. In 
particular, the Committee focused on the developments with 
regard to regulation for audit tendering and the deﬁnition of 
non-audit services, cyber security and the requirement for a 
viability statement. The Committee received presentations from 
a number of members of senior management including the Group 
Finance Director, Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, Group Financial Controller, the Head of Internal Audit, 
the Head of Compliance and the external Auditor Ernst & Young 
LLP . Other attendees were invited from time to time depending 
on the nature of agenda items.
The Chairman of the Committee also met a number of these 
individuals separately in advance of the Committee meetings 
providing an additional forum to discuss relevant issues. During 
the year, the Committee held private discussions with the Group 
Finance Director, the Head of Internal Audit, and the Head of 
Group Compliance, and with the external Auditor in the absence 
of management.
“ The Audit and Compliance Committee’s

environment as well as the integrity 
of its ﬁnancial reporting.”

Committee report  What the Committee reviewed in 2016 
The Committee met six times during the year and the members’ attendance at meetings is shown in the table on page 68.  
During the year the Committee’s activities included considering the following: 
 – Annual and half-yearly reports
 – Quarterly performance updates
 – Key accounting judgements and estimates
 – Developments in ﬁnancial reporting
 – Fair, balanced and understandable
 – Valuation reports and recommending the investment asset 
valuations to the Board
 – Conﬁrmation of the external Auditor’s independence
 – Policy and approval of non-audit fees
 – The FY2016 Audit plan, including the Auditor’s signiﬁcant audit 
risks, (being the valuation of the unquoted investment portfolio and 
the calculation of carried interest) as well as the area of audit focus 
(revenue recognition)
 – Auditor performance and effectiveness
 – Regulatory position with regard to audit tender
Financial reporting External audit
Internal control and risk management Risk reviews
 – Review of 3i’s system of internal control and risk management
 – External and Internal audit reports
 – Review of Corporate Governance changes including the risk 
appetite statement and viability statement
 – Internal audit effectiveness review
 – Cyber security
 – Regular reviews of compliance with regulatory rules
 – Annual report on taxation
 –Litigation
 – Liquidity and going concern
In addition to areas of signiﬁcant accounting judgement and 
monitoring the effectiveness of 3i’s risk management, the 
Committee particularly focused on the matters described below.
As one of the changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code  
for the 2016 reporting year onwards, the Directors are required  
to make a statement in the Annual Report as to the longer-term 
viability of 3i as well as enhanced risk disclosures. The Committee 
received regular updates throughout the year on the work being 
undertaken to support the viability statement and risk disclosures, 
including forecasts for capital and liquidity, the stress tests of  
3i’s ﬁve-year strategic plan and an assessment of the key risks for 
3i’s viability. A report was prepared for the Board in January 2016 
which detailed the process undertaken across the business to 
develop suitable scenarios against which to test 3i’s ﬁnancial 
performance as well as the results of these stress tests. This report 
was then updated and presented to the Committee in May 2016. 
The Committee agreed to recommend the viability statement and 
risk disclosures to the Board for approval. 
The Committee received two presentations in the year from the 
IT Director on cyber security risk management. Management 
engaged external advisers in late 2015 to assess the threat to 
cyber security, including the potential impact of cyber attacks,  
on both 3i’s information and infrastructure and its portfolio 
companies. The Committee assessed the results of this review, 
including the proposed actions to strengthen risk management 
further, and were satisﬁed that 3i’s capability was proportionate  
to its size and business activity. The Committee will receive an 
update on cyber security and the implementation of 
recommended actions in FY2017 . 
Given the signiﬁcant changes to the taxation environment 
announced as part of the OECD’s Base Erosion Proﬁt Shifting 
(“BEPS”) project in October 2015, the Committee received an 
update on the impact of BEPS on the Group in addition to the 
annual update it receives from the Tax Director on the Group’s 
taxation status more generally. As an authorised Investment 
Trust the Company does not pay tax on capital proﬁts in the 
United Kingdom. However the changes coming into force 
over the next few years are expected to increase the resources 
needed to comply with the various reporting requirements. 
The Committee also considered the appropriateness of the 
Group’s tax disclosures in the Annual Report and on its website. 
The improved investment performance and good ﬂow of 
realisations led the Committee to review both carried interest 
receivable and payable balances. Internal Audit also carried  
out a review of carry payable and receivable in the year.  
Following discussions with management and the external  
Auditor, the Committee was satisﬁed that carried interest 
was being appropriately accounted for. 
In the year, management performed a detailed review of the  
IFRS 10 accounting for subsidiaries in the parent company’s 
balance sheet. The Committee considered and reviewed the 
accounting adjustments as well as the external Auditor’s ﬁndings 
and reporting in this area. These adjustments had no impact on 
the Group’s reported result.

Corporate Governance
Audit and Compliance Committee report  Areas of accounting judgement and control focus
The Committee pays particular attention to matters it considers to be important by virtue of their size, complexity, level of judgement 
or potential impact on the ﬁnancial statements and wider business model. 
Signiﬁcant areas of accounting and control focus considered by the Committee are detailed in the table below, alongside the actions taken 
by the Committee (with appropriate input, guidance and challenge from the external Auditor) to address these issues/judgements. 
Areas of signiﬁcant accounting judgement What the Committee reviewed and concluded
Valuation of the Proprietary Capital portfolio 
The most material area of judgement in the ﬁnancial statements, and 
noted as a key risk by the external Auditor, relates to the valuation of the 
unquoted Proprietary Capital portfolio, which at 31 March 2016 was 
£3,839 million, or 86% of net assets, under the Investment basis.
In recognition of the importance of this area the Board has a separate 
Valuations Committee to review the valuations policy, process and 
application to individual investments. This Valuations Committee 
provides quarterly reports to the Committee and the Board.
The valuation of the Proprietary Capital portfolio is a primary input into 
the carried interest accrual, which is determined by reference to the 
valuation at 31 March 2016.
On behalf of the Board, the Committee considered quarterly reports 
from the Valuations Committee, with particular focus on the 
assumptions supporting the unquoted asset investments, any valuation 
uncertainties and the proposed disclosure in the ﬁnancial statements. 
As in 2015, the 2016 Annual report includes a separate report from the 
Valuations Committee. Details of the key valuation considerations and 
the review and challenge undertaken in the year is included in the 
Valuation Committee report on pages 79 to 81.
The Committee reviewed the carried interest payable and receivable as 
part of the overall summary prepared alongside the 2016 Annual report.
Fair, balanced and understandable and the presentation  
of 3i’s results 
Under the UK Corporate Governance Code the Board should establish 
arrangements to ensure the Annual report presents a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group’s position and prospects and 
make a statement that they considered the Annual report to be fair, 
balanced and understandable.
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee considered what, if any, 
enhancements were necessary to current procedures to ensure that this 
statement could be made.
The Group prepares a non-GAAP Investment basis ﬁnancial statements 
following its adoption of IFRS 10 to ensure that its results remain 
understandable.
 
The Committee reviewed the Half-yearly and Full Year ﬁnancial 
statements as well as the Quarterly Performance Updates with 
management, focusing on the integrity and clarity of disclosure  
so as to ultimately enable the Board to provide the fair, balanced 
and understandable conﬁrmation to shareholders in the 2016 
Annual report.
A report summarising the considerations for the 2016 Annual report 
was reviewed by the Audit Committee in advance of the year end and 
a summary of the detailed procedures undertaken was prepared 
alongside the 2016 Annual report.
The Committee was satisﬁed that maintenance of the Investment basis 
ﬁnancial statements was appropriate.
The external Auditor states in its audit report that the information given 
in the FY2016 Strategic report and Corporate Governance report is 
consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. 
Risk and internal control reviews
The Committee holds responsibility on behalf of the Board for 
overseeing the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems. It monitors the activities of the Group 
Risk Committee (“GRC”), the risk management processes in place, 
the Group’s whistleblowing arrangements and the activities of the 
Internal Audit function, including its reporting on the 
effectiveness of internal controls. 
A report summarising each quarterly GRC meeting, along with the 
risk report considered, is provided to the Committee for review 
and discussion. The risk report details the principal risks, which 
are derived from the Group Risk process, along with commentary 
on how the exposure to these risks has moved in the quarter. The 
Committee also monitors Internal Audit activity quarterly, covering 
change management and other areas of identiﬁed higher risk. 
The Head of Internal Audit provided an annual assessment of 
the Group’s risk management and internal control systems for 
presentation to the Committee. The review documents the 
components of the risk management and internal control 
framework and highlights the key developments in the year, 
along with commentary on their operation over the year. The 
effectiveness of such controls is reviewed by Internal Audit, either 
through dedicated procedures or in the course of other Internal 
Audit reviews over the year. Group Compliance carries out desk 
based monitoring, business unit and thematic reviews in relation 
to compliance policies and other regulatory matters.
The Group maintains a framework of controls related to key 
ﬁnancial processes, including the preparation of consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements, and management of the associated risks. 
The Group’s control policies and procedures, which are in 
accordance with the Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance 
on risk management, internal control and related ﬁnancial and 
business reporting have been in place throughout the ﬁnancial 
year and up to the date this report was approved.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 Internal audit 
The Committee continued to monitor the scope, activity, and 
resources of the Group’s internal audit function including whether 
the current operating model remained effective and concluded 
that it remained appropriate. 
During the year the Committee approved the annual internal 
audit plan and subsequent updates. It also received a quarterly 
report from the Head of Internal Audit summarising the audits 
concluded in the period and periodical updates on outstanding 
agreed actions from previous reports. The Head of Internal Audit 
meets the Committee privately as well as meeting regularly with 
the Audit Committee Chairman throughout the year. 
External audit
Ernst & Young LLP has been the Group’s statutory external auditor 
since before the Group was listed on the London Stock Exchange 
in 1994. The Committee assesses the independence and 
objectivity, qualiﬁcations and effectiveness of Ernst & Young LLP 
on an annual basis. The Committee also concludes on whether to 
recommend to the Board the reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP 
as auditor.
Auditor appointment and independence
The Committee recognises the importance of ensuring the 
independence and objectivity of the Group’s auditor. It reviews 
the nature and extent of the services provided by them, the level 
of their fees and the element comprising non-audit fees.
The total audit fee for the year was £2.0 million (2015: £2.0 million). 
The Committee is satisﬁed that this fee is appropriate in respect 
of the audit services provided and that an effective audit can be 
provided. The Committee oversees the Group’s policy on the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditor. The 
Committee continues to see beneﬁts for the Group in engaging 
Ernst & Young LLP where:
 – Work is closely related to the audit; or
 – A detailed understanding of the Group is required; or
 – Ernst & Young LLP is able to provide a higher quality and/or 
better value service than other potential providers.
The Committee Chairman is notiﬁed of all assignments allocated 
to Ernst & Young LLP over a deﬁned limit, other than those related 
to due diligence within the Group’s investment process. The key 
principle of our policy is that permission to engage the external 
auditor will always be refused when a threat to independence 
and/or objectivity is perceived. Appointments in relation to the 
investment process are independent of the audit team and are 
reviewed separately by the Investment Committee but are 
reported to the Audit and Compliance Committee Chairman. 
Details of the non-audit fees paid to the auditors are disclosed 
in Note 6 to the ﬁnancial statements. The Committee concluded 
that all of these fees fell within its criteria for engaging Ernst & 
Young LLP and does not believe they pose a threat to the 
auditor’s independence or objectivity.
Assessing external audit effectiveness
The Committee reviews the effectiveness of Ernst & Young LLP 
through the use of questionnaires completed by management, 
by considering the extent and quality of their contribution at its 
meetings throughout the course of the year, and in one-to-one 
meetings. The Committee Chairman met Ernst & Young LLP’s 
Head of Audit Quality Assurance, together with their Head of 
Financial Services Assurance Practice to discuss their approach to 
audit quality, and what assurance had been taken in connection 
with their audit of 3i.
The 2016 evaluation also reviewed the quality of the audit process, 
the use of Ernst & Young LLP’s valuation practice to support the 
audit of the portfolio valuations, the technical knowledge of the 
team and the staff turnover within the Ernst & Young LLP audit 
team and the Committee concluded that the audit was effective.
Audit tender
The Committee is cognisant of the requirements governing the 
appointment of an external Auditor, notably the requirements of 
the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) in relation to the 
mandatory re-tendering of audit services every 10 years, together 
with the European Union’s requirements for mandatory ﬁrm 
rotation. The Group conﬁrms that it has complied with the 
provisions of the CMA’s Order for the ﬁnancial year under review. 
During the year the Committee received regular updates on 
the Group’s position on its external audit and potential tender. 
Of particular interest to 3i was the Financial Reporting Council’s 
consultation, released in September 2015, on the implementation 
of the EU legislation and the application of the rules, particularly 
around the components of an audit group. The scale of the 
current engagement across the Group and its portfolio 
companies with ﬁrms that may participate in any tender, as well 
as the complexities around how the rules would apply to Private 
Equity investments, meant that the Committee concluded that it 
would be appropriate to use the full transitional arrangements in 
relation to auditor rotation as outlined by the Financial Reporting 
Council. The Committee currently expects that Ernst & Young LLP 
will be retained until 2020 when mandatory rotation will be 
required. As a result, Ernst & Young LLP replaced the lead audit 
partner in March 2016 to enable continuity throughout the 
period to 2020.

Corporate Governance
Audit and Compliance Committee report  The Valuations Committee reports to the Audit and Compliance 
Committee and the Board on the valuation of the Group’s 
investment assets. It meets quarterly, to coincide with the 
Group’s external ﬁnancial reporting calendar. It reviews and 
challenges the assumptions behind management’s proposed 
investment asset valuation.
The Committee’s activity is principally focused on the Private 
Equity investments as a high level of judgement is required to 
value the unquoted portfolio. In light of the Group’s increased 
capital allocation to Debt Management and the market volatility 
seen in the second half of the year in particular, the Committee 
also focused on the Group’s Debt Management CLO equity 
portfolio and the principal drivers behind its valuation. As in 
previous years, the Committee devoted limited time to 
Infrastructure due to the fact that its principal investment is its 
shareholding in the quoted 3i Infrastructure plc.
The Committee is responsible for keeping the Group’s valuation 
policy under review and recommending any changes to the policy 
to Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board. The policy 
is reviewed at least annually with the last update in January 2016. 
The Group’s valuation policy is based on the International Private 
Equity and Venture Capital (“IPEV”) Guidelines which set out 
recommended practice for fair valuing unquoted investments 
within the IFRS framework.
Overview of the Valuation Process
The Committee receives a detailed report from the Group 
Finance Director recommending a proposed valuation of the 
Group’s investment portfolio. This report highlights the key 
themes by business line and the main drivers of value movement 
analysed between performance, multiple movements and other 
factors. At each meeting the Committee also reviews selected 
assets for detailed discussion; examples of such assets covered 
during the year included Action, Basic-Fit, Scandlines, AES, 
JMJ and Dynatect.
In advance of the full year and half-year reporting, management 
hold individual portfolio company reviews with the respective 
investment teams. Non-executive Directors, including members 
of the Valuations Committee, attended a signiﬁcant proportion 
of all the meetings held in September 2015 and March 2016 and 
were represented at all of the top ﬁve Private Equity portfolio 
company review meetings. 
As part of its external audit, Ernst & Young LLP undertakes a 
separate review of the proposed investment portfolio valuation to 
determine that the valuation policy is being complied with and 
that there is consistent application and support for the underlying 
assumptions. As part of their year-end audit, Ernst & Young LLP’s 
specialist valuations teams independently reviewed a selection 
of Private Equity and Debt Management investments to provide 
further assurance on their overall audit conclusion on the 
appropriateness of 3i’s portfolio valuation.

Private Equity
Earnings and multiple assumptions
The majority (74%) of the portfolio is valued using a multiple of earnings. 
This requires judgement as the earnings of the portfolio company may 
be adjusted so that they are considered “maintainable” . 
There is also a signiﬁcant degree of judgement in selecting the 
appropriate set of comparable quoted companies to determine the 
appropriate multiple to generate an enterprise value. Multiples are 
selected by reference to quoted comparable companies, M&A 
transactions and input in certain cases from corporate ﬁnance advisers. 
Management also take into account growth proﬁle, geographic 
location, diversiﬁcation and leverage/reﬁnancing risk. The multiple 
implied by the quoted comparable may be adjusted if the longer-term 
view (cycle or exit plan) supports the use of more conservative multiples. 
This has been a particularly important exercise in light of the increased 
volatility experienced in the quoted equity markets over the period 
under review. 
Earnings data is received monthly from Private Equity portfolio 
companies and monitored closely by management. Actual earnings 
may then be adjusted in management’s proposed valuations, for 
example, to reﬂect a full year’s trading of an acquired business, 
removing proﬁt from discontinued activities or excluding exceptional 
transaction costs. Material adjustments are highlighted to the 
Committee in the quarterly report for review and approval.
Management continued to adjust a signiﬁcant proportion of multiples 
used if the longer-term view (exit or multiple) supports the use of a 
different multiple. Notable changes in multiples in a quarter are 
presented to the Committee and adjustments are reviewed by the 
Committee at each meeting. Ernst & Young LLP also speciﬁcally review 
and consider the appropriateness of a sample of these adjustments 
and reports to the Committee.
Imminent sale assets 
At any point in time a number of potential exit processes from the 
portfolio may be underway. Judgement is applied by management as 
to the likely eventual exit proceeds and certainty of completion. This 
means that in some cases the valuation of an asset may not be moved 
to an imminent sales basis until very shortly before completion; in other 
cases the switch may occur on signing. However as a general rule the 
valuation of an asset moves to an imminent sale basis only when a 
process is materially complete and the remaining risks are estimated 
to be minimal, taking into account the normal completion risk around 
unquoted equity transactions.
Assets that are within active sales processes are reviewed by the 
Committee including details such as the timeline to potential 
completion, the number and make-up of bidders for investments, 
execution and due diligence risks and regulatory or competition 
clearance issues. Management propose a treatment for each asset 
which the Committee reviews.
Assets valued using a DCF basis
For assets valued using DCF techniques the key valuation judgements 
relate to longer-term assumptions that drive the underlying business 
plan and cash ﬂows and appropriate discount rates.
Material assumptions and signiﬁcant changes to these assumptions 
are reviewed by the Committee. This may include third-party support 
if available. Sensitivity to assumptions is also noted.
Discount rates are selected by management with reference to market 
transactions, weighted average cost of capital calculations and other 
public data. Any material changes are reviewed by the Committee 
and external advice is sought from time to time.
Debt Management
CLO equity valuation process
The level of capital deployed into Debt Management investments at 
31 March 2016 was £229 million (31 March 2015: £176 million). 66% of this 
relates to investment in CLO equity where there is infrequent trading 
and therefore little third-party evidence of value. Consequently, 
judgement is required on the choice of basis to use for CLO valuations, 
including use of broker marks and internal DCF models.
Reﬂecting the market volatility in the second half of the year, 
management increased the level of information provided to the 
Committee to allow it to assess the appropriateness of the valuations. 
This included input from the relevant credit teams regarding the 
underlying assets. The use by management of independent data, such 
as broker marks supporting the proposed valuations increased and 
broker marks are the primary data point to determine fair value. The 
quarterly valuation report includes a range indicated from all available 
data points, including internal DCF models, against the proposed 
valuation. The range and actual values are reviewed by the Committee. 
Ernst & Young LLP also selected a sample of CLOs for valuation by  
their valuation specialists in order to review the appropriateness of 
management‘s valuation and included their results in a report to  
the Committee.

Valuations Committee report As part of its challenge and review process, the Committee:
 – Considered the management information provided to support 
the Committee’s review of the portfolio valuation, including the 
strength and operation of the internal controls and 
management’s responses to any challenges raised by the 
Committee members or Ernst & Young LLP;
 – Sought assurance from the external Auditor as to whether and 
how it had considered each of these areas; 
 – Reviewed the consistency of the views of management and the 
external Auditor.
The Committee was satisﬁed that the application of the policy 
and process was appropriate during the applicable period, and 
recommended the portfolio valuation to the Audit and 
Compliance Committee and the Board at each quarter end for 
approval by the Board.
Portfolio trends
As noted in the prior year’s report, at least annually the 
Committee Chairman and management conduct a review of the 
valuation outcomes in the portfolio over the preceding three 
years. The Committee Chairman and Group Finance Director 
reported to the Board in May 2016 on the key observations.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 “ We remain committed to maintaining a 
remuneration framework which supports 
the achievement of our strategic 
objectives.”
Jonathan Asquith
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
Statement by the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman
As Remuneration Committee Chairman, I am pleased to introduce 
the Directors’ remuneration report for the ﬁnancial year 1 April 
2015 to 31 March 2016 (“the year”) and to provide some details of 
the background against which the Committee’s decisions have 
been taken in the year. References to “the current year” or 
“FY2017” relate to the ﬁnancial year 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017 .
At our 2014 Annual General Meeting, our Remuneration policy 
was approved. That policy has served us well and we are not 
proposing any changes to it at this time. The policy is available on 
our website www.3i.com/investor-relations/results-and-reports/
reports.
Performance in the year
I am pleased to report, as you will have read earlier in this 
Annual report, that this has been another successful year for 
the Company. The business has continued to execute its well 
established strategy and performed resiliently in the face of 
volatile macro-economic conditions. Robust unrealised value 
growth, particularly in our largest and strongest investments,  
such as Action, Scandlines and 3i Infrastructure plc, together with 
a good ﬂow of realisations and continued cost discipline, have 
driven an excellent total return on opening shareholders’ funds  
of 21.7% (2015: 19.9%).
The strong performance of the Company has been reﬂected in 
the Committee’s decisions concerning the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration. Further information on this assessment is provided 
on pages 84 to 87 . Highlights of these achievements include:
Portfolio return
Exceptional performance of the Private Equity portfolio as well as 
good returns from the Infrastructure portfolio generated a gross 
investment return of £1,069 million (2015: £805 million) or 28% of 
opening portfolio value. This materially exceeded target and 
higher than the previous year (2015: 23%).
Investment
Throughout the period, management continued its disciplined 
and selective approach to investment. Despite this, the 
investment momentum seen in FY2015 continued through FY2016 
with three key investments completed in Private Equity: Weener 
Plastic; Euro-Diesel; and Audley Travel. The Infrastructure business 
also completed four new investments, while Debt Management 
successfully completed £1.3 billion of new CLO issuance in  
the year.
Operating proﬁt
Annual operating cash proﬁts improved from £28 million  
in FY2015 to £37 million in FY2016, which was signiﬁcantly  
above target. 
Strategy and people
The strategic re-positioning of the Infrastructure business and 
related team hires enabled the business to expand its capabilities 
and deliver on a broader investment mandate. 
2013–16 Performance
Shortly after Simon Borrows was appointed as Chief Executive in 
2012 and as part of the three-year strategic plan that was set out 
at that time, the terms of the LTIP scheme were discussed and 
supported by our larger shareholders. In order to ensure that 
management remained focused on delivering the three-year 
turnaround in the business, it was decided that the 2013 LTIP 
award would be split with 50% relating to Total Shareholder 
Return over the three-year performance period and 50% equally 
divided between two strategic objectives concerning the 
restructuring of the cost base and the elimination of the annual 
operating cash deﬁcit which had been an unwelcome feature of 
the business in prior years. The three-year performance period for 
this award started on 1 April 2013 and ended on 31 March 2016. 
Total Shareholder Return over the three-year period was 20.2%, 
well above the maximum target of 18%. For the two strategic 
objectives, the Committee has concluded that the performance 
has been either good or exceptional and therefore most of the 
award aligned to these objectives will vest. More detail on the 
performance can be found on page 87 .

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016
Corporate Governance
Directors’ remuneration report Regulatory changes in the year
During FY2016, 3i has worked to ensure that it continues to 
comply with changes in regulation. The Group must comply with 
the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, which 
requires the Company to deliver variable remuneration to certain 
staff in a particular form. The two Executive Directors are 
considered to be AIFMD Identiﬁed Staff and, as such, 60% of their 
annual bonuses will be delivered in 3i Group plc shares deferred 
for four years (and which vest one quarter per annum over those 
four years). The remaining 40% will be delivered half in cash bonus 
and half in 3i Group plc shares which are subject to a six-month 
retention period.
The Committee has reviewed the malus provision, which remains 
substantially unchanged, and introduced a clawback policy,  
which is shown on page 91, complying with the new requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Committee priorities and potential changes 
in the current year
The Committee remains committed to maintaining a 
remuneration framework which rewards progress in meeting the 
Group’s strategic objectives. We will continue to monitor and 
comply with relevant guidelines and regulatory changes.
The Remuneration policy was approved in 2014 and is now in its 
third year of operation. The policy will be reviewed during the year 
and be presented to shareholders for approval at the 2017 AGM. 
If there are any substantial changes to the policy we will consult 
with major shareholders and the appropriate institutional groups.

Directors’ remuneration report  FY2016 Annual bonus
The annual bonuses for Executive Directors for the year were awarded against a balanced scorecard of both ﬁnancial and strategic 
measures agreed by the Committee in May 2015. The Committee uses the scorecard as a prompt and guide to judgement and 
considers the performance outcomes in the wider context of personal performance (including values and behaviours) risk, market 
and other factors. 
The performance achieved against the scorecard metrics supports the commentary within this Annual report and accounts that FY2016 
was another exceptionally strong year. Highlights included:
 – Materially higher gross investment return of 28% against a target of 15% on opening portfolio value;
 – Signiﬁcant new investments across all business areas, while maintaining a disciplined and selective approach to investment 
opportunities; and
 – Positive operating cash proﬁt signiﬁcantly above target and higher than FY2015.
FY2016 has been an exceptional year, with performance being signiﬁcantly ahead of targets and expectations across the Company.

1 All numbers are under the Investment basis.
T = Target E = Expectation
* Some expectations are not disclosed as they are commercially sensitive.
Consistent with last year, the Board set expectations rather than targets for some metrics. This is because the timing of acquisitions and 
disposals is highly sensitive to market conditions, and a more prescriptive approach would run the risk of creating perverse incentives 
for executives. For example, to achieve a target level of realisations may result in the earlier sale of assets than would otherwise be 
appropriate, or to achieve a target level of investments may result in investing at inﬂated prices. In practice, the Board’s expectations in 
these areas were met or exceeded in each case. 
In light of the achievements detailed above, and the exceptional performance of the Group in the year, the Committee awarded  
Mr Borrows a bonus in respect of FY2016 of £2,158,932 (being 92.5% of his maximum bonus opportunity), and awarded Mrs Wilson a 
bonus in respect of FY2016 of £901,765 (being 85% of her maximum bonus opportunity). In each case, 20% of the award will be paid in 
cash immediately, 20% will be delivered as shares with a retention period of six months and the remaining 60% will be deferred into the 
Company’s shares vesting in equal instalments over four years. Annual bonus awards are subject to the malus and clawback policy.

Deferred bonuses awarded in FY2016
Under the Deferred Bonus Plan, share awards were granted to the Executive Directors on 4 June 2015 in respect of FY2015 
performance with a face value of £1,048,000 (193,680 shares) for the Chief Executive and £425,000 (78,519 shares) for the Group Finance 
Director. These face values were reported in the 2015 single ﬁgure of remuneration for each Director. The share price used to calculate 
face value was the average of the mid-market closing prices over the ﬁve working days starting with the date of the announcement of

subject to further performance conditions and vest in four equal instalments annually from 1 June 2016.
Share Incentive Plan
During the year, Mrs Wilson participated in the HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan which during the year allowed employees to 
invest up to £150 per month from pre-tax salary in ordinary shares (“partnership shares”). For each partnership share, the Company 
grants two free ordinary shares (“matching shares”) which are normally forfeited if employment ceases within three years of grant. 
Dividends are reinvested in further ordinary shares (“dividend shares”). During the year Mrs Wilson purchased 367 partnership shares, 
and received 734 matching shares and 530 dividend shares at prices ranging between £4.3297 and £5.5633 per share, with an average 
price of £4.9489. 
Pension arrangements
Mr Borrows and Mrs Wilson received salary supplements in lieu of pension of £16k and £44k respectively.
Payments to past Directors
No payments were made to past Directors in the year.
Payments for loss of ofﬁce
No payments to Directors for loss of ofﬁce have been made in the year.

Directors’ remuneration report  Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests
The Company’s share ownership and retention policy requires Executive Directors to build up over time, and thereafter maintain, 
a shareholding in the Company’s shares equivalent to at least 3.0 times gross salary in the case of the Chief Executive and 1.5 times 
gross salary for the Group Finance Director. In addition, shareholding targets have been introduced for other members of 
Executive Committee of 1.5 times their gross salaries and for partners in the Group’s businesses of 1.0 times their gross salaries. 
Details of Directors’ interests (including interests of their connected persons) in the Company’s shares as at 31 March 2016 are shown

Statement of implementation of the remuneration policy in the coming year
The table below sets out how the Committee intend to operate the remuneration policy in FY2017 . 
Policy element Implementation of policy during FY2017
Base salary A Group-wide 3% increase to salaries will take place in FY2017 , which will also be applied to Executive Director salaries. 
Effective from 1 July 2016, salaries for the Executive Directors will therefore be as follows:
 – Chief Executive: £601,000
 – Group Finance Director: £437 ,090
Pension No changes to the current arrangements are proposed for FY2017 . The Executive Directors will continue to receive a 
pension contribution or salary supplement as follows:
 –Chief Executive: £15k 
 – Group Finance Director: 12% of salary
Beneﬁts No changes to the current arrangements are proposed for FY2017 .
Beneﬁts will continue to include a car allowance, provision of health insurance and any Share Incentive Plan matching 
share awards.
Annual bonus The maximum annual bonus opportunities for FY2017 will remain unchanged, in line with the remuneration policy, 
as follows:
 – Chief Executive: 400% of salary
 – Group Finance Director: 250% of salary
Awards over 75% of this maximum will be made only in exceptional circumstances.
Any bonus will be awarded based on a balanced scorecard of both ﬁnancial and strategic measures agreed by the 
Committee, alongside a consideration of the wider context of personal performance (including values and behaviours), 
risk, market and other factors. 
Measures for the FY2017 scorecard are based 90% on ﬁnancial measures (50% portfolio return, 30% investment 
management and 10% operating performance) and 10% on strategic and people objectives. They are calibrated to 
current business strategy and will evolve year on year as the Group’s situation and priorities develop.
The Committee considers that the speciﬁc targets and expectations contained within the FY2017 scorecard are 
commercially sensitive and therefore will not be disclosed in advance. We will report to shareholders next year on 
performance and the resulting bonus outturns. 
At least 50% of any bonus award will be deferred into shares vesting in equal instalments over four years.
Awards are subject to the Company’s malus and clawback policy.

Directors’ remuneration report  Policy element Implementation of policy during FY2017
Long-term  
incentive plan
Awards under the long-term incentive plan in FY2017 will be made as follows:
 – Chief Executive: 400% of salary
 – Group Finance Director: 250% of salary 
Performance will be measured over a three-year period and will be determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
Performance measures remained unchanged from the previous year and will be as follows:
50% of the award is based on absolute TSR measured over the performance period, and vests:
 – 0% vesting below 10% p.a. TSR;
 – 20% vesting at 10% p.a. TSR;
 – Straight-line vesting between 10% and 18% p.a. TSR; and
 – 100% vesting at 18% p.a. TSR.
50% of the award is based on relative TSR measured against the FTSE 350 Index over the performance period, 
and vests:
 – 0% for below median performance against the index;
 – 25% for median performance against the index;
 – 100% for upper quartile performance against the index; and
 – Straight-line vesting between median and upper quartile performance. 
Awards are subject to the Company’s malus and clawback policy.
Shareholding  
requirements
No changes to the current arrangements are proposed for FY2017 . Shareholding requirements will therefore remain 
as follows:
 – Chief Executive: 300% of salary
 – Group Finance Director: 150% of salary 
Non-executive  
Director fees
No changes to the current arrangements are proposed for FY2017 . Fees for the non-executive Directors will therefore 
remain as follows:
Chairman fee:  £265,000 plus £30,000 in 3i shares
Non-executive Directors:
Board membership fee: £50,000 plus 3,000 3i shares
Deputy Chairman (including SID fee) £40,000
Senior Independent Director fee: £10,000
Committee chairman:  £20,000
Committee member: £8,000
Committee fees are payable in respect of the Audit and Compliance Committee, Remuneration Committee 
and Valuations Committee.
Malus and  
clawback policy
Long-term incentive awards and deferred bonus share awards made during the year to Executive Directors (and certain 
other Senior Executives), may be forfeited or reduced prior to vesting in exceptional circumstances on such basis as the 
Committee considers fair, reasonable and proportionate. This would include, but is not limited to, material 
misstatement of Group ﬁnancial statements, or cases where an individual is deemed to have caused a material loss for 
the Group as a result of reckless, negligent or wilful actions or inappropriate values or behaviour.
The Group may recover amounts that have been paid or released from awards (including cash bonus awards), as long 
as a written request for the recovery of such sums is made in the two-year period from the date of payment or release 
and in circumstances where either (a) there has been a material misstatement of Group ﬁnancial statements or (b) the 
Group suffers a material loss, and (in either case) the Committee considers that there is reasonable evidence to show 
that the misstatement or loss has been caused by the individual’s reckless, negligent or wilful actions or inappropriate 
values or behaviours.

IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
The impact of future standards and amendments on the ﬁnancial statements is being assessed by the Group and the Company.
B Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as disclosed in the Directors’ report.
C Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control, as deﬁned by IFRS 10, is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, 
to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group effectively obtains control. They are de-consolidated from the 
date that control ceases. 
3i Group plc is an investment entity and, as such, does not consolidate the investment entities it controls. Most of the Group’s interests 
in subsidiaries are recognised at fair value through proﬁt or loss. Those subsidiaries which provide investment related services, such as 
advisory, management or employment services, are not classiﬁed at fair value through proﬁt and loss and continue to be consolidated 
unless they are deemed investment entities, in which case they are fair valued. 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. Under the acquisition method of 
accounting, with some limited exceptions, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values 
at the date of acquisition. Any non-controlling interest is measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportion 
of the net assets acquired. Acquisition related costs are accounted for as expenses when incurred. Any excess of the cost of 
acquisition over net assets is capitalised as goodwill. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated 
upon consolidation.
(ii) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence, but not control, over the ﬁnancial and operating policies. 
Investments that are held as part of the Group’s investment portfolio are carried in the statement of ﬁnancial position at fair value even 
though the Group may have signiﬁcant inﬂuence over those companies. 
(iii) Composition of the Group
The Group comprises several different types of subsidiaries. The Group re-assesses the function performed by each type of subsidiary 
to determine its treatment under the IFRS 10 exception from consolidation on an annual basis. The types of subsidiaries and their 
treatment under IFRS 10 are as follows:

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016
Financial statements
Signiﬁcant accounting policies General Partners (GPs) – Consolidated
General Partners provide investment management services and do not hold any direct investments in portfolio assets. These entities 
are not investment entities. 
Investment managers/advisers – Consolidated
These entities provide investment related services through the provision of investment management or advice. They do not hold any 
direct investments in portfolio assets. These entities are not investment entities. 
Investment managers/advisers which also hold investments – Consolidated
These entities provide investment related services through the provision of investment management or advice and also hold 
investments in managed assets, typically due to regulatory reasons or investor expectations. The primary purpose of these entities is to 
provide investment related services and therefore they are not classiﬁed as investment entities. 
Holding companies of investment managers/advisers – Consolidated
These entities provide investment related services through their subsidiaries. They do not hold any direct investment in portfolio assets 
and these entities are not investment entities. 
Limited Partnerships and other intermediate investment holding structures – Fair valued 
The Group makes investments in portfolio assets through its ultimate parent company as well as through other limited partnerships 
and corporate subsidiaries which the Group has created to align the interests of the investment teams with the performance of the 
assets through the use of various carried interest schemes. The purpose of these limited partnerships and corporate holding vehicles, 
many of which also provide investment related services, is to invest for investment income and capital appreciation. These partnerships 
meet the deﬁnition of an investment entity and are classiﬁed at fair value through proﬁt and loss.
Portfolio investments – Fair valued
Under IFRS 10, the test for accounting subsidiaries has been altered to take wider factors of control as well as actual equity ownership 
into account. At 31 March 2016, the Group had 26 investments which were classiﬁed as accounting subsidiaries. In accordance with the 
investment entity exception, these entities have been held at fair value with movements in fair value being recognised in the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income. With one exception (Palace Street I Limited) none of these subsidiaries are UK 
Companies Act subsidiaries.
Structured entities – Fair valued
The Group has interests in a number of unconsolidated structured entities, their current carrying value and a description of their 
activities is included in Note 29. 
D Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The reported results of the Group are sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation 
of its ﬁnancial statements. UK company law and IFRS require the Directors, in preparing the Group’s ﬁnancial statements, to select 
suitable accounting policies, apply them consistently and make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent. The 
Group’s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and expectation of future events and are reviewed periodically. 
The actual outcome may be materially different from that anticipated. 
The judgements, assumptions and estimates involved in the Group’s accounting policies that are considered by the Board to be the 
most important to the portrayal of its ﬁnancial condition are the fair valuation of the investment and the assessment regarding 
investment entities. The investment portfolio is held at fair value. Given the importance of this area, the Board has a separate Valuations 
Committee to review the valuations policies, process and application to individual investments. A report on the activities of the 
Valuations Committee is included in the Governance section of the Annual report. Note 12 provides further detail on the fair value 
of the investment portfolio, including sensitivities to inputs in level 3 valuations. The Group’s valuation policy is set out on pages 148 
and 149.
Further detail on the assessment as an investment entity is as follows:
(a) Assessment as an investment entity
Entities that meet the deﬁnition of an investment entity within IFRS 10 are required to account for most investments in controlled 
entities, as well as investments in associates and joint ventures, at fair value through proﬁt and loss. 
The Board has concluded that the Company continues to meet the deﬁnition of an investment entity as its strategic objective of 
investing in portfolio investments and providing investment management services to investors for the purpose of generating returns 
in the form of investment income and capital appreciation remains unchanged. 
The Group is required to determine the degree of control or inﬂuence the Group exercises and the form of any control to ensure that 
the ﬁnancial treatment is accurate. Further detail on our review of our application of IFRS 10 can be found on pages 48 to 52.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 (b) Valuation of the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
The Group also considers the valuation of the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes in accordance with IAS 19 to be a signiﬁcant estimate. The 
Group reviews its assumptions annually with its independent actuaries. 
E Other accounting policies 
(a) Revenue recognition
Gross investment return is equivalent to “revenue” for the purposes of IAS 1. It represents the overall increase in net assets from the 
investment portfolio net of deal-related costs and includes foreign exchange movements in respect of the investment portfolio. 
Investment income is analysed into the following components:
i.   Realised proﬁts or losses over value on the disposal of investments are the difference between the fair value of the consideration 
received less any directly attributable costs, on the sale of equity and the repayment of loans and receivables, and its carrying value 
at the start of the accounting period, converted into sterling using the exchange rates in force at the date of disposal.
ii.  Unrealised proﬁts or losses on the revaluation of investments are the movement in the carrying value of investments between 
the start and end of the accounting period converted into sterling using the exchange rates in force at the date of the movement.
iii.  Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries are the movements in the carrying value of Group subsidiaries which 
are classiﬁed as investment entities under IFRS 10. The Group makes investments in portfolio assets through these entities which 
are usually limited partnerships or corporate subsidiaries. 
iv.  Portfolio income is that portion of income that is directly related to the return from individual investments. It is recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that there will be economic beneﬁt and the income can be reliably measured. The following speciﬁc 
recognition criteria must be met before the income is recognised:
 – Dividends from equity investments are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income when the 
shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. Income received on the investment in the most junior ranked level 
of CLO capital is recognised as a dividend. £31 million was received in the year (2015: £16 million). 
 – Income from loans and receivables is recognised as it accrues by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest 
rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash ﬂows through the expected life of the ﬁnancial 
asset to the asset’s carrying value. When the fair value of an investment is assessed to be below the principal value of a loan the 
Group recognises a provision against any interest accrued from the date of the assessment going forward until the investment 
is assessed to have recovered in value. Income received on the instruments in the most junior level of CLO capital is recognised 
as a dividend as detailed above. £31 million was received in the year (2015: £16 million).
 – Fee income is earned directly from investee companies when an investment is ﬁrst made and through the life of the investment. 
Fees that are earned on a ﬁnancing arrangement are considered to relate to a ﬁnancial asset measured at fair value through proﬁt 
or loss and are recognised when that investment is made. Fees that are earned on the basis of providing an ongoing service 
to the investee company are recognised as that service is provided.
v.   Foreign exchange on investments arises on investments made in currencies that are different from the functional currency of the 
Group entity. Investments are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. At each subsequent reporting 
date investments are translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
(b) Foreign currency translation
For the Company and those subsidiaries whose balance sheets are denominated in sterling, which is the Company’s functional and 
presentational currency, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the closing 
rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange 
over the year and exchange differences arising are taken to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The balance sheets of subsidiaries and associates denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the closing rates. 
The Statements of comprehensive income for these subsidiaries and associates are translated at the average rates and exchange 
differences arising are taken to other comprehensive income. Such exchange differences are reclassiﬁed to the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the subsidiary or associate is disposed of.
Exchange movements in relation to forward foreign exchange contracts are included within exchange movements in the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. During the year, a £14 million loss (2015: £12 million gain) was recognised in exchange movements 
in relation to forward foreign exchange contracts.
(c) Treasury assets and liabilities 
Short-term treasury assets and short and long-term treasury liabilities are used in order to manage cash ﬂows and minimise the overall 
costs of borrowing. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, short-term deposits and amounts held in money market funds, which are readily 
convertible into cash and there is an insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value. Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the balance 
sheet when the relevant Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. De-recognition occurs when 
rights to cash ﬂows from a ﬁnancial asset expire, or when a liability is extinguished.

Signiﬁcant accounting policies 1 Segmental analysis
Operating segments are the components of the Group whose results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision 
maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. 
The Chief Executive, who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker, managed the Group on two bases throughout the 
year. Firstly, as business divisions determined with reference to market focus, geographic focus, investment funding model and the 
Group’s management hierarchy. Secondly, he considers separate Proprietary Capital and Fund Management businesses focused on 
investment returns and Fund Management proﬁts respectively. A description of the activities, including products and services offered 
by these divisions and the allocation of resources, is given in the Strategic report. For the geographical segmental split, revenue 
information is based on the locations of the assets held.
The segmental information that follows is presented on the Investment basis which is the basis used by the Chief Executive to monitor 
the performance of the Group. The remaining Notes are prepared on the IFRS basis.

7 Income taxes
Accounting policy: 
Income taxes represent the sum of the tax currently payable, withholding taxes suffered and deferred tax. Tax is charged or credited 
in the Statement of comprehensive income, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the 
tax is also dealt with in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable proﬁt for the year. This may differ from the proﬁt included in the Statement of 
comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
To enable the tax charge to be based on the proﬁt for the year, deferred tax is provided in full on temporary timing differences, at 
the rates of tax expected to apply when these differences crystallise. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available against which temporary differences can be set off. All deferred tax liabilities 
are offset against deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of IAS 12.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
The main rate of UK corporation tax is to be reduced from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 , and further to 18% from 1 April 2020. 
These changes will affect future UK corporate taxes payable and the rate at which deferred tax assets are expected to reverse.

The tax exemption for capital proﬁts which they beneﬁt from allows them to ensure that investors do not ultimately suffer double 
taxation of their investment returns, ie once at the level of the investment fund vehicle and then again in the hands of the investors. 
Including £2 million of tax credits (2015: £2 million tax charge) incurred in fair valued entities, the total tax charge for the Group was nil 
(2015: £4 million) under the Investment basis.

At 31 March 2016, the Group had carried forward tax losses of £1,375 million (2015: £1,409 million), capital losses of £88 million 
(2015: £98 million) and other temporary differences of £69 million (2015: £12 million). It is uncertain that the Group will generate sufﬁcient 
taxable proﬁts in the foreseeable future to utilise these amounts and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect 
of these losses. Deferred income taxes are calculated using an expected rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19% (2015: 20%).

In FY2016, the Group’s dividend policy is to distribute to shareholders between 15% and 20% of gross cash realisation proceeds, 
provided that gearing is less than 20% and gross debt is, or is scheduled to be below £1 billion. The policy is designed to give 
shareholders a direct share in the Group’s realisation activities, while retaining sufﬁcient funds within the Group to make new 
investments, meet liabilities as they fall due and meet internally set liquidity requirements. When determining the level of realisations 
to be paid as a dividend each year, the Board considers current and expected cash investment along with any signiﬁcant actual or 
expected cash ﬂows. 
The distribution policy covers the Group’s total annual dividend, which is split between a base dividend (8.1 pence per share) and an 
additional dividend (2016: 13.9 pence per share). The dividend can be paid out of either the capital reserve or the revenue reserve 
subject to the investment trust rules which state that at least 85% of revenue must be distributed by the Company.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 10 Investment portfolio
Accounting policy: 
Investments are recognised and de-recognised on the date when their purchase or sale is subject to a relevant contract and the 
associated risks and rewards have been transferred. The Group manages its investments with a view to proﬁting from the receipt 
of investment income and capital appreciation from changes in the fair value of investments.
All investments are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given and are subsequently measured at fair value, 
in accordance with 3i Group’s valuation policies. 
Quoted investments are designated at fair value through proﬁt and loss and subsequently carried in the balance sheet at fair value. 
Fair value is measured using the closing bid price at the reporting date, where the investment is quoted on an active stock market.
Unquoted investments, including both equity and loans are designated at fair value through proﬁt and loss and are subsequently 
carried in the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position at fair value. Fair value is determined in line with 3i’s valuation policy, 
which is compliant with the fair value guidelines under IFRS and the International Private Equity and Venture Capital (IPEV) Valuation 
Guidelines, details of which are available in “Portfolio valuation – an explanation” on pages 148 and 149.
Interest bearing loans accrue interest which is either settled in cash or capitalised on a regular basis and included as part of the 
principal loan balance. The capitalisation of accrued interest is treated as part of investment additions during the year. If the fair 
value of an investment is assessed to be below the principal value of the loan the Group recognises a fair value reduction against any 
interest income accrued from the date of the assessment going forward. “Capitalisation at nil value” is the term used to describe the 
capitalisation of accrued interest which has been fully provided for. These transactions are disclosed as additions to portfolio cost 
with an equal reduction made where loan notes have nil value.
In accordance with IFRS 10, the proportion of the investment portfolio held by the Group’s unconsolidated subsidiaries is presented as 
part of the fair value of investment entity subsidiaries, along with the fair value of their other assets and liabilities. A reconciliation of the 
fair value of Investments in investment entities is included in Note 11.

The holding period of 3i’s investment portfolio is on average greater than one year. For this reason the portfolio is classiﬁed as non-
current. It is not possible to identify with certainty investments that will be sold within one year.
Additions include £35 million (2015: £69 million) in interest received by way of loan notes, of which £13 million (2015: £48 million) has 
been valued to nil, as well as cash advanced to Debt Management warehouses. Included within the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income is £26 million (2015: £38 million) of interest income, which reﬂects the net additions after write downs noted 
above, £5 million (2015: £14 million) of cash income and the capitalisation of accrued income and non-capitalised accrued income is £(1) 
million (2015: £3 million).
Other movements include the effects of foreign exchange and conversions from one instrument into another, including £38 million 
which relates to cash returned (2015: £18 million cash returned) from Debt Management warehouses.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 11 Investments in investment entity subsidiaries
Accounting policy: 
Investments in investment entity subsidiaries are accounted for as ﬁnancial instruments at fair value through proﬁt and loss.
These entities are typically limited partnerships and other intermediate investment holding structures which hold the Group’s 
interests in investments in portfolio companies (Investment Entity Holding Companies). The fair value can increase or reduce from 
either cash ﬂows to/from the investment entities or valuation movements in line with the Group’s valuation policy. 
Substantially all of these entities meet the deﬁnition of a Fund under the IPEV guidelines and the fair value and unit of account of 
these entities is their net asset values. There were no adjustments to the subsidiaries’ net asset values in the year. In 2015 an 
adjustment of £142 million was made to reﬂect the carried interest payable attributable to the value of investments held by the 
entities but not accounted for within their net asset value. This adjustment is no longer required as the underlying entities, being 
qualifying limited partnerships, have now adopted IFRS and account for the relevant carried interest payable within their net asset 
value. Carried interest is described further in Note 13.
We determine that in the ordinary course of business, the net asset values of an investment entity subsidiary are considered to be 
the most appropriate to determine fair value. At each reporting period, we consider whether any additional fair value adjustments 
need to be made to the net asset values of the investment entity subsidiaries. These adjustments may be required to reﬂect market 
participants’ considerations about fair value that may include, but are not limited to, liquidity and the portfolio effect of holding 
multiple investments within the investment entity subsidiary. There was no particular circumstance to indicate that a fair value 
adjustment was required and after due consideration we concluded that the net asset values were the most appropriate reﬂection of 
fair value at 31 March 2016.

(B) Valuation
The fair values of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values with the exception of 
loans and borrowings. The fair value of the loans and borrowings is £967 million (2015: £997 million), determined with reference to their 
published market prices. The carrying value of the loans and borrowings is £837 million (2015: £815 million).
Valuation hierarchy
The Group classiﬁes ﬁnancial instruments measured at fair value in the investment portfolio according to the following hierarchy:
Level Fair value input description Financial instruments
Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) from active markets Quoted equity instruments
Level 2
Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable 
either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices)
Level 3 Inputs that are not based on observable market data Unquoted equity instruments and loan instruments
Unquoted equity instruments and debt instruments are measured in accordance with the IPEV Guidelines with reference to the most 
appropriate information available at the time of measurement. Further information regarding the valuation of unquoted equity 
instruments and debt instruments can be found in the section Portfolio valuation – an explanation on pages 148 and 149.

At the Company level, the disclosures remain the same, with the exception of unquoted investments. Unquoted investments in the 
Company of £1,103 million (2015: £1,082 million) are valued at Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. This disclosure only refers to the directly 
held investment portfolio. The fair value hierarchy also applies to Investments in investment entities, see Note 11 for details.
Investments in investment entities are fair valued at the entity’s net asset value, with the most signiﬁcant component being the 
underlying investment portfolio. The underlying portfolio is valued under the same methodology as directly held investments, with 
any other assets or liabilities within investment entities valued in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Note 11 details 
the Directors’ considerations about the fair value of the underlying Investment entity subsidiaries.

Other movements include the effects of foreign exchange and conversions from one instrument into another, including £38 million 
which relates to cash returned (2015: £18 million cash returned) from Debt Management warehouses.
Unquoted investments valued using Level 3 inputs also had the following impact on the Statement of comprehensive income: realised 
proﬁts over value on disposal of investment of £10 million (2015: £19 million), dividend income of £46 million (2015: £23 million) and 
foreign exchange gains of £40 million (2015: £52 million losses). 
Level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when ascertaining fair value as described in the Portfolio valuation – an explanation 
section. On an IFRS basis, of assets held at 31 March 2016, classiﬁed as Level 3, 28% (2015: 44%) were valued using a multiple of earnings 
and the remaining 72% (2015: 56%) were valued using alternative valuation methodologies. 
Valuation multiple – The valuation multiple is the main assumption applied to a multiple of earnings based valuation. The multiple is 
derived from comparable listed companies or relevant market transaction multiples. Companies in the same industry and geography 
and, where possible, with a similar business model and proﬁle are selected and then adjusted for factors including liquidity risk, growth 
potential and relative performance. The value weighted average earnings multiple used when valuing the portfolio was 9.83x 
(2015: 9.68x). 
If the multiple used to value each unquoted investment valued on an earnings multiple basis as at 31 March 2016 decreased by 5%, 
the investment portfolio would decrease by £19 million (2015: £35 million) or 1% (2015: 2%). If the same sensitivity was applied to the 
underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have a negative impact of £173 million (2015: £121 million) or 6% (2015: 5%). 
If the multiple increased by 5% then the investment portfolio would increase by £19 million (2015: £33 million) or 1% (2015: 2%). If the 
same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have a positive impact of £172 million 
(2015: £122 million) or 6% (2015: 6%).
Alternative valuation methodologies – There are a number of alternative investment valuation methodologies used by the Group, 
for reasons speciﬁc to individual assets. The details of such valuation methodologies, and the inputs that are used, are given in the 
Portfolio valuation – an explanation section. Each methodology is used for a proportion of assets, by value and at year end the 
following techniques were used: 30% DCF (2015: 21%), 11% Imminent sale (2015: 7%), 10% Industry metric (2015: 10%), 18% broker 
quotes (2015: 13%) and 3% other (2015: 5%). If the value of all of the investments valued under alternative methodologies moved by 
5%, this would have an impact on the investment portfolio of £45 million (2015: £35 million) or 3% (2015: 2%). If the same sensitivity was 
applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have an impact of £9 million (2015: £6 million) or 0.3% 
(2015: 0.3%).

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 13 Carried interest and performance fees
Accounting policy:
Carried interest and performance fees receivable
The Group earns a share of proﬁts (“carried interest and performance fees receivable”) from funds which it manages on behalf 
of third parties. These proﬁts are earned when the funds meet certain performance conditions.
Carried interest and performance fees receivable include amounts receivable from Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt 
Management funds and is measured at fair value. Each scheme is separately reviewed at the balance sheet date, and an accrual for 
carried interest receivable is made once the performance conditions would be achieved if the remaining assets in that fund were 
realised at fair value. Fair value is determined using the Group’s valuation methodology and is measured at the balance sheet date. 
An accrual is made equal to the Group’s share of proﬁts in excess of the performance conditions, taking into account the cash 
already returned to fund investors and the fair value of assets remaining in the fund.
The performance fee receivable from 3iN is based on 3iN’s most recently published NAV subject to a performance hurdle and a high 
water mark. 
Carried interest and performance fees payable
The Group offers investment executives the opportunity to participate in the returns from successful investments. “Carried interest 
and performance fees payable” is the term used for amounts payable to executives on investment-related transactions and is 
measured at fair value. 
A variety of asset pooling arrangements are in place so that executives may have an interest in one or more carried interest plans. 
Carried interest payable is accrued if its performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achieved if the 
remaining assets in that plans were realised at fair value. An accrual is made equal to the executive’s share of proﬁts in excess of the 
performance conditions in place in the carried interest plan, discounted to reﬂect the likely actual cash payment date, which may be 
materially later than the time of the accrual.
The Infrastructure performance fee is accrued when the Group becomes contractually liable to make payments to the team. 
Under IFRS 10, where carried interest payable reduces the fair value of an investment entity subsidiary, that movement is recorded 
through “Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries” . At 31 March 2016, an additional £299 million of carried interest 
payable was recognised in the Statement of ﬁnancial position of these investment entity subsidiaries (2015: £142 million). As detailed 
in Note 11, the net assets of the Investment Entity subsidiaries were adjusted to reﬂect £142 million of carry payable in FY2015. No 
such adjustment was required in FY2016.

Accounting policy:
Fund management contracts, such as those acquired by the Group in connection with the acquisition of a subsidiary, are stated 
at their fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the Statement of comprehensive income, included in operating expenses, on a straight-line basis over 
the estimated useful life of the fund management contract, typically ﬁve to 10 years.
Goodwill is recognised on the acquisition of subsidiaries when the cost of acquisition exceeds the net assets acquired. Goodwill 
is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment, and is assessed annually for impairment.

Accounting policy: 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received. After initial recognition, these are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated 
future cash ﬂows through the expected life of the liabilities. Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished.

During the year, the maturity of the Company’s £350 million syndicated multi-currency facility was extended by one year to September 
2020. The Company has the option to request a further one-year extension at the second year anniversary of the facility, which may be 
granted at the discretion of each lender individually. The £350 million facility has no ﬁnancial covenants. 
All of the Group’s borrowings are repayable in one instalment on the respective maturity dates. None of the Group’s interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are secured on the assets of the Group. 
The fair value of the loans and borrowings is £967 million (2015: £997 million), determined with reference to their published market 
prices. The loans and borrowings are included in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Under AIFMD, the Group is required to calculate leverage in accordance with a set formula and disclose this to investors. In line with 
AIFMD, leverage is 116% (2015: 117%) under the gross method and 116% (2015: 120%) under the commitment method.

Accounting policy:
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation of uncertain timing or amount as a result of past events 
and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of that obligation can be made. 
The provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the amount to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and 
are discounted to present value if the effect is material. Changes in provisions are recognised in the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income for the period.

The provision for redundancy relates to staff reductions announced prior to 31 March 2016. Most of the provision is expected to be 
utilised in the next year.
The Group has a number of leasehold properties whose rent and unavoidable costs exceed the economic beneﬁts expected to be 
received. These costs arise over the period of the lease, and have been provided for to the extent they are not covered by income from 
subleases. The leases covered by the provision have a remaining term of up to four years.

Capital constraints
The Group is generally free to transfer capital from subsidiary undertakings to the parent company subject to maintaining each 
subsidiary with sufﬁcient reserves to meet local statutory/regulatory obligations. No signiﬁcant constraints have been identiﬁed 
and the Group has been able to distribute proﬁts in a tax-efﬁcient manner.
The Group’s regulated capital requirement is reviewed regularly by the Board of 3i Investments plc, an investment ﬁrm that is regulated 
by the FCA. The last submission to the FCA demonstrated a signiﬁcant consolidated capital surplus in excess of the FCA’s prudential 
rules. The Group’s capital requirement is updated regularly following approval of the Group’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP) report by the Board of 3i Investments plc. The Group complies with the Individual Capital Guidance as agreed with the 
FCA and operates with a signiﬁcant regulatory capital surplus. The Group’s Pillar 3 disclosure document can be found on www.3i.com.
22 Interests in Group entities
Accounting policy: 
The Company has controlling equity interests in, and makes loans to, both consolidated and fair valued Group entities. As an 
investment entity, these subsidiaries are all held at fair value in the Company’s accounts. The net assets of these entities are deemed 
to represent fair value. This accounting policy was updated in 2016; see Note 31 for further details.

During the year to 31 March 2016, £5 million (2015: £5 million) was recognised as an expense in the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income in respect of operating leases. There was no impact (2015: nil) on the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income in respect of subleases, as the difference between future lease and sublease obligations was already provided 
for in prior years (refer to Note 17). The total future sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases are 
£4 million (2015: £4 million).
24 Commitments
Accounting policy:
Commitments represent amounts the Group has contractually committed to pay third parties but do not yet represent a charge or 
asset. This gives an indication of committed future cash ﬂows. Commitments at the year end do not impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial 
results for the year.

not within the Group’s control, but where there is a possible obligation. Contingent liabilities are only disclosed and not included 
within the Statement of ﬁnancial position.

Contingent liabilities relating to guarantees available to third parties in respect  
of investee companies – 14 – 14
The contingent liability at 31 March 2015 related to an investee company that was sold during the current ﬁnancial year. The contingent 
liability was eliminated on the date of disposal.
Other contingent liabilities
The Company has provided a guarantee to the Trustees of the 3i Group Pension Plan in respect of liabilities of 3i plc to the Plan. 3i plc 
is the sponsor of the 3i Group Pension Plan. On 4 April 2012, the Company transferred eligible assets (£150 million of ordinary shares in 
3i Infrastructure plc) as deﬁned by the agreement to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. The Company will retain all income and 
capital rights in relation to the 3i Infrastructure plc shares, as eligible assets, unless the Company becomes insolvent or fails to comply 
with material obligations in relation to the agreement with the Trustees, all of which are under its control. The fair value of the assets 
held by this subsidiary at 31 March 2016 was £187 million (2015: £193 million).
3i has entered into warehouse arrangements in Europe and the US to support the creation of senior secured debt portfolios ahead of 
future CLO fund launches. Whilst in the warehouse phase negative mark to market movements may trigger a margin call, at which point 
3i is required to post additional capital or close the facility and crystallise market losses. The maximum additional capital that could be 
required based on the amount invested at 31 March 2016 is £17 million (2015: £15 million) and further detail can be found in Note 29.
At 31 March 2016, there was no material litigation outstanding against the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings.
26 Retirement beneﬁts
Accounting policy:
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt plans are charged to the Statement of comprehensive income as they fall due.
For deﬁned beneﬁt retirement plans, the cost of providing beneﬁts is determined using the projected unit method with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability/asset, calculated using the 
discount rate used to measure the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation, is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. Re-measurement gains or losses are recognised in full as they arise in other comprehensive income.
A retirement beneﬁt deﬁcit is recognised in the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position to the extent that the present value 
of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligations exceeds the fair value of plan assets.
A retirement beneﬁt surplus is recognised in the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position where the fair value of plan assets 
exceeds the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligations limited to the extent that the Group can beneﬁt from that surplus.
Retirement beneﬁt plans
(i) Deﬁned contribution plans
The Group operates a number of deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt plans for qualifying employees throughout the Group. The 
assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group. The employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in France are members of 
a state managed retirement beneﬁt plan operated by the country’s government. 3i Europe plc’s French branch is required to contribute 
a speciﬁc percentage of payroll costs to the retirement beneﬁt scheme to fund these beneﬁts.
The total expense recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income is £3 million (2015: £3 million), which represents 
the contributions paid to these deﬁned contribution plans. There were no outstanding payments due to these plans at the balance 
sheet date.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 26 Retirement beneﬁts continued
(ii) Deﬁned beneﬁt plans
The Group operates a ﬁnal salary deﬁned beneﬁt plan for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK (“the Plan”). The Plan is 
approved by HMRC for tax purposes and is operated separately from the Group and managed by an independent set of Trustees, 
whose appointment is determined by the Plan’s documentation. The Plan is subject to UK funding regulations, which require the 
Group and the Trustees to agree a funding strategy and contribution schedule where necessary.
Membership of the Plan has not been offered to new employees joining 3i since 1 April 2006. The Plan was closed to the future accrual 
of beneﬁts by members with effect from 5 April 2011, although the ﬁnal salary link will be maintained on existing accruals. Members of 
the Plan have been invited to join the Group’s deﬁned contribution plan with effect from 6 April 2011. The deﬁned beneﬁt plan is a 
funded scheme, the assets of which are independent of the Company’s ﬁnances and are administered by the Trustees. The Trustees 
are responsible for managing and investing the Plan’s assets and for monitoring the Plan’s funding position. As the Plan is now closed 
to future accrual, measures have been taken to de-risk the Plan through changes to its investment policy. 
The valuation of the Plan has been updated on an IAS 19 basis by an independent qualiﬁed actuary as at 31 March 2016.
Employees in Germany and Spain are entitled to a pension based on their length of service. 3i Deutschland GmbH and the German 
and Spanish branches of 3i Europe plc contribute to individual investment policies for their employees and have agreed to indemnify 
any shortfall on an employee’s investment policy should it arise. The total value of these investment policies intended to cover pension 
liabilities is £1 million (2015: £1 million) and the future liability calculated by German and Spanish actuaries is £21 million (2015: £20 million). 
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position for the year and other comprehensive income for these 
schemes are a £1 million expense (2015: £1 million expense) and a £2 million gain (2015: £7 million expense), respectively.

A retirement beneﬁt surplus is recognised in respect of the Plan on the basis that the Group is entitled to a refund of any remaining 
surplus once all beneﬁts have been settled in the expected course. The asset restriction relates to tax that would be deducted at 
source in respect of a refund of the Plan surplus.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 26 Retirement beneﬁts continued
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries and used for the purpose of the year end valuation of the Plan were as follows:
2016 2015
Discount rate 3.5% 3.3%
Expected rate of salary increases 5.7% 5.6%
Expected rate of pension increases 3.3% 3.2%
Retail Price Index (RPI) inﬂation 3.2% 3.1%
Consumer Price Index (CPI) inﬂation 2.2% 2.1%
In addition, it is assumed that members exchange 25% of pension for lump sum at retirement on the conversion terms in place at 
31 March 2016 with an allowance for the terms to increase in future. The duration of the Plan’s deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the 
accounting date was around 20 years. 
The post-retirement mortality assumption used to value the beneﬁt obligation at 31 March 2016 is 80% of the S1NA Light tables 
allowing for improvements from 2003 in line with the CMI 2012 core projections with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1.5% 
(unchanged from 31 March 2015). The life expectancy of a male member reaching age 60 in 2036 (2015: 2035) is projected to be 33.6 
(2015: 33.4) years compared to 31.3 (2015: 31.1) years for someone reaching 60 in 2016.
The sensitivity of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:
Impact on retirement beneﬁt surplus
Change in assumption 2016 2015
Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% Decrease by £10 million Decrease by £12 million
Retail Price Index (RPI) inﬂation Increase by 0.1% Decrease by £7 million Decrease by £11 million
Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Decrease by £15 million Decrease by £16 million
The above sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption whilst all others remain constant. In practice this is unlikely to occur 
and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Through its deﬁned beneﬁt plan the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most signiﬁcant of which are detailed below:
Asset volatility A fall in the value of the Plan’s assets may reduce the value of the deﬁned beneﬁt surplus and could affect the future 
funding requirements. To reduce the volatility of the Plan’s assets, the Trustees have implemented an investment strategy 
that reduces the Plan’s equity holdings by switching them to bonds over time. The Plan’s assets are also diversiﬁed across 
different asset classes.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the Plan’s IAS 19 deﬁned beneﬁt obligation. However, the Plan holds a 
proportion of its assets in corporate bonds and so any increase in the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation would be partially offset 
by an increase in the value of the Plan’s assets.
Inﬂation risk The Plan’s deﬁned beneﬁt obligations are linked to inﬂation, and higher inﬂation will lead to higher liabilities. The majority 
of the Plan’s assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inﬂation, meaning that an increase in inﬂation 
could reduce or eliminate the deﬁned beneﬁt surplus.
Life expectancy The Plan’s obligations are to provide beneﬁts for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an 
increase in the Plan’s deﬁned beneﬁt obligation.
As the Plan was closed to future accrual of beneﬁts by members with effect from 5 April 2011, the Group ceased to make regular 
contributions to the Plan in the year to 31 March 2012. The Group does not intend to make contributions in the next year.
The triennial actuarial funding valuation as at 30 June 2013 was completed in March 2014. The results of that valuation showed that the 
Plan had an actuarial surplus of £1 million at 30 June 2013 and as a result the Group was not required to make contributions to the Plan 
in respect of that valuation. The contingent asset arrangement entered into during FY2013, details of which are provided in Note 25, 
remains in place. It is expected that the next triennial actuarial funding valuation exercise will be based on the ﬁnancial position of the 
Plan as at 30 June 2016.
During the year, the Group launched a programme to offer the Plan’s members ﬂexibility in how they take their pension beneﬁts 
following the Government’s “Freedom and choice in pensions” changes announced in April 2014. This included the provision of 
independent ﬁnancial advice and a range of options for deferred and pensioner members.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 27 Share-based payments
Accounting policy: 
The Group has equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment transactions with certain employees. Equity-settled schemes 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant, which is then recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income over the period 
that employees provide services, generally the period between the start of performance period and the vesting date of the shares. 
The number of share options expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and services conditions included 
in the terms of the award will be met. 
Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate model which takes into account the exercise price of the option (if any), the current 
share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and any other relevant 
factors. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the 
price of the shares of 3i Group plc. The charge is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reﬂect the actual number of forfeitures, 
cancellations and leavers during the year. The movement in cumulative charges since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the 
Statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Liabilities arising from cash-settled share-based payment transactions are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income 
over the vesting period. They are fair valued at each reporting date. The cost of cash-settled share-based payment transactions 
is adjusted for the forfeitures of the participants’ rights that no longer meet the plan requirements as well as for early vesting.
Share-based payments are in certain circumstances made in lieu of annual cash bonuses or carried interest payments. The cost of 
the share-based payments is allocated either to operating expenses (bonuses) or carried interest depending on the original driver 
of the award. Executive Director Long-Term Incentives are allocated to operating expenses.
The total cost recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income is shown below:

3 Recognised in operating expenses and/or carried interest.
The features of the Group’s share schemes for Executive Directors are described in the Report of the Board on Directors’ remuneration 
on pages 87 and 88. To ensure that employees’ interests are aligned with shareholders, a signiﬁcant amount of variable compensation 
paid to higher earning employees is deferred into shares that vest over a number of years. For legal, regulatory or practical reasons 
certain participants may be granted “phantom awards” under these schemes, which are intended to replicate the ﬁnancial effects of 
a share award without entitling the participant to acquire shares. The carrying amount of liabilities arising from share-based payment 
transactions at 31 March 2016 is £4 million (2015: £5 million). 
For the share-based awards granted during the year, the weighted average fair value of those options at 31 March 2016 was 457 pence 
(2015: 323 pence). 
The main assumptions for the valuation of certain share-based awards with market conditions attached comprised:

28 Financial risk management
Introduction
A review of the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Risk section on pages  
27 to 35. This Note provides further detail on ﬁnancial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk section where applicable, and 
includes quantitative data on speciﬁc ﬁnancial risks.
The Group is a highly selective investor and each investment is subject to an individual risk assessment through an investment approval 
process. The Group’s Investment Committee is part of the overall risk management framework set out in the Risk section. The risk 
management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group and both the Group and the Company share the same 
ﬁnancial risks. 
Financial risks
Concentration risk
3i seeks to diversify risk through signiﬁcant dispersion of investments by geography, economic sector, asset class and size as well as 
through the maturity proﬁle of its investment portfolio. Although 3i does not set maximum limits for asset allocation, it does have a 
maximum exposure limit. This is detailed in the Investment policy on page 63 in the Corporate Governance section. Quantitative data 
regarding the concentration risk of the portfolio across geographies can be found in the Segmental analysis in Note 1 and in the 25 
large investments table on pages 146 and 147 .
Credit risk
The Group is subject to credit risk on its unquoted investments, derivatives, cash and deposits. The Group’s cash and deposits are held 
with a variety of counterparties with 86% of the Group’s surplus cash held on demand in AAA rated money market funds and 4% held in 
deposit accounts with an initial notice period of greater than 90 days. The balance is held on short-term deposit with banks with a credit 
rating of A- or higher.
The credit quality of unquoted investments, which are held at fair value and include debt and equity elements, is based on the ﬁnancial 
performance of the individual portfolio companies. The credit risk relating to these assets is based on their enterprise value and is 
reﬂected through fair value movements. Where the portfolio company has failed or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the 
Group’s policy is to record a provision for the full amount of the loan. Further detail can be found in the Price risk – market ﬂuctuations 
disclosure in this Note and the sensitivity disclosure to changes in the valuation assumptions is provided in the valuation section of 
Note 12. 
Liquidity risk
The liquidity outlook is monitored weekly by management and regularly by the Board in the context of periodic strategic reviews of the 
balance sheet. The new investment pipeline and forecast realisations are closely monitored and assessed against our vintage control 
policy. These are noted in the risk mitigation section on page 33 of the Risk section. The table on the next page analyses the maturity 
of the Group’s gross contractual liabilities.

Forward foreign exchange contracts
At 31 March 2016, there were no forward foreign exchange contracts in place (2015: Gross amount receivable and payable for foreign 
exchange contracts of £58 million; due within one year). 
The Company disclosures are the same as those for the Group with the following exceptions; carried interest and performance fees 
payable within one year is nil (2015: nil) and trade and other payables within one year is £417 million (restated 2015: £319 million).
Market risk
The valuation of the Group’s investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within 
the portfolio but the valuation and other items in the ﬁnancial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted 
market ﬂuctuations. The Group’s sensitivity to these items is set out below.
(i) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk has primarily been managed through a reduction in gross debt since 2012. The direct impact of a movement in interest 
rates is relatively small as the Group’s outstanding debt is ﬁxed rate. The sensitivities below arise principally from changes in interest 
receivable on cash and deposit. 
An increase of 100 basis points, based on the closing balance sheet position over a 12 month period, would lead to an approximate 
increase in total comprehensive income of £10 million (2015: £9 million increase) for the Group and £9 million income (2015: £8 million) 
for the Company. In addition, the Group and Company have indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the ﬁnancial 
performance and valuation of portfolio companies and valuation of debt management investments caused by interest rate ﬂuctuations. 
(ii) Currency risk
The Group’s net assets in euro, US dollar, Swedish krona, Indian rupee and all other currencies combined are shown in the table below. 
This sensitivity analysis is performed based on the sensitivity of the Group’s net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange 
rates assuming a 10% movement in exchange rates against sterling. The sensitivity of the Company to foreign exchange risk is not 
materially different from the Group.

Unconsolidated structured entities
The application of IFRS 12 requires additional disclosure on the Group’s exposure to unconsolidated structured entities. 
The Group has exposure to a number of unconsolidated structured entities as a result of its investment activities across its Private 
Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management business lines. These structured entities fall into four categories, namely CLOs, debt 
management warehouses, closed end limited partnerships (Private Equity and Infrastructure funds) and investments in certain 
portfolio investments. 
The nature, purpose and activities of these entities are detailed below along with the nature of risks associated with these entities 
and the maximum exposure to loss. 
CLO structured entities
The Group manages CLO vehicles as part of its Debt Management business. These funds predominantly invest in senior secured loans 
and are ﬁnanced by investors seeking credit rated, structured, investment returns. 
The Group manages these funds in return for a management fee. The Group also typically invests into the equity tranche of these 
funds. The Group’s attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value, fees receivable are recognised on an accruals basis and 
performance fees are accrued when relevant performance hurdles are met. 
The risk and maximum exposure to loss arising from the Group’s involvement with these entities are summarised below:

At 31 March 2015, the carrying amount of assets and maximum loss exposure of unquoted investments and fee income receivable 
was £119 million and £7 million respectively. The carrying amount of liabilities was nil.
At 31 March 2016, the total CLO assets under management were £7 .1 billion (2015: £6.5 billion). The Group earned distributions 
of £31 million (2015: £16 million) and fee income of £33 million (2015: £30 million) during the year from CLO structured entities.
Warehouse structured entities
Ahead of future CLO fund launches, warehouse facilities are usually established to support the creation of senior secured debt 
portfolios. These entities are ﬁnanced by the Group along with the bank appointed to operate the warehouse facility. The Group makes 
a commitment to the warehouse, typically taking the ﬁrst loss position and is at risk for margin calls if the portfolio underperforms. The 
Group’s attributable stakes in these warehouses are held at fair value. 
The risk and maximum exposure to loss arising from the Group’s involvement with these entities are summarised below:

carrying amount of liabilities was nil.
The Group earned interest income of £4 million (2015: £6 million) during the year from warehouse structured entities. 
Closed end limited partnerships
The Group manages a number of closed end limited partnerships, which are primarily Private Equity or Infrastructure focused, in return 
for a management fee. The purpose of these partnerships is to invest in Private Equity or Infrastructure investments for capital 
appreciation. Limited Partners, which in some cases may include the Group, ﬁnance these entities by committing capital to them 
and cash is drawn down or distributed for ﬁnancing investment activity. 
The Group’s attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value, fees receivable are recognised on an accruals basis and carried 
interest is accrued when relevant performance hurdles are met.

Investments that are structured entities
The Group makes investments on behalf of itself and third-party funds that it manages, for capital appreciation purposes. In a small 
number of cases, these investments fall under the classiﬁcation of a structured entity as they are funds managed by the General Partner 
under a limited partnership agreement. 
The Group’s attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value.

The Group recognised an unrealised movement of nil (2015: £1 million loss) from investments that are structured entities.
Regulatory information relating to fees:
Under AIFMD, 3i Investments plc acts as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”) to 3i Group plc. In performing the activities 
and functions of the AIFM, the AIFM or another 3i company may pay or receive fees, commissions or non-monetary beneﬁts to or from 
third parties of the following nature:
 – Transaction fees: 3i companies receive monitoring and Directors’ fees from portfolio companies. The amount is agreed with the 
portfolio company at the time of the investment but may be re-negotiated. Where applicable, 3i may also receive fees on the 
completion of transactions such as acquisitions, reﬁnancings or syndications either from the portfolio company or a co-investor. 
Transaction fees paid to 3i are included in portfolio income.
 – Payments for third-party services: 3i companies may retain the services of third-party consultants; for example, for an independent 
director or other investment management specialist expertise. The amount paid varies in accordance with the nature of the service 
and the length of the service period and is usually, but not always, paid/reimbursed by the portfolio companies. The payment may 
involve a ﬂat fee, retainer or success fee. Such payments, where borne by 3i companies, are usually included in portfolio income. 
 – Payments for services from 3i companies: One 3i company may provide investment advisory services to another 3i company and 
receive payment for such service.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 30 Subsidiaries and related undertakings
IFRS 10 has reduced the requirements for an entity to be classiﬁed as an accounting subsidiary and deems wider control, as opposed to 
equity ownership, as the key determinant when identifying accounting subsidiaries. Under IFRS 10, if the Group is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the 
investee, then it has control and hence the investee is deemed an accounting subsidiary. This is inconsistent with the UK Companies 
Act where voting rights are the key determinant when identifying accounting subsidiaries, with a larger than 50% holding of voting 
rights resulting in an entity being classiﬁed as a subsidiary. 
In addition, under the application of IFRS 10, 30 of the portfolio investments are considered to be accounting subsidiaries. As per the

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 31 Company – Restatement of prior period information
During the year, the Company changed the accounting treatment for its Employee Share Option Trust (“ESOT”) and reviewed the  
IFRS 10 accounting policy for its interests in Group entities and restated comparative information where relevant. These adjustments 
had no impact on the Group reported results. 
Management reviewed the accounting for its ESOT and concluded that it would be better reﬂected as a branch of the Company rather 
than as an independent subsidiary. The impact of this change on the Company statement of ﬁnancial position was to decrease interests 
in Group entities by £5 million (2015: £5 million, 2014: £80 million) and decrease Treasury shares by £54 million (2015: £79 million, 
2014: £89 million) and increase capital reserves by £49 million (2015: £74 million, 2014: £9 million).
Separately management reviewed the interests in Group entities in the Company’s ﬁnancial statements. These entities were previously 
held at cost or accounted for directly in the Company’s ﬁnancial statements. For these entities held at cost, an amount has been 
reclassiﬁed from other current assets to Interests in Group entities. In addition, some of these entities are now held at fair value in 
accordance with IFRS 10 and IAS 27 . 
For those entities that were accounted for directly within the Company’s ﬁnancial statements, the impact on the Company statement 
of ﬁnancial position of this revision, by signiﬁcant line item, is to reduce quoted equity investments by £56 million (2015: £65 million, 
2014: £16 million), unquoted equity investments by £42 million (2015: £81 million, 2014: £117 million), cash and cash equivalents by nil 
(2015: nil, 2014: £1 million), and increase interests in Group entities by £99 million (2015: £43 million, 2014: £50 million) and equity by 
£99 million (2015: £34 million decrease, 2014: £21 million). 
For those entities that were held at cost, the impact on the Company statement of ﬁnancial position of this revision, by signiﬁcant line 
item, is to increase interests in Group entities by £243 million (2015: £802 million, 2014: £429 million), reduce other current assets by 
£343 million (2015: £329 million, 2014: £290 million) and increase the capital reserve within equity by £243 million (2015: £455 million, 
2014: £33 million). The impact of these restatements is presented on a line by line basis below:

Overview of our audit approach
Areas of audit focus The following risks had the greatest effect on our overall strategy, on the allocation of resources on the audit, and on 
directing the efforts of the audit team. 
 – Incorrect valuation of unquoted proprietary investments and resulting impact on the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
 – Incorrect calculation of carried interest and resulting impact on the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income.
 – Incorrect recognition of portfolio income and realised proﬁts on disposal of investments.
The ﬁrst two areas of focus are considered to be signiﬁcant risks, consistent with the 2015 audit strategy.
Audit scope – The Group is principally managed from one location in London. All core functions, including ﬁnance and operations, 
are located in London. The Group operates nine international ofﬁces which are primarily responsible for deal 
origination and investment portfolio monitoring. 
 – The Group comprises 69 consolidated subsidiaries and 43 investment entity subsidiaries. Monitoring and control 
over the operations of these subsidiaries, including those located overseas, is centralised in London. 
 – The UK audit team audited all items material to the Group ﬁnancial statements.
 – Our audit tested 99% of the investment portfolio and 96% of carried interest accruals.
Materiality – Overall Group materiality of £44m (2015: £38m) which represents 1% of net assets.
 – Any audit differences in excess of £2m (2015: £1.9m) are reported to the Audit and Compliance Committee. 
What has changed – The incorrect recognition of portfolio income and realised proﬁts on disposal of investments is included as an area of 
audit focus. We have included this risk in 2016 as a number of the Group‘s investments have been realised or 
re-ﬁnanced during the period.

Independent Auditor’s report to  
the members of 3i Group plc Our assessment of areas of audit focus 
We identiﬁed the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed the 
procedures below which were designed in the context of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any 
opinion on these individual areas.
Area of audit focus Our response to the area of audit focus
Group and parent company risk
Incorrect valuation of unquoted proprietary investments 
and resulting impact on the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income 
Refer to the Audit and Compliance Committee report 
(pages 75 to 78); Signiﬁcant accounting policies (pages 100 
to 102); and Notes 10, 11 and 12 of the ﬁnancial statements 
(pages 110 to 114)
The proprietary investment portfolio comprises a number 
of unquoted securities. In the consolidated statement of 
ﬁnancial position these are shown both as Investments 
(which are held directly by consolidated subsidiaries of the 
Group), and as Investments in investment entities (which are 
typically limited partnerships and other holding structures). 
The Group adopts a valuation methodology based on the 
International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation 
2012 (‘IPEV’) guidelines, in conformity with IFRS 13. Owing 
to the unquoted and illiquid nature of these investments, 
the assessment of fair valuation is subjective and requires a 
number of signiﬁcant and complex judgements to be made 
by management. The exit value will be determined by the 
market at the time of realisation and therefore despite the 
valuation policy adopted and judgements made by 
management, the ﬁnal sales value may differ materially 
from the valuation. 
There is the risk that inaccurate judgements made in the 
assessment of fair value, in particular in respect of; earnings 
multiples, the application of liquidity discounts, calculation 
of discount rates and the estimation of future maintainable 
earnings, could lead to the incorrect valuation of the 
unquoted proprietary investment portfolio. In turn, this 
could materially misstate the value of the Investment 
portfolio in the Statement of ﬁnancial position, the Gross 
investment return and Total return in the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income and the Net asset 
value per share.
There is also the risk that management may inﬂuence the 
signiﬁcant judgements and estimations in respect of 
unquoted proprietary investment valuations in order to 
meet market expectations of the overall Net asset value of 
the Group. 
Monitoring and control of the valuation process is exercised centrally by management in 
London and therefore we have reﬂected this in our audit strategy whereby the London 
based team perform all audit procedures. Our procedures extended to testing 99% of 
the related amount.
We obtained an understanding of management’s processes and controls determining 
the fair valuation of unquoted proprietary investments. This included discussing with 
management the valuation governance structure and protocols around their oversight 
of the valuation process and corroborating our understanding by attending Valuations 
Committee meetings. We identiﬁed key controls in the process, assessed design 
adequacy and tested operating effectiveness of those controls. This enabled us to rely 
on controls over portfolio company and comparable company data used in the valuation 
of unquoted investments.
We compared management’s valuation methodology to IFRS and the IPEV guidelines. 
We sought explanations from management where there were judgements applied in 
their application of the guidelines, and discussed their appropriateness. 
With the assistance of our valuations specialists, we formed an independent range of 
the key assumptions used in the valuation of a sample of unquoted investments within 
both the private equity and debt management business lines, with reference to relevant 
industry and market valuation considerations. We compared these ranges with 
management’s assumptions, and discussed our results with both management and the 
Valuations Committee. 
With respect to unquoted investments in the private equity business line, on a sample 
basis we corroborated key inputs in the valuation models, such as earnings and net debt 
to source data. We also performed the following procedures on key judgements made 
by management in the calculation of fair value:
 – Assessed the suitability of the comparable companies used in the calculation of the 
earnings multiples;
 – Challenged management on the application of liquidity discounts to earnings 
multiples, obtaining rationale and supporting evidence for adjustments made; 
 – Performed corroborative calculations to assess the appropriateness of discount 
rates; and
 – Discussed the adjustments made to calculate future maintainable earnings and 
corroborated this to supporting documentation. 
We veriﬁed the valuation of unquoted investments in the debt management business 
line to broker quotes and other data from third party pricing sources used by 
management in the calculation of fair value. 
We checked the mathematical accuracy of the valuation models on a sample basis. 
We recalculated the unrealised proﬁts on the revaluation of investments impacting 
the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
We discussed and understood the rationale for any differences between the exit prices 
of investments realised during the year and the prior year fair value, to further verify the 
reasonableness of the current year valuation models and methodology adopted by 
management.
What we concluded to the Audit and Compliance Committee:
The valuation of the unquoted proprietary investment portfolio is considered appropriate and within an acceptable range of fair value. All valuations 
tested have been measured and recognised in accordance with IFRS and the IPEV guidelines. Appropriate inputs to the valuations were used and we 
identiﬁed no signiﬁcant differences between the valuations calculated by management and the results of our testing. Based on our procedures 
performed we had no matters to report to the Audit and Compliance Committee.

Incorrect calculation of carried interest and resulting

Refer to the Audit and Compliance Committee report (page

(pages 111 and 115)
Carried interest receivable is an accrual of the share of the 
proﬁts from funds managed by the Group on behalf of third 
parties. Carried interest payable is an accrual of amounts 
payable to investment executives in respect of the returns 
on successful investments. Carried interest payable is only 
paid on realisation of investments. 
Carried interest receivable and payable is calculated as a 
percentage of the proﬁts that would be achieved, if the 
investments within each fund or scheme were realised at 
fair value, subject to the relevant hurdle rates or 
performance conditions being met. 
Judgement is required in determining the fair value of the 
investment portfolio (as described in the preceding risk 
section) and therefore, whether hurdles or performance 
conditions have been achieved. 
There are multiple carried interest arrangements which 
have been structured over multiple periods, include 
different pools of investments and investment executives 
may participate in more than one scheme. The process of 
calculating carried interest receivable and payable relies on 
manual calculations. 
Due to the complexities inherent in the arrangements and 
the manual nature of the recognition process, there is a risk 
that the carried interest calculations are incorrectly 
calculated or recognised in the wrong period. 
Monitoring and control of the carried interest process is exercised centrally by 
management in London and therefore we have reﬂected this in our audit strategy 
whereby the London based team perform all audit procedures. Our procedures 
extended to testing 96% of the related amount.
We obtained an understanding of management’s processes and controls for the 
calculation of carried interest by performing walkthrough procedures and discussing 
with management the governance structure and protocols around their oversight of the 
carried interest arrangements. Given the manual nature of the calculation, although 
controls were deemed to be designed effectively, we adopted a substantive approach 
to our testing.
We agreed a sample of calculation methodologies to their respective terms and 
conditions set out in the underlying agreements. 
Our audit procedures on the fair value of the underlying investments are stated in the 
above section. We performed analytical procedures comparing the performance of the 
reference investments in each fund/scheme, taking into account the investment 
realisations, to the related accruals in the ﬁnancial statements. 
On a sample basis we:
 – Recalculated the returns on the fund/scheme to test that hurdles/performance 
conditions had been met where carried interest was being accrued;
 – Recalculated the carried interest accruals for mathematical accuracy and agreed the 
investment fair values to our audit work on the fair value of the investment portfolio, 
the fee rates to the relevant agreements and realised gains to our audit work on 
realised proﬁts;
 – Determined the reasonableness of investment exit dates with reference to our audit 
work on the fair value of the investment portfolio, and our understanding of the life 
cycle of the relevant investments, and then compared this with the anticipated 
payment dates used to discount the carried interest accrual; and
 – Veriﬁed the resulting cash ﬂows to award letters sent to investment executives and 
bank statement payments.
What we concluded to the Audit and Compliance Committee:
Our year-end audit procedures did not identify any matters regarding the recognition of carried interest in accordance with IFRS. All calculations 
tested have been performed in accordance with contractual terms. Based on our procedures performed we had no matters to report to the Audit 
and Compliance Committee.

Incorrect recognition of portfolio income and realised 
proﬁts on disposal of investments 
Refer to the Audit and Compliance Committee report 
(pages 75 to 78); Signiﬁcant accounting policies (pages 100 
to 102); and Notes 2 and 11 of the ﬁnancial statements 
(pages 105 and 111)
Realised proﬁts originate from disposals of investments. 
Realised proﬁts are calculated as the difference between 
the net proceeds and the investment’s fair value at the 
beginning of the year.
Portfolio income is directly attributable to the return from 
investments. This includes: dividends from investee 
companies; income from the most junior ranked level of 
CLO investments; and income from loans and receivables.
In general, the calculations are non-complex. However, 
there is the risk that investment disposals may be 
recognised before the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of 
ownership have been transferred to the buyer. In addition, 
the calculation of portfolio income includes manual 
interventions. 
Monitoring and control of the portfolio income and realised proﬁts on disposal of 
investments is exercised centrally by management in London and therefore we have 
reﬂected this in our audit strategy whereby the London based team perform all audit 
procedures. Our procedures extended to testing 77% of the related amount.
We conﬁrmed our understanding of the processes and controls around accounting for 
portfolio income and realised gains by performing walkthroughs of the material 
processes. We identiﬁed key controls in the process, assessed design adequacy and 
tested operating effectiveness of those controls.
We performed detailed testing on a sample of portfolio income transactions to conﬁrm 
whether they had been appropriately recorded in the income statement. Our tests 
involved:
 – Agreeing dividends and income from the most junior ranked level of CLO capital to 
third party support; and
 – Recalculating interest income based on the terms of the underlying agreements. 
For realised gains, on a sample basis, we:
 – Analysed the contract and terms of the sale to determine whether the Group had met 
the stipulated requirements, conﬁrming that the net proceeds and therefore the 
realised proﬁt over opening value could be reliably measured; and
 – Re-performed management’s calculations to determine mathematical accuracy and 
conﬁrmed the collection of the net proceeds by agreeing the cash receipt to bank 
statements.
What we concluded to the Audit and Compliance Committee:
Our year-end audit procedures did not identify any matters regarding the recognition of realised proﬁts on disposal of investments and portfolio 
income. All transactions tested have been recognised in accordance with contractual terms and IFRS. Based on our procedures performed we had 
no matters to report to the Audit and Compliance Committee.
The scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for 
each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
We take into account the size, risk proﬁle, the organisation of the group and the effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the 
business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the nature, timing and extent of the audit 
work to be performed at each entity.
The investment portfolio balance is the most signiﬁcant part of the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position. Monitoring and 
control over the valuation of investments is exercised by management centrally in London, and as such is audited wholly by the UK 
based audit team. Monitoring and control over the operations of the other subsidiaries within the Group, including those located 
overseas, is centralised in London. In all locations where the Group has operations, the UK based audit team audited all items material 
to the Group ﬁnancial statements. 
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identiﬁed misstatements on the 
audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
Materiality is deﬁned as the magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be 
expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of the users of the ﬁnancial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the 
nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £44m (2015: £38m), which is 1% (2015: 1%) of net assets. We believe that net assets 
provides us with a consistent year on year basis for determining materiality, and is the most relevant performance measure to the 
stakeholders of the entity.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 Performance materiality
Performance materiality is the application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an 
appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, we set performance 
materiality at 50% (2015: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely £22m (2015: £19m). This is at the lower end of a range of 50% to 75%. In 
arriving at 50%, we considered the judgemental nature of the valuations in the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position, the relative 
value of transactions recorded in the other primary statements, and to ensure that total uncorrected and undetected audit differences 
in all accounts did not exceed our materiality of £44m.
Reporting threshold
Our reporting threshold is deﬁned as an amount below which identiﬁed misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit and Compliance Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £2m 
(2015: £1.9m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting 
on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the Annual 
Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on pages 65 to 66, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 – the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Corporate Governance Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.

or Liquidity of the Entity
ISAs (UK and Ireland)  
reporting
We are required to give a statement as to whether we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in 
relation to:
 – the directors’ conﬁrmation in the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 – the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
 – the directors’ statement in the ﬁnancial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identiﬁcation of any material uncertainties to the entity’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the ﬁnancial 
statements; and
 – the directors’ explanation in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualiﬁcations or assumptions.
Conclusion
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to in respect of the above.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 The 25 investments listed below account for 79% of the portfolio at 31 March 2016 (2015: 81%). This table does not include two 
investments that have been excluded for commercial reasons. For each of our investments we have assessed whether they classify as 
accounting subsidiaries under IFRS and/or subsidiaries under the UK Companies Act. This assessment forms the basis of our disclosure 
of accounting subsidiaries in the ﬁnancial statements. 
The UK Companies Act deﬁnes a subsidiary based on voting rights, with a greater than 50% majority of voting rights resulting in an 
entity being classiﬁed as a subsidiary. IFRS 10 applies a wider test and, if a Group is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee then it has control, and 
hence the investee is deemed an accounting subsidiary. Accounting subsidiaries under IFRS 10 within the 25 large investments below 
are noted. None of these investments are UK Companies Act subsidiaries. 
In accordance with Section 29 of the Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive (“AIFMD”), 3i Investments plc, as AIFM, 
encourages all controlled portfolio companies to make available to employees and investors an Annual report which meets the 
disclosure requirements of the Directive. These are available either on the portfolio company’s website or through ﬁling with the 
relevant local authorities.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 Policy
The valuation policy is the responsibility of the Board, with 
additional oversight and annual review from the Valuations 
Committee. Our policy is to value 3i’s investment portfolio 
at fair value and we achieve this by valuing investments on an 
appropriate basis, applying a consistent approach across the 
portfolio. The policy ensures that the portfolio valuation is 
compliant with the fair value guidelines under IFRS and,  
in so doing, is also compliant with the guidelines issued by the 
International Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation board 
(the “IPEV guidelines”). The policy covers the Group’s Private 
Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management investment 
valuations. Valuations of the investment portfolio of the Group 
and its subsidiaries are performed at each quarter end.
Fair value is the underlying principle and is deﬁned as “the price 
that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date” (IPEV 
guidelines, December 2012). Fair value is therefore an estimate and, 
as such, determining fair value requires the use of judgement.
The quoted assets in our portfolio are valued at their closing bid 
price at the balance sheet date. The majority of the portfolio, 
however, is represented by unquoted investments. 
Private equity unquoted valuation
To arrive at the fair value of the Group’s unquoted Private Equity 
investments, we ﬁrst estimate the entire value of the company we 
have invested in – the enterprise value. We then apportion that 
enterprise value between 3i, other shareholders and lenders.
Determining enterprise value
The enterprise value is determined using one of a selection 
of methodologies depending on the nature, facts and 
circumstances of the investment.
Where possible, we use methodologies which draw heavily 
on observable market prices, whether listed equity markets 
or reported merger and acquisition transactions, and trading 
updates from our portfolio.
As unquoted investments are not traded on an active market, 
the Group adjusts the estimated enterprise value by a liquidity 
discount. The liquidity discount is applied to the total enterprise 
value and we apply a higher discount rate for investments where 
there are material restrictions on our ability to sell at a time of 
our choosing.
The table opposite outlines in more detail the range of valuation 
methodologies available to us, as well as the inputs 
and  adjustments necessary for each.
Apportioning the enterprise value between 3i, other 
shareholders and lenders
Once we have estimated the enterprise value, the following steps 
are taken:
1.  We subtract the value of any claims, net of free cash balances, 
that are more senior to the most senior of our investments.
2.  The resulting attributable enterprise value is apportioned to 
the Group’s investment, and equal ranking investments by 
other parties, according to contractual terms and conditions, 
to arrive at a fair value of the entirety of the investment. 
The value is then distributed amongst the different loan, 
equity and other ﬁnancial instruments accordingly.
3.  If the value attributed to a speciﬁc shareholder loan investment 
in a company is less than its carrying value, a shortfall is 
implied, which is recognised in our valuation. In exceptional 
cases, we may judge that the shortfall is temporary; to 
recognise the shortfall in such a scenario would lead to 
unrepresentative volatility and hence we may choose not 
to recognise the shortfall.
Other factors
In applying this framework, there are additional considerations 
that are factored into the valuation of some assets.
Impacts from structuring
Structural rights are instruments convertible into equity or cash 
at speciﬁc points in time or linked to speciﬁc events. For example, 
where a majority shareholder chooses to sell, and we have a 
minority interest, we may have the right to a minimum return 
on our investment.
Debt instruments, in particular, may have structural rights. In the 
valuation, it is assumed third parties, such as lenders or holders 
of convertible instruments, fully exercise any structural rights they 
might have if they are “in the money” , and that the value to the 
Group may therefore be reduced by such rights held by third 
parties. The Group’s own structural rights are valued on the basis 
they are exercisable on the reporting date.
Assets classiﬁed as “terminal”
If we believe an investment has more than a 50% probability of 
failing in the 12 months following the valuation date, we value the 
investment on the basis of its expected recoverable amount in 
the event of failure. It is important to distinguish between our 
investment failing and the business failing; the failure of our 
investment does not always mean that the business has failed, 
just that our recoverable value has dropped signiﬁcantly. This 
would generally result in the equity and loan components of our 
investment being valued at nil. Value movements in the period 
relating to investments classiﬁed as terminal are classiﬁed as 
provisions in our value movement analysis.
Infrastructure unquoted valuation
The primary valuation methodology used for infrastructure 
investments is the discounted cash ﬂow method (“DCF”). Fair 
value is estimated by deriving the present value of the investment 
using reasonable assumptions of expected future cash ﬂows and 
the terminal value and date, and the appropriate risk-adjusted 
discount rate that quantiﬁes the risk inherent to the investment. 
The discount rate is estimated with reference to the market 
risk-free rate, a risk adjusted premium and information speciﬁc 
to the investment or market sector.
Debt management valuation
The Group’s Debt Management business line typically invests in 
traded debt instruments and the subordinated notes that it is 
required to hold in the debt funds which it manages. The traded 
debt instruments and the subordinated notes are valued using 
a range of data including broker quotes if available, 3i internal 
forecasts and discounted cash ﬂow models, trading data where 
available, and data from third-party valuation providers. Broker 
quotes and trading data for more liquid holdings are preferred.

where relevant, with 
similar characteristics
Earnings multiples are applied to the earnings of the 
Company to determine the enterprise value
Earnings
Reported earnings adjusted for non-recurring items, 
such as restructuring expenses, for signiﬁcant corporate 
actions and, in exceptional cases, run-rate adjustments 
to arrive at maintainable earnings
Most common measure is earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)
Earnings used are usually the management accounts 
for the 12 months to the quarter end preceding the 
reporting period, unless data from forecasts or the 
latest audited accounts provides a more reliable picture 
of maintainable earnings
Earnings multiples
The earnings multiple is derived from comparable listed 
companies or relevant market transaction multiples
We select companies in the same industry and, where 
possible, with a similar business model and proﬁle in 
terms of size, products, services and customers, growth 
rates and geographic focus
We adjust for relative performance in the set of 
comparables, exit expectations and other company

A liquidity discount is 
applied to the enterprise

For a small proportion of our smaller investments (less than 1% of the portfolio value), the valuation is determined by a more mechanical 
approach using information from the latest audited accounts. Equity shares are valued at the higher of an earnings or net assets 
methodology. Fixed income shares and loan investments are measured using amortised cost and any implied impairment, in line with IFRS.
Consistent with IPEV guidelines, all equity investments are held at fair value using the most appropriate methodology and no 
investments are held at historical cost.

Information for shareholders Boiler room and other scams
In the past, some of our shareholders have received unsolicited 
telephone calls or correspondence concerning investment 
matters from organisations or persons claiming or implying 
that they have some connection with the Company. These are 
typically from overseas based “brokers” who target UK 
shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be 
worthless or high risk shares in UK or overseas investments. 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free reports 
into the Company. These approaches are operated out of what 
is more commonly known as a “boiler room” . You may also be 
approached by brokers offering to purchase your shares for an 
upfront payment in the form of a broker fee, tax payment or 
de-restriction fee. This is a common secondary scam operated 
by the boiler rooms.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
 – Always ensure the ﬁrm is on the Financial Conduct Authority 
(“FCA”) Register and is allowed to give ﬁnancial advice before 
handing over your money. You can check at www.fca.org.uk/
register;
 – Double-check the caller is from the ﬁrm they say they are – ask 
for their name and telephone number and say you will call them 
back. Check their identity by calling the ﬁrm using the contact 
number listed on the FCA Register. This is important as there 
have been instances where an authorised ﬁrm’s website has 
been cloned but with a few subtle changes, such as a different 
phone number or false email address;
 – Check the FCA’s list of known unauthorised overseas ﬁrms. 
However, these ﬁrms change their name regularly, so even 
if a ﬁrm is not listed it does not mean they are legitimate. 
Always check that they are listed on the FCA Register; and
 – If you have any doubts, call the Financial Conduct Authority 
Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768. If you deal with an 
unauthorised ﬁrm, you will not be eligible to receive payment 
under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 Alternative Investment Funds (“AIFs”) At 31 March 2016, 3i 
Investments plc as AIFM, managed ﬁve AIFs. These were 3i Group 
plc, 3i Growth Capital Fund, 3i Eurofund V, 3i Global Income Fund 
and the European Middle Market Loan Fund. 
Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) 
became effective from July 2013. As a result, at 31 March 2016, 
3i Investments plc is registered as an Alternative Investment Fund 
Manager (“AIFM”), which in turn manages ﬁve AIFs. 
Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”) is the regulated 
manager of AIFs. Within 3i, this is 3i Investments plc.
Approved Investment Trust Company This is a particular UK tax 
status maintained by 3i Group plc, the parent company of 3i 
Group. An approved investment trust company is a UK company 
which meets certain conditions set out in the UK tax rules which 
include a requirement for the company to undertake portfolio 
investment activity that aims to spread investment risk and for 
the company’s shares to be listed on an approved exchange. 
The “approved” status for an investment trust must be agreed by 
the UK tax authorities and its beneﬁt is that certain proﬁts of the 
company, principally its capital proﬁts, are not taxable in the UK. 
Assets under management (“AUM”) A measure of the total 
assets that 3i has to invest or manages on behalf of shareholders 
and third-party investors for which it receives a fee.
Barclays Infrastructure Fund Management business (“BIFM”) 
Acquired by 3i in November 2013 when it managed two active 
unlisted funds that invest in UK and European PPP and energy 
projects, with assets under management of over £700 million. 
Base Erosion and Proﬁt Shifting (“BEPS”) Project is an OECD 
initiative that was launched in 2013, at the request of the G20 
countries, to develop speciﬁc, detailed proposals, rules and 
instruments required to equip governments and tax authorities to 
address the BEPS challenge and the proposals were delivered to 
and approved by the G20 leaders in November 2015. Countries 
are now in the process of considering and implementing changes 
to their domestic tax laws and international tax treaties to give 
effect to the recommendations made by the BEPS project team. 
Board The Board of Directors of the Company.
Capital redemption reserve is established in respect of the 
redemption of the Company’s ordinary shares.
Capital reserve The capital reserve recognises all proﬁts that 
are capital in nature or have been allocated to capital. Following 
changes to the Companies Act, the Company amended its 
Articles of Association at the 2012 Annual General Meeting to 
allow these proﬁts to be distributable by way of a dividend.
Carried interest is accrued on the realised and unrealised 
proﬁts generated taking relevant performance hurdles into 
consideration, assuming all investments were realised at the 
prevailing book value. Carried interest is only actually paid or 
received when the relevant performance hurdles are met and 
the accrual is discounted to reﬂect expected payment periods. 
Carried interest receivable is generated on third-party capital 
over the life of the relevant fund when relevant performance 
criteria are met. 
We pay carried interest to our investment teams on proprietary 
capital invested and share a proportion of carried interest 
receivable from third-party funds. This total carried interest 
payable is provided historically by reference to two or three-year 
vintages to maximise ﬂexibility in resource planning.
“CLO” – Collateralised Loan Obligation A form of securitisation 
where payments from multiple loans are pooled together and 
passed on to different classes of owners in various tranches.
Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) imposes obligations 
on ﬁnancial groups and entities to identify and report details, 
relating to the foreign investors investing in such groups and 
entities, to the local tax authority who then exchanges the 
information with the other relevant tax authorities.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016
Portfolio and other information
Glossary Company 3i Group plc.
Country by Country reporting (“CbC Reporting”) refers to a 
requirement for large multinational groups, operating in different 
countries, to ﬁle an annual report detailing certain information 
about the activities of the entities in the Group, on a country by 
country basis, covering the countries in which the Group entities 
operate. This new requirement will apply to the Group for its 
accounting periods beginning after 1 April 2016.
Discounting The reduction in present value at a given date of 
a future cash transaction at an assumed rate, using a discount 
factor reﬂecting the time value of money. 
Dividend income from equity investments and CLO capital is 
recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income when the 
shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
(“EBITDA”) EBITDA is deﬁned as earnings before interest, 
taxation, depreciation and amortisation and is used as the typical 
measure of portfolio company performance.
EBITDA multiple Calculated as the enterprise value over EBITDA, 
it is used to determine the value of a company.
Executive Committee The Executive Committee is responsible 
for the day-to-day running of the Group and comprises: the Chief 
Executive, Group Finance Director, the Managing Partners of the 
Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management businesses 
and the Group’s General Counsel.
Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries The 
movement in the carrying value of Group subsidiaries, classiﬁed 
as investment entities under IFRS 10, between the start and end 
of the accounting period converted into sterling using the 
exchange rates at the date of the movement. 
Fair value through proﬁt or loss (“FVTPL ”) is an IFRS measurement 
basis permitted for assets and liabilities which meet certain criteria. 
Gains and losses on assets and liabilities measured as FVTPL are 
recognised directly in the Statement of comprehensive income.
Fee income is earned directly from investee companies when an 
investment is ﬁrst made and through the life of the investment. 
Fees that are earned on a ﬁnancing arrangement are considered 
to relate to a ﬁnancial asset measured at fair value through proﬁt 
or loss and are recognised when that investment is made. Fees 
that are earned on the basis of providing an ongoing service to 
the investee company are recognised as that service is provided. 
Fees receivable from external funds are fees received by the 
Group, from third parties, for the management of private equity, 
infrastructure and debt management funds. 
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) is US tax 
legislation aimed at preventing offshore tax avoidance by US 
persons. The rules impose obligations on non-US ﬁnancial groups 
and entities to identify and report details relating to US investors 
who have invested in those groups and entities.
Foreign exchange on investments arises on investments made 
in currencies that are different from the functional currency of the 
Group entity. Investments are translated at the exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. At each subsequent 
reporting date investments are translated to sterling at the 
exchange rate ruling at that date. 
Fund Management A segment of the business focused on 
generating proﬁts from the management of private equity, 
infrastructure and debt management funds.
Fund Management Operating proﬁt comprises fee income 
from third parties as well as a synthetic fee received from the 
Proprietary Capital business less operating expenses incurred 
by the Fund Management business.
Gross investment return (“GIR”) includes proﬁt and loss on 
realisations, increases and decreases in the value of the 
investments we hold at the end of a period, any income received 
from the investments such as interest, dividends and fee income 
and foreign exchange movements. GIR is measured as a 
percentage of the opening portfolio value and is the principal 
tool for assessing our Proprietary Capital business.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 Income from loans and receivables is recognised as it accrues. 
When the fair value of an investment is assessed to be below the 
principal value of a loan the Group recognises a provision against 
any interest accrued from the date of the assessment going 
forward until the investment is assessed to have recovered 
in value.
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) are 
accounting standards issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (“IASB”). The Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements are required to be prepared in accordance with IFRS. 
Investment basis Accounts prepared assuming that IFRS 10 had 
not been introduced. Under this basis, we fair value portfolio 
companies at the level we believe provides the most 
comprehensive ﬁnancial information. 
The commentary in the Strategic report refers to this basis 
as we believe it provides a more understandable view of our 
performance.
Key Performance Indicators (“KPI”) is a measure by reference 
to which the development, performance or position of the Group 
can be measured effectively.
Money multiple is calculated as the cumulative distributions plus 
any residual value divided by paid-in capital.
Net asset value (“NAV”) is a measure of the fair value of our 
proprietary investments and the net costs of operating the 
business. 
Operating cash proﬁt Deﬁned as the difference between our 
cash income (cash fees from managing third-party funds and cash 
income from our proprietary capital portfolio) and our operating 
expenses, excluding restructuring costs.
Operating proﬁt Includes gross investment return, management 
fee income generated from managing external funds, the costs of 
running our business, net interest payable, movements in the fair 
value of derivatives, other losses and carried interest. 
Portfolio income is that which is directly related to the return from 
individual investments. It is recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that there will be economic beneﬁt and the income can 
be reliably measured. It is comprised of dividend income, income 
from loans and receivables and fee income. 
Proprietary Capital A segment of the business focused on 
generating proﬁts from shareholders’ capital which is available 
to invest. 
Proprietary Capital operating proﬁt Comprises gross investment 
return, operating expenses, a fee paid to the Fund Management 
business and balance sheet funding expenses such as interest 
payable.

private business venture which is funded and operated through 
a partnership of government and one or more private sector 
companies.

investments The difference between the fair value of the 
consideration received, less any directly attributable costs, on the 
sale of equity and the repayment of loans and receivables and its 
carrying value at the start of the accounting period, converted 
into sterling using the exchange rates at the date of disposal.
Revenue reserve recognises all proﬁts that are revenue in nature 
or have been allocated to revenue.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a 
manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 
Chief Executive who is considered to be the Group’s chief 
operating decision maker. All transactions between business 
segments are conducted on an arm’s length basis, with intra-
segment revenue and costs being eliminated on consolidation. 
Income and expenses directly associated with each segment 
are included in determining business segment performance.

amounts in retained earnings in respect of share-based 
payments.

from the translation of the ﬁnancial statements of international

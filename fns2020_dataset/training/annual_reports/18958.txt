Dividend
As a result of the growth in underlying 
Group profitability and the Board’s positive 
view of future prospects for the business, 
an increase in the final dividend of 3.6% to 
8.6 pence per share (2014: 8.3 pence per 
share) will be proposed to Shareholders at 
the forthcoming AGM, increasing the total 
dividend for 2015 by 2.4% to 12.6 pence 
per share (2014: 12.3 pence per 
share). The proposed dividend 
payment is at the upper end 
of our previously stated 
policy of applying a dividend 
payout ratio of between 
30% to 40% of Group 
Underlying Operating Profit 
after interest and tax and 
reflects our confidence in 
the future.

Introduction
In my first year as Chairman, I am 
pleased to report the continued progress 
of the Group with record financial results 
posted in 2015. Group Underlying 
Operating Profit
1
 of £42.9m (2014: £42.0m) 
was higher than LSL achieved in the 
property market peak of 2007. Group 
revenue grew by 4.6% to £300.6m (2014: 
£287.5m) and profit before tax grew by 
20.8% to £38.6m (2014: £31.9m).
Performance
After a slower first half in the Estate Agency 
Division, reflecting the overall market,  
we continued to execute on our strategy, 
delivering a strong second half. As a result, 
in 2015 we delivered full year growth of 12% 
in the counter-cyclical Lettings business, 
Financial Services revenue growth of 16% 
and revenue growth in Marsh & Parsons 
of 9% against a challenging prime Central 
London market.
The Surveying Division delivered an 
excellent performance with 3% revenue

Audit Committees in May and September 
respectively and Adam Castleton as Group 
Chief Financial Officer in November.

appointment as Regional President, Europe 
at Reed Exhibitions which is part of RELX 
Group plc.
Adam Castleton joined LSL from French 
Connection Group PLC. He previously held 
leadership roles at a number of market 
leading companies, including O2 UK, eBay 
and The Walt Disney Company. Adam has 
over 24 years’ experience in finance, having 
started his career with Price Waterhouse 
where he qualified as a Chartered 
Accountant in 1989.
In December 2015, we announced 
that Mark Morris, who has been a Non 
Executive Director and member of the 
Nominations, Remuneration and Audit 
Committees since November 2006, will 
retire from the Board and its Committees 
and that David Stewart, will, subject to 
his election at the 2016 AGM, take on the 
role of Chairman of the Audit Committee 
with effect from the AGM, in addition to 
his existing appointments as a member 
of the Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees.
Corporate Governance
The Board remains committed to high 
levels of corporate governance and during 
2015, LSL has complied in all respects 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(September 2014 edition) save that due to 
my previous roles on the Board, I did not 
satisfy the independence requirement prior 
to my appointment as Chairman. Further 
details relating to my appointment are 
contained in the Corporate Governance 
Report.
In respect of 2015, the Board has again 
conducted an annual review of its 
effectiveness and that of its Committees, 
taking into account the balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge 
of our businesses. Following this exercise, 
we concluded that the Board and its 
Committees are effective and are able 
to discharge their respective duties and 
responsibilities appropriately.
The Board has during the year also 
reviewed its composition, which at the date 
of this Report includes five independent 
Non Executive Directors (due to reduce to 
four independent Non Executive Directors 
at the 2016 AGM) and three Executive 
Directors and myself as Chairman. Further, 
the Board continues to recognise the 
benefits of diversity in the boardroom, 
including gender and racial diversity. The 
current Board composition includes two 
female Directors, Helen Buck and Kumsal 
Bayazit Besson, who are both independent 
Non Executive Directors.
Whilst we remain of the view that the 
setting of targets for the number of female 
directors on the Board is not necessary and 
that we will continue to appoint on merit, I 
will continue to ensure that our searches for 
new directors take into account diversity, 
including gender and race.
LSL remains committed to promoting 
diversity throughout the Group and in 
2015 we continued to build on the diversity 
reviews conducted during the previous 
years. During 2015, we have commenced 
a range of employee training initiatives, 
including courses relating to gender bias 
training and assertiveness training. Further 
details of LSL ’s studies and its conclusions 
are set out in our Corporate Social 
Responsibility Report.
As Chairman, with the responsibility 
for leadership of the Board, I review its 
effectiveness on all aspects of its role and 
encourage feedback.
Our market position
LSL holds a market leading position in its 
core Estate Agency business comprising 
12 Estate Agency brands, including Your 
Move, which is the largest UK single 
brand estate agent with 282 branches 
nationwide and has the UK’s most visited 
estate agency website
2
. The businesses are 
organised to deliver integrated Residential 
Sales, Lettings and Financial Services from 
a single operating structure.
We continue to invest in our brands and in 
January 2016 we launched a national media 
campaign to further invest in our Your Move 
Estate Agency brand. This demonstrates 
our commitment to supporting and 
protecting our valuable brands and has 
started well. We also invested in 2015 to 
drive future growth by increasing branch 
headcount to support our successful 
Lettings and Financial Services businesses 
and also in our growing Land and New 
Homes businesses.

residential property market, which is 
characterised by on-going new entrants. 
We continue to develop and evolve our 
offering to ensure our competitiveness in 
this marketplace.
Ultimately the success of our business 
model has always been underpinned by our 
strong brands and excellence in delivery 
by our knowledgeable local colleagues. 
In 2016 we will continue to invest in 
technology to widen the digital offering to 
our customers whilst improving our internal 
efficiency at the same time.
We continue to selectively acquire 
businesses. To drive growth in the counter-
cyclical Lettings business, we acquired 
30 lettings books in 2015 (2014: 10), with 
internal disciplines in place to ensure 
successful integration into the Group. 
It is also pleasing to note the strong 
performance of Thomas Morris, a multi 
award winning seven branch estate agency 
which we acquired during the first quarter 
of 2015.
Post our 2015 year-end, we acquired a 
65% interest in Group First Limited (GFL) in 
February 2016 which provides mortgage 
and protection brokerage services to the 
purchasers of new homes. This is a value 
enhancing opportunity which further 
strengthens LSL ’s relationships with its key 
housebuilder clients.
In Financial Services, the Group arranged 
total mortgage lending of £14.5bn (2014: 
£11.6bn), representing 6.6% of the overall 
market
3
. Measured by the number of 
appointed representatives, LSL ’s overall 
network is the second largest in the UK

We continue to hold a leadership position in 
Surveying, maintaining strong relationships 
with many of the major lenders.

The number of Group employees at 31

December 2015 was 5,181 (2014: 5,222) and 
our success is ultimately dependent on the 
customer service provided by our staff in all 
parts of our business across the entire UK. 
I would like to thank all of our staff for their 
continued hard work and commitment which 
they have demonstrated throughout 2015.
Current trading and outlook
We have started the year positively across 
the Group.
In the Estate Agency Division, trading is in 
line with expectations and there are good 
activity levels with quality buyers and good 
availability of mortgages. Whilst there 
remains a shortage of stock, our sales 
conversion remains strong and we are 
maintaining our market share. The January 
2016 launch of the Your Move national 
media campaign has started well.
In our Surveying Division, trading is in line 
with expectations and the technology 
refresh is progressing well.
The forthcoming year is expected to see a 
flat housing market in terms of transactions, 
with continuing house price inflation outside 
prime Central London.
Underpinned by a series of strategic 
initiatives, the business is well placed to 
deliver a solid performance in 2016. We 
are positive regarding the outlook for 2016, 
committed to driving profitable organic 
growth across the business, and will 
continue to evaluate selective acquisitions.
The Group has a robust balance sheet 
with relatively low levels of gearing and 
is very cash generative at an operational 
level. The business is therefore well placed 
to capitalise on the market conditions to 
increase Shareholder value.

2015 Overview
I am pleased to report that after the 
slower first half we continued to execute 
our strategy and worked tirelessly 
across the whole business to deliver a 
strong second half performance and 
what was ultimately a full year operating 
profit result higher than the property 
market peak of 2007.
We delivered on our financial 
commitments made at the time of the 
2015 interim results announced in 
August 2015 and I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank all my colleagues 
across our business for delivering a 
record breaking result.
Group revenue increased by 4.6% to 
£300.6m (2014: £287.5m) with strong 
second half growth of 8.7%. Group 
Underlying Operating Profit increased by 
2% to a record £42.9m (2014: £42.0m), 
with double digit profit growth in the 
second half in both the Estate Agency 
and Surveying Divisions.
Duty changes. There was little market 
recovery in prime Central London post the 
General Election.
Average house prices
2
 in England and 
Wales grew 6.6% to £292,000 annually 
as stock shortages continued to have an 
impact. Excluding London and the South 
East, the average increase was 4.7%.
Residential property values in Greater 
London increased by 5.6%. Prime Central 
London (5 prime boroughs) fell by 8.7% 
impacted by a range of factors including the 
impact of the December 2014 Stamp Duty 
changes. Outside the top five prime Central 
London boroughs, London experienced an 
11% increase in year-on-year house prices.
The proportion of mortgage lending in 
the market placed through intermediaries 
continued to increase during the year

. 
Following market declines in the

Strategy
We remain committed to the strategy we 
communicated in March 2015. The key 
components of our strategy are:
Estate Agency
•  Drive operating profit per branch to 
between £80,000 and £100,000 in the 
medium term
•  Expand the number of Marsh & Parsons 
branches to a total of 36 by 2019, 
particularly outside prime Central London

The Market in 2015
The UK residential property services market 
in 2015 was a story of two halves.
As we reported at the 2015 interim results, 
the first quarter of 2015 faced very strong 
comparatives relative to the first quarter of 
2014, which was a period characterised by 
strong growth ahead of the implementation 
of the Mortgage Market Review. The 
second quarter of 2015 was impacted by 
uncertainty around the General Election. 
As a result, in the first half of 2015 house 
purchase approvals were down by 3.3% 
year-on-year
1
.
In the second half of 2015, there was a 
modest recovery in the market following 
the General Election and the comparatives 
were against a slowing market in 2014. 
Over the full year therefore house purchase 
approvals increased by 4.7%.
Total Mortgage Approvals
1
 increased by 
8.4% in 2015. This reflected a flat first 
half with accelerating market sentiment 
and volume growth in the second half in 
both approvals for house purchases 
which are typically three months 
before completion and also in 
remortgage approvals.
The prime Central London 
market in 2015 was 
impacted by a range of 
factors including the 
December 2014 Stamp

LSL performance in 2015
Estate Agency Division
Total Estate Agency income of £236.5m 
(2014: £225.3m) increased by 5%. This 
increase resulted from the consistent 
execution of our strategy in 2015.
We continue to adapt our approach to 
maintain competitiveness. We launched 
the Your Move national media campaign 
in January 2016, moving the focus of 
our advertising spend away from more 
traditional local media. The campaign “it 
pays to be with Your Move”, underlines the 
customer value from using an estate agent 
with Your Move’s reach and size.
In 2016, we will continue to focus on further 
improving the digital communication with 
our customers and to improve the customer 
experience.
Residential Sales exchange income
Residential Sales exchange income grew 
1% during the year. Whilst in the first half 
income fell by 5% reflecting the market 
conditions, the second half performance 
was strong with 7% growth, reflecting 
market stabilisation post the General 
Election and the investments we made 
in Estate Agency in the first half. Total 
exchange units were broadly flat in 2015 
with an increase in fees per unit largely on 
the back of house price inflation.
Recurring Lettings income
We remain committed to our strategy 
of increasing recurring Lettings income. 
In 2015 we delivered growth in Lettings 
income of 12%. Lettings Income increased 
as a proportion of the Estate Agency 
business and represented 28% of total 
Estate Agency Division income in 2015 
(2014: 26%).
We delivered organic Lettings growth of 
5% and in addition, in line with our strategy 
substantially increased the rate of Lettings 
book acquisitions, acquiring 30 Lettings 
books in 2015 for a total consideration of 
£9.6m
5
. This is a significant increase against 
2014 when we acquired 10 Lettings books 
for a total consideration of £1.8m.
We have maintained consistent investment 
criteria for Lettings book acquisitions 
throughout the year and we have not 
changed our investment criteria as we 
have increased the rate of investment. The 
Lettings books have been successfully 
integrated into our networks.
Financial Services
Total Financial Services income grew 
strongly again with 16% year-on-year  
growth in 2015. We have also delivered over 
16% compound growth since 2011 as we 
have rolled out our model across the Estate 
Agency business and delivered growth from 
our intermediary networks.
Post our 2015 year-end, we acquired a 
65% interest in GFL in February 2016, 
which provides mortgage and protection 
brokerage services to the purchasers 
of new homes through its subsidiaries, 
Mortgages First Limited and Insurance 
First Brokers Limited. This investment 
supports LSL ’s strategy to grow long-term 
profitability in the provision of residential 
property services in the UK, by identifying 
value enhancing opportunities. Further, the 
investment strengthens LSL ’s relationships 
with its key housebuilder clients.
Selective Estate Agency acquisitions
We remain committed to our strategy of 
evaluating selective acquisition of Estate 
Agency businesses.
In February 2015 we acquired Thomas 
Morris, a multi award-winning Estate 
Agency and Lettings business with seven 
branches in Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire 
and Hertfordshire. We are pleased with the 
performance of the business in 2015 and 
also note that since acquisition, Thomas 
Morris has increased its Financial Services 
income, an example of how we can add 
value to our acquisitions.
Marsh & Parsons
Given the overall challenging prime Central 
London market, I am pleased to report 
that Marsh & Parsons’ revenue grew 9% in 
2015 to £35.3m (2014: £32.5m) and profit 
increased by 6% to £6.9m (2014: £6.5m).
This growth was a result of strong Lettings 
performance of 10%, growth in Land and 
New Homes and resilience in Residential 
Sales, with good results from the new 
offices opened previously in the outer prime 
Central London locations.
We continued with our branch expansion 
strategy in 2015, opening two branches 
during the year in the outer prime Central 
London locations of Shoreditch and Queens 
Park. We have continued with our strategy 
in 2016 and since the year-end have opened 
a branch in Tooting. We are pleased with 
the performance of these new branches.
Our ambition remains to expand to 36 
branches by 2019. Outer prime Central 
London has not been as negatively 
impacted as prime Central London and 
Marsh & Parsons is looking to expand its 
new office footprint in outer prime Central 
London locations.
Estate Agency profit per branch  
(Your Move, Reeds Rains and LSLi)
LSL successfully increased operating profit 
per branch from £4,600 in 2011 to £45,600 
in 2014. Our medium term strategy is to 
drive operating profit per owned branch 
to between £80,000 and £100,000 on the 
expectation of longer term stability in the 
UK residential property sector. Our Lettings 
growth and Financial Services growth 
across the network continues to underpin 
this strategy.
We invested in 2015 to drive future growth 
by increasing branch headcount to support 
our successful Lettings and Financial 
Services businesses and also in our 
growing Land and New Homes business.

LSL AR 2015_Sect1-3.indd   11 24/03/2016   15:29 11 10
Group Chief Executive’s Review
We increased our headcount in these 
growing businesses by over 100 colleagues 
during the year. This investment will support 
further growth and has resulted in a short- 
term fall in branch profitability by 7% in 2015.
Estate Agency operating margin was 13.2% 
(2014: 15%) reflecting these investments in 
the business and also the market decline 
in repossessions, impacting LSL ’s Asset 
Management business.
Surveying Division
During 2015 we continued to focus on 
optimising the profitability of our Surveying 
business.
The 2014 contract renewals and wins 
as well as the project undertaken in Q4 
2014 to optimise operational performance 
and productivity have delivered full year 
benefits in 2015. With further optimisation 
of capacity management in 2015, profit 
margins have therefore improved in the 
year to 28.3% (2014: 21.4%). A technology 
refresh is also in progress to deliver further 
enhancements.
Income per job increased by 17% to £196 
(2014: £167) and we performed 327,267 
total jobs in 2015 (2014: 371,717) as we 
optimised the mix of our business. We will 
further support our graduate programme 
which continues to be successful.
Our customers
Our continued focus on providing the 
best service to our customers has been 
recognised in 2015 with numerous industry 
awards including:
•  e.surv: What Mortgage? Awards 2015; 
Best Survey Provider-Winner
•  e.surv: Equity Release Awards 2015; Best 
Valuer-Winner
•  First Complete: Money Marketing Awards 
2015; Best Mortgage Network-Winner
•  Pink Home Loans: Financial Adviser 
Service Awards 2015; 5 star award
•  Linear Financial Solutions: Mortgage 
Strategy Awards 2015; Best Broker for 
General Insurance-Winner
•  Marsh & Parsons: Estate Agency of the 
Year Awards 2015, sponsored by The 
Times and Sunday Times; Best Marketing-
Gold award, Best Medium Lettings 
Agency, London-Gold Award. The 
Negotiator Awards 2015; London Agency 
of the Year-Gold Award
Balance Sheet
The Group has a strong balance sheet with 
closing Net Bank Debt at 31
st
 December 
2015 of £39.9m (2014: £34.7m) reflecting 
the acquisitions made during the year 
and a gearing level at 0.83 times adjusted 
EBITDA (2014: 0.74 times)
6
. The Group has 
a committed revolving credit facility until 
August 2017.
At 31
st
 December 2015, we held a 2.7% 
shareholding in Zoopla, valued at £27.1m.
In December 2014 we announced the need 
to further increase our PI Costs provision 
due to the historic market issues relating to 
the 2004 to 2008 high risk lending period 
and an additional reserve of £24.6m was 
provided and included as an exceptional 
item in 2014. In 2015 we continued to make 
positive progress in addressing these 
historic claims and the reduction in the rate 
of notifications and claims from the high 
risk lending period has been in line with our 
expectations during the year, and those 
assumed in setting the provision.
Outlook
We have started 2016 in line with our 
expectations across the Group and are 
well placed to deliver a solid performance 
during the year. We continue to consistently 
execute on our strategy and are well placed 
to deliver increased Shareholder value.
I look forward to working with all my 
colleagues to deliver another successful 
year in 2016.

Business Model
LSL ’s business model is how LSL puts its strategy into action. The execution of the strategy results in market 
leading positions in the Group’s business segments which produces a virtuous circle of strong revenues,  
profitability and cash flow which allows significant reinvestment in the business in order to further enhance 
LSL ’s market positions while also paying out a significant proportion of earnings as a dividend to Shareholders.
•  LSL has market leading positions in residential property 
surveying, mortgage valuations, asset management, residential 
sales and lettings, which are highly fragmented markets.
•  LSL serves retail customers in its Estate Agency businesses, 
such as house sellers and buyers, landlords and tenants.
•  LSL serves business customers in its Surveying and Asset 
Management businesses, such as Banks and Building 
societies, and benefits from long-term relationships and 
contracts.
•  The growth and reputation of LSL is dependent on providing 
exceptional service and appropriate outcomes for customers .
•  The business model has demonstrated resilience to changes in 
the residential property market due to its market positions in Lettings 
and Asset Management.
•  The model benefits from scale advantages which include superior 
productivity in the Surveying business as a result of shortened drive 
times and the ability to focus LSL ’s agency branches on customer 
service by building hubs and call centres to provide instructions to 
the branches and to handle certain administrative tasks centrally.
•  The business has low capital requirements and is highly cash 
generative.
•  LSL allocates the strong cash generation between paying dividends 
to Shareholders, reinvesting in the business to drive future organic 
growth and in making selective, value adding acquisitions.

LSL ’s Markets

Estate Agency Performance
Estate Agency Division Performance
Year-on-year income growth in the Estate 
Agency Division was 5%. All key income 
streams other than the counter-cyclical 
Asset Management business showed 
positive growth.
Residential Sales exchange income grew 
1% during the year. Whilst in the fi rst half 
income fell by 5% refl ecting the market, 
the second half performance was stronger 
with 7% growth, refl ecting the market 
stabilisation post General Election and the 
investments in the Estate Agency business 
made by LSL in the fi rst half. Exchange units 
were broadly fl at in 2015, with an increase in 
fees per unit, largely on the back of house 
price infl ation.
Lettings income
Lettings income grew consistently 
throughout the year, as we put more 
dedicated Lettings staff  into Estate Agency 
branches. Organic Lettings growth for the 
year was 5%. Combined with the Lettings 
acquisitions, overall growth was strong, at 
12% for the full year. This followed growth 
of 12% in 2014 and refl ects our continued 
focus on this recurring revenue stream.
Financial Services income 
Total Financial Services Income delivered 
through the Estate Agency Division’s 
branches, the intermediary networks of First 
Complete and Pink Home Loans and Linear 
Financial Solutions grew strongly again with 
16% year-on-year growth in 2015. We have 
also achieved over 16% compound growth 
since 2011 as we have rolled out the model 
across the Estate Agency business.
In February 2016, the Group acquired 
a 65% interest in GFL which provides 
mortgage and protection brokerage 
services to the purchasers of new homes 
through its subsidiaries, Mortgages First 
Limited and Insurance First Brokers Limited.

 Other Information Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview
Directors’ Report and Corporate 
Governance Reports
The investment supports LSL ’s strategy to 
grow long-term profi tability in the provision 
of residential property services in the UK, by 
identifying value enhancing opportunities. 
Further, the investment strengthens LSL ’s 
relationships with its key housebuilder 
clients.
In total the Group arranged mortgage 
lending completions of £14.5bn during 
2015 (2014: £11.6bn), with an estimated 
market share of 6.6% giving the Group an 
important position as a mortgage distributor 
for lender clients
7
.
Other income
Other income grew by 3% year-on-year 
mainly due to improved conveyancing and 
Land and New Homes income.
Marsh & Parsons
Marsh & Parsons delivered a strong 
performance in a challenging prime Central 
London market which was impacted by a 
number of factors including the 2014 Stamp 
Duty changes. The increase in the number 
of Marsh & Parsons branches outside 
prime Central London, strong exposure to 
the mid-market, strong recurring Lettings 
income which was up 10% and a growing 
Land and New Homes development 
business, all contributed to the delivery of 
9% income growth and a 6% improvement 
in profi t.
Asset Management
Asset Management delivered a robust 
performance in a shrinking market with 
revenues lower by 34% compared to 
the 51% market fall in repossessions to 
10,200
6
 in 2015. With a strong market 
share, the Asset Management business is 
well positioned to capitalise on any future 
increase in repossession volumes. Asset 
Management is developing its corporate 
property management service off ering to 
further enhance counter-cyclical revenues 
in the Group.
The Estate Agency 
Division operating margin
The Estate Agency Division operating 
margin was 13.2% in 2015 (2014: 
15%) which resulted from lower Asset 
Management profi ts, new Estate Agency 
branches opened, and headcount 
investment in Financial Services, Lettings 
and Land and New Homes.
2016 Strategy
During 2015, the Group has delivered on 
its strategy, continuing to make selective 
acquisitions and has added to the Estate 
Agency Division in the South East through 
the acquisitions of Thomas Morris and 30 
lettings books.
LSL will continue to target the selective 
acquisition of Estate Agency and Lettings 
books and will focus on driving organic 
growth in Residential Sales, Lettings and 
Financial Services as well as rolling out new 
branches in Marsh & Parsons.

 increased in the 
year by 8.4% to 1.388m (2014: 1.280m) with 
a fl at fi rst half followed by an increase in the 
second half. This refl ected the strong prior 
year growth in H1 pre the Mortgage Market 
Review launch and consumer confi dence 
post the General Election in 2015.
Surveying turnover was £64.1m (2014: 
£62.2m), an increase of 3% on last year 
and the total number of jobs performed 
was 327,267 (2014: 371,717) refl ecting 
management of the mix of jobs. Double 
digit profi t growth was strongly infl uenced 
by the full year impact of the 2014 mid-
year contract renewals and wins and the 
Q4 2014 operational performance and 
productivity project.
We also continued to focus on optimising 
capacity management in 2015, driving an 
increase in income per job to £196, an 
improvement of 17% year-on-year. As a 
result we delivered an increase in Operating 
profi t to £18.1m (2014: £13.3m) with an 
enhancement of profi t margin to 28.3% 
(2014: 21.4%).
The total number of qualifi ed surveyors at 
31
st
 December 2015 was 347, a reduction 
of 4% year-on-year. LSL ’s on-going 
graduate programme continues to be 
successful and assists in alleviating the 
impact of skill constraints in the market. 
In 2016 LSL will continue to focus on 
improving our effi  ciency through optimising 
capacity management supported by use of 
better technology.
At 31
st
 December 2015 the total provision 
for PI Costs was £29.7m. In 2015 LSL 
continued to make positive progress in 
addressing these historic claims and the 
reduction in the rate of notifi cations and 
claims from the high risk lending period has 
been in line with our expectations during 
the year, and those assumed in setting the 
provision.

LSL AR 2015_Sect1-3.indd   21 24/03/2016   15:29 Financial Review
The key drivers of the financial performance of LSL in 2015 are summarised below: 
Income statement
Revenue
Revenue increased by 4.6% to £300.6m in 
the year ended 31
st
 December 2015 (2014: 
£287.5m).
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased by 4.6% to 
£260.7m (2014: £249.3m). The increase 
was in the Estate Agency Division and 
was mainly as a result of acquisitions (e.g. 
Thomas Morris), new Marsh & Parsons 
branches and an investment in headcount 
to support growth in Lettings, Financial 
Services and Land and New Homes.
The average number of full time equivalent 
employees during the year was 4,677 (2014: 
4,760).
Underlying Operating Profit
Group Underlying Operating Profit (before 
exceptional gains and exceptional costs, 
contingent consideration, amortisation of 
intangible assets and share-based payments) 
increased by 2% to £42.9m (2014: £42.0m) 
with the Underlying Operating Margin of 
14.3% (2014: 14.6%). On a statutory basis, 
the Group operating profit increased by 
22.2% to £41.4m (2014: £33.9m).
Exceptional Items
Total net exceptional costs in 2015 were 
£0.3m (2014: £6.2m net exceptional costs). 
Exceptional costs in 2015 comprised the 
closure of an administration centre and the 
subsequent restructuring costs incurred 
which included redundancy costs.
In 2014, exceptional costs comprised of PI 
Costs of £24.6m, acquisition related costs 
of £0.3m and restructuring, redundancy 
and other associated branch closure costs 
including onerous lease provisions of £1.1m. 
These exceptional costs were partly offset 
by the gain on the sale of part of LSL ’s 
investment in Zoopla on its IPO totalling 
£19.8m.
Provision for PI claims  
and notifications
In December 2014, LSL announced the 
need to further increase the PI Costs 
provision due to the historic market issues 
relating to the 2004 to 2008 high risk 
lending period and an additional reserve of 
£24.6m was provided and included as an 
exceptional item in 2014.
At 31
st
 December 2015, the total provision 
for PI Costs was £29.7m. In 2015 the 
Group continued to make positive progress 
in addressing these historic claims and the 
reduction in the rate of notifications and 
claims from the high risk lending period 
has been in line with LSL ’s expectations 
during the year, and those assumed in 
setting the provision.
Contingent consideration
Certain contingent consideration 
arrangements have been accounted for 
as remuneration as the arrangements 
potentially involve the vendors forfeiting 
amounts otherwise due if continued 
services are not provided. These amounts 
are shown separately on the face of 
the Income Statement. Contingent 
consideration amounted to a credit of 
£1.5m in 2015 (2014: £0.4m credit).
Net Financial Costs
Net financial costs (excluding exceptional 
finance credit) amounted to £2.8m 
(2014: £2.2m). The finance costs related 
principally to interest and fees on the 
revolving credit facility. Additional costs 
relate to the unwinding of discounts on 
provisions and contingent consideration 
and interest on loan notes.
Taxation
The UK standard corporation tax rate has 
reduced from 21% as at 1
st
 January 2015 
to 20% from 1
st
 April 2015 with further 
reductions to 19% from 1
st
 April 2017 and 
18`% from 1
st
 April 2020. The effective 
rate of tax for the year was 21.1% (2014: 
21.2%). The effective tax rate for 2015 was 
decreased as a result of reducing the rate 
at which deferred tax is provided resulting 
from the reduction in the headline rate 
of corporation tax. Deferred tax charged 
directly to other comprehensive income 
is £0.5m (2014: credit of £2.7m); this is 
comprised of a credit of £0.05m and a 
charge of £1.0m and relates to the disposal 
and revaluation of financial assets (see Note 
16 to the Financial Statements). There is 
also a credit arising as a result of the impact 
of rate change on deferred tax of £0.5m. 
Income tax credited directly to the share 
based payment reserve is £nil (2014: £nil).

LSL AR 2015_Sect1-3.indd   22 24/03/2016   15:29 In July 2015, the UK Government 
announced proposals to reduce the main 
rate of corporation tax to 19% from 1
st
 April 
2017, and further reduced to 18%, effective 
from 1
st
 April 2020. As of 31
st
 December 
2015 reductions to the main rate of 
corporation tax to 18% had been enacted. 
Accordingly, this is the rate at which 
deferred tax has been provided.
Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share
The Basic Earnings per Share was 29.7 
pence (2014: 24.5 pence). The Adjusted 
Basic Earnings per Share (as calculated in 
Note 10 to the Financial Statements) is 31.5 
pence (2014: 30.5 pence). The Directors 
consider that the adjustments made to 
exclude the after tax effect of exceptional 
items, contingent acquisition consideration 
treated as remuneration, and amortisation 
of acquisition intangibles provides a better 
and more consistent indicator of the 
Group’s underlying performance.
Balance Sheet
Capital Expenditure
Total capital expenditure in the year 
amounted to £4.8m (2014: £8.6m) and an 
additional £3.2m (2014: £0.7m) has been 
spent internally on developing new software 
which has been treated as an intangible 
asset.
Bank Facilities
LSL refinanced its bank facility in 2013 with 
a £100m revolving credit facility in place 
until August 2017 (2014: £100m).
Further details on the Group’s financial 
commitments as well as the Group’s 
treasury and risk management policies 
are set out in Note 29 to the Financial 
Statements. During the period under 
review, the Group complied with all of the 
financial covenants contained within the 
facility.
Net Bank Debt and Cashflow
As at 31
st 
December 2015 Net Bank 
Debt was £39.9m (2014: £34.7m) and 
Shareholders’ funds amounted to £107.4m 
(2014: £83.1m) giving balance sheet gearing 
of 37.1% (2014: 41.8%). The increase in 
Net Bank Debt arose mainly as a result of 
the increased number of acquisitions. The 
2015 gearing level was 0.83 times adjusted 
EBITDA
1
 (2014: 0.74 times). The Group has 
20 21
a committed revolving credit facility until 
August 2017. In 2015 the Group generated 
cash from operations of £36.5m (2014: 
£25.7m).
Zoopla
Subsequent to the 2015 interim date, 
Zoopla completed an anniversary offer 
allowing LSL to subscribe for a further 
619,318 shares at the £2.20 IPO price with 
a 20% discount. These have been taken up 
by LSL. At the same time, a further 169,350 
shares were sold through the anniversary 
member offer at £1.76 with proceeds of 
£0.3m net of associated costs included 
in other operating income. Zoopla’s share 
price at 31
st
 December 2015 was £2.40 per 
share. The fair value of the Group’s 2.7% 
stake in Zoopla is calculated to be £27.1m 
at 31
st
 December 2015.
Net Assets
The Group’s net assets as at 31
st
 December 
2015 were £107.4m (2014: £83.1m).
Treasury and Risk Management
LSL has an active debt management 
policy. LSL does not hold or issue 
derivatives or other financial instruments  
for trading purposes.
Post Balance Sheet Events
Subsequent to the year end the following 
transactions have been completed:
a.  LSL acquired three small lettings 
book acquisitions for a total initial 
consideration of £1.82m.
b.  On 17
th
 February 2016, Your Move 
acquired a 65% interest in GFL for an 
initial consideration of £9.1m, with 50% 
paid at completion and the remaining 
50% to be in March 2017.
The Group is in the process of allocating 
the purchase price in accordance with IFRS 
3. As a result the initial accounting for the 
acquisitions above are currently incomplete, 
so a fair value table of the identifiable assets 
and liabilities has not been presented.

Directors’ Report and Corporate 
Governance Reports
LSL AR 2015_Sect1-3.indd   23 24/03/2016   15:29 Development of risk appetite
During 2015, in line with the FRC’s 
Guidance on ‘Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business 
Report’ which was published in 2014 and 
which integrated and replaced the FRCs 
previous guidance on risk management 
and internal controls, the Board has 
developed LSL ’s approach to risk appetite 
to ensure continued compliance with the 
Code and FRC guidance. The Board has 
through this process expressed the types 
and level of risk which it is willing to take 
or accept to achieve LSL ’s plans and to 
support consistent, risk-informed decision 
making across the Group.
The development of the risk appetite began 
with the Directors defining the draft risk 
appetite statements for LSL ’s principal risks, 
and for key decisions made by the Board. 
These statements provide parameters 
within which the Board typically expect 
LSL ’s businesses to operate, facilitating 
structured consideration of the risk and 
reward trade-off for the decisions made 
around how the Group conducts business.
The discussions covered a wide range 
of risks, which reflect the nature of LSL ’s 
businesses and acknowledges that 
there is not a one size fits all approach 
to establishing risk parameters. During 
2016, LSL will continue to develop the 
framework in line with emerging best 
practice, including evolution of existing 
objective measures defining risk appetite 
elements and analysis of how individual risk 
conditions interact with each other.
The Board will seek to establish clear 
parameters, whilst at the same time 
fostering an environment within which 
innovation and entrepreneurial activities 
thrive. Where there is any proposal to 
shift the Group significantly closer to or 
outside agreed risk parameters, this will be 
discussed and subject to Board approval 
before commencing any activities to ensure 
that appropriate mitigation controls are put 
into place.
Once finalised, LSL ’s risk appetite 
statements will be incorporated into our 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
LSL has an overall framework for management of risks and internal controls to mitigate the risks. Through this framework, the 
Board, which has overall accountability and responsibility for the management of risk, on a regular basis identifies, evaluates and 
manages the principal risks and uncertainties faced by LSL, areas which could adversely affect its business, operating results 
and financial condition.
existing Group risk processes, and used 
to monitor business activities and decision 
making. Whilst good progress has been 
made in 2015, the continued development 
of the risk appetite framework remains a 
key priority for the Board in 2016.
Developing the financial  
viability statement
In developing the financial viability 
statement, it was determined that a three 
year period should be used, consistent with 
the period of the Group’s strategic plan.
The Management Team reviewed the 
principal risks, and considered which of 
these risks might threaten the Group’s 
viability.
A number of severe but plausible scenarios 
were considered and modelled in detail 
with input from a cross functional group of 
senior managers, including representatives 
from Finance.
The main focus of the scenario modelling 
related to the impact of a significant 
downturn in the property market as 
occurred in the 2008 to 2009 period. 
Modelling included the plans LSL put in 
place during that recessionary period. 
The skills and many of the personnel with 
experience to manage through such a 
scenario remain within the business which 
has helped this process and gives a degree 
of confidence to manage through a similar 
scenario.
Detailed assumptions for each scenario 
were built up and modelled by month 
across the three year period. The models 
measured the downside impact on revenue 
and the management action which would 
be taken to retain cash reserves and 
maintain the operating capacity of the 
business as a result of the stress scenarios.
Assumptions were also made for the 
potential growth of LSL counter-cyclical 
businesses, notably asset management, 
and the extent to which some activities, 
such as Lettings, tend to be less affected 
through the cycle. The modelling and 
assumptions took account of the 
broad range of services across a broad 
geography which allows some protection 
from the impact of stress scenarios.
The current £100m revolving credit facility 
is committed until August 2017. The 
Group expects to agree a new extended 
facility during 2016. External professional 
advice has also been sought and has 
confirmed the Directors’ confidence that 
the refinancing will proceed as planned. 
This assumption has been included in LSL ’s 
financial plans and stress testing.
As set out in the Audit Committee’s Report, 
the Directors reviewed and discussed the 
process undertaken by the Management 
Team in proposing the viability statement.
The Directors’ financial viability statement is 
contained in the Directors’ Report.
Risk management and internal 
controls framework
LSL ’s risk management and internal 
controls framework for 2015 included:
a.  ownership of the risk management 
and internal controls framework by the 
Board, including a Risk Framework 
policy, supported by the Group 
Chief Financial Officer, the Company 
Secretary, Head of Risk and Internal 
Audit and members of the Group 
Finance team;
b.  a network of risk owners in each 
of LSL ’s businesses with specific 
responsibilities relating to risk 
management and internal controls;
c.  the documentation and monitoring 
of risks are recorded and managed 
through standardised risk registers 
which undergo regular reviews and 
scrutiny by local boards and the Head 
of Risk and Internal Audit;
d.  the Board regularly identifies, reviews 
and evaluates the principal risks which 
may impact the Group as part of the 
planning and reporting cycle to ensure 
that such risks are identified, monitored 
and mitigated;
e.  the development and application of 
LSL ’s risk appetite statement and 
associated framework (for further details 
22 23
LSL AR 2015_Sect1-3.indd   24 24/03/2016   15:29 on steps taken during the year, please 
see the Audit Committee Report); and
f.  reporting by the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee to the Board on any matters 
which have arisen from the Audit 
Committee’s review of the way in which 
the risk management and internal control 
framework has been applied together 
with any breakdowns in, or exceptions 
to, these procedures.
As stated above, LSL has in place a Group-
wide risk appetite statement and framework 
which will continue to be developed in 2016. 
This framework includes the following:
a.  assessment of principal risks and their 
management or mitigation;
b. assessment of prospects and viability;
c.  review of effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control 
systems; and
d.  going concern confirmation (for LSL ’s 
going concern disclosure please refer to 
the Report of the Directors).
During the year, the Directors carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those 
that threaten the business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. The 
Directors believe that the assessment 
which has been completed is appropriate to 
the complexity, size and circumstances of 
the Group, which is a matter of judgement 
of the Board and has been supported by 
the Management Team.
These risks may change over time due to 
changes in business models, performance, 
strategy, operational processes and the 
stage of development of the Group in its 
business cycle as well as with changes 
in the external environment. This robust 
assessment is focused on the principal 
risks and it differs from the review of 
the effectiveness of the systems of risk 
management and internal controls.
In accordance with the requirements of 
the Code this Report includes descriptions 
of principal risks together with a high 
level explanation of how they are being 
managed or mitigated. This includes clear 
descriptions of the risks together with an 
evaluation of the likelihood of a typical 
risk event crystallising and its possible 
impact. Mitigating steps and any significant 
changes to specific areas of risk are also 
referred to within the tabular summary.
As noted above, this robust analysis of 
principal risks has also contributed to the 
Group’s viability statement which is set 
within the Report of the Directors. The 
Directors have also considered the impact 
if risks coincide, namely a combination 
of non-principal risks could potentially 
represent a single compound principal risk.
The Group also faces other risks which, 
although important and subject to regular 
review, have been assessed as less 
significant and are not listed overleaf. This 
may include some risks which are not 
currently known to the Group or that LSL 
currently deems as immaterial, or were 
included in previous Annual Report and 
Accounts and through changes in external

factors and careful management, are no 
longer deemed to be as material to the 
Group as a whole.
However, these risks may individually or 
cumulatively also have a material adverse 
effect together with other risk factors 
which are beyond the direct control of LSL, 
and may have a material adverse impact 
on LSL ’s business, results of operations 
and/or financial condition. The risk 
management framework and procedures 
in place can only provide reasonable but 
not absolute assurance that the principal 
risks and uncertainties are managed to an 
acceptable level.
Further information relating to how LSL 
managed these risks and uncertainties 
during 2015 is set out in the Audit 
Committee Report (Internal Controls).

Corporate Social Responsibility
The Board has overall responsibility for establishing the Group’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) statement and associated 
policies with the Group Chief Financial Officer, taking individual responsibility for the creation, operation and implementation of 
the Group’s CSR statement and strategy.
LSL believes that it is necessary to support responsibly-grounded business decision making, to consider the broad impact of corporate 
actions on people, communities, and the environment. The growing awareness of and attention to social responsibility issues has many 
benefits for corporations such as LSL and by way of this statement, LSL recognises that its employees are central to the Group meeting 
its CSR, Environmental and Community Investment objectives. Guidelines, progress and achievements are communicated to employees 
at regular intervals through bulletins, intranet sites and notice boards as appropriate (including the Group HR online service systems).
LSL ’s focus is on actions that the Group can take over and above its legal requirements to address its competitive interests of the wider 
society and underpins all other internal policies that the Group adheres to. LSL actively ensures that its businesses are compliant and 
proactive in respect of legislation, in accordance with its employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders’ interests.
LSL believes that the objective of providing goods and services needed or desired by members of society while returning a profit to 
Shareholders can be – and should be – fully compatible with addressing social responsibility concerns and vice versa. For example, LSL ’s 
environmental policy and performance demonstrates its commitment to the reduction of energy consumption and the positive impact that 
this has had both on the environment and in terms of cost reduction to the Groups businesses.
The Board recognises that it is important that Group companies operate in a responsible way. LSL ’s stakeholders expect LSL to take 
issues into account and LSL in turn has a duty to demonstrate to them how it is living up to this expectation. This can often mean 
balancing competing demands, which are placed on LSL as a public company and as a property services group.
This section of the Report details how LSL seeks to manage these interests.
LSL ’s objectives extend to its relationships with customers and suppliers, and all Group companies will seek to be honest and fair in these 
relationships. Further, ethics, hospitality and conflicts policies are in place to govern these relationships. During 2016, LSL is putting in 
place arrangements to ensure compliance with both the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the payment practices reforms proposed by the 
Government during 2015 for implementation in 2017.
As part of LSL ’s regular risk assessment procedures, the Board takes account of the significance of environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) matters to the business of the Group and in its decision making. The Board has identified and assessed the significant ESG risks 
to LSL ’s short and long-term value, as well as the opportunities to enhance value that may arise from an appropriate response. The 
Board receives information to make this assessment and that account is taken of ESG matters in the training of Directors. The Board has 
also ensured that LSL has in place effective systems for managing and mitigating significant risks, which, where relevant, incorporate 
performance management systems and appropriate remuneration incentives.

LSL’s People
LSL recognises that its people are a valuable asset and is committed to providing a working environment in which its employees can 
develop to achieve their full potential with opportunities for both professional and personal development.
By creating such an environment, LSL believes that this will enable the retention and recruitment of the right people to work at every level 
throughout the Group. An essential part of this strategy is to encourage and promote effective communication with all employees which is 
achieved through employee opinion surveys. This also ensures that LSL, in its decision making, takes into account its employees views. 
For further details of the employee survey arrangements, see Communication (Employees) below.
LSL’s Approach
LSL ’s aim is to be recognised by existing and potential future employees as a responsible employer that values its people and the 
contribution they make both in the business and in the wider community. LSL recognises that its market leading positions in Estate 
Agency and Surveying are achieved by the quality and service provided by the Group’s employees. LSL ’s employees are its key 
differentiator and it is this principle that guides the Board’s decision making on how LSL approaches the management of its people.
Communication
Employees:
LSL ensures that employees are kept informed of Group affairs via information distributed by post, e-mail, handbooks or the various intranet 
sites. LSL values employee feedback and all Group employees are encouraged to discuss strategic, operational and business issues within 
their teams and with their management.
In addition, the Board receives employee feedback via employee opinion surveys which operate across all parts of the Group businesses 
on an annual basis. The data that is captured is presented to the Board as part of a regular review of employee matters which focuses 
on understanding the issues facing our employees. KPIs such as labour turnover and responses to key questions are also monitored to 
measure staff morale. Further the 2015 employee opinion survey results were once again reviewed in respect of age and gender diversity, 
see below for further details.
Each year LSL engages an external consultant to assist with the annual employee surveys and this engagement allows LSL to not only 
generate an accurate picture of engagement across the Group, it also allows LSL to assess the results and feedback received against 
similar organisations using the benchmarking data retained by the agency. As in previous years, the 2015 survey covered all aspects of the 
working environment including training, careers, performance and company communications together with questions on the effectiveness 
of company management and leadership. The response from employees to the survey was very positive with 3,578 (71%) (2014: 3,337 
(67%)) returns received.
The survey results provide the Board with insight into what factors concern and motivate the Group’s employees and contribute to action 
plans and/or focus groups across the Group. The employee survey process is continually evaluated and developed to maximise the validity 
and reliability of the data that is captured. Further, the process will be repeated again in 2016 as LSL remains committed to the continual 
development and improvement of employee 
engagement across the Group. On strategic 
matters, LSL recognises and consults Unite.
Customers:
In relation to its customers, all businesses 
regularly seek feedback from customers. 
This feedback is obtained in a range of 
ways, including relationship management 
meetings, formal questionnaires and 
mystery shopping exercises. This feedback 
is taken into account in LSL ’s decision-
making processes and in particular in the 
development of its services to customers.
Equal Opportunities
LSL promotes equal opportunities in 
employment, recognising that equality and 
diversity is a vital part in its success and 
growth. The Group recruitment, training 
and selection processes seek to appoint 
the best candidates based on suitability 
for the job and to treat all employees and The winner of Intercounty’s Easter competition

being submitted annually for review and 
approval by the Board. Compliance with 
legislation and Group policies is audited by 
the Group’s Risk and Internal Audit team 
with regular reporting to the Board, which 
includes indicators such as staff  turnover.
Age and Gender Diversity:
Since 2011, LSL has undertaken reviews 
in relation to gender diversity which was 
further explored in 2014 by the completion 
of an age and gender analysis of its 2014 
employee opinion survey which revealed 
that whilst feedback from employees is 
consistent regardless of gender, there are 
diff erences in relation to age groups. This feedback will be taken into account in Group employee initiatives going forward. The fi ndings of 
all reviews completed since 2011 are set out in LSL ’s previous Annual Report and Accounts. For details of relevant gender diversity KPIs, 
see below.
During 2015, LSL has remained committed to diversity and equal pay and LSL is closely monitoring the proposals relating to the 
new gender pay reporting requirements, and has also participated in the Government consultation. During 2016, LSL will ensure full 
compliance following the publication and commencement of the fi nal reporting requirements.
Disability:
LSL has in place policies and procedures to achieve its objective that where appropriate, upon employment reasonable adjustments will 
be made to accommodate disabled persons wherever the requirements of the organisation will allow and if applications for employment 
are received from suitable individuals. If existing employees become disabled every reasonable eff ort is also made to ensure that their 
employment with LSL can continue on a worthwhile basis with career opportunities available to them.

Employee Training:
LSL ’s businesses place strong emphasis on the quality of service they provide to customers with employees (and where appropriate 
consultants) undergoing appropriate training. During 2015, LSL continued its commitment to recruit, develop and invest in colleagues. 
The Group’s approach is to prioritise colleague learning and development to strengthen the businesses and to ensure the Group’s 
continued success. Examples of this approach to training are detailed below.
Surveying and Valuation Services:
There are now in excess of 100 graduates in the business, the majority of whom have achieved AssocRICS qualifi cations, and it is 
expected that the remainder will qualify during 2016. e.surv continues to use the Mitre Training Academy to support the learning and 
development of the Central Operations staff . There are now 35 members of staff  who are working towards NVQ accreditation at either 
Level 1, 2 or 3 in Business Administration, Customer Service, Team Leading, Management, and Business Improvement Techniques.
In addition to this training initiative undertaken with Mitre, all surveyors receive continuing professional development through a variety of 
methods ranging from distance learning, regional workshops and an annual conference.
Estate Agency and Related Services:
Across the Group’s Estate Agency Division’s branches, employees adhere to the Codes of Practice issued by The Property Ombudsman 
(TPO) and/or the Association of Residential Lettings Agents (ARLA). This is in addition to observing compliance with relevant legislation, 
such as the Consumer Protection Regulations, guidance material published by relevant regulators, including the Competition and Markets 
Authority (CMA) (and its predecessor the Offi  ce of Fair Trading (OFT)), the National Trading Standards Agency/Trading Standards Institute 
(TSI), HMRC and codes published by other relevant bodies, including the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). LSL from time to time 
also enters into direct dialogue with the regulators and consumer groups, such as Which?. During 2015, LSL on behalf of all its Estate 
Agency businesses entered into a primary authority agreement with York Trading Standards.
During 2015 the Group continued to monitor and implement regulatory changes, including the implementation of the Consumer Rights 
Act, which sought to simplify the UK’s consumer legislation and implement the EU’s Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices. As a result, 
the Group has reviewed and updated all consumer terms of business to ensure compliance with the new legislation.
LSL monitors all relevant legislative changes, including reform of consumer rights and data protection legislation, and in response keeps 
under review its training programmes to ensure that employees receive specially designed training courses, with the quality of service 
monitored on a regular basis.
LSL ’s ‘Talent Development Team’ delivered training to a total of 4,171 employees during 2015, equating to the delivery of 7,107 training 
days. 2015 saw the implementation of a number of eLearning packages on ‘Learning Matters’, LSL ’s online eLearning system, which 
allows Group employees to complete eLearning training packages for compliance and regulatory purposes, and as a result of this system, 
LSL are able to monitor and report on compliance training completion rates in real-time.
As stated above, LSL monitors all relevant legislative changes and in response keeps under review its training programmes to ensure that 
Group employees receive specially designed training courses, with the quality of service monitored on a regular basis.
Throughout the year a number of new learning initiatives were implemented including the launch of the Advances Leadership Pathway – 
an accredited development programme for existing and future managers, new apprenticeship programmes, career pathways and various 
CPD workshops to support the development of new and tenured employees. CPD workshops to support the development of new and tenured employees.

at the same rate. Therefore LSL have identifi ed some of the main barriers to progression and have developed a plan to support minority 
groups. This includes the implementation of new training programmes which have started with both unconscious bias and assertiveness 
training.
In relation to LSL ’s Financial Services business, the FCA is responsible for the conduct of fi rms authorised by the Financial Services and 
Markets Act 2000 (FSMA). LSL ’s Financial Services businesses include two authorised fi rms, which operate broker networks that include 
other Group companies acting as their appointed representatives. Accordingly, the Financial Services companies are responsible for 
the training and compliance arrangements of all Financial Services business conducted by Group companies. LSL ’s Financial Services 
businesses place strong emphasis on the quality of service provided to customers and as part of the compliance arrangements, all 
employees involved in the Financial Services businesses receive appropriate and relevant training. In particular, all advisers complete a 
specially designed training programme which is supplemented by eff ective supervision, regular monitoring and regular refresher training 
sessions.
For further details on the regulations relevant to LSL ’s businesses, please see page 17 of the Business Review – Estate Agency Division 
included within the Strategic Report.
During 2015, the Group training expenditure was:
Division Expenditure 2015 Expenditure 2014
Estate Agency and Related Services (£) 1,489,182 1,294,812
Surveying and Valuation Services (£)  400,026 937,725
Total Expenditure (£)  1,889,208 2,232,537
This includes in-house training costs of £1,557,807 (2014: £1,950,795).
Health, Safety and Welfare
LSL places great importance on the health, safety and welfare of its employees. Regular training is supported by policies, together with 
Group standards and procedures, which aim to identify and remove any hazardous areas, reduce material risks of fi re and accidents or 
injuries to employees and visitors and, in conjunction with its HR policies, manage workplace stress levels.
To this end, LSL makes every reasonable eff ort to provide safe and healthy working conditions in all offi  ces and branches. Similarly, it is 
the duty of all employees to exercise responsibility and to do everything to prevent injury to themselves and to others.
Separate Health and Safety policies exist which employees are required to observe and the Group Chief Financial Offi  cer has overall 
responsibility for this. Compliance with legislation and Group policies is audited by the Group’s Risk and Internal Audit team with regular 
reporting to the Board, and includes indicators such as accident numbers.
Environmental Issues
LSL recognises that the environment has an intrinsic value, which is central to the quality of life and underpins economic development. 
As part of this understanding, LSL have assessed the main areas in which it is able to eff ect the largest reductions in the Group’s overall 
environmental impact.
The Group’s Environmental Policy is contained within the CSR Policy, which the Group Chief Financial Offi  cer, has overall responsibility for. 
Compliance with aspects of the CSR Policy is audited by the Group’s Risk and Internal Audit team with regular reporting to the Board.
Since 2010, LSL ’s ‘green’ priorities have been to:
• Improve energy effi  ciency and reduce energy usage
• Reduce waste and increase recycling
• Reduce transport generated CO
2
 emissions
Since the adoption of these ‘green’ priorities, LSL has sought to keep stakeholders informed on how LSL manages its environmental 
impacts and how it is performing. Stakeholders may also provide LSL with views and opinions which can strengthen LSL ’s approach to 
environmental management. Within this framework, LSL companies assess and manage the environmental impact of their operations 
to ensure that LSL is an active participant in the sustainable society and the LSL Board receives regular reports to enable it to monitor 
progress.
The Group continues to promote environmental awareness within the Group and to encourage the use of environmentally sensitive 
operating models.

Green Priorities 
and Environmental 
Initiatives:
Examples of Actions Continued in 2015:
Recycling •  Group companies working to specific targets in relation to the use of general waste services in and the use 
of dry mixed recycling.
•  Environmental waste friendly arrangements have been maintained via Biffa for the majority of activity and 
also with First Mile in London. The commissioning of Biffa’s new transfer stations has seen the Estate 
Agency Division increasingly utilising these facilities and recycling in excess of 80% of produced waste. 
During the year Marsh & Parsons instructed First Mile and recycled 53% of produced waste. e.surv 
participation has continued with the ‘Shred-Pro’ shredding and recycling programme which saved  
112 trees (2014: 121 trees). In addition, esurv recycled 86% of produced waste, equating to 7.4 tonnes 
(2014 comparison data not available).
•  Across the Group various recycling schemes are in place with Iron Mountain, which delivered the following 
benefits:
• 271 (2014: 173) cubic metre landfill reduction.
• 1,038,000 (2014: 761,457) trees saved.
• 87,386 (2014: 50,030) kilos of recycled paper produced.
Power Saving • Continued monitoring of energy consumption and benefits of energy saving initiatives.
•  Installation of Smart Meters to monitor electricity and gas consumption within some Estate Agency 
Division branches now completed at the majority of sites. Marsh & Parsons have installed LED window 
displays across all their branches, and just over half of their estate overall is primarily fitted with LED 
or other form of low energy lighting. At other Estate Agency Division branches the installation of LED 
window and wall displays continues via the annual branch refurbishment programmes.
• Encouraging the switching off of electrical equipment, such as printers and PCs overnight.
• Promotion of the installation of timer plugs and other devices.
Avoid/Limit Printing • Continued use of the “think before you print” note on emails to customers and employees.
•  Implementation of secure printing by Marsh & Parsons has resulted in a significant reduction in 
unnecessary reprints, generating a saving of 21% over comparable 2014 usage and spend.
• Continued investment in electronic record keeping avoiding the need to maintain paper files.
• Promote double sided photo copying and printing where paper records are necessary.
Remote Meetings 
(including training)
•  LSL employees are geographically spread out across the UK and where possible, meetings are 
held by telephone conference facilities to avoid the need for travel which provides both financial and 
environmental benefits to the Group.
•  Implementation and utilization of online training arrangements (e.g. Learning Matters) to encourage 
remote training and minimise travel delivering financial and environmental benefits.
Reduce Carbon 
Emissions
•  Encourage company car users to select energy efficient cars, and offer a range of hybrid and efficient 
dynamics diesel models on the company car list.
• See also mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reporting overleaf.

As can be seen above, since 2014 LSL ’s absolute emissions have decreased by 11%. This reduction is principally due to the Group’s 
programme of continual branch refurbishment across the Estate Agencies to improve effi  ciency and modernise the fi ttings, as well as the 
reduction in average FTE employees across the Group over the year and the disposal of a number of sites.
GHG reporting methodology:
The Group quantifi es and reports on its organisational greenhouse gas emissions according to Defra’s Environmental Reporting 
Guidelines and has utilised the UK Government 2015 Conversion Factors for Company Reporting in order to calculate CO2 equivalent 
emissions from corresponding activity data. LSL has also utilised data required for compliance with the CRC Energy Effi  ciency Scheme 
and the UK’s Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) (see below).
In order to improve monitoring and management of the Group’s climate change impact, LSL continued to commission independent 
environmental consultancy, Carbon Credentials Energy Services Limited to support with emissions reporting.
GHG reporting boundaries and limitations:
The emission sources included within this Report fall within the consolidated Financial Statement. LSL does not have responsibility for any 
emissions sources that are not included within the consolidated Financial Statement. LSL have not yet during 2015 calculated the Group’s 
fugitive refrigerants from air-conditioning equipment as these are considered to be de minimis, however, LSL may look to quantify and 
report on emissions from this source in future years.
The GHG sources that constitute LSL ’s operational boundary for the 2014/2015 reporting period are:
• Scope 1: Natural gas combustion within boilers and road fuel combustion within vehicles
• Scope 2: Purchased electricity consumption for our own use
GHG reporting assumptions and estimations
In some cases, missing data has been estimated using either extrapolation of available data from the reporting period or data from 
2013/2014 as a proxy.
Energy Savings Opportunities Scheme (ESOS)
During 2015, LSL undertook a number of energy audits to identify further opportunities for energy and emissions reductions and to ensure 
compliance to the new ESOS Regulations 2014 and Article 8 of the EU Energy Effi  ciency Direct, which came into force in the UK in July 2014.
The aim of ESOS is to aid organisations in its identifi cation of energy effi  cient savings to support and increase good energy management 
and it is part of the Government’s climate change initiative. The results of the audit were submitted to the Environment Agency in 
December 2015 and LSL ’s next audit is scheduled to take place in 2019.
The 2015 audit which was completed by a Lead ESOS Assessor, involved a review of energy consumption data and visits to selected 
branches and offi  ces. The recommendations arising from the audit, which were reported to the Board will during 2016, be reviewed and a 
plan formulated to ensure the achievement energy effi  cient savings and good energy management across the LSL Group.
In 2016, the Group is engaging with Carbon Credentials to set up a Group wide energy strategy to link the recommendations identifi ed 
through ESOS with the planned refurbishment programme for the retail portfolio.

Social and Community interests (including Human Rights and Ethical Issues)
LSL ’s social, community interests (which includes the promotion of human rights and ethical issues) objective is to establish a common 
and coherent approach among Group businesses and to support investment in the communities in which they operate. Group companies 
are sensitive to local communities cultural, social and economic needs. LSL is committed to acting responsibly wherever it operates and 
to engaging with stakeholders to manage the social, economic and environmental impact of all Group activities.
LSL ’s business has a direct impact on the local communities in which it operates and the Board recognises that good relations with local 
communities are fundamental to LSL ’s sustained success. Working in partnership with communities over a sustained period of time is the 
most effective way to achieve objectives and lasting change.
LSL supports its businesses in achieving these objectives by encouraging Group businesses to:
• make donations both to local and national charities;
• support and organise fundraising events including supporting charities and local community initiatives selected by Group companies; 
and
• support employees in their personal fundraising ambitions.
Further details of some specific charitable initiatives are set out below.
LSL ’s approach to the promotion of human rights and ethical issues is contained within the Group’s HR policies, which includes the 
Group’s Combined Ethics Policy, which is presented to the Board for annual review and approval. While all Group employees are made 
aware of the policy, the Risk and Internal Audit Team will audit awareness and compliance.
During 2015 LSL has been monitoring the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and during 2016 LSL is putting into place 
arrangements to ensure compliance with the the new requirements.
Charitable Donations
Workplace Giving:
LSL has implemented the ‘Workplace Giving’ initiative and all Group employees have been invited to participate. The initiative was 
launched in October 2010 and in 2015 LSL employees raised over £14,000. Over 160 employees participate in the scheme, which 
donates to a range of charities.
Working with professional fundraising organisations, Workplace Giving UK makes it possible for employees to make regular donations 
via the payroll system to a charity or charities of their choice on a tax free basis. The tax free element means that the charity benefits on 
receiving a higher amount. Further information can be found at: www.workplacegiving.co.uk/giving
Agents Giving (www.agentsgiving.org):
LSL ’s Estate Agency Division continues to support the Agents Giving as its primary charity.
Agents Giving, which was launched originally in 2007 as “The Estate Agency Foundation” and then rebranded in 2014, has as its objectives:
• encourage and support estate agents throughout the UK to raise funds for charitable causes;
• bring together the whole industry to contribute to charitable causes throughout the UK; and
• raise funds from supporters’ activities and central fundraising events which will be distributed to established and recognised charities.
The Group HR Director, Lisa Charles-Jones is a trustee of the charity, which was chosen due to its direct connection with property and 
estate agency. It brings together estate agents from all over the country with the hope that by using their collective fundraising skills, 
the Agents Giving initiative makes a significant contribution to communities. Lisa’s appointment ensures that LSL is able to support the 
charity’s initiatives and fundraising activities.
Surveying:
Within the Surveying Division, during 2015 a number of different charities (national and local) were supported by initiatives undertaken by 
e.surv Chartered Surveyors’ employees, which included the following:

World Marathon by the Group HR Director in Orlando. In addition, members of the Estate Agency Division completed a cycle ride from 
Land’s End to John O’Groats. In total the fundraising exceeded £60,000.

Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities in Relation to 
the Group Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group Financial Statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
Under Company Law the Directors must not approve the Group Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they present fairly 
the financial position of the Group and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group for that period. In preparing the Group 
Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Change in Accounting Estimates and Errors’ 
and then apply them consistently;
•  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
•  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and financial 
performance;
•  state that the Group has complied with IFRSs, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Financial 
Statements; and
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that 
the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Report of the Directors, the Directors‘ Remuneration 
Report, the Audit Committee Report and the Corporate Governance Report in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and 
applicable regulations, including the requirements of the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.

the Financial Statements. The Trustees have waived the right to any dividend payment in respect of each Share held by them in 2015 and 
to all future payments.
The second employee benefit trust was established in November 2011 (the 2011 EBT), as part of the acquisition of Marsh & Parsons. While 
the beneficiaries of the 2011 EBT are the LSL employees, the 2011 EBT acquired the Growth Shares as part of the transaction and some of 
these shares were acquired by members of the current management team of Marsh & Parsons in 2012 and 2013. This was in accordance 
with the previously stated objective that current and future managers at Marsh & Parsons apply for Growth Shares, as part of a package of 
measures designed to incentivise the management of Marsh & Parsons. The 2011 EBT does not currently hold any LSL shares.
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will 
continue to operate and meet its liabilities, as they fall due, for the next three years.
A period of three years has been chosen for the purpose of this viability statement, in line with the Group’s planning cycle.
The Directors’ assessment has been made with reference to the Group’s current position and prospects, the current three year strategy 
and the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties and how these are managed as detailed in pages 22 to 25 of the Strategic Report.
The strategic plan has been stress tested using sensitivity analysis which reflects plausible but severe combinations of the principal risks 
of the business, primarily through reducing revenues and cash flow as a result of a severe downturn in the UK property market.
Going Concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out 
in the Business Review sections of the Strategic Report. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and the 
Group’s policy for treasury and risk management are described in the Financial Review sections of the Strategic Report. Details of the 
Group’s borrowing facilities are set out in Note 21 to the Financial Statements. Note 29 to the Financial Statements describes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments 
and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. A description of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties and 
arrangements to manage these risks are detailed within the Strategic Report on pages 22 to 25.
As explained in Note 29 to the Financial Statements, the Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through a revolving 
credit facility, which was renewed in June 2013 and the Group currently has a £100.0m facility which is committed for a period up to 
August 2017. As stated in Note 21 to the Financial Statements as at 31
st
 December 2015 the Group had available £60.1m of undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the terms of its 
current facility.
The Directors have considered the future profitability of the Group, forecast of future cash flows, banking covenants, liquidity of 
investments and joint ventures and the ability of the Group to re-finance any loans due to mature in the next 12 months (including the 
Group’s facility which due to mature in August 2017) where necessary. Further the Directors considered the key judgments, assumptions 
and estimates underpinning the review.
Report of the Directors
40
LSL AR 2015_Sect1-3.indd   42 24/03/2016   15:30 After making enquiries, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing this Report.
Disclosure of Information to Auditors
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the external auditors, each of the current Directors, confirms that:
•  to the best of his/her knowledge and belief, there is no information (as defined in the Companies Act 2006) relevant to the preparation of 
this Report of which the external auditors are unaware; and
•  he/she has taken all the steps a Director might reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit information and to 
establish that the external auditors are aware of that information.
Directors’ Qualifying Third Party Indemnity Provisions
LSL had qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the benefit of the Directors in force from the start of the financial period to the date 
of this Report, subject to the conditions set out in the Companies Act 2006. LSL has put in place ‘Directors & Officers’ Liability’ insurance 
and indemnities to cover for this liability.
Additional Information for Shareholders
The following provides the additional information required for Shareholders as a result of the implementation of the Takeovers Directive 
into UK Law.
Share Capital
At 31
st
 December 2015, LSL ’s issued share capital comprised 104,158,950 0.2 pence Ordinary Shares. The authorised share capital is 
500,000,000 Ordinary Shares of 0.2 pence each. 
Ordinary Shares
On a show of hands at a general meeting of LSL every holder of Ordinary Shares present in person and entitled to vote shall have one 
vote and on a poll, every member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for every Ordinary Share held. The 
notice of the AGM which accompanies this Report specifies deadlines for appointing a proxy in relation to resolutions to be passed at a 
general meeting. Where the Chairman of the AGM is appointed as proxy, such proxy votes are counted and the numbers for, against or 
withheld in relation to each resolution are announced at the AGM and published on LSL ’s website after the meeting (www.lslps.co.uk).
There are no restrictions on the transfer of Ordinary Shares in LSL other than:
•  certain restrictions which may from time to time apply under applicable laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws and 
market requirements relating to close periods); and
• pursuant to the Listing Rules of the FCA whereby certain employees of LSL require the approval of LSL to deal in LSL ’s securities.
LSL ’s Articles of Association may only be amended by way of a special resolution at a general meeting of the Shareholders.
LSL has the authority under section 701 of the Companies Act 2006 to make market purchases of the Ordinary Shares of the Group on 
such terms and in such manner that the Directors determine. The maximum shares to buy back is capped at 10% of the Ordinary Share 
capital of the Group being 10,415,895 Ordinary Shares.
Company Share Schemes 
As at 31
st
 December 2015, the Trust held 1.6% (2014: 2.2%) of the issued share capital of LSL in trust for the benefit of employees of the 
Group and their dependents. The voting rights in relation to these shares are exercised by the Trustees.
Significant Agreements – Change of Control
Subsidiaries of LSL are party to agreements which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the subsidiary company 
following a takeover bid. The majority of the income derived through the provision of Surveying and Valuation Services and the Asset 
Management income streams are driven by specific contracts. Any termination of such contracts on the change of control of the relevant 
subsidiary company will have a significant impact on the revenue of those income streams.
The Group is party to a number of banking agreements which upon a change of control of the Group are terminable by the bank and all 
outstanding amounts become immediately due and payable.

Compensation for Loss of Offi  ce – Change of Control
There are no agreements between LSL and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of offi  ce or employment 
(whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Post Balance Sheet Event
Subsequent to the year end the following transactions have been completed:
a. LSL acquired three small lettings book acquisitions for a total initial consideration of £1.82m.
b .  O n 1 7
th
 February 2016, Your Move acquired a 65% interest in Group First Limited for an initial consideration of £9.1m, with 50% paid at 
completion and the remaining 50% in March 2017.
Management is in the process of allocating the purchase price in accordance with IFRS 3. As a result the initial accounting for the 
acquisition is currently incomplete, so a fair value table of the identifi able assets and liabilities has not been presented.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
Each of the Directors confi rms that to the best of their knowledge:
•  the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair review of the assets, 
liabilities, fi nancial position and results of LSL and its subsidiaries included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
•  the Strategic Report (including the Strategy, the Business Model, the Business Reviews, the Financial Review, the Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties, Corporate Social Responsibility Report and the Board) and the Directors’ Report (including the Corporate Governance 
Reports) include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of LSL and its subsidiaries included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and
•  the Report (including the Financial Statements), taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for Shareholders to assess LSL ’s performance, business model and strategy.

Report of the Directors
LSL AR 2015_Sect1-3.indd   44 24/03/2016   15:30 Corporate Governance Report
UK Corporate Governance Code (September 2014) (the Code) 
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and the Directors recognise the value and importance of 
meeting the principles of good corporate governance as set out in the Code. This part of the Report describes how LSL has complied 
with the Code during 2015 and the corporate governance arrangements that are in place for 2016.
During 2015, LSL complied with the provisions of the Code in all respects save only in relation to the appointment of Simon Embley as 
Chairman, which took effect on 1
st
 January 2015. The relevant provisions of the Code are:
a.   A.3.1, which states that a chairman should on appointment meet the independence criteria set out in B.1.1. Further a chief executive 
should not go on to be chairman of the same company. However, if by exception the board decided that a chief executive should 
become chairman, the board should consult major shareholders in advance and set out its reasons to shareholders both at the time of 
the appointment and in the next annual report.
b.   B.1.1, which stipulates the criteria for determining ‘independence’, namely that a director is not deemed independent if he has been an 
employee of the company/group within the last 5 years; has a significant shareholding; has participated in the company’s share option/
performance related pay scheme; or is a member of the pension scheme.
Prior to his appointment as Chairman, Simon Embley was an Executive Director in his roles as the Group’s Chief Executive Officer and 
then Deputy Chairman. The changes in Simon’s roles reflect the Board’s continued desire to implement an orderly succession and their 
wish to retain Simon’s knowledge and experience of the residential property market, maintain contacts with key stakeholders and benefit 
from his track record of delivering Shareholder value. Prior to Simon Embley’s appointment as Chairman, LSL has consulted with major 
Shareholders and their feedback was taken into account. Looking forward and in accordance with the provisions of the Code, whilst 
Simon did not meet the independence criteria on appointment, following appointment the test of independence is not appropriate in 
relation to the role of chairman. 
The Board
At the date of this Report, the Board has nine members, whose details are set out below. Details of changes to the Board which took 
place in 2015 and which are planned for 2016 are set out below.

had to respond to a number of changes. These changes comprised the appointment of Kumsal Bayazit Besson and David Stewart as 
Independent Non Executive Directors and the recruitment of Adam Castleton, as Group Chief Financial Officer.

Directors’ Report and Corporate 
Governance Reports

LSL AR 2015_Sect1-3.indd   45 24/03/2016   15:30 45
Further details on all Board changes are set out in this Corporate Governance Report and all of the Directors are listed with their 
biographies in the Board at pages 34 and 35 of this Report.
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive Officer. The Chairman’s key 
responsibilities are leadership of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness on all aspects of its role. The Chairman sets the Board’s agenda, 
ensuring that adequate time is available for discussion of all agenda items, and in particular strategic issues. He also promotes a culture 
of openness and debate by facilitating the effective contribution of the Non Executive Directors in particular, and ensuring constructive 
relations between the Executive and Non Executive Directors.
The Group Chief Executive Officer’s key responsibility is the running of the business and his delegated powers have been set by the Board 
and the Directors are satisfied that the balance of Executive and Non Executive Directors is appropriate and that no individual or group 
may dominate the Board’s decisions.
Excluding the Chairman, all of the Non Executive Directors are independent of management and are determined to be independent in 
accordance with B.1.1 of the  Code. The  current Non Executive Directors together have a range  of experience which is described in more 
detail overleaf in the Nominations Committee section.
As stated above, Simon Embley was not deemed to be independent prior to this appointment as Chairman. Other than an appointment to 
a small estate management company and to Road to Health a healthcare provider, Simon does not hold any other directorships.
During the year the Directors continuously review and are encouraged to provide feedback on the effectiveness of the Board. Further, 
they undertake an annual evaluation of the performance of the Board which includes an evaluation of the Board, its Committees and 
of individual Directors (including relevant skills, experience and diversity) to ensure that the Directors remain individually and collectively 
effective.
The evaluation process in 2015 involved discussions between each Director and the Chairman, meetings of the Board and discussions 
between the Non Executive Directors. As in previous years the Non Executive Directors have also evaluated the Chairman’s performance, 
after taking into account the views of the Executive Directors.
Whilst no significant issues requiring action arose from the 2015 evaluations, the outcomes of the exercise were reported to the Board 
and showed that the Board and its Committees were discharging their responsibilities effectively. The appraisal produced a number of 
recommendations to further improve effectiveness of the Board. As a result, during 2016 the Board will review its meeting arrangements, 
including the provision of information to Board members, to ensure that the Board is able to focus on the development and execution of 
LSL ’s strategy, as well as monitoring performance and governance matters.
During 2016, the Board will continue to monitor the results of the FRC’s discussion – UK Board Succession Planning, which was 
published in October 2015 and which considers key issues and identifies suggestion for good practice. This includes a review of best 
practice relating to board evaluation and consideration on the role of the nominations committee in succession planning arrangements.
LSL continues to recognise the benefits of diversity (including relevant skills, experience, gender and race) and the current Board 
composition includes two female Directors, Helen Buck and Kumsal Bayazit Besson, who are both independent Non Executive Directors.  
Whilst the Directors remain of the view that the setting of targets for the number of female directors on the Board is not necessary and 
that it will continue to appoint on merit, both the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Nominations Committee ensure that all 
searches (including those undertaken in 2015) continue to take into account diversity, including gender and race.
Copies of the Executive Directors’ service agreements and of the Non Executive Directors’ letters of appointment are available for 
inspection at the Registered Office during normal business hours and at each AGM.
All Directors may receive independent professional advice at LSL ’s expense, if necessary, for the performance of their duties. This is in 
addition to the access every Director has to the Company Secretary and her team. The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the 
Board on all matters of corporate governance, ensuring that all Board procedures are followed and facilitating training.
Each newly appointed Director receives an induction on a range of topics, including as appropriate, on the responsibilities of a listed 
public company director and on LSL ’s business. Thereafter, LSL provides the necessary resources for developing this understanding and 
knowledge. Further, the Chairman regularly reviews and agrees any training and development needs with each of the Directors and any 
training needs are also discussed as part of the annual evaluation exercise.
During 2015 the Board held 14 scheduled meetings (including a three year planning meeting and a strategy meeting). Each of the 
Directors was able to allocate sufficient time to LSL to discharge their responsibilities effectively and the attendance of each of the 
Directors at the Board meetings (as a Director or a Committee member) is set out below. During 2016 the Board is scheduled to meet 10 
times (including a three year planning meeting and a strategy meeting). Additional meetings will be held as required.
During 2015 the Non Executive Directors collectively met three times without the Executive Directors being present and it is the intention 
that this will be repeated in 2016. In addition, the Non Executive Directors intend to meet at least once in the year without the Chairman 
being present.

provided her comments and queries to the Chairman of the meeting and the Group Chief Executive Officer for raising at the meetings. 
3    Adam Castleton joined the Board on 2
nd
 November 2015 and therefore his attendance is only recorded for meetings taking place after his appointment.
4   Mark Morris was not present at one of the Nominations Committee meeting during 2015. He received the papers and provided his comments and queries to the Chairman of the meeting 
and the Group Chief Executive Officer for raising at the meetings.
5    David Stewart joined the Board and its Nominations, Remuneration and Audit Committees on 1
st
 May 2015 and therefore his attendance is only recorded for meetings taking place after his

In accordance with LSL ’s Articles of Association, all of the Directors appointed since the previous AGM and circa one-third of the 
remaining Directors, including any Director who has not been elected or re-elected at either of the two preceding AGMs, are required to 
retire and seek election/re-election (as appropriate). Notwithstanding this, since 2012 LSL has in accordance with best practice and by an 
amendment to the Nominations Committee Terms of Reference, chosen to adopt annual elections for all Directors and in accordance with 
this policy, all of the Directors will stand for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.
The Board is primarily responsible for the overall management of the Group and for decisions on Group strategy, including approval 
of the Group’s strategy, its annual business plans and budgets, the interim and full year financial statements and reports, any dividend 
proposals, the accounting policies, any major capital projects, any investments and disposals, its succession plans and the monitoring of 
financial performance against budget and forecast and the formulation of the Groups risk appetite including the identification, assessment 
and monitoring of LSL ’s principal risks. In accordance with best practice, LSL has adopted a policy of Matters Reserved for the Board 
which is annually reviewed by the Board and any items not included within the policy (such as responsibility for implementing the Board’s 
strategy and managing the business) are delegated to the Management Team(s).
There is a programme of regular reviews of performance and developing best practice in matters such as employment, health and 
safety, environmental and social and community interests (including human rights and ethical issues). LSL believes that Corporate Social 
Responsibility is necessary to support responsibly-grounded business decision making that considers the broad impact of corporate 
actions on people, communities, and the environment. Accordingly, the Board takes account of the significance of environmental, social 
and governance matters (ESG) when making decisions. Further details of LSL ’s CSR objectives can be found in the CSR statement 
included in this Report.
The Board has adopted principles of good boardroom practice which set out procedures on how Directors are given accurate, timely 
and clear information and how they can seek and obtain information or advice necessary for them to discharge their duties and these 
arrangements are reviewed annually as part of the Board’s evaluation process referred to above.
Under the Companies Act 2006, a director must avoid a situation where he/she has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, 
or possibly may conflict, with the company’s interest. The Companies Act 2006 allows directors of public companies to authorise 
conflicts and potential conflicts where appropriate and where the articles of association contain a provision to this effect, as LSL ’s Articles 
do. Accordingly, the Board has adopted procedures for the Directors to report any potential or actual conflict to the Board for their 
authorisation where appropriate. Each Director is aware of the requirement to seek approval of the Board for any new conflict situations, 
as they may arise. The process of reviewing conflicts disclosed, and authorisations given, is repeated both annually and following the 
appointment of any new Director. Any conflicts or potential conflicts considered by the Board and any authorisations given are recorded in 
the Board minutes and in a register of Director’s conflicts which is maintained by the Company Secretary.

Board Committees
The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to three standing committees of the Board: Nominations, Remuneration and Audit. The 
membership of these committees and a summary of their main duties under their Terms of Reference are set out below. The full Terms of 
Reference may be viewed on LSL ’s website (www.lslps.co.uk). During 2015, the Board reviewed the Terms of Reference for each of the 
Committees and during 2016 will continue to review its terms of reference in response to amendments to FRC guidance and the Code.
It is also the intention that Bill Shannon as Chairman of the Nominations Committee and Remuneration Committee and Mark Morris as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee will both attend the 2016 AGM to answer any questions.
Nominations Committee
Bill Shannon is the Chairman of the Nominations Committee and, as at the date of this Report the other members of the Committee are 
Helen Buck, Mark Morris, Kumsal Bayazit Besson (appointed on 1
st
 September 2015) and David Stewart (appointed on 1
st
 May 2015).
The Committee met four times in 2015 and the Group Chief Executive Officer, Deputy Chairman, Group HR Director and Company 
Secretary were invited to attend some of these meetings and assisted the Nominations Committee in its deliberations during this period.
The duties of the Nominations Committee are governed by its Terms of Reference, which was reviewed in 2015 to ensure continued 
compliance with the Code and its role includes:
 a.  to regularly review the structure, size and composition (including skills, knowledge and experience) required of the Board and make 
recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes;
 b.  prior to recommending any appointments, evaluate the balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge on the Board, its 
diversity, including gender and race and in light of this evaluation, prepare a description of the role and capabilities required for each 
particular appointment;
 c.  to give full consideration to succession planning for the Directors and senior management (as specified by the Board), taking into 
account the challenges and opportunities facing LSL, and what skills and expertise are therefore needed on the Board in the future. 
The plans are also reviewed to ensure orderly succession for appointments to the Board and to senior management, so that LSL 
maintains an appropriate balance of skills and experience within the Group and on the Board to ensure progressive refreshing of the 
Board;
 d.  to recommend to the Board as a whole the selection and appointment of new executive and non executive directors in accordance 
with the Code, ensuring that any search is conducted, and appointments made, on merit, against objective criteria, with due regard 
for the benefits of diversity on the Board, including gender and race; 
 e.  report on the nomination of all new Board appointments and undertake an annual performance evaluation to ensure that all members 
of the Board have devoted sufficient time to their duties;
 f.  to keep under review the leadership needs of the Group at varying levels with a view to ensuring the continued ability to compete 
effectively in LSL ’s marketplaces; 
 g.  to ensure that as part of the process for nominating candidates for any appointments, details are obtained and reviewed of any 
interests that the candidate may have which conflict or may conflict with the interest of LSL; and 
 h.  to ensure that prior to the appointment of the Chairman, a job description is prepared which includes an assessment of the time 
commitment expected for the role. 
As part of its discussions in 2015 the Nominations Committee considered the composition of the Board and the balance of skills and 
experience required. These discussions included diversity, and in particular gender and race. In particular the Nominations Committee 
considered and, where appropriate made recommendations to the Board on the following matters during 2015:
 a. The appointment of David Stewart and Kumsal Bayazit Besson into the roles of Independent Non Executive Directors
 b. The appointment of Adam Castleton as Group Chief Financial Officer 
Whilst an executive search agency assisted in the recruitment of Kumsal Bayazit Besson and Adam Castleton, the Nominations 
Committee did not require the services of any agency in the appointment of David Stewart nor did it consider any other candidates for  
this role.
Following the changes in 2015, the LSL Board has expertise in strategy, technology, estate agency, surveying, financial services, the 
residential housing sector, retail and marketing, operations, business services, entrepreneurial private and public companies, finance, 
customer and employee matters, and corporate governance.
LSL is committed to promoting diversity throughout the Group. In previous years, LSL has reported on studies undertaken in relation to 
gender diversity. Whilst the recommendations flowing from these studies continue to be implemented in 2015, LSL undertook an age and 
gender analysis of its employee opinion survey which revealed that whilst feedback from employees is consistent regardless of gender, 
there are differences in relation to age groups. This feedback will be taken into account in Group employee initiatives going forward.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Bill Shannon and at the date of this Report its other members are Mark Morris, Helen Buck, 
Kumsal Bayazit Besson (appointed on 1
st
 September 2015) and David Stewart (appointed on 1
st
 May 2015).
The Committee met three times during the year and the Group Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman, the Group HR Director and the 
Company Secretary were invited to attend meetings and assist the Remuneration Committee in its deliberations during this period.
The duties of the Remuneration Committee are governed by its Terms of Reference, which were reviewed in 2015 to ensure continued 
compliance with the Code. The Terms of Reference of the Remuneration Committee are available from the Company Secretary or LSL ’s 
website www.lslps.co.uk.
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for determining LSL ’s policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors and selected 
senior managers, including pension rights and any compensation payments. It is also responsible for making recommendations for grants 
of shares under the employee share schemes. The Directors’ Remuneration Report provides details of how the Committee has discharged 
these duties which can be found from page 55 of this Report.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for ensuring that the Executive Directors and selected senior managers’ remuneration is 
designed to promote the long-term success of LSL and for 2016 they have again recommended performance-related elements which 
are transparent, stretching and rigorously applied. In discharging its duties, the Remuneration Committee considers LSL ’s peers and also 
ensures that a significant proportion of the Executive Directors’ remuneration is structured so as to link rewards to corporate and individual 
performance and that it is sensitive to pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group, especially when determining annual salary 
increases.
During 2015, the Remuneration Committee’s overall purpose was to ensure that the levels of remuneration were sufficient to attract, 
retain and motivate Directors of the quality required to run LSL successfully. In addition, it was responsible for reviewing and making 
recommendations to the Board on any remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors departed from the Board during the year.
Details of any remuneration consultants engaged by the Remuneration Committee during the year are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report.
None of the current Remuneration Committee members have and nor did the 2015 Remuneration Committee members have any personal 
financial interest (other than as Shareholders), any conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships; or any day to day involvement in 
running the business. The Remuneration Committee recognises and manages conflicts of interest when receiving views from the Executive 
Directors or senior managers about any proposals. The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board and no Director is 
permitted to participate in any discussion about their remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee may, in exercising its discretion in relation to the remuneration of Executive Directors and selected senior 
managers, take into account LSL ’s performance on governance (including regulatory compliance) and CSR related issues and it ensures 
that the incentive schemes put in place do not raise any ESG issues by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee is chaired by Mark Morris and at the date of this Report, its other members are Bill Shannon, Kumsal Bayzit Besson 
(appointed on 1
st
 September 2015) and David Stewart (appointed on 1
st
 May 2015). At the 2016 AGM, Mark Morris will retire from the 
Board and its Committee, including as Chairman of the Audit Committee. Subject to him being elected at the AGM, David Stewart will 
be appointed as Chairman of the Audit Committee, and the Board and Nominations Committee have determined that David Stewart has 
recent and relevant financial experience as is required by the Code.
The Committee met on four occasions in 2015. LSL ’s Head of Risk and Internal Audit, the external auditors, the Chairman, the Executive 
Directors (including the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer), the Group Financial Controller and the 
Company Secretary were invited to attend these meetings to assist the Audit Committee in its deliberations during this period. The Audit 
Committee met with the auditors without the Executive Directors being present twice during 2015.
Further details of the duty and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are shown from page 49 of this Report.
Shareholder Relations 
LSL places a great deal of importance on communication with its stakeholders and is committed to establishing constructive relationships 
with investors and potential investors in order to assist it in developing an understanding of the views of its Shareholders.
LSL maintains a dialogue with institutional Shareholders through regular meetings with such Shareholders to discuss strategy, performance 
and governance matters and to obtain investor feedback. The views of the Shareholders expressed during these meetings are reported

to the Board. In addition presentations will be arranged from time to time for Shareholders and analysts, including after the interim and 
preliminary results.
Steps are taken to ensure that all members of the Board understand the views of major Shareholders. This is achieved in a number of ways 
including feedback from the corporate advisors, Executive Directors and the distribution of analysts’ reports to the Board.
In addition each year all of the Non Executive Directors, including the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman and the Senior Independent Director, 
are offered the opportunity to attend meetings with all Shareholders as they require. If any Shareholder or any Shareholder representative 
groups would like to discuss any issues or concerns with the Non Executive Directors, they can be contacted through the Company 
Secretary’s office (see Shareholder Information at page 154 of this Report for details).
With regard to individual Shareholders, the Board considers that the main forum for communication is at the AGM and all of the current 
Directors will be available at the 2016 AGM to meet with investors.
All of LSL ’s announcements are published on the LSL website (www.lslps.co.uk), together with copies of presentation material and financial 
reports.
Model Code
LSL complies with a code on securities dealings in relation to its Ordinary Shares which is consistent with the Model Code published in 
the Listing Rules. This code applies to the Directors and relevant employees of LSL and will be reviewed during 2016 in response to the 
implementation of the Market Abuse Regulations.
Takeover Directive
The Group has addressed the matters required to be addressed by the Takeover Directive which was implemented in the UK in 
accordance with statutory provisions in Part 28 of the Companies Act 2006 in the Report of the Directors. Please refer to the Report of 
the Directors for further details.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report on the activities of the Audit Committee during the 2015 financial year. The Audit Committee, on behalf of the 
Board, has ensured that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable.
In this report I have detailed how the Audit Committee has discharged its responsibilities.
Members of the Audit Committee have continued to take an active role in understanding the business and the risks and challenges 
it faces, particularly as the Group has been without a permanent Group Chief Financial Officer for much of the year. Progress 
has been made on a number of fronts in improving the performance of the Group Finance function and development of our risk 
framework, but there is further improvement to be delivered under our new Group Chief Financial Officer. Also set out within this 
part of the Report are details on the processes we have in place to safeguard the independence and objectivity of our relationship 
with the external auditor and the role played by the Risk and Internal Audit Team to ensure we have in place effective control and risk 
management processes.

Audit Committee Report
 What the Audit Committee did in 2015:
The Audit Committee met three times in 2015, during which time the Committee:
 a. reviewed the interim and year end results and preliminary announcement;
 b.  received and considered, as part of the review of the interim and annual financial statements, reports from the external auditor in 
respect of their review of the interim results and annual financial statements, the audit plan for the year and the results of the annual 
audit. These reports included the scope of the interim review and annual audit, the approach to be adopted by the external auditor  
to address and conclude upon key estimates and other key audit areas, the basis on which the auditor assesses materiality, the  
terms of engagement for the external auditor and an on-going assessment of the impact of future accounting developments on the 
Group; 
 c.  considered this Report, including the Financial Statements in the context of fairness, balance and understandability to ensure that  
the Committee was in a position to report to the Board that the Annual Report and Accounts 2015 when taken as a whole is 
fair, balanced and understandable on the basis that the description of the business agrees with the Audit Committee’s own 
understanding, the risks reflect the issues that concerned the Audit Committee, appropriate weight has been given to the ‘good and 
bad’ news, the discussion of performance properly reflects the ‘story’ of the year and that there is a clear and well-articulated link 
between all areas of disclosure;
 d.  considered the effectiveness and independence of the external audit and recommended to the Board for approval by Shareholders at 
the 2016 AGM, the re-appointment of Ernst & Young as external auditor. The Committee also confirmed its intention to complete an 
audit services tendering exercise in 2016 ahead of the 2017 financial year;
 e.  considered the effectiveness of internal audit and agreed the annual Risk and Internal Audit plan, including compliance with both 
internal standards and external regulatory requirements, and its linkage to Group risks; plus engagement with external consultants on 
specialist areas as appropriate;
 f.  received and considered regular reports from the Risk and Internal Audit Team with regard to the control environment of the Group;
 g.  considered the review of material business risks, including reviewing internal control processes used to identify and monitor principal 
risks and uncertainties. An update of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties was presented to the Audit Committee for 
discussion at each meeting and during the year the Audit Committee supported the Board in its robust assessment of LSL ’s principal 
risks and the development of the Group’s risk appetite framework;
 h.  evaluated areas for the continued development of financial control structures, including the reporting of PI claims; payment control 
arrangements; strengthened the role and effectiveness of the Group’s finance functions; and the resourcing and control environment 
in relation to the Group’s acquisition activities;
 i.  continued to develop the systems and controls in place with regard to valuations carried out by the Surveying Division, including 
strengthening the effectiveness of second-line structures;
 j.    initiated steps to further enhance the Group’s information security arrangements;
 k. reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s whistleblowing policy, including logs of any whistleblowing-related incidents;
 l.   reviewed the Audit Committee’s composition and confirmed that there is sufficient expertise and resource for the Audit Committee to 
fulfil its responsibilities effectively;
 m. reviewed the Audit Committee’s Terms of Reference; and
 n. carried out an annual review of the Audit Committee’s performance.

Significant issues considered in relation to the Financial Statements
During the year the Audit Committee, the Management Team, the Head of Risk and Internal Audit together with the external auditor 
considered and concluded on what the significant risks and issues were in relation to the Financial Statements and how these would be 
addressed. Areas of particular focus during the year have been:  
Significant Judgments in 
Financial Reporting for 2015
How the Audit Committee Addressed these Judgments
Revenue recognition The Group sells a number of different products and services and operates in multiple locations throughout the UK. 
Revenue recognition is considered to be material to the Group although the nature of the revenue recognised in the 
Group is not considered complex. LSL ’s Risk and Internal Audit Team performed financial control audits on all key 
subsidiaries in 2015 which included focus on the revenue cycle with findings reported to the Audit Committee for 
discussion.
Provision for PI Costs relating to 
valuation services
Given the materiality of the PI costs provision, the Board receives monthly updates on the status of the provision 
which includes the status of existing claims and the number and nature of new claims. The Group has historically 
experienced a high level of claims relating to the 2004 to 2008 high risk lending period, and continues to receive 
claims relating to valuation work undertaken during this period.
During 2015, the Management Team continued to undertake a detailed review on a case-by-case basis of all 
notifications and claims relating to this period. The review has also included an assessment of the claims and 
notifications on a case-by-case basis by specialist external legal counsel.
The Committee also commissioned Risk and Internal Audit to complete two internal audit reviews of this work and 
during the year further improvements to the reporting of claims and notifications have also been implemented.
The results of the reviews were presented to the Audit Committee and the Board during 2015.
Acquisition accounting In 2015 the Board approved a number of acquisitions including Thomas Morris and 30 small lettings books. During 
the year, the Audit Committee has, in relation to the acquisition accounting, reviewed the way in which intangibles 
and goodwill are recognised, and the treatment of earn-out and other contingent consideration.
Client monies accounts with regard 
to the Lettings businesses
The Group holds client monies within its Lettings businesses. Neither the client monies, nor the matching liabilities 
to such clients are included in the Group balance sheet, as the Group is not entitled to the benefit from the use 
of the amount held in these accounts. The Group does have a responsibility to ensure that the money held in the 
client accounts is appropriate and if required, the Group would make good any shortfall. The client accounts are 
reconciled at regular intervals (including daily exercises for the larger businesses) and the Risk and Internal Audit 
Team perform regular client account audits and findings are reported to the Audit Committee.
Other Financial Statement 
Matters considered by the 
Committee
How the Audit Committee Addressed these Judgments
Going Concern The Management Team provided the Audit Committee with a paper on the ability of the Group to continue as a 
going concern. This paper considered the future profitability of the Group, forecast of future cash flows, banking 
covenants, liquidity of investments and joint ventures and the ability of the Group to re-finance any loans (including 
the Group’s facility which is due to mature in August 2017) where necessary.
The key judgments, assumptions and estimates underpinning this review were discussed and considered. 
Following the review, the Audit Committee was able to conclude that the adoption of the going concern principle 
was justified for the foreseeable future.
Viability Statement The Management Team provided the Audit Committee with a paper on the financial viability of the Group, which was 
determined over a three year period, which is consistent with the period of the Group’s strategic plan. This paper 
included a review of the principal risks, and considered which of these risks might threaten the Group’s viability. It also 
considered and modelled a number of severe but plausible scenarios.
The scenario modelling considered a significant downturn in the property market, plus scenarios involving conflating 
smaller risks, and took into account the Group’s ability to refinance its facility, which is due to mature in August 2017.
The key judgments, assumptions and modelling underpinning the review were discussed and considered. Following 
the review, the Audit Committee was able to approve the statement and recommend its adoption by the Board.
50
LSL AR 2015_Sect1-3.indd   53 24/03/2016   15:30 53
Treatment of exceptional items The Audit Committee has, in line with FRC guidance, reviewed the Group’s previous accounting policy with regard 
to the classification of items as exceptional.
Available for sale assets The Group holds minority shareholdings in Zoopla, VEM and the GPEA.  
The Audit Committee has considered the fair value of these holdings for the inclusion in the Group’s balance sheet.
Impairment of goodwill and 
intangible assets
The Management Team annually provide the Audit Committee with a paper supporting the review of goodwill to 
assess whether any impairment is required.
Based on the work performed, the Audit Committee was able to conclude that no impairment was necessary to the 
goodwill or intangible assets as at 31
st
 December 2015. Further information is provided in the Notes to the Financial 
Statements.
Taxation The Audit Committee has received reports from the Management Team on the tax provisions recorded in the 
Financial Statements.
Misstatement due to fraud and 
error
The Management Team submit regular reports and updates to the Audit Committee on the Group’s fraud 
prevention arrangements, including details of any incidences of any actual or suspected circumstances.
LMS The Group acquired 33.33% of LMS in 2011 and increased its holding to 49.99% in 2014 with part of the contingent 
consideration for the 2014 acquisition deferred for payment in 2016, based on LMS’s performance in 2015. Accordingly, 
during 2015, the Audit Committee has considered the accounting treatment of the contingent consideration.
Appointment of External Auditor
Whilst the Audit Committee has not undertaken a tendering exercise in 2015, it has conducted a review of the auditor’s
effectiveness, independence and objectivity. In making its assessment of the effectiveness of the external audit, the Audit
Committee reviewed the external audit findings and the Management Team’s responses to these findings. In addition,
discussions were held with the Risk and Internal Audit Team and Management Teams with regard to the effectiveness of
the audit process.
Taking into account the abovementioned factors, the Audit Committee, acting on behalf of the Directors, has concluded
that Ernst & Young is effective, independent and objective, and based on this conclusion, the Board will recommend to
Shareholders the reappointment of Ernst & Young as external auditor at the 2016 AGM and seek authority for the
Directors to agree the external auditor’s remuneration.
During 2014, the European Parliament and Council adopted measures which will reform the statutory audit market and
impact all UK listed companies. The new Directive (which amends the existing 2006 Directive), will be implemented into
UK law by 16
th
 June 2016, requiring UK listed companies to change their external auditor every 10 years with effect for
financial years beginning on or after 17
th
 June 2016.
LSL is closely monitoring the implementation of the EU Audit Directive and Regulation into the UK. Ernst & Young have acted as LSL ’s 
external auditors since 2004 with a tendering exercise undertaken in 2007. In accordance with the draft guidance included within the 
Department of Business  Innovation and Skills consultation, which was published in October 2015, Ernst & Young’s current term will 
expire at the end of 2016 and LSL will be required to conduct an audit tendering exercise ahead of the 2017 audit. Ernst & Young will be 
eligible to participate in this tendering exercise, although their total term will be subject to a 20 year cap. LSL will continue to monitor the 
implementation of the reforms into UK law and notes the content of the feedback document published by the Department of Business 
Innovation and Skills in January 2016.
The purpose of the audit tendering exercise will be to benchmark the quality and effectiveness of the services provided by
the incumbent auditor against those offered by other firms, with the aim of obtaining the best quality and most effective audit.
Auditor Independence Policy
To guard against the objectivity and independence of the external auditors being compromised, the Audit Committee has
adopted a policy under which any non-audit related services provided by the external auditors must be approved by the
Committee or be within a pre-approved category and a pre-approved fee limit (Auditor Independence Policy). The Audit
Committee is kept regularly informed of the fees paid to the auditor in all capacities.
Under the terms of the Auditor Independence Policy, which takes into account the relevant ethical guidance regarding the
provision of non-audit services by external audit firms, the following categories of fee need pre-approval from the Audit
Committee:
 a. any fee for specific non-audit services which exceed £25,000;
 b. any fee which has a contingent element; and
 c. where the total of the fees for non-audit services in any particular year is likely to exceed the audit fee for the year.

Directors’ Report and Corporate 
Governance Reports
53
The Auditor Independence Policy stipulates restrictions and procedures in relation to the potential allocation of non-audit
work to the auditor. These include categories of work which may and may not be allocated to the auditor, subject to certain
provisions as to materiality, nature of and competency to perform work.
A copy of the Auditor Independence Policy is available at LSL ’s website: (www.lslps.co.uk).
The split between audit and non-audit fees for 2015 appears at Note 9 to the Financial Statements. The non-audit fees
amounted to £60,000 (2014: £83,000) compared with audit fees and other assurance related services fees of £432,300
(2014: £271,000). This is in line with the provisions of the Auditor Independence Policy. The non-audit fees for the current
and prior year relate to taxation services.
Internal Controls 
The Board has overall responsibility for LSL ’s system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system of internal controls 
is subject to an on-going process of change and improvement, and was originally designed in accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull 
Committee on Internal Controls and it is regularly reviewed and was updated in 2015 to take into account the guidance set out in the 
September 2014 FRC “Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting”.
The arrangements in place for 2015 sought to identify, evaluate and manage significant risks faced by LSL, including assessments of risk 
appetite levels and measures to define levels of existing risk in relation to tolerable boundaries. The system aimed to manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Internal control facilitates the effectiveness and efficiency of LSL ’s operations, helps to ensure the reliability of internal and external reporting 
and assists compliance with laws and regulations. The internal controls are also in place to safeguard both Shareholder investment and 
LSL’s assets.
In order to discharge this responsibility, the Board has established the procedures necessary to apply both the Code and relevant FRC 
guidance, including clear operating procedures, distinct lines of responsibility and delegated authorities. LSL ’s risk management and internal 
control procedures and framework has continually evolved since LSL was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2006 and is regularly 
reviewed by the Board and the Audit Committee and continues to be in place up to the date of this Report. The risk framework will continue 
to evolve in 2016 in line with emerging best practice.
LSL ’s risk management and internal control framework is made up of the following parts:
 a. Risk assessment
 b. Control environment
 c. Control activities
 d. Monitoring
 e. Information and communication
In particular, the Group has in place internal control and risk management systems in relation to LSL ’s financial reporting procedures and 
the process for preparation of consolidated accounts. These systems include policies and procedures to facilitate the maintenance of 
records that accurately and fairly reflect transactions, provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS or UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, as appropriate, and that 
require reported data to be reviewed and reconciled.
Further, LSL operates a management structure with delegated authority levels and functional reporting lines and accountability. It also 
operates a budgeting and financial reporting system which compares actual performance to latest forecast, budget and to the previous year 
on a monthly basis. In addition, the Executive Directors receive daily information on sales activity and weekly information on key result areas. 
All capital expenditure and other purchases are subject to appropriate authorisation procedures.
In addition, LSL has established a Financial Services Management Committee (FSMC) and a Financial Services Risk Committee (FSRC) 
which are both Executive Committees with roles and responsibilities relating to the management of LSL ’s FCA regulated Financial Services 
businesses. Equivalent governance bodies also exist for other business operations, for example, the Estate Agency Management 
Committee. The Audit Committee and the Board receives regular reports from the FSMC and FSRC along with updates from the Group’s 
Customer Outcomes Committee, whose focus is to monitor key performance indicators in relation to LSL ’s key customer groups, being 
consumers and key lender clients.
During 2015 the Executive Directors have regularly identified, evaluated and managed the principal risks and uncertainties which could 
adversely affect LSL ’s business, operating results and financial condition. The effectiveness of the internal control system and risk 
management process is also kept under review by the Audit Committee and has been reviewed by the Board during 2015 as part of an 
annual review which considered the effectiveness of the risk management arrangements and internal control systems. This review covered 
52
LSL AR 2015_Sect1-3.indd   55 24/03/2016   15:30 55
Audit Committee Report
all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls. In addition, LSL ’s Risk and Internal Audit Team regularly 
submits reports to the Audit Committee and this, together with the internal controls system and risk management process in place within 
LSL, allows the Board to monitor financial and operational performance and compliance with controls on a continuing basis and to identify 
and respond to business risks as they arise.
During the year the Committee reviewed progress on a number of matters identified in 2014 intended to improve the control environment, 
in particular the effectiveness of the Group Finance function as a second line of defence. Whilst progress has been made on a number 
of fronts, because the Group has not had a permanent Chief Financial Officer for much of the year there is still work to be done. The 
Committee will closely monitor progress on these outstanding matters during 2016.
The principal risks and uncertainties facing LSL together with details of key mitigation initiatives is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 
22 and 25.

Directors’  
Remuneration Report
Annual Statement 
Dear Shareholder
This report sets out the remuneration policy for the Directors of LSL and discloses amounts paid to individuals who were members 
of the Board over the course of the financial year ended 2015. This Directors’ Remuneration Report is divided into the following three 
sections:
•  Annual Statement: summarising and explaining the major decisions on, and any substantial changes to the Directors’ remuneration 
in the year;
•  Directors’ Remuneration Policy: setting out the basis of remuneration for the Directors that has applied since the three-year policy 
was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM; and
•  Annual Report on Remuneration: setting out the remuneration earned by the Directors in the year ended 31
st
 December 2015 and 
how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be implemented in 2016.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy (referred to in this Directors’ Remuneration Report as the Policy) is subject to a binding vote every 
three years (sooner if changes are made to the Policy) whereas the Annual Statement and Annual Report on Remuneration are subject 
to an annual Shareholder advisory vote and will be presented to Shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
The Policy was submitted to and was approved by Shareholders at the 2014 AGM and, as no changes to the Policy have been 
proposed, it is not being submitted for Shareholder approval at the 2016 AGM although changes introduced by the Code (September 
2014) have been taken into account in the implementation of the Policy during 2016 (see the Annual Report on Remuneration for further 
details).
Summary of LSL’s performance in the year
In 2015 LSL made good progress against a backdrop of rapidly changing market conditions and the 2015 Executive Directors’ 
bonus awards reflect this. The 2015 bonus scheme was made up of 80% based on LSL ’s financial performance plus 20% based on 
individually agreed non-financial measures. The Executive Directors’ bonus scheme is subject to a 100% of basic salary cap.
Based on LSL ’s performance in 2015, eligible Executive Directors received an annual bonus equivalent to between 35% and 80% of 
salary in respect of the financial performance element and between 10% and 13.3% of the available 20% of salary for performance 
against individual non-financial measures.
Further, Simon Embley and Ian Crabb are expected to receive 66.81% of their 2013 LTIP awards in accordance with the challenging 
performance conditions based on the Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Total Shareholder Return (TSR). The awards which are due to vest 
in April 2016 are expected to deliver based on the EPS element of the targets only. Further details of incentive payments are set out in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Summary of key decisions in the year
The Remuneration Committee continually reviews the senior executive remuneration policy to ensure it promotes the attraction, 
motivation and retention of the high quality executives who have been key to delivering LSL ’s strategy in the past and who will be key to 
delivering sustainable earnings growth and Shareholder return in the future. The Remuneration Committee’s most recent conclusions 
are that the existing senior executive remuneration policy remains appropriate and should continue to operate for 2016. Specifically, the 
Remuneration Committee felt that:
 a.  basic salary levels are considered to be broadly appropriate and in line with the Policy. Details of any basic salary adjustments are 
set out at the start of the Annual Report on Remuneration;
 b. the annual bonus continues to work well; and
 c.  the long-term incentive grant policy, whereby nil-cost awards are granted annually up to a maximum normal limit of 100% of 
salary (200% in exceptional circumstances) with vesting based on EPC (70%) and relative TSR (30%) performance conditions and 
continued service, provides a strong alignment between the senior executive team and Shareholders. The existing LTIP scheme 
which was put in place in November 2006 is due to expire in November 2016. Accordingly, a replacement plan will be presented 
for Shareholder approval at the 2016 AGM along with replacement SIP/BAYE, SAYE and CSOP schemes. As the proposed 
scheme is similar to and based on the 2006 LTIP scheme, no changes are required to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.

In addition to the above, and in relation to the Board changes which took place during 2015, the Remuneration Committee has also 
dealt with the recruitment of a new Group Chief Financial Officer (Adam Castleton) in November 2015.
Further details of the remuneration packages recommended and received are described in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
In relation to the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors and senior managers, the Remuneration Committee ensures 
that they are aligned to the LSL ’s strategic goals and key performance indicators. Further, the Remuneration Committee believes 
that the current remuneration policy continues to promote the long-term success of LSL and to incentivise the delivery of strong yet 
sustainable financial results with the creation of Shareholder value.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy (Policy)
Introduction and Overview
The Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM and the Directors are not recommending any amendments for 2016. A 
detailed review of the Policy will be carried out in advance of the 2017 AGM, when it is intended that the new Policy will be submitted for 
Shareholder approval.
The Board recognises that the Directors’ remuneration is of legitimate concern to Shareholders and is committed to following current best 
practice. The Group operates within a competitive environment; performance depends on the individual contributions of the Directors and 
employees and LSL believes in rewarding vision and innovation.
When setting the Executive Directors’ remuneration, the Remuneration Committee endeavours to ensure that all Executive Directors are 
provided with appropriate profit related pay and an element of pay relates to non-financial performance measures to encourage enhanced 
performance and that they are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
LSL ’s policy is to provide executive remuneration packages designed to attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors of the calibre 
necessary to maintain and improve the Group’s profitability and effectiveness and to reward them for enhancing Shareholder value and 
return. To do this, it aims to provide a market competitive (but not excessive) package of pay and benefits. The Group’s general policy is 
to set basic salaries around mid-market levels and set performance pay levels which are at the upper quartile of market practice but with 
stretching goals that accord with the Group’s general policy of seeking to make bonuses self-financing wherever possible. Remuneration 
packages will also reflect the Executive Director’s responsibilities and contain incentives to deliver the Group’s objectives.
As noted in the Remuneration Committee Chairman’s Letter on page 55, the Policy has not been updated from that approved by 
Shareholders at the 2014 AGM, but it is included here for information; 
 a. the chart showing remuneration scenarios on page 61 has been updated to reflect potential 2016 remuneration levels;
 b. details of external appointments of Executive Directors on page 62 has been updated to reflect current appointments; and  
 c.  the tables summarising the terms of Directors’ service contracts have been updated to reflect changes to the composition of the 
Board during 2015.
Consideration of Shareholder Views
The Remuneration Committee considers Shareholder feedback received in relation to LSL ’s Annual Report and Accounts, including the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report each year at a meeting following publication of the Report. This feedback, plus any additional feedback 
received during any meetings from time to time, is then considered as part of the Group’s annual review of the Policy. In addition, the 
Remuneration Committee will seek to engage directly with institutional Shareholders and their representative bodies should any material 
changes be made to the Policy. Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and any matters discussed with Shareholders during the year are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration. For further details of 
the way in which LSL communicates with its Shareholders, please see the Shareholder Relations section of the Corporate Governance 
Report.
Consideration of Employment Conditions Elsewhere in the Group
The Remuneration Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader UK employee population when determining the 
annual salary increases for the Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee did not consult with other employees with regard to 
remuneration of the Executive Directors.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Notes to the Remuneration Policy Summary:
1.  A description of how LSL has implemented the Policy set out in the table for 2015 and how it will operate it for 2016 is set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
2.  The following differences exist between LSL ’s Policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors as set out in the table and its approach 
to the payment of Group employees generally:
 a) A lower level of maximum annual bonus (or no bonus) opportunity may apply to employees other than the Executive Directors.
 b)  Participation in the long-term incentive plan (LTIP) is limited to the Executive Directors and certain selected senior managers. All 
employees are eligible to participate in LSL ’s share save schemes: save as you earn (SAYE), self invested plan/ buy as you earn (SIP/
BAYE); and company share ownership plan (CSOPs) upon invitation.
 c)  Benefits that are offered to other employees generally comprise of paid holidays and voluntary benefits such as childcare vouchers, a 
health cash plan, life assurance and, for more senior managers, private medical insurance.
 d)  LSL offers a stakeholder pension scheme with employee and employer contributions for new members calculated at a level which 
is compliant with automatic enrolment minimums (increasing over time as required by legislation) and based on a band of qualifying 
earnings which may vary month by month as variable pay fluctuates. The Remuneration Committee may use its discretion on the 
appointment of new executive directors to recommend a 5% match of basic salary.  
In general, the above listed differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the 
various categories of individuals, together with the fact that remuneration of the Executive Directors and selected senior managers 
typically has a greater emphasis on performance-related pay.  
3.  The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflect the Remuneration Committee’s belief that any 
incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging and tied to both the delivery of profit and non-financial measures. 
4.  The TSR and EPS performance conditions applicable to the LTIP were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they 
reward the delivery of long-term returns to Shareholders and the Group’s financial growth, and they are consistent with LSL ’s objective 
of delivering superior levels of long-term value to Shareholders. The TSR performance condition is monitored on the Remuneration 
Committee’s behalf by NBS whilst the Group’s EPS growth is derived from the audited financial statements.
5.  The Remuneration Committee operates the LTIP in accordance with the plan rules and the Listing Rules of the FCA and the 
Remuneration Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and 
administration of the plan.
6.  While LTIP awards currently vest after three years subject to continued service and performance targets, the Remuneration Committee 
will consider developments in best practice when setting future long-term incentive grant policies.
7.  The employee share schemes (SAYE, SIP/BAYE and CSOP) do not include any performance conditions.
8.  For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the Policy, authority was given to LSL to honour any commitments entered into with current 
or former Directors (such as the payment of a pension, payment of last year’s annual bonus or the vesting/exercise of share awards 
granted in the past) that have been disclosed in previous remuneration reports. Details of any payments to former Directors will be set 
out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.

Reward Scenarios (Illustration of Application of Remuneration Policy)
The charts below show how the composition of each of the remuneration packages, as applicable for each of the Executive Directors who 
are currently holding offi  ce and how each varies at diff erent levels of performance under the Policy set out above, as a percentage of total 
remuneration opportunity and as a total value:
Notes to the Reward Scenarios:
1. The ‘below target’ performance scenario comprises the fi xed elements of remuneration only, including:
 a) salary, applying from 1
st
 January 2016;
 b) pension, as per the Policy; and
 c) estimated benefi ts.
2.  The target level of bonus is taken to be 60% of the maximum bonus opportunity (100% of salary), and the on-target level of LTIP vesting 
is assumed to be 50% of the face value assuming a normal grant level (100% of salary). These values are included in addition to the 
components/values of minimum remuneration.
3.  Maximum remuneration assumes full bonus payout (100% of salary) and the full face value of the LTIP (100% of salary), in addition to 
fi xed components of remuneration.
4. No share price growth has been factored into the calculations.
Approach to Recruitment and Promotions
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of LSL ’s prevailing approved 
remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into account the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate for a 
candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as required to attract the most appropriate candidate and may be set initially at a below mid-
market level on the basis that it may progress towards the mid-market level once expertise and performance has been proven and 
sustained. The annual bonus potential would be limited to 100% of salary and grants under the LTIP would be limited to 100% of salary 
or 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances. Further, in exceptional circumstances the Remuneration Committee may off er additional 
cash and/or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an individual leaving a previous employer. It would 
seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards would be consistent with any awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected 
value and performance conditions.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
For an internal candidate being appointed as an Executive Director, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may 
be allowed to pay out according to its terms. In addition, any other on-going remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may 
continue, provided that they are put to Shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
For external and internal candidate appointments, the Remuneration Committee may agree that LSL will meet certain relocation and/or 
incidental expenses as appropriate.
In exceptional circumstances the Remuneration Committee may also agree, on the recruitment of a new executive director, a notice 
period in excess of nine months but with the intention to reduce this to nine months over a specified period.
Service Contracts for Executive Directors
The service contracts for each of the Executive Directors in place at the date of this Report are not fixed term and are terminable by either 
LSL or the Executive Director on the following bases:
Director Commencement of Current Service Contract Notice Period 
Ian Crabb 9
th
 September 2013 9 months
Adrian Gill 24
th
 November 2014 9 months
Adam Castleton 2
nd
 November 2015 9 months
At the Remuneration Committee’s recommendation and at the Board’s discretion, early termination of an Executive Director’s service 
contract can be undertaken by way of payment of salary and benefits in lieu of the required notice period. A summary of the main 
contractual terms surrounding termination are set out below:
Provision Detailed Terms
Notice Period 9 months
Termination Payment Payment in lieu of notice based on basic salary, fixed benefits and pension
Remuneration entitlements A bonus may be payable (pro-rated where relevant) and outstanding share awards may vest 
(see below)
Change of control No Executive Director’s service contract contains additional provisions in respect of change of 
control
At the Remuneration Committee’s recommendation and at the Board’s discretion early termination of a service contract can be 
undertaken by way of payment of nine months’ salary and benefits. An annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of the 
financial year served although it will be pro-rated for time and paid at the normal payout date.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under LSL ’s share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan 
rules. However, in certain prescribed circumstances under the LTIP rules, such as death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or 
cessation by reason of the employing company/business ceasing to be a member of the Group, or other circumstances at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee, a “good leaver” status may be applied.
In exceptional circumstances for good leavers, all or part of unvested LTIP awards may vest at the date of cessation of employment. In 
all other circumstances the awards will vest at the original specified vesting date, unless specifically determined by the Remuneration 
Committee that the award(s) for an individual will lapse. In exercising its discretion to the extent to which and when an award shall vest the 
Remuneration Committee will, under the LTIP rules, take into account:
1. the progress made towards meeting the performance conditions;
2. the extent to which it considers the performance condition would have been satisfied by the end of the vesting period;
3. the proportion of the vesting period elapsed; and 
4. any other factors which it considers to be relevant. 
The Board permits Executive Directors to accept appropriate outside commercial non executive director appointments provided that the 
aggregate commitment is compatible with their duties as an Executive Director. The Executive Directors concerned may (subject to Board 
approval) retain fees paid for these services. During 2015, other than Adrian Gill’s appointment as a non executive director of Lifetime 
Legal Limited for which he receives a fee; and Adam Castleton’s directorship and 50% ownership of Porten Properties Limited, none of 
the Executive Directors held any other non executive directorships of any other companies other than to represent the majority or minority 
interests of the Group or to participate in representative trade bodies.

Non Executive Directors
The Group’s policy is to appoint to the Board Non Executive Directors with a breadth of skills and experience that is relevant to the 
Group’s business. Appointments are made by the Board upon the recommendations and advice from the Nominations Committee.
Non Executive Directors, including the Chairman, have letters of appointment which set out their duties and responsibilities. The Non 
Executive Directors and Chairman are not eligible to participate in incentive arrangements or receive pension provision. The following table

Annual Report on Remuneration
Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for the year ending 31
st
 December 2016 (unaudited information)
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out how the Policy will be implemented for the year ending 31
st
 December 2016.  
Basic Salary
Executive Directors’ basic salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the responsibilities, skills 
and experience of each individual, pay and employment conditions within LSL and salary levels within listed companies of a similar size.
Basic salary levels as at 1
st
 January 2016 and 2015 for the current Executive Directors are set out below:
Director Role 2016  
(£)
2015  
(£)
Adam Castleton Group Chief Financial Officer 290,000 290,000
Ian Crabb Group Chief Executive Officer 400,000 370,000
Adrian Gill Executive Director, Estate Agency 285,000 280,000
Adam Castleton’s salary is from the date of his appointment as an Executive Director and has not been increased for 2016.
Ian Crabb’s basic salary was set below market at appointment to reflect his experience at that time and to enable the salary to be moved 
to a market level over time. Following a detailed review of LSL ’s and Ian Crabb’s performance and his increasing level of experience in the 
role, the Remuneration Committee awarded an increase from £370,000 to £400,000 from 1
st
 January 2016. The Committee now believes 
the salary is within the market range for the role and size and complexity of company. 
Annual Bonus Payments 2016
The Remuneration Committee will operate an annual bonus plan for Executive Directors during 2016 in line with that operated in 2015. 
The maximum bonus continues to be capped at 100% of basic salary.
For 2016, the overall structure of the annual bonus will remain broadly similar to that operated in 2015, with sliding scale performance 
targets based on LSL ’s budgeted Group Underlying Operating Profit (after the payment of bonuses) for 80% of the potential with the 
remaining 20% of the potential based on challenging non-financial performance measures.
The Committee has decided not to disclose the non-financial measures or targets (and the relative weighting of each individual target) in 
advance as they contain items which LSL consider to be commercially sensitive. However, targets will be disclosed in the Annual Report 
and Accounts 2016, which will be published in 2017. Further, the Remuneration Committee has confirmed that it is satisfied that individual 
measures are challenging and demanding, and reflect LSL ’s on-going business expectations and have a clear link to LSL ’s strategy. The 
financial performance element of the scheme require LSL ’s performance to be significantly better than budget for full payout.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP continues to be LSL ’s primary long-term incentive. The current LTIP scheme which was put into place in November 2006, is due 
to expire in November 2016. Accordingly, a replacement LTIP scheme will be submitted for Shareholder approval at the 2016 AGM along 
with the SIP/BAYE, SAYE and CSOP schemes. As the proposed 2016 LTIP scheme is very similar to the 2016 LTIP scheme, no changes 
are proposed to the existing Directors’ Remuneration Policy (which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM) to accommodate the 
new plan. Awards to be granted in 2016 to the Executive Directors and selected senior management will be made over shares worth up to 
100% of salary.
Awards will be subject to a range of adjusted earnings per share growth targets (70% of an award) and a TSR condition (for 30% of an 
award), each applying to separate parts of an award and measured over a period of three years as follows:
1.   25% of the Adjusted Basic EPS part of the award will vest for threshold Adjusted Basic EPS growth increasing pro-rata to full vesting 
for stretch Adjusted Basic EPS growth. The precise targets will be disclosed in full at the same time as announcing the grants of the 
awards.
2.  35% of the TSR part of the award will vest if LSL ’s TSR for the three years from date of grant is equal to the TSR of the median company 
increasing pro-rata to full vesting of this part of the award for top quartile performance as measured against the constituents of the 
FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts). For any part of the TSR part of the award to vest, the Remuneration Committee must also be 
satisfied that there has been an improvement in LSL ’s underlying financial performance.
Benefits
Taxable benefits for the Executive Directors will continue to include a car allowance, life assurance and private medical insurance. Benefits 
in kind are not pensionable and are not taken into account when determining basic salary for performance-related remuneration. 
Pension
New executive directors are offered a pension in accordance with auto enrolment minimums. The Remuneration Committee may use its 
discretion on appointment to recommend a 5% match of basic salary.
Non Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Non Executive Directors is a matter for the Chairman and Executive Directors whilst the remuneration of the 
Chairman is a matter for the Remuneration Committee. Fees for both Non Executive Directors and the Chairman are reviewed from time 
to time with regard to time commitment required and the level of fees paid by comparable companies.
A summary of fees for the current Non Executive Directors is as follows:
Director Notes 2016 (£) 2015 (£)
Kumsal Bayazit Besson 40,000 40,000
Helen Buck 40,000 40,000

Mark Morris 2 47,000 47,000
Bill Shannon 3 70,000 70,000
David Stewart 4 40,000 40,000
Notes to summary of fees for the Non Executive Directors:
1  Simon Embley became Non Executive Chairman on 1
st
 January 2015.
2   Mark Morris’ fee reflects his role as both Non Executive Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee up to 28
th
 April 2016 (being the 
date of the 2016 AGM).
3    Bill Shannon’s 2015 fee reflects increased responsibilities in his roles as Deputy Chairman, Senior Independent Director and Chairman 
of the Nominations Committee and the Remuneration Committee. He is also a member of the Audit Committee.
4    Subject to David Stewart’s election at the 2016 AGM, his fee will increase to £45,000 from the 28
th
 April 2016 (being the date of the 2016 
AGM) to reflect his role as both a Non Executive Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee.

9.  David Stewart was appointed to the Board on 1
st

10.  ‘Benefits’ refers to benefits in kind, which excludes pension provision and is comprised of private medical cover and company car or

11.  LSL ’s performance in 2015 results in the Executive Directors earning an annual bonus of between 35% and 80% of their basic salary 
in relation to the financial performance element of the scheme. In comparison, LSL ’s performance in 2014 resulted in the Executive 
Directors at the time, earning an annual bonus of 40% of their basic salary for the financial performance element of the scheme and 
total bonuses were capped at 60% of basic salary. See below for further details of the 2015 bonus payments.
12.  The gain on share award values for 2015 presented in the table were based on the 2013 LTIP award, which will vest in part during 2016 
based on performance of the EPS for the three years ended 31
st
 December 2015. As disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration, 
included in the Annual Report and Accounts 2014, the gain on share award values for 2014 presented in the table were based on the 
2012 LTIP award, which vested during 2015 based on performance for the three years ended 31
st
 December 2014. These figures now 
reflect the actual share price at vesting (337.6 pence).
13.  The figure shown for the gain on share award values for 2015 reflects the expected level of vesting for 2013 LTIP awards, at LSL ’s 
average share price from 1
st
 October 2015 to 31
st
 December 2015 (318.11 pence). Based on EPS performance for the three-year 
performance to 31
st
 December 2015, 95.45% of this element (representing 70% of the award) will vest on 2
nd
 April 2016 (for Simon 
Embley) and 23
rd
 September 2016 (for Ian Crabb). TSR performance will be tested over the three-year period to 1
st
 April 2016; based 
on forecast TSR performance 1
st
 April 2016 it is expected that 0% of this element (representing 30% of the award) will vest on 2
nd
 April 
2016. These figures will be restated in the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report to reflect the actual share price at vesting.
14.  SAYE 2011 awards became exercisable on 1
st
 May 2014. The value shown in the table reflects the difference between the exercise 
price of the SAYE option (257 pence) and LSL ’s share price on the date they became exercisable (403 pence).
15.  Adam Castleton was not entitled to an annual bonus under the LSL Executive Director bonus arrangements given that he only served  
2 months of the 2015 financial year. However, as part of his recruitment arrangements, LSL agreed to compensate him for the annual 
bonus forgone in respect of leaving his previous employer during 2015. The compensation, which is consistent with the Policy, 
amounted to £100,000 and will be paid at the normal LSL annual bonus payment date.

The Committee has decided not to disclose the non-financial measures or targets (and the relative weighting of each individual target) in 
advance as they contain items which LSL consider to be commercially sensitive. The Committee will disclose these targets in the Annual 
Report and Accounts 2016 which will be published in 2017. Further, the Remuneration Committee has confirmed that it is satisfied that 
individual measures are challenging and demanding, and reflect LSL ’s on-going business expectations and have a clear link to LSL ’s 
strategy. The financial performance element of the scheme require LSL ’s performance to be significantly better than budget for full payout.

Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed the 
procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any 
opinion on these individual areas.
Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to the  
Audit Committee
Revenue Recognition (including lapse 
provision)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 49); Accounting policies (page 95); 
and Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (page 96)
The Group has reported revenues 
of £300.60m (2014: £287.50m). We 
focused primarily on the timing of revenue 
recognised, as given the number of 
products and services offered there are 
inherent complexities surrounding the 
timing of revenue recognition.
In addition the Group earns commissions 
acting as an agent for the sale of financial 
services policies. If these policies are 
subsequently cancelled by the customer 
then an element of the commission earned 
has to be repaid. The Group is required 
to make an estimate based on historical 
experience of the amount of commission 
earned that it expects to be repaid as a 
result of the lapse of policies that have 
been sold, which is recognised as a 
reduction in revenue.
We identified two specific risks of fraud 
and error in respect of improper revenue 
recognition:
• Inappropriate cut off of revenue focusing 
around the year end timing of revenue 
recognised both through error or 
management bias
• Inaccurate estimate of lapse rates which 
could lead to revenue being manipulated 
by understating the provision
We performed full and specific scope 
audit procedures over this risk area in 
8 locations, which covered 91% of the 
revenue balance and 100% of the lapsed 
commission provision.
• We understood the key processes used 
to record revenue transactions;
• At certain locations we identified and 
tested key revenue controls;
• We performed analytical procedures 
including data analytics and overall 
analytical review;
• We examined material journal entries that 
were posted to revenue accounts around 
the year end; and
• We performed detailed cut off testing of 
revenue transactions either side of the 
Balance Sheet date.
For the estimate of repayable commissions 
we performed the following:
• We obtained management’s workings 
and checked the underlying calculations 
for arithmetical accuracy;
• We tested the integrity of the underlying 
data used in management’s assumptions 
by selecting a sample of policies that had 
lapsed and vouching them to claims from 
the lender and bank statements; and
• We identified that each item in our 
sample had been correctly included in 
the historical lapse rate calculation.
Based on our audit procedures we 
concluded that revenue is appropriately 
recognised in accordance with IAS 18, and 
that there was no evidence of management 
override.
The lapsed commission rates used to 
calculate the lapse provision are based on 
historical trend analysis, and sit within an 
acceptable range  76
Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to the  
Audit Committee
Recognition and measurement of 
professional indemnity (“PI”) liabilities 
for inaccurate surveys
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 49); Accounting policies (page 93); 
and Note 22 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (page 118)
The Group has recognised a professional 
indemnity provision of £29.67m (2014: 
£38.72m) as at 31
st
 December 2015.
This is an area of significant judgement 
and estimation. In particular the Group 
has historically experienced a high level of 
claims relating to the 2004 to 2008 period, 
and valuations work undertaken during 
this period continues to result in claims 
being made against the Group. There is a 
risk that the provision for these claims is 
significantly different as a result of variations 
from key assumptions, in particular the 
incidence of claims, the propensity for 
claims to result in financial loss and the 
resultant loss per claim.
We performed the following procedures 
across one full and one specific scope 
location providing 100% coverage 
across the professional indemnity 
provision. Our procedures have focused 
on management’s estimation process, 
including whether bias exists in determining 
the professional indemnity provision.
• We recalculated and validated 
management’s calculations, with 
reference to source documentation;
• We compared these calculations to 
expectations and investigated and 
corroborated any material variances;
• We corroborated material assumptions 
in relation to the incidence of claims, the 
propensity for claims to result in financial 
loss and the resultant loss per claim used 
by management and verified that these 
were appropriate;
• We interrogated the data around 
the current level of claims to assess 
management’s assumptions relating to 
how the level of claims will change over 
time;
• We traced a sample of payments to bank 
statements and reviewed the post year 
end settlements against management’s 
estimates in order to assess 
management’s accuracy in estimating 
claim costs;
• We inquired with legal counsel for certain 
claims and investigations to understand 
the most current legal standing; and
• We reviewed the disclosures included 
within the financial statements for 
completeness and appropriateness of the 
disclosure around the sensitivity of the 
provision in line with IAS 37.
Based on our procedures we believe 
that the estimate for PI liabilities is in 
accordance with IAS 37 and the estimate 
is within an acceptable range.

Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to the  
Audit Committee
Accounting for acquisitions
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 49); Accounting policies (page 89); 
and Note 27 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (page 120)
The Group is acquisitive in nature, and 
acquisitions frequently include earn-out 
arrangements in respect of key employees.
There is a risk that the accounting for 
acquisitions, including the allocation of 
the purchase price, the recognition of 
intangible assets and goodwill and the 
treatment of contingent consideration and 
earn-out arrangements is not performed in 
accordance with IFRS 3.
During the year the Group acquired 
Thomas Morris Ltd as well as a number of 
small lettings businesses.
As at the 31
st
 December 2015, the 
Group has recognised a financial liability 
of £9.89m in relation to contingent 
consideration.
We have performed the following 
procedures across all material acquisitions 
within the Group.
• We obtained and read all material sales 
and purchase agreements (SPA);
• We verified the appropriateness of the 
allocation of the purchase price and the 
recognition of intangible assets.
• We identified within the SPA any earn-out 
and contingent consideration clauses 
and considered whether these had 
been appropriately classified as either 
consideration or remuneration;
• For acquisitions that arose in prior 
periods we tested the subsequent 
measurement of contingent consideration 
liabilities with reference to SPA, actual 
and forecast financial results; and
• Review of necessary disclosures in 
the financial statements, to include the 
(provisional) allocation of fair values.
Based on our audit procedures we 
conclude that accounting for acquisitions 
has been performed correctly in line with 
IFRS 3.
Furthermore, we conclude that financial 
liabilities held in relation to earn-out 
arrangements are appropriate.
Client Monies
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 49); and Note 28 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements (page 122)
As at 31
st
 December 2015 the Group holds 
£93.84m (2014: £82.64m) on behalf of 
Estate Agency customers. These amounts 
do not belong to the Group and are held 
on behalf of clients. There is a risk of loss 
or misappropriation of monies held which, 
if it arose, would result in a financial cost to 
the Group.
We performed procedures across 4 full 
scope locations and 1 specific scope 
location providing 100% coverage across 
the client money balance.
We performed the following procedures:
• We obtained client account 
reconciliations and agreed material 
reconciling items to supporting evidence;
• We agreed the amounts held in client 
monies accounts to the bank letters; and
• We performed a cashbook review of the 
trading accounts, with a particular focus 
on the appropriateness and cut off of 
transfers to and from client accounts.
Based on the procedures we have 
performed we conclude that client monies 
are appropriately held off balance sheet 
and reconcile to third party confirmations.
The scope of our audit
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each 
entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account 
size, risk profile, the organisation of the group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other 
factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity. 78
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage 
of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 17 reporting components of the Group, we selected 11 components covering 
entities, which represent the principal business units within the Group.
Of the 11 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of 6 components (“full scope components”) 
which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining 5 components (“specific scope components”), we 
performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on 
the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 95% (2014: 97%) of the Group’s Profit before tax and 
98% (2014: 98%) of the Group’s Revenue. For the current year, the full scope components contributed 85% (2014: 64%) of the Group’s 
Profit before tax and 91% (2014: 82%) of the Group’s Revenue. The specific scope components contributed 10% (2014: 33%) of the 
Group’s Profit before tax and 7% (2014: 16%) of the Group’s Revenue. The audit scope of these components may not have included 
testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. 
The Group audit risk in relation to revenue recognition was subject to audit procedures across all full scope locations and 2 specific scope 
locations. The Group audit risk in relation to professional indemnity liabilities was subject to specific procedures at one full scope location 
and one specific scope location. The Group audit risk in relation to acquisition accounting was subject to audit procedures at 5 full scope 
locations. The Group audit risk in relation to client monies was subject to audit procedures across 4 full scope locations and one specific 
scope location.
Of the remaining 6 components that together represent 5% of the Group’s Profit before tax none are individually greater than 3% of the 
Group’s Profit before tax. For these components, we performed analytical review procedures to respond to any potential risks of material 
misstatement to the Group financial statements.
The charts below illustrate the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams.

Changes from the prior year
The above scope is consistent with the prior year except for the inclusion of one component as full scope this year in comparison to being 
specific scope in the prior year. In addition one component has changed from full scope to specific scope. These changes in our scope are 
as a result of our evaluation of the relative size and risk assessment of each location.
Involvement with component teams
All audit work performed for the purposes of the audit was undertaken by the Group audit team. All locations are audited by EY and all 
reside within the United Kingdom.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit 
and in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit 
procedures.
Independent Auditor's Report continued.
for the year ended 31
st
 December 2015  Other Information Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview
Directors’ Report and Corporate 
Governance Reports
79
We determined materiality for the Group to be £1.70m (2014: £0.5m), which is 5% of profit before tax (2014: 5% of adjusted profit before 
tax). We believe that profit before tax provides us with an appropriate basis for materiality and is the most relevant performance measure 
for stakeholders. In the prior year we used an adjusted measure to exclude certain non-recurring exceptional gains; however, such material 
items were not present for the current year.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality was 50% (2014: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely £0.86m (2014: £0.30m). We have set performance 
materiality at this percentage to ensure that total uncorrected and undetected audit differences in all accounts did not exceed our materiality 
level of £1.70m.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken 
based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale 
and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, 
the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £0.47m to £0.17m (2014: £0.21m to £0.08m).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.09m (2014: £0.03m), 
which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and 
Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 42, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 80

Notes to the Group Financial Statements
for the year ended 31
st
 December 2015
1. Authorisation of Financial Statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs
The Group Financial Statements of LSL and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31
st
 December 2015 were authorised for issue by the Board 
of the Directors on 3
rd
 March 2016 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by Ian Crabb, Group Chief Executive Officer 
and Adam Castleton, Group Chief Financial Officer. LSL is a listed company, in London, incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales 
and the Group operates a network of estate agencies, surveying and valuation and other related businesses.
The Group’s Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation of financial information
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and on a historical cost basis, except for available-for-sale 
financial assets that have been measured at fair value.
The accounting policies which follow set out those significant policies which apply in preparing the Financial Statements for the year ended 
31
st
 December 2015. The Group’s Financial Statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 
pounds (£’000) except when otherwise indicated.
New standards and interpretations
There are no IFRS amendments or IFRIC interpretations effective for the first time this financial year that had a material impact on the Group.
Judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRS as adopted by European Union requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reporting amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that 
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed 
below:
Professional indemnity (PI) claims
Significant judgement is required when provisioning for PI claims. Details of key assumptions in these areas are disclosed in Notes 7 and 22 
to these Financial Statements. A sensitivity calculation which illustrates the impact of different assumptions on the required PI provision is 
included in Note 22.
Valuations in acquisitions
The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on a business combination involves the estimation of future cashflows and other 
inputs relevant to the valuation model being applied.
Impairment of intangible assets
The Group determines whether indefinite life intangible assets (including goodwill) are impaired on an annual basis and this requires an 
estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated. This involves estimation of future 
cashflows and choosing a suitable discount rate (see Note 14).
Assessment of the useful life of an intangible asset
The consideration of the relevant factors when determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires judgement. Similarly there is also 
judgement applied when assessing that an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life.  Other Information Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview
Directors’ Report and Corporate 
Governance Reports

2. Accounting policies (continued)
Contingent consideration
The Group has acquired a number of businesses over the last few years. With regard to a number of these businesses, the Group has 
put and call options to purchase the remaining interest in these businesses at some point in the future. In accordance with the accounting 
standards, estimates have been made with regard to the future profitability of these acquisitions and a provision for the cost of acquiring 
these interests has been recognised. The provisions are disclosed in Note 21 to these Financial Statements. A sensitivity calculation which 
shows the impact of changes in assumption is shown in Note 29.
Valuation of financial assets
The Group owns minority interests in a number of listed and unlisted entities. In accordance with the accounting standards, these 
investments are held at fair value and significant judgment is required in assessing this. Further details of the methodology used are 
disclosed in Note 16 to these Financial Statements. A sensitivity calculation which shows the impact of changes in assumption is shown in 
Note 29.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries:
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be 
consolidated until the date such control ceases. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls 
an investee if, and only if, the Group has:
• Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)
• Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee
• The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the same 
reporting year as the Parent Company and are based on consistent accounting policies. All intra-Group balances and transactions, 
including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated in full.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
Non-controlling interests:
Non-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Parent Company; and is presented 
within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from equity attributable to owners of the parent. Losses within a subsidiary are 
attributed to the non-controlling interest even if it results in a deficit balance.
Interest in Joint Ventures
The Group’s investments in its joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in a 
joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share 
of net assets of the joint venture since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment and is not tested for impairment individually.
The statement of profit or loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the joint venture. In addition, when there has 
been a change recognised directly in the equity of the joint venture, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in 
the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the joint venture are 
eliminated to the extent of the interest in the joint venture.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of a joint venture is shown on the face of the statement of profit or loss, within Group 
operating profit, and represents profit or loss after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the joint venture. The financial 
statements of the joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring 
the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its 
joint ventures. At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the joint venture is 
impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the 
joint venture and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss as ‘Share of profit of a joint venture’ in the statement of profit or loss. 90
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued.
for the year ended 31
st
 December 2015
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Upon loss of significant influence over the joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment 
at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the joint venture upon loss of significant influence or joint control and the fair 
value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.
Intangible assets
Business combinations from 1
st
 January 2010
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The choice 
of measurement of non-controlling interest, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, is 
determined on a transaction by transaction basis. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation 
in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. Any contingent 
consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in 
accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income. If contingent consideration is linked to a service condition 
then expected payments are recognised as remuneration in the profit or loss over the earn-out period.
Where a put and call option is transacted over a non-controlling interest independently of a business combination, the present value of the 
exercise price of the put and call option is recorded as a liability with a debit to equity. Subsequent movements in the assessment of the 
exercise price are taken to profit and loss. If the put option lapses, the liability is derecognised with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred 
and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest (and where the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition-
date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and 
the liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the 
business combinations, such as the settlement of pre-existing relationships or post-acquisition remuneration arrangements are accounted 
for separately from the business combination in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs. Identifiable intangible assets, meeting 
either the contractual-legal or separability criteria are recognised separately from goodwill.
If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest 
(and where the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in 
the acquiree) is lower than the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing interest held in 
the business acquired, the difference is recognised in profit and loss.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired separately are measured at cost on initial recognition. Following the initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The useful lives of intangible assets are 
assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.  Other Information Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview
Directors’ Report and Corporate 
Governance Reports
91
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets (unless such 
lives are indefinite) as follows:
Customer contracts:
 Residential Sales customer contracts – three to ten years
 Surveying and Valuation customer contracts – between three and five years
Lettings contracts – five years 
Order book:
 Estate Agency pipeline – three months
 Surveying pipeline – one week 
 Estate Agency register – twelve months
Others:
 Franchise agreements – ten years
 In-house software – between three and five years
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication 
that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least at each financial 
year end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is 
accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Brand names are not amortised as the Directors are of the opinion that they each have an indefinite useful life. This is based on the 
expectation of the Directors that there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which each of the assets are expected to generate net 
cash inflows to the businesses and the Directors are confident that trademark registration renewals will be filed at the appropriate time and 
sufficient investment will be made in terms of marketing and communication to maintain the value inherent in the brands, without incurring 
significant cost. All brands recognised have been in existence for a number of years and are not considered to be at risk of obsolescence 
from technical, technological nor commercial change. Whilst operating in competitive markets they have demonstrated that they can 
continue to operate in the face of such competition and that there is expected to remain an underlying market demand for the services 
offered. The lives of these brands are not dependent on the useful lives of other assets of the entity.
Impairment
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash generating 
unit level. The useful life of such intangible assets is reviewed annually to determine whether indefinite life assessment continues to be 
supportable. If not, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, 
or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, and is determined 
for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or Groups 
of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down 
to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses 
of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired 
asset.
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously 
recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the assets’ or 
cash generating unit’s recoverable amount. 92
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued.
for the year ended 31
st
 December 2015
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is provided to write off 
cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic 
lives as follows:
Office equipment, fixtures and fittings – over three to seven years
Computer equipment – over three to four years
Motor vehicles – over three to four years
Leasehold improvements – over the shorter of the lease term or ten years
Freehold and long leasehold property – over fifty years or the lease term whichever is shorter
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use 
or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement when the asset is derecognised. These asset’s residual values, useful 
lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial year end, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when 
paid. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the AGM.
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on 
tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The Management Team periodically evaluates 
positions taken in the tax returns with respect to the situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and 
establishes provisions where appropriate.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
• deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the 
related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax 
assets are reassessed at each reporting period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will 
allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net 
payment. Income tax is charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity, if it relates to items that are charged or 
credited in the current or prior periods to other comprehensive income or equity respectively. Otherwise income tax is recognised in the 
income statement.  Other Information Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview

Share-based payment transactions
Equity-settled transactions
The equity share option programmes allow Group employees to acquire LSL Shares. The fair value of the options granted is recognised 
as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity in the case of equity-settled schemes. The fair value is measured at 
grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the 
options granted is measured using the Black Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions (including market and non-
vesting conditions) upon which the options were granted. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number 
of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting 
period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for 
equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market or non-market vested condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are 
satisfied.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share (further 
details given in Note 10).
Treasury shares
The Group has an employee share trust (ESOT) and an employee benefit trust (Trust) for the granting of LSL Shares to Executive 
Directors and selected senior employees. Shares in LSL held by the ESOT and the Trusts are treated as treasury shares and presented 
in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. The finance costs and administration costs relating to the ESOT and the Trusts are 
charged to the income statement. Dividends earned on shares held in the ESOT and the Trusts have been waived. The Shares are ignored 
for the purposes of calculating the Group’s EPS.
Leases
Group as a lessee
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases and 
rentals payable are charged in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor
Assets leased out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. 
Rental income, including the effect of lease incentives, is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Pensions
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees in certain Group companies. The assets of the scheme are 
invested and managed independently of the finances of the Group. The pension cost charge represents contributions payable in the year.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and 
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, 
when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, 
in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. Financial assets are derecognised 
when the Group no longer has the rights to cash flows, the risks and rewards of ownership or control of the asset. Financial liabilities are 
derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. All regular way purchases and sales of financial 
assets are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Regular way transactions 
require delivery of assets within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the market place. 94

 December 2015
2. Accounting policies (continued)
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification.
The Group’s accounting policy for each category of financial instruments is as follows:
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified as held to 
maturity, loan and receivables or fair value through profit or loss. After initial recognition available-for-sale financial assets are measured at 
fair value with gains or losses being recognised in other comprehensive income and as a separate component of equity until the investment 
is de-recognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity 
is included in the income statement. Where a reliable indicator of fair value cannot be obtained the assets are valued at cost.
If an available-for-sale financial asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment 
and amortisation) and its fair value is transferred from equity to the income statement. Reversals of impairment losses in respect of equity 
instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement.
Cash and short term deposits
Cash and short term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity 
period of three months or less.
For the purposes of the Group cash flow statement, cash and short term deposits consist of cash and short term deposits.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their original invoiced value as reduced by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade receivables generally have four to seven day payment terms in the estate agency business and thirty days in the surveying business. 
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off when 
the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
In relation to trade receivables carried at amortised cost, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the 
probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due 
under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired 
debts are de-recognised when they are assessed as uncollectable.
Trade payables
Trade payables do not carry any interest and are stated at their original invoice value.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-
bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses arising 
on repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance costs.
Finance costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated at the effective interest rate method and recognised on an accruals 
basis.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate caps and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest 
rate fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial 
liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives are taken directly to the income 
statement. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Assets carried at cost
If there is objective evidence of an impairment loss on an unquoted equity instrument that is not carried at fair value because its fair value 
cannot be reliably measured, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present 
value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.  Other Information Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview

2. Accounting policies (continued)
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable, net of discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or 
duty. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Rendering of services
Revenue from the exchange fees in the estate agency business is recognised by reference to the legal exchange date of the housing 
transaction. Revenue from the supply of surveying services is recognised upon the completion of the professional survey by the surveyor. 
Revenue from lettings, asset management and conveyancing fees is recognised on completion of the service being provided.
Financial services income
Revenue from mortgage procuration fees is recognised by reference to the completion date of the mortgage on the housing transaction. 
Revenue from policy sales is recognised by reference to the date that the policy is accepted by the insurer.
Interest income
Revenue is recognised as interest accrues (using the effective interest method – that is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset).
Rental income
Rental income including the effect of lease incentives from sub-let properties is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Dividends
Revenue is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established.
Exceptional items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement those material items of income and expense which, because 
of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand 
better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in 
financial performance.
New standards and interpretations not applied
The following new standards, new interpretations and amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not effective 
for the financial year beginning 1
st
 January 2015 and have not been early adopted:
International Accounting Standards 
(IAS/IFRSs) Effective date
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement 
This final version of IFRS 9 adds a new expected loss impairment model and 
amends the classification and measurement model for financial assets by 
adding a new fair value through other comprehensive income category for 
certain debt instruments.

The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of the above standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group’s 
Financial Statements, other than additional disclosures, in the period of initial application. This is with the exception of IFRS 16, for which we 
are currently evaluating the impact.
3. Revenue
The revenue and pre-tax income is attributable to the continuing activity of estate agency and related activities and the provision of 
surveying and valuation services on residential property. All revenue arises in the United Kingdom.
Revenue is analysed as follows:
2015

Dividend income was received in the year from the Group’s investments in Zoopla, VEM and GPEA. Further details of LSL’s investments are 
shown in Note 16.
4. Segment analysis of revenue and operating profit
For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on their products and services and has two reportable 
operating segments as follows:
• The Estate Agency and Related Services segment provides services related to the sale and letting of residential properties. It operates a 
network of high street branches. As part of this process, the Estate Agency Division also provides marketing and arranges conveyancing 
services. In addition, it provides repossession asset management services to a range of lenders. It also arranges mortgages for a 
number of lenders and arranges pure protection and general insurance policies for a panel of insurance companies via the estate agency 
branches, Pink Homes Loans, First Complete, Embrace Mortgage Services, First2Protect and Linear Financial Services. The financial 
services segment included within the Estate Agency division includes two mortgage and insurance distribution networks providing 
products and services for sale via financial intermediaries. The results of this financial services segment do not meet the quantitative 
criteria for separate reporting under IFRS and has therefore been aggregated with those of Estate Agency and Related Services.
• The Surveying and Valuation Services segment provides a valuations and professional survey service of residential properties to various 
lenders and individual customers.
Each segment has various products and services and the revenue from these products and services are disclosed on pages 16 to 19 
under the Business Review section of the Strategic Report.
The Management Team monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource 
allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss which in certain respects, 
as explained in the table below, is measured differently from operating profit or loss in the Group Financial Statements. Head office costs, 
Group financing (including finance costs and finance incomes) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to 
operating segments.  Other Information Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview

exceptional contingent consideration credit recognised in the year relating to other acquisitions, primarily a charge for LMS of £2,136,000 
and a credit of £611,000 in LSLi (2014: credit of £2,686,000). See Notes 21 and 27 for more details.
Provision for professional indemnity (PI) claims/notifications
Since early 2012 the Group has experienced a high level of claims and notifications relating to the 2004 to 2008 period, which was a period 
of relatively high risk lending characterised by higher house prices, high loan-to-value ratios and considerable levels of buy-to-let and sub-
prime lending. As a result the provision for PI Costs was increased by £17.3m in June 2012 and again by £12.0m in November 2013 and 
finally by £24.6m in December 2014.
The PI Costs provision at 31
st
 December 2015 was made up of a ‘Specific Provision’ and ‘Incurred But Not Reported’ (IBNR). The Specific 
Provision was based on the Group’s review of any notifications or claims which had been made against the Group as at 31
st
 December 
2015. The main factors considered in quantifying the Specific Provision were the likelihood that a claim would be successful; an assessment 
of the likely cost for each claim, including any associated legal costs, and whether any reduction in the claim is considered likely due to 
contributory negligence of the lender.
The IBNR provision was based on the Directors estimates of the number of claims which would be received in the future with regard to 
work completed before 31
st
 December 2015. The Directors have then applied an average cost per case, based on historical averages, to 
estimate the IBNR provision.
This provision represents our current best estimate of likely claims costs but the process of resolving open claims and estimating future 
claims is on-going. 100
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued.
for the year ended 31
st
 December 2015
7. Exceptional items and contingent consideration (continued)
A number of risks and uncertainties remain, in particular the actual monthly run rate of new claims, the date at which the rate of claims will 
significantly reduce, and the average cost per case both for existing open claims and for claims yet to be received. The cost of these factors 
could differ materially from the Directors’ estimates, which could result in a further provision being required.
At 31
st
 December 2015 the total provision for PI Costs was £29.7m. The Directors have considered sensitivity analysis on the key risks 
and uncertainties discussed which is set out in Note 22. The Group has continued to build a provision for estimated PI Costs relating to 
valuations completed since 2009, and an income statement charge has been made in these results, which has been considered as an 
operating expense rather than as an exceptional cost.
Gain on disposal of financial assets
On 18
th
 June 2014, Zoopla underwent an IPO and successfully completed a listing on the London Stock Exchange. Prior to the IPO, LSL 
owned 4.91% of Zoopla. Valued at the IPO price of £2.20 per share, LSL’s investment was £44,039,000.
As part of the IPO, LSL sold 8,889,317 Zoopla shares at an average price of £2.19 per share. The total gain on sale of the shares was 
£17,989,000 net of associated costs. On 3
rd
 July 2014, the Group sold a further 926,813 shares as part of the IPO over allotment and 
received proceeds of £1,978,000, £1,589,000 net of tax. In total, the Group received proceeds net of associated tax costs of £16,814,000. 
A special distribution of 16.5 pence per share was declared to return this exceptional gain to Shareholders in 2014.

Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Parent Company by the 
weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Parent Company by the weighted 
average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares that would be 
issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential Ordinary Shares into Ordinary Shares.

Long-Term Incentive Plan
The Group operates a LTIP (an equity-settled share-based remuneration scheme) for certain employees. Under the LTIP, the options vest if 
the individual remains an employee of the Group after a three year period, unless the individual has left under certain ‘good leaver’ terms in 
which case the options may vest earlier and providing the performance conditions are met.
LTIP 2015 vesting conditions
30% of the options vest based on the TSR of LSL as compared to the FTSE 250 index (excluding investment trusts) over the three year 
performance period:
• If the Group is in the top 25% percentile, all of these options will vest;
• If the Group is at the median 35% will vest;
• Straight line vesting between median and top 25% percentile; and

Joint Share Ownership Plan (JSOP)
Awards under the JSOP participate in increases in the value of shares in the Company above the share price at the date of grant. Awards 
comprise of an interest in jointly owned shares (i.e. Ordinary Shares held in co-ownership with the Trust) and a stock appreciation right. 
A key feature of the JSOP is that individuals are required to purchase their interest in the jointly owned shares and have thereby put their 
personal capital at risk.
The vesting of JSOP awards granted in 2011 is conditional upon both the following criteria being met:
• LSL’s adjusted EPS performance over the three financial years starting with the financial year in which the JSOP award is granted being 
10% p.a. or more; and
• LSL’s total shareholders’ return must exceed that of the FTSE 250 index (excluding investment trusts) over the three year performance 
period.  Other Information Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview

The volatility assumption, measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns, is based on statistical analysis of historical 
share price. The dividend yield assumption is based on the fact that the shares awarded are not eligible to receive dividends until the end of 
the vesting period.

107
13. Taxation (continued)
The UK standard corporation tax rate has reduced from 21% as at 1
st
 January 2015 to 20% from 1
st
 April 2015 with further reductions to 
19% from 1
st
 April 2017 and 18% from 1
st
 April 2020. The effective rate of tax for the year was 21.1% (2014: 21.2%). The effective tax rate 
for 2015 was decreased as a result of reducing the rate at which deferred tax is provided resulting from the reduction in the headline rate of 
corporation tax. Deferred tax charged directly to other comprehensive income is £0.5m (2014: credit of £2.7m); this is comprised of a credit 
of £0.05m and a charge of £1.0m and relates to the disposal and revaluation of financial assets (see Note 16 to the Financial Statements). 
There is also a credit arising as a result of the impact of rate change on deferred tax of £0.5m. Income tax credited directly to the share-
based payment reserve is £nil (2014: £nil).
In July 2015, the UK Government announced proposals to reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 19% from 1
st
 April 2017, and further 
reduced to 18%, effective from 1
st
 April 2020. As of 31
st
 December 2015 reductions to the main rate of corporation tax to 18% had been 
enacted. Accordingly, this is the rate at which deferred tax has been provided.
(b) Factors affecting tax charge for the year
The tax assessed in the profit and loss account is higher (2014: lower) than the standard UK corporation tax rate, because of the following 
factors:
2015
£’000
2014
£’000
Profit on ordinary activities before tax 38,600 31,943
Tax calculated at UK standard rate of corporation tax rate of 20.25% (2014 – 21.5%) 7,816 6,868
Non-taxable income from joint ventures and dividends (403) (641)
Benefit of deferred tax asset and brought forward losses not previously recognised (32) (249)
Disallowable expenses 381 394
Impact of movement in contingent consideration credited to the Income Statement (295) (87)
Share-based payment relief 57 281
Impact of rate change on deferred tax (207) (8)
Prior period adjustments – current tax 391 144
Prior period adjustment – deferred tax 430 83
Total taxation charge 8,138 6,785
The major component of expenses not deductible for tax purposes within the tax reconciliation is a permanent disallowance of depreciation 
on assets which do not qualify for capital allowances. This is a recurring adjustment with the tax impact of approximately £320,000 being 
broadly consistent with the prior year figure. The remainder of the adjustment relates to non-recurring items of disallowable expenditure, 
primarily legal and professional fees incurred in relation to capital transactions.
(c) Factors that may affect future tax charges (unrecognised)

Losses 3,823 2,500

The deferred tax assets may be recoverable in the future and this is dependent on subsidiary companies generating taxable profits sufficient 
to allow the utilisation of these amounts. These deferred tax assets cannot be offset against profits elsewhere in the Group as they relate to 
losses brought forward which can only be offset against taxable profits arising from the same trade in which the losses arose. There is no 
time limit for utilisation of the above tax losses and other temporary differences. 108

14. Intangible assets (continued)
Estate Agency and Related Services companies
The recoverable amount of the Estate Agency and Related Services companies has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation 
using cashflow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Board and three year plan. The discount rate applied to cashflow 
projections is 9.7% (2014:10.6%) and cashflows beyond the three year plan are extrapolated using a nil growth rate (2014: nil).
Surveying and Valuation Services company
The recoverable amount of the Surveying and Valuation Services companies is also determined on a value-in-use basis using cash flow 
projections based on financial budgets approved by the Board and three year plan. The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections 
is 9.7% (2014:10.6%). The growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows of the Surveying and Valuation Services company beyond the 
three-year plan is nil (2014: nil).
Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations
The calculation of value-in-use for each of the Estate Agency and Related Services and Surveying and Valuation Services companies is 
most sensitive to the following assumptions:
• Discount rates
• Market share and market recovery
• Growth rate used in the budget period
Discount rates reflect management’s estimate of the post-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of the Group and this is grossed 
up to arrive at a pre-tax discount rate (using a tax rate of 20.25%) of 9.7%. This is the benchmark used by management to assess 
operating performance and to evaluate future acquisition proposals.
Market share and market growth assumptions are important because, as well as using industry data for growth rates (as noted below) 
management assess how LSL’s relative position to its competitors might change over the budget period. The Estate Agency and Surveying 
markets both showed resilience in challenging markets in the first half of 2015, and showed recovery in the second half. The calculations 
supporting the impairment test are a 2% p.a. improvement in the housing market in 2016 and flat thereafter.
Growth rate conservatively estimated at nil after the end of the three year plan (2014: nil). Given the housing and mortgage markets are 
currently considered to be at a low point in the cycle, with transaction volumes at approximately half the long-term average, this estimate is 
considered conservative.
There has been no impairment in respect of the carrying amount of goodwill or brand (an indefinite useful life asset) held on the balance 
sheet.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
With regard to the assessment of value-in-use for each of the above companies, management believes that no reasonably possible change 
in any of the above key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be below the carrying value.  Other Information Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview

Bank loans – revolving credit facility and overdraft
A £100.0m loan facility which expires in August 2017 was arranged in June 2013. Loan refinance costs of £1,128,000 were incurred in 
June 2013 which have been capitalised and are being amortised over the life of the loan facility.
The bank loan totalling £45.5m (2014: £34.0m) and overdraft totalling nil (2014: £0.7m) are secured via cross guarantees issued from all 
of the Group’s subsidiaries excluding the following subsidiaries, Lending Solutions, Homefast, Linear (Linear Mortgage Network and Linear 
Financial Services), Templeton LPA, property-careers.com, Chancellors Associates and LSLi and the LSLi subsidiaries.
The utilisation of the revolving credit facility may vary each month as long as this does not exceed the maximum £100.0m facility 
(2014: £100.0m). The Group’s overdraft is also secured on the same facility but cannot exceed £5.0m and the combined overdraft and 
revolving credit facility cannot exceed £100.0m (2014: £100.0m). The banking facility is repayable when funds permit on or by August 2017.
Interest and fees payable on the revolving credit facility amounted to £1.9m (2014: £1.8m). The interest rate applicable to the facility is 
LIBOR plus a margin rate of 1.50% (2014: LIBOR plus 1.50%). The margin rate is linked to the leverage ratio of the Group and the margin 
rate is reviewed at six monthly intervals. An additional fee is charged if the facility is more than 33% drawn with a further fee due if the facility 
is more than 67% drawn.
12% unsecured loan notes
12% unsecured loan notes with a face value of £6,146,000 and a fair value of £8,660,000 were issued as part satisfaction of the 
consideration for acquisition of Marsh & Parsons in November 2011. These loan notes carry a coupon of 12%, which is compounded 
every year on 1
st
 January and rolled up to redemption. The loan notes are redeemable at par value plus rolled up interest at any time after 
1
st
 January 2016 at the option of the loan note holder. However, if that option is not exercised by the loan note holder they are redeemable 
on 1
st
 April 2020. The amounts shown in the table above include accrued interest of £1,374,000 (2014: £1,021,000).
2% unsecured loan notes
2% unsecured loan notes with a face value of £63,000 were issued in September 2014 for the acquisition of Marsh & Parsons. These were 
redeemed at par during 2015.  Other Information Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview

£1,518,000 (2014: £4,501,000) of contingent consideration relates to the Growth Shares acquired by the management of Marsh & Parsons 
subsequent to acquisition as an incentive to grow the Marsh & Parsons business. Holders of Growth Shares will have the option to require 
LSL to buy their Growth Shares at any time between 1
st
 January 2016 and 1
st
 April 2020, at their discretion, at a price determined by a 
multiple of EBITDA in the previous financial year. The payment of the consideration is contingent on the holder of the Growth Shares being 
continuously employed by the relevant company and consequently the expected value of the Growth Shares is charged to the income 
statement over the earn-out period.
£4,790,000 (2014: £7,496,000) of contingent consideration relates to payments to third parties in relation to the acquisition of LSLi and 
certain of its subsidiaries between 2007 and 2015. This is payable between three and five years after the acquisition dates depending on 
the profitability of those subsidiaries in the relevant years. In 2015, the contingent consideration has been recalculated using a discount rate 
of 6.5% (2014: 6.5%).
£3,093,000 (2014: £957,000) of contingent consideration relates to payments to third parties in relation to the acquisition of LMS in 
September 2014 (see Note 17). This is payable in 2016 and the payout will vary depending on the profitability of LMS in 2015.

Professional Indemnity (PI Cost) claim provision
The PI Cost provision is to cover the costs of claims relating to valuation services for clients which are not covered by PI insurance. The PI 
Cost provision includes amounts for claims already received from clients, claims yet to be received and any other amounts which may be 
payable as a result of legal disputes associated with provision of valuation services.
The provision is the Directors’ best estimate of the likely outcome of such claims, taking account of the incidence of such claims and 
the size of the loss that may be borne by the claimant, after taking account of actions that can be taken to mitigate losses. The PI Cost 
provision will be utilised as individual claims are settled and the settlement amount may vary from the amount provided depending on 
the outcome of each claim. It is not possible to estimate the timing of payment of all claims and therefore a significant proportion of the 
provision has been classified as non-current.
As at 31
st
 December 2015 the total provision for PI Costs was £29.7m. The Directors have considered the sensitivity analysis on the key 
risks and uncertainties discussed above.
Cost per claim
A substantial element of the PI Cost provision relates to specific claims where disputes are on-going. These specific cases have been 
separately assessed and specific provisions have been made. The average cost per claim has been used to calculate the IBNR. Should the 
costs to settle and resolve these claims and future claims increase by 10%, an additional £2.5m would be required.
Rate of claim
The IBNR assumes that the rate of claim for the high risk lending period in particular reduces over time. Should the rate of reduction be 
lower than anticipated and the duration extend, further costs may arise. An increase of 30% in notifications in excess of that assumed in the 
IBNR calculations would increase the required provision by £0.5m.
Notifications
The company has received a number of notifications which have not deteriorated into claims or loss. Should the rate of deterioration 
increase by 50%, an additional provision of £1.0m would be required.
Onerous lease provision
The provision for lease obligations relates to obligations under leases on vacant properties. The provision is expected to be fully utilised by 
June 2020. The final outcome depends upon the ability of the Group to sublet or assign the lease over the related properties.  Other Information Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview

b. Thomas Morris
In February 2015, the Group acquired 80% of Thomas Morris, a 7 branch estate agency chain in Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire and 
Hertfordshire for an initial consideration of £4.1m. The remaining 20% is subject to put and call options which are exercisable between 2018 
and 2020 dependent on profit performance. Due to the nature of the payment terms, the contingent consideration is considered to be a 
capital payment for accounting purposes.  Other Information Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview

The goodwill of Thomas Morris comprises certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from the 
acquiree due to their nature. These items include an experienced management team with a good record of delivering a quality service to 
customers, the expected value of synergies and the potential to significantly grow the business. No determination has been made yet as to 
what proportion, if any, of the goodwill will be tax deductible. Thomas Morris has contributed £762,000 profit before tax and £4,226,000 
revenue in the period since acquisition. If it had been acquired at the beginning of the year then the consolidated revenue would have been 
£782,000 higher and the consolidated profit before tax would have been £114,000 higher. An analysis of cashflow on acquisition is given in 
the table below:

From the date of acquisition to 31
st
 December 2014, the acquisition has contributed to £3.4m of revenue and £0.5m profit before tax of the 
Group, excluding the impact of movements in the contingent consideration recorded through the profit and loss. If all of these combinations 
had taken place at the beginning of the year, the consolidated revenue would have been higher by £4.3m and the consolidated profit before 
tax would have been higher by £0.7m.
Transaction costs have been expensed and are included under exceptional costs (see Note 7).
28. Client monies
As at 31
st
 December 2015, monies held by subsidiaries in separate bank accounts on behalf of clients amounted to £93,837,000 (2014: 
£82,642,000). Neither this amount, nor the matching liabilities to the clients concerned are included in the Group balance sheet, as the 
Group is not entitled to these amounts.  Other Information Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview

29. Financial instruments – risk management
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and other loans. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise 
finance for the Group’s operations and to fund acquisitions. The Group has various financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables, 
cash and short-term deposits and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
It is the Group’s policy that trading in derivatives shall not be undertaken. Interest rate swap agreements, which expired in 2014, were held 
for risk management purposes.
The Group is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks:
• cash flow interest rate risk;
• liquidity risk; and
• credit risk.
Policy for managing these risks is set up by the Board following recommendations from the Group Chief Financial Officer. Certain risks are 
managed centrally, while others are managed locally following communications from the centre. The policy for each of the above risks is 
described in more detail below.
Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with floating 
interest rates.
The majority of external Group borrowings are variable interest based and this policy is managed centrally. The subsidiaries are not 
permitted to borrow from external sources directly without approval from the Group Finance team.
In 2009 the Group entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on £25m of the Group’s bank borrowings. The interest 
rate swap agreements fixed LIBOR to approximately 2.9% until April/May 2014 and had expired at 31
st
 December 2014. At 31
st
 December 
2015 none of the Group’s revolving credit facility is at a fixed rate of interest (2014: nil%).
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and borrowings, 
which is not covered by the fixed interest rate swap. With all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit before tax is affected through 
the impact on floating rate borrowings as follows. There is no material impact on the Group’s equity.

2015 +100 (455)

2014 +100 (340)

Liquidity risk
The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generation by its operations, dividend policy and acquisition strategy. 
Acquisitions are carefully selected with authorisation limits operating up to Board level and cash payback periods applied as part of the 
investment appraisal process. In this way the Group aims to maintain a good credit rating to facilitate fundraising. The Group is also very 
cash generative as demonstrated by the cash from operations. The Group has net current liabilities due to the operating model where 
debtors are collected earlier than payments to creditors, allowing the cash to be used elsewhere in the business such as to reduce the 
amount drawn down on the revolving credit facility and to make acquisitions. However, the requirement to pay creditors is managed 
through future cash generation and, if required, from the revolving credit facility.
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool and daily cash flow reporting. This includes 
consideration of the maturity of both its financial investments and financial assets (e.g. accounts receivable, and other financial assets) 
and projected cash flows from operations. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility for 
potential acquisitions through the use of its banking facilities. 124

The liquidity risk of each Group entity is managed centrally by the Group Treasury Function. The Group’s cash requirement is monitored 
closely. All surplus cash is held centrally to offset against the Group’s borrowings and reduce the interest payable. The type of cash 
instrument used and its maturity date will depend on the Group’s forecast cash requirements. The Group has a revolving credit facility with 
a syndicate of major banking corporations to manage longer term borrowing requirements.
Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains appropriate capital structure to support its business 
objectives, including any regulatory requirements, and maximise shareholder value. Capital includes share capital and other equity 
attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
In the medium to long-term, the Group will strive to maintain a reasonable leverage (i.e. balance between debt and equity) to help achieve 
the Group’s business objectives of growth (through acquisitions and organic growth) and dividend policy. In the short term, the Group does 
not have a set leverage ratio to be achieved but the Directors monitor the ratio of net debt to operating profit to ensure that the debt funding 
is not excessively high. Certain loan notes issued on acquisition of Marsh & Parsons are excluded from this ratio as they are unsecured and 
are not relevant to calculate the Group’s banking covenant.
The Group has a current ratio of Net Bank Debt (excluding loan notes) to EBITDA of 0.83 (2014:0.74), based on Net Bank Debt (excluding 
loan notes) of £39.9m (2014: £34.7m) and operating profit before exceptional costs, amortisation and share-based payment charge of 
£42.9m (2014: £42.0m). The business is cash generative with a low capital expenditure requirement. The Group remains committed to its 
stated dividend policy of 30% to 40% of Group Underlying Operating Profit after interest and tax. In addition, the Group’s other main priority 
is to generate cash to support its operations and to fund any strategic acquisitions.
Net Bank Debt is defined as follows:

Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The Group is exposed to a credit risk in respect of revenue 
transactions (i.e. turnover from customers). It is Group policy, implemented locally, to obtain appropriate details of new customers before 
entering into contracts. The majority of the Estate Agency customers use the Group’s services as part of a house sale transaction and 
consequently the debt is paid from the proceeds realised from the sale of the house by the vendor’s solicitor before the balance of funds is 
transferred to the vendor. These minimise the risk of the debt not being collected.
The majority of the surveying customers and those of the asset management business are large financial institutions and as such the credit 
risk is not expected to be significant. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at 
the balance sheet date.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities
Treasury policy is described in the Note above. The disclosures below exclude short term receivables and payables which are primarily of a 
trading nature and expected to be settled within normal commercial terms.

The fair values for the majority of the financial instruments have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at interest 
rates prevailing for a comparable maturity period for each instrument.
Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of the financial instruments by valuation technique:
• Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2:  other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or 
indirectly; and
• Level 3:   techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market 
data.
The following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Group’s assets and liabilities.

At 31
st
 December 2015 the Group stake in Zoopla has been valued at £27,097,000 based on the Zoopla share price at that date of 
£2.40 per share which qualifies as a Level 1 technique.
The other investments totaling £1,774,000 are valued using Level 3 valuation techniques. The Directors reviewed the fair value of the 
financial assets at 31
st
 December 2015. The methods used to determine the fair value are disclosed in more detail in Note 16. The 
underlying value of the business will be driven by the profitability of these businesses. If this was to drop by 10%, the implied valuation is 
likely to also drop by around 10%, £0.2m.
The contingent consideration relates to amounts payable in the future on acquisitions. The amounts payable are based on the amounts 
agreed in the contracts and based on the future profitability of each entity acquired. In valuing each provision, estimates have been made 
as to when the options are likely to be exercised and the future profitability of the entity at this date. Further details of these provisions are 
shown in Note 21. If the future profitability of the entities was to decline by 10%, the size of the contingent consideration would decrease by 
approximately £1.2m.
Fair values of the Group’s interest-bearing borrowings and loans are determined by using discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology 
using a discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. The own non-performance risk as at 
31
st
 December 2015 was assessed to be insignificant.

34. Post Balance Sheet Events
Subsequent to the year end the following transactions have been completed:
a.  LSL acquired three small lettings book acquisitions for a total initial consideration of £1.82m.
b.  On 17
th
 February 2016, Your Move acquired a 65% interest in GFL for an initial consideration of £9.1m, with 50% paid at completion 
and the remaining 50% to be in March 2017.
The Group is in the process of allocating the purchase price in accordance with IFRS 3. As a result the initial accounting for the acquisitions 
above are currently incomplete, so a fair value table of the identifiable assets and liabilities has not been presented. 133

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Relation 
to the Parent Company Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Parent Company Financial Statements (together with the Annual 
Report and Accounts) in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the Company Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they present fairly the 
financial position of the Company and the financial performance and cash flows of the Company for that period. In preparing the Company 
Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Change in Accounting Estimates and Errors’ and then 
apply them consistently;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Company’s financial position and financial performance;
• state that the Company has complied with IFRSs, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Financial Statements; 
and
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial 
Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 134

1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
For all periods up to and including the year ended 31
st
 December 2014, the Company prepared its financial statements in accordance with 
UK generally accepted accounting principles (UK GAAP). These financial statements for the period ended 31
st
 December 2015 are the first 
the Company has prepared in accordance with IFRS. Please refer to Note 2 for information on how the Company adopted IFRS.
The Company Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and on a historical cost basis, except for, available-for-
sale financial assets that have been measured at fair value.
The accounting policies which follow set out those significant policies which apply in preparing the Financial Statements for the year ended 
31
st 
December 2015. The Company’s Financial Statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 
pounds (£’000) except when otherwise indicated.
Summary of significant accounting policies
The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRS as adopted by IASB requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reporting amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed 
below:
Contingent consideration
The Company has acquired a number of businesses over the last few years. With regard to a number of these businesses, the Company 
has a put and call option to buy, or require to buy, the remaining interest in these businesses at some point in the future. In accordance with 
the accounting standards, estimates have been made with regard to the future profitability of these acquisitions and a provision for the cost 
of acquiring these interests has been recognised.
Valuation of financial assets
The Company owns minority interests in a number of listed and unlisted entities. In accordance with the accounting standards, these 
investments are held at fair value and estimates and assumptions are required in assessing this.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment. The cost of an investment is measured as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value. Any contingent consideration will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised through profit and loss.
Investments are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value 
may be impaired.
Investments in joint ventures
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for at cost less any provision for impairment. Investments are reviewed for impairment annually 
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be impaired. The cost of an investment is 
measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value. Any contingent consideration will be 
recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit 
and loss. 138
Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued.
for the year ended 31
st
 December 2015
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on 
tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The Management Team periodically evaluates 
positions taken in the tax returns with respect to the situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and 
establishes provisions where appropriate.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
• deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the 
related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax 
assets are reassessed at each reporting period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will 
allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net 
payment. Income tax is charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity, if it relates to items that are charged or 
credited in the current or prior periods to other comprehensive income or equity respectively. Otherwise income tax is recognised in the 
income statement.
Pensions
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees of the Company. The assets of the scheme are invested and 
managed independently of the finances of the Company. The pension cost charge represents contributions payable in the year.
Share-based payment transactions
Equity-settled transactions
The equity share option programmes allow Company employees to acquire LSL Shares. The fair value of the options granted is recognised 
as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity in the case of equity-settled schemes. The fair value is measured at 
grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the 
options granted is measured using the Black Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions (including market and non-
vesting conditions) upon which the options were granted. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number 
of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting 
period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for 
equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market or non-market vested condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are 
satisfied.
Treasury shares
The Company has an employee share trust (ESOT) for the granting of Company shares to Executive Directors and senior employees. LSL 
Shares held by the ESOT are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity. Dividends earned 
on LSL shares held in the ESOT have been waived. 139

Directors’ Report and Corporate 
Governance Reports
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Company’s Balance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction 
price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. Financial assets 
are derecognised when the Company no longer has the rights to cash flows, the risks and rewards of ownership or control of the asset. 
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
The Company’s accounting policy for each category of financial instruments is as follows:
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-
bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses arising 
on repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in investment income and finance costs.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is provided to write off 
cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic 
lives as follows:
Office equipment, fixtures and fittings – over three to seven years
Computer equipment – over three to four years
Leasehold improvements – over the shorter of the lease term or ten years
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or 
disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement when the asset is derecognised. These asset’s residual values, useful 
lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial year end, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
2. First-time adoption of IFRS
These financial statements, for the year ended 31
st 
December 2015, are the first the Company has prepared in accordance with IFRS. For 
periods up to and including the year ended 31
st 
December 2014, the Company prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK 
generally accepted accounting principles (UK GAAP).
Accordingly, the Company has prepared financial statements that comply with IFRS applicable as at 31
st 
December 2015, together with 
the comparable period data for the year ended 31
st
 December 2014, as described in the summary of significant accounting policies. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Company’s opening statement of financial position was prepared as at 1
st 
January 2014, 
the Company’s date of transition to IFRS. This note explains the principle application made by the Company in restating its UK GAAP 
financial statements, including the statement of financial position as at 1

Deferred consideration
Deferred consideration of £447,000 (2014: £465,000) relates to Marsh & Parsons acquisition in November 2011. This is payable at any time 
between 31
st
 March 2016 and 31
st
 March 2020 at the option of management of Marsh & Parsons Ltd. No interest is payable on this. There 
is also a deferred consideration of £2,422,000 relating to LMS acquisition from September 2014 relating to the purchase of an additional 
stake in LMS.
Contingent consideration
£1,518,000 (2014: £4,501,000) of contingent consideration relates to the Growth Shares acquired by the management of Marsh & Parsons 
subsequent to acquisition as an incentive to grow the Marsh & Parsons business. Holders of Growth Shares will have the option to require 
LSL to buy their Growth Shares at any time between 1
st 
January 2016 and 1
st
 April 2020, at their discretion, at a price determined by a 
multiple of EBITDA in the previous financial year. The payment of the consideration is contingent on the holder of the Growth Shares being 
continuously employed by the relevant company and consequently the expected value of the Growth Shares is charged to the income 
statement over the earn-out period.
£3,093,000 (2014: £957,000) of contingent consideration relates to payments to third parties in relation to the acquisition of LMS in 
September 2014 (see Note 17 in the Group Financial Statements). This is payable in 2016 and the payout will vary depending on the 
profitability of LMS in 2015.

Bank loans – revolving credit facility and overdraft
The Company’s bank loan totals £45.5m (2014: £34.0m) and the Company’s overdraft totals £19.5m (2014: £26.5m). The bank loan is 
secured via a cross guarantee issued from all of the Group’s subsidiaries excluding the following subsidiaries, Lending Solutions, Homefast 
Property Services, Linear Financial Solutions (including Linear Mortgage Network), Templeton LPA, Pink Home Loans, Barnwoods, 
Chancellors Associates and LSLi and its subsidiaries.
The bank loans relate to the revolving credit facility. The utilisation of this revolving credit facility may vary each month as long as this 
does not exceed the maximum £100.0m facility (2014: £100.0m). The Company’s overdraft is also secured on the same facility and the 
combined overdraft and revolving credit facility cannot exceed £100.0m (2014: £100.0m). The banking facility was renewed in June 2013 
for a further period until August 2017.
The interest rate applicable to the facility is LIBOR plus a margin rate of 1.50% (2014:1.50%). The margin rate is linked to the leverage ratio 
of the Group and the margin rate is reviewed at six monthly intervals. 143

For a description of the reserves refer to Note 25 to the Group Financial Statements.
Share premium
The amount subscribed for share capital in excess of nominal value less any costs attributable to the issue of new shares.
Share-based payment reserve
This represents the amount provided in the year in respect of share awards. The Company has operated long-term incentive plans 
(including JSOP and CSOP) and a number of SAYE schemes for the employees in the Company and the Group. See Note 12 to the Group 
Financial Statements for details of the LTIP, JSOP, CSOP, SIP/BAYE and the SAYE schemes.
Fair value reserve
The fair value reserve is used to record the changes in fair value of financial assets held for sale. Due to the first time adoption of IFRS within 
the Parent Company financial statements during the current year, the fair value reserve has been restated for the conversion changes which 
applied. Note 5 gives further details of the movement in the current year. 144

13. Company profit /loss for the financial year after tax
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The loss after 
tax for the year was £3.6m (2014: profit of £36.6m).
Remuneration paid to Directors of the Company is disclosed in Note 12 to the Group Financial Statements.
The Company paid £243,733 (2014: £124,434) to its auditors in respect of the audit of the Financial Statements of the Company.
Fees paid to the external auditors and their associates for non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the individual 
accounts of the Company because Group financial statements are prepared which are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated 
basis. These are disclosed in Note 9 to the Group Financial Statements.
14. Pensions costs and commitments
The Company operates defined contribution pension schemes for all its Directors and employees. The assets of the schemes are held 
separately from those of the Company in independently administered funds. The Company’s contributions for ‘old’ members of the existing 
defined contribution section of the scheme (those members who have always been in this scheme) throughout 2008, were a maximum 
of 5% of pensionable salaries where members contribute and the cost of the death-in-service benefits. Contributions to the scheme were 
suspended in April 2009 and recommenced in 2010.
The Company’s contributions for ‘new’ members of the defined contribution stakeholder scheme (those members who were part of the 
Aviva scheme until the Company left the Aviva group in 2004) was 5% of pensionable salaries where members contribute, and the cost of 
the death-in-service benefits. Contributions to the scheme were suspended in April 2009 and recommenced in 2010. Total contributions to 
the defined contribution schemes in the year were £40,787 (2014: £70,217). There were no outstanding amounts in respect of pensions as 
at 31
st 
December 2015 (2014: £nil).
The Parent Company headcount at 31
st
 December 2015 was nil (2014: nil). This is due to employment contracts being drawn up within the 
subsidiaries and not within the Parent Company itself.
15. Capital commitments

17. Financial instruments – risk management
The Company’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and other loans. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to 
raise finance for the Company’s operations and to fund acquisitions. The Company has various financial assets and liabilities such as trade 
receivables, cash and short-term deposits and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
It is the Company’s policy that trading in derivatives shall not be undertaken, apart from interest rate swap agreements, which expired 
during 2014.
The Company is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks:
• cash flow interest rate risk;
• liquidity risk; and
• credit risk.
Policy for managing these risks is set up by the Board following recommendations from the Group Finance Director. Certain risks are 
managed centrally, while others are managed locally following communications from the centre. The policy for each of the above risks is 
described in more detail below.
Cash flow interest rate risk
The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s long-term debt obligations with 
floating interest rates.
The majority of external Company borrowings are variable interest based and this policy is managed centrally. The subsidiaries are not 
permitted to borrow from external sources directly without approval from the Head Office team.
In 2009 the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on £25.0m of the Company’s bank borrowings. 
The interest rate swap agreements fixed LIBOR to approximately 2.9% until April/May 2014 and had expired at 31
st
 December 2014. At 
31
st
 December 2015 none of the Company’s RCF is at a fixed rate of interest (2014: nil%).
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and borrowings, 
which is not covered by the fixed interest rate swap. With all other variables held constant, the Company’s profit before tax is affected 
through the impact on floating rate borrowings as follows. There is no material impact on the Company’s equity.

st
 January 2014 +100 (240)

Liquidity risk
The Company aims to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generation by its operations, dividend policy and acquisition strategy. 
Acquisitions are carefully selected with authorisation limits operating up to Group Board level and cash payback periods applied as part of 
the investment appraisal process. In this way the Company aims to maintain a good credit rating to facilitate fundraising. The Company is 
also very cash generative as demonstrated by the cash from operations. The Company has net current liabilities due to the operating model 
where debtors are collected earlier than payments to creditors, allowing the cash to be used elsewhere in the business such as to reduce 
the amount drawn down on the revolving credit facility and to make acquisitions. However, the requirement to pay creditors is managed 
through future cash generation and, if required, from the revolving credit facility.
The Company monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool and daily cash flow reporting. This includes 
consideration of the maturity of both its financial investments and financial assets (e.g. accounts receivable, and other financial assets) and 
projected cash flows from operations. The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility for 
potential acquisitions through the use of its banking facilities. Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued.

The liquidity risk of the Company entity is managed centrally by the Group treasury function. The Company’s cash requirement is monitored 
closely. All surplus cash is held centrally to offset against the Company’s borrowings and reduce the interest payable. The type of cash 
instrument used and its maturity date will depend on the Company’s forecast cash requirements. The Company has a revolving credit 
facility with a syndicate of major banking corporations to manage longer term borrowing requirements.
Capital management
The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains appropriate capital structure to support its 
business objectives, including any regulatory requirements, and maximise shareholder value. Capital includes share capital and other equity 
attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
In the medium to long-term, the Company will strive to maintain a reasonable leverage (i.e. balance between debt and equity) to help 
achieve the Company’s business objectives of growth (through acquisitions and organic growth) and dividend policy. In the short term, the 
Company does not have a set leverage ratio to be achieved but the Directors monitor the ratio of net debt to operating profit to ensure that 
the debt funding is not excessively high. Certain loan notes issued on acquisition of Marsh & Parsons are excluded from this ratio as they 
are unsecured and are not relevant to calculate the Company’s banking covenant.
Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Company.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities
Treasury policy is described in the Note above. The disclosures below exclude short term receivables and payables which are primarily of a 
trading nature and expected to be settled within normal commercial terms.

The fair values for the majority of the financial instruments have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at interest

Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of the financial instruments by valuation technique:
• Level 1:  quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2:  other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or 
indirectly; and
• Level 3:   techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market 
data. 148

At 31
st
 December 2015, our stake in Zoopla has been valued at £27,097,000 based on the Zoopla share price at that date of £2.40 per 
share which qualifies as a Level 1 technique.
The contingent consideration relates to amounts payable in the future on acquisitions. The amounts payable are based on the amounts 
agreed in the contracts and based on the future profitability of each entity acquired. In valuing each provision, estimates have been made 
as to when the options are likely to be exercised and the future profitability of the entity at this date. Further details of these provisions 
are shown in Note 21 of the Group Financial Statements. If the future profitability of the entities was to decline by 10%, the size of the 
contingent consideration would decrease by approximately £0.6m.
Fair values of the Company’s interest-bearing borrowings and loans are determined by using discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology 
using a discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. The own non-performance risk as at 
31
st
 December 2015 was assessed to be insignificant.

In accordance with its Articles of Association, LSL publishes shareholder information, including notice of AGMs and the Annual Report and

Companies Act 2006). Documents will be supplied via LSL’s website to Shareholders who have not requested a hard copy, or provided an

a letter will be sent to the Shareholder on release of any information directing them to the website.

Introduction

Next Fifteen has once again looked at the best way to  
communicate with its shareholders and other stakeholders 
within the constraints of the budget appropriate for a  
small company . W e are pleased to see that many people  
accessed our online annual report through our website, 
www . nextfifteen.com, and delighted by how few paper 
copies we still have lying around the office. W e were also  
encouraged by the number of people who watched the 
video clips. This year we are building on this success and 
using video clips in which some of our senior management 
team answer key questions that have been asked by  
employees and shareholders. At the same time we respect 
the wishes of some shareholders who prefer a printed copy , 
but would encourage them to look at the online version if 
they get the opportunity . W e have incorporated a question 
facility in the online version so that shareholders do not  
have to wait until the Annual General Meeting to have their  
questions answered. W e look forward to talking to you.

Europe and Africa
Europe, with its expanded EU, is now an easier place in which to 
do business than it was in previous years, and the strength of the 
euro increases the potential rewards. Next Fifteen has ten offices 
and a licensed partner in Europe and Africa, with over 100 
consultants providing services to companies of all sizes. Many of 
our accounts in this region are multi-country engagements.
Asia Paciﬁc
With 16 offices and three licensed partners, Next Fifteen has a

the most vital criterion for success in business. The Group has

1 6 Next Fifteen Communications Group plc Annual Report 2009
Chairman’ s statement
Next Fifteen Communications Group plc 
(‘Next Fifteen’ or ‘the Group’), the global 
public relations consultancy group, is 
pleased to report its results for the year 
to 31 July 2009. The Group, like many 
businesses has been impacted by the 
global economic downturn. Despite  
this the Group has reported revenues  
up 3.6% to £65.4m (2008: £63.1m). 
Profitability was more sensitive to the 
economic slowdown with profit before 
tax down to £3.2m (2008: £5.5m), but the 
adjusted profit was £5.2m (2008: £6.6m) 
(see note 5). Earnings per share was 
similarly impacted at 3.67p (2008: 7 .08p), 
with the adjusted basic earnings per 
share being 6.48p (2008: 8.62p) (see  
note 10). The Group continues to have a 
strong balance sheet, ending the year 
with net funds of £1.8m (2008: £3.4m) 
(see note 20), achieved after making 
£4.5m of acquisition-related payments.  
In view of this and the improving outlook 
overall, the Board has proposed a final 
dividend of 1.25p per share, which 
maintains the total dividend for the year 
at 1.7p.
The Group’s results were significantly 
impacted by the currency contracts 
placed before the start of the year,  
which matured during the year.  
These protection contracts effectively 
locked the Group into what became 
unfavourable rates after sterling fell 
sharply against both the US dollar and 
euro. These maturing contracts created 
an additional loss of £1.7m above their 
fair value at the beginning of the year, 
which is included in other operating 
charges within head office costs  
but not shown as an adjustment to  
profit (note 5). 
Corporate activity
Just after the year end the Group 
announced the acquisition of New York-
based consumer agency M Booth and in 
recent weeks it has also announced the 
acquisition of the Asian PR assets of  
AIM-listed Upstream Marketing and 
Communications Inc., which will give  
the Group’s Bite business a strong Asia 
Pacific operation, to complement its 
existing US and European operations. 
The Group also announced its  
purchase of a further 30% stake in 463 
Communications LLC, a US-based policy 
communication consultancy, in which  
it already has a 40% interest. Lastly the 
Group also announces that it intends  
to open a digital communications 
agency in the next three months.  
Two executives from Bite are moving 
over to lead this venture.
Cost control 
During the year the Group made  
some significant headcount reductions 
following the slowdown in most of its 
markets. Following a strategic review, 
decisions were also taken to merge 
London-based Inferno into Bite and to 
close the Text 100 offices in Seattle and 
Dublin. These actions resulted in one-
time charges of £1.95m, of which £0.4m 
related to the cost of surplus office space. 
Setting these aside, the Group continued 
to keep staff costs as a percentage of 
revenue at 67%. The close management 
of staff costs should help the business  
to restore its profit margins in the 
coming year as revenue growth  
begins to recover.
Strengthened client base
The Group already has an enviable  
client base that includes IBM, Microsoft, 
Cisco, Facebook, AMD, Unilever and 
Coca-Cola. Just after the year end, the 
Group added HP as a significant client  
in the US which helped make up for  
the loss of Sun Microsystems, following 
the announcement that it was being 
acquired by Oracle. The Group also 
added Autodesk and VMware as clients 
during this period.

Growth strategy
The Group has continued to explore 
organic growth opportunities supported 
by selective acquisitions of specialist 
agencies in growth sectors. This is 
demonstrated by the acquisition of  
M Booth who are working with the 
existing UK business of Lexis, to create  
a global consumer agency for the  
Group. The acquisition of Upstream’s  
PR agencies in China, Singapore and 
Australia will enable Bite to offer its 
existing and new clients a single-agency 
solution in Europe, North America and 
Asia Pacific. Lastly, the creation of a 
digital agency to leverage the Group’s 
existing capabilities in social media and 
related digital services is further evidence 
that the Group continues to focus on 
long-term growth. With strong cash-
generation from operations and existing 
acquisition facilities, the Group remains 
well placed to make additional targeted 
acquisitions of a size that would not lead 
to a significantly geared balance sheet, 
an approach that the Board continues  
to feel is prudent given the current 
economic climate.
Prospects
The Group has managed its cost base 
and balance sheet well during this 
difficult economic cycle. Unlike some 
others in the marketing services sector it 
remains conservative about cash, having 
ended the year with net funds of £1.8m 
on its balance sheet. Despite the slow 
but gradual improvement in the 
economic climate, the Group will 
continue to be careful in its approach to 
running the business and as reported 
last year, focus heavily on the three Cs  
of customers, cost base and cash.  
The Group has seen an improvement  
in trading conditions after a tough first 
quarter of the 2009 calendar year but it 
will continue to manage the business  
in a way that reflects the general 
uncertainty that surrounds the 
sustainability of economic recovery.  
In the first two months of the current 
financial year, the Group has seen good 
momentum and the Board remains 
optimistic about the prospects for  
the year.

Given the current challenging economic conditions  
we have been asked many questions on our strategy by  
employees, shareholders and analysts. Here are a selection  
of them which will be answered in this report by some of the 
senior management team:
Growth has been difficult in the last 1 2 months but 
does the Next Fifteen brand portfolio still offer good 
growth prospects ?  
Q 1:
for the answer please see page 11
Next Fifteen’ s technology clients have been early 
adopters of social media services. What demand  
for these services have M Booth seen ? 
Q2 :

The acquisition of M Booth has added to the consumer 
PR capabilities of the Next Fifteen Group, but in what 
ways will this benefit Lexis ?

interesting move. How will this help the growth 
prospects for the Bite Group ?

Chief Executive Officer’ s review
Back in 2001 when the dotcom bubble 
was bursting our business faced a very 
difficult road ahead. I was, however, 
optimistic about our prospects, as I 
believed we had a strong talent-base 
and a sound and quite simple strategy–
focus on building a global consultancy 
that does great work. I felt a similar level 
of optimism as we approached the 
winter of 2008 when banks were being 
rescued almost daily and governments 
around the world were forced to inject 
vast amounts of capital into their 
economies. In 2001 we emerged a 
stronger business. Today, despite recent 
events, the Company is much larger than 
it was in 2001, and has an even stronger-
talent base and a client list that is the 
envy of the industry. For the record,  
the simple strategy remains.
Despite the climate, we grew
Last year we achieved modest revenue 
growth of 3.6%, to £65.4m (2008: £63.1m). 
This derived from a stronger US dollar 
and euro relative to sterling. Profit fared 
less well, with adjusted profit declining 
to £5.2m from £6.6m the previous year. 
That said, the Group did have to incur 
some significant losses from foreign 
exchange contracts, which resulted  
in a £1.7m charge to the profit and loss 
account. As several analysts noted, had 
these not occurred, then adjusted profit 
would actually have risen year on year.
A client base that keeps  
getting better
Beyond the financial metrics there are 
several other measures that investors 
should look at. These include the quality 
of the Company’s client base. On this 
front I am pleased to report that the 
business has maintained an excellent list 
that includes IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, AMD, 
salesforce.com, Facebook, Yahoo!, Xerox, 
Sony, Unilever, Coca-Cola and Boots.  
I’m also pleased to note that the Group 
has added some additional blue-chip 
clients, including Hitachi Data Systems, 
Autodesk, VMware and HP .
Platforms for future growth
Another important measure of the 
Group’s performance is its ability to 
deliver growth in the future. While many 
businesses have simply hunkered down 
and focused on survival, we have 
continued to invest in our future. Shortly 
after our year end, we made a series of 
announcements. Firstly, we announced 
the acquisition of M Booth, a New York-
based consumer agency that includes 
Unilever and JC Penney amongst its 
clients. Secondly, we announced that we 
have acquired the PR assets of Upstream 
Asia, which will become Bite Asia and 
will give Bite offices in Beijing, Shanghai, 
Hong Kong, Singapore and Sydney. 
Thirdly, we announced that we now  
own 70% of 463 Communications,  
a public policy consultancy based in

Lastly, we announced that in the next 
few months we will be opening a digital 
communications consultancy to service 
clients in the US and Europe.
All you need is LUV
As you can see, we have been busy 
during these difficult times and I’m 
proud of the great progress we have 
made. That said, the economic impact  
of this latest recession is still being felt  
in many parts of the world. However,  
I believe our business is set for what  
is being described as a ‘LUV’-shaped 
recovery, i.e. where the models of 
economic recovery are L -shaped  
in Europe, U-shaped in the US, and 
V-shaped in Asia. This would certainly 
match the signs we have seen during 
the last six months.
This last year placed some strong 
challenges in front of our people. They 
experienced clients being forced to cut 
back on marketing expenditure due to 
their declining sales. They witnessed an 
increasingly active merger and 
acquisitions market that had clients 
disappearing (and also appearing) from 
nowhere. They were engaged in the 
accelerating trend towards using social-
media as a major part of PR campaigns, 
as traditional media continue to struggle. 
In all this, they maintained one constant 
belief: that doing great work is what 
really matters. I’m delighted to say that  
in these difficult times they did a lot of 
great work, which is why today we have 
a customer base that keeps getting 
better and an outlook that suggests that, 
as the world economy emerges from the 
uncertainty that has enveloped it in the 
last year, we will be presented with some 
wonderful opportunities, which we 
intend to take advantage of.

Operational review
Introduction
The US remains the most important 
market for the Group generating 48%  
of total revenue in this financial year. 
Since the year end the Group has added 
New York-based consumer PR agency,  
M Booth & Associates to its US interests 
as well as increasing its investment  
in policy communication company,  
463 Communications to 70%. This 
demonstrates its commitment to, and 
confidence in, the US market. The Group 
now has 1 3 offices in the US and Canada 
and employs over 300 members of staff.
This year was the most difficult for the 
US market since 2001. Unsurprisingly our 
businesses in North America were not 
immune to the challenges that the 
global economic crisis created, which 
were first felt in this region. Many clients 
cut budgets in the face of the uncertain 
sales outlook, some clients withdrew 
their agency spend completely and 
others moved more of their spend  
to a project basis rather than monthly 
retainer. The Group responded with 
headcount reductions and the closure  
of the Seattle office. Although this office 
had reduced in significance in recent 
years, it was the first Next Fifteen office 
in the US, opened in 1995, and so it was 
disappointing to see it close.
Despite these challenges the region 
responded extremely positively on a 
number of fronts.
Doing great work
OutCast celebrated its tenth year 
working with cloud computing leader 
salesforce.com and achieved a major 
milestone with Mozilla with the launch 
of Firefox 3.5, which brought Firefox over 
the one billion user downloads mark. 
OutCast also had a successful year  
with Amazon, which launched the  
best-selling Kindle 2 and Kindle DX. 
OutCast worked with fellow Next  
Fifteen agency Text 100 on Amazon  
and brought 463 Communications  
in to Foundation Capital, Yahoo! and 
Facebook. Text 100 achieved great 
coverage for the re-branding of 
Macrovision as Rovi, and also for  
MTV with the global announcement 
around the launch of the Beatles  
Rock Band game.
On the research side, Context Analytics 
produced a study on the most influential 
blogs in North America and another on 
the relationship between brand value 
and media coverage, which found that 
PR was more important than advertising 
for generating brand value for 
companies that sell feature-rich or

Client wins and extended 
relationships
In tough economic times the focus is 
rightly on keeping existing clients happy. 
However, to grow their businesses, the 
Next Fifteen brands were also busy 
pitching and winning some exciting 
new clients. OutCast won work from 
AdMob, Autodesk, LiveOps, Hara, 
MeLLmo, RedPoint, Intuit and VMware. 
Text 100 won new mandates from CNN, 
Mindjet, OboPay, iRex, Intralinks and 
Cognizant. It was also successful in 
extending its global footprint with 
Boston-based The Mathworks and now 
represents them in 14 countries, adding 
India, Australia and Denmark this year. 
Bite was successful with Hitachi Data 
Systems, Lonely Planet and Vonage.  
The biggest challenge for Bite came 
towards the end of the year when  
its largest client, Sun Microsystems,  
was acquired by Oracle. Bite responded 
in typically confident style by winning  
a corporate brief for HP , focusing on 
innovation and sustainability.
Increased momentum  
in social media 
The Group’s businesses have continued 
to drive innovation in the field of social 
media communications. This gives them 
an opportunity to win more business 
and gain access to client budgets held 
outside traditional PR. Demonstrating 
their social media expertise also leads  
to opportunities in sectors beyond the 
ones they normally work in and helps 
them remain relevant as 
communications continues to shift 
online and away from traditional media 
relations activity. OutCast’s work with 
Facebook continues to give them 
unique insights; amongst other tasks 
they helped launch Facebook Connect 
and the new Facebook home page. 
Intuit hired OutCast to lead their social 
media efforts for Quicken Online, and its 
iPhone application became the New York 
Times application of the week. Text 100’s 
project with new client CNN was 
specifically around a revamp of its  
online profile.
Giving something back
It’s not all about client work though, and 
the Group’s businesses are proud to give 
something back to the communities 
they work in. For example Bite’s people 
helped in the community kitchens of 
New York and with beach-cleaning in 
San Francisco. Text 100 partnered with 
TechnoServe and provided employees 
on secondment to work in Peru and 
Tanzania providing PR support to local 
entrepreneurs. 
Recognition
Doing great work is important for clients 
and rewarding when recognised by 
others. Bite won the AMA Award for 
Green Marketing and the 2009 
PRSourceCode Top Tech Communicators 
award for its work for AMD.
The year ahead
The US market, having been first into  
the downturn, seems to be climbing  
out as we head towards the end of 2009. 
The technology-focused brands are 
partnering with many of the most 
interesting and important technology 
companies in the world and can be 
justifiably excited about recovery 
prospects in 2010. With the recent 
acquisition of M Booth, the Group has a 
strong partner in the consumer field and 
opportunity to transfer skills between 
the two sectors for the benefit of the 
clients of each.

Introduction
The UK is the second most important 
revenue market for the Group, 
representing over 25% of total revenue.  
It is also the place where the Group was 
founded back in 1981 and where it is 
headquartered (although Tim Dyson,  
the Group CEO, has been happily based 
in the US for the last 14 years!). The first 
quarter of the financial year was strong, 
with good momentum continuing from 
the previous record year and it seemed 
at that time that the worst of the 
downturn might be contained to the 
financial sector. However, by the 
beginning of 2009, the UK businesses 
had seen some client budget allocations 
significantly reduced and it was clear 
that the UK faced a very difficult year. 
Agency-management teams responded 
quickly and decisively cutting non-
essential costs and reducing staff costs in 
line with revenue projections. Alongside 
the downturn, traditional media outlets 
continued to shrink and the shift to 
online media consumption gathered 
pace. So, with the prospect of reduced 
client spend and a diminishing demand 
for traditional media relations services, 
the response had to be both ambitious 
and thorough.
Merging Inferno and Bite
Inferno had been created by a team 
from Bite in 2003 as a response to client 
conflicts where Bite could not handle 
the work. Inferno had developed 
independently into a good business  
with some great clients, but following a 
strategic review in early 2009 it was felt 
that a merger with Bite would create a 
single entity better positioned to 
succeed in the current marketplace.  
This merged team created a broader 
group of specialists able to deliver 
counsel, create content and drive 
communications campaigns helping 
clients reach the right audiences with 
the right messages through the right 
media. This decision was vindicated as 
the newly merged business pitched  
and won the Logica account in the UK.

Client wins
Despite the economic climate and the 
clear need to deliver outstanding work 
to existing clients, there was still a desire 
to pitch and win new clients. Text 100 
secured regional wins in Europe with 
leading technology brands Skype and 
SanDisk, where London provides the 
central hub team taking the lead  
on content creation, campaign 
development and international 
coordination. Bite was successful against 
some strong competition in securing 
new business from Amadeus, 4Music, 
Juniper and Xerox. Consumer agency 
Lexis had success with DHL, Weight 
Watchers, Strepsils, Beck’s and Flora.
Working together
Research agency Redshift has a different 
business model, being almost exclusively 
reliant on ad hoc research projects.  
So the success of this business depends 
on its ability to win, deliver and secure 
repeat commissions from clients. 
Working with other parts of the Group 
was a key objective when Redshift was 
formed. Redshift works closely with Lexis 
on the consumer side and provides 
media analysis and evaluation work for 
Group companies as they pitch for new 
business. This has helped win business 
with Hitachi Data Systems, Sony 
Professional, HP , AMD and Amadeus. 
Redshift has also worked with Bite in  
the US to develop a proprietary way  
of proving return on investment for  
PR campaigns. Other examples of the  
UK businesses working together are  
EXO, the design team at Lexis, working 
with Bite and Text 100 clients, and Lexis 
working with Text 100’s worldwide 
network on the Barclays Premier  
League account.
Increased momentum in  
social media 
As mentioned above, social media  
and digital campaigns are becoming 
increasingly imbedded into all  
client PR programmes. Worldwide,  
Text 100 worked on more than 300  
social media projects, many of which 
were regular projects for key clients,  
such as IBM. Here Text 100 has been 
working on a landmark social media 
campaign to showcase IBM’s 
technological expertise in the Virtual 
Forbidden City, a breathtaking Second 
Life-like representation of a Chinese 
world from five hundred years ago.  
The campaign utilised social media 
tactics as an integrated component of a 
more traditional marketing programme 
to generate new influencer audiences 
and generate new business leads.
Giving something back
Despite the tough climate, there are 
always those less fortunate to consider. 
The UK businesses have once again 
shown that they care and Lexis raised 
nearly £15,000 for Cancer Research,  
and two staff members went to Ecuador 
to help rebuild a school as part of the  
Sir Bobby Moore project for prostate 
cancer. Text 100 has supported Action 
For Children since 2005 by raising money 
on Byte Night, the IT industry’s annual 
sleep-out in support of Action for 
Children.  Over the last five years  
Text 100 has raised over £23,000. 
Recognition
It’s a source of pride and motivation  
to be recognised for good work and a 
good culture. Text 100 UK was shortlisted 
for the PR Week International Consultancy 
of the Year and was voted as Exceptional 
by Best Companies and ranked No. 29 in 
The Sunday Times Best Small Companies 
to Work For, where Lexis also featured 
once again. Lexis was also shortlisted for 
Best Consumer Campaign by PR Week for 
their work for Boots’ No7 anti-wrinkle 
cream, Protect & Perfect Intense. Redshift 
Research was also recognised with a 
shortlisting in the Best New Agency 
category by the Market Research Society.
The year ahead
2009 has been difficult and the new 
financial year started in August with only 
tentative signs of economic recovery. 
The UK businesses of Next Fifteen have 
weathered the downturn, taken the right 
action and are well positioned to benefit 
from any sustained recovery. Next 
Fifteen is still investing in the UK market 
with the recent announcement of a 
digital PR start-up business in both the 
UK and US, which seeks to supplement 
the work that the existing agencies are 
already doing for their clients.

Introduction
Europe and Africa represented 15%  
of Group revenue this year. Reported 
revenue declined by 3%, but based at 
constant exchange rates the decline was 
13%. The region was affected in a similar 
way to the United Kingdom in terms of 
client budget cuts, although the cycle 
was a little behind but has been more 
prolonged and very difficult to forecast. 
One reason for this lack of visibility is the 
high degree of project revenue in this 
region rather than monthly retainers.  
The proportion is 34% in Europe  
and Africa compared to 15% in US. 
This is also an increasing trend  
and it therefore makes it more difficult  
to predict when the recovery will begin. 
Headcount reductions to match the 
more volatile revenue took longer to 
implement and are more costly than in 
the UK and US. These factors contributed 
to adjusted profit margins falling to 8.9%, 
from 1 1.6% last year. 
Client change
Looking back on the last year reveals  
a higher than usual amount of client 
churn. The client base was under 
pressure to make significant cost 
reductions and this pressure resulted  
in a rise in re-pitching, where it is  
always more difficult for the incumbent 
to win. The two largest and most 
disappointing losses were ARM and 
Novell. These losses detract from a 
successful new-business campaign.  
The most notable successes were the 
SanDisk and Skype wins, where London 
acts as the hub for work performed in 
France, Germany, Spain and Italy. In the 
case of SanDisk this also extends to cover 
Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and 
Norway. From a Next Fifteen perspective 
the best new client win in the region 
was the AMD account where Bite 
benefited from its relationship in the US 
to win the EMEA lead agency role and 
then brought in Text 100 to carry out 
local market implementation in the UK, 
Germany and France.
Cost reduction
The management priority in 2009 was  
to protect the future health of the region. 
Headcount reductions were made to 
match the projected revenue, salary 
reviews were postponed and all non-
essential overhead expenditure was cut 
back. Another action taken to reduce 
cost was the closure of the small office  
in Dublin.
Return to growth
It is a little early to be calling an end to 
the downturn in Europe but markets  
like Germany and Spain are performing 
better than expected in the first quarter 
of the current year. Bite, which only has 
one office in the region is still looking  
to have a bigger presence in the core 
European markets of Germany and 
France and this is something that they 
will explore in 2010.
Europe and Africa

with over 1 00 consultants providing services to companies of all sizes.

Introduction
The Asia Pacific region represents one  
of our biggest management challenges 
simply because of the geographic and 
cultural diversity of the region (or 
actually grouping of regions). Asia Pacific 
increased its share of Group revenue 
from 10.6% last year to 12% this year, with 
a reported growth rate of 17%, but on an 
underlying basis at constant exchange 
rates this was a flat performance.  
This reflects the fact that overall the 
region was only affected by the global 
economic crisis for a relatively short 
period and has been able to return to 
growth. The Group has 16 offices spread 
from China to Australia, plus a further 
three licensed partners, so not all 
markets experienced the downturn 
similarly.
Client activity
The Text 100 business had a strong  
new-business performance and with its 
established office footprint continues  
to attract clients who want a multiple-
market solution. Reliance Globalcom 
became a new global retainer based  
out of Mumbai. 
India also won a retainer with Yahoo! and 
attracted Facebook as a client. PayPal 
appointed Text 100 to new Southeast 
Asia and Japan programmes. The Cisco 
relationship was extended to include a 
PR hub in India and a South Asia PR hub 
in Singapore. The Nokia business was 
retained after a re-pitch in the South Asia 
and Australia region and further projects 
were added in India and China. Lenovo is 
a global client and the regional mandate 
was extended to new areas such as 
internal communications.
Management talent
Text 100 has strong leadership in the  
Asia Pacific region, located in China  
and Australia to address the geographic 
diversity. Strong leadership and a 
talented workforce were rewarded  
by Text 100 being named by the  
Holmes Report as Asia Pacific’s Global 
Technology Consultancy of the Year.
Investment to accelerate growth
Next Fifteen has been looking to expand 
its activities in the region for some  
time and it was very pleasing to be  
able to conclude a deal in October  
2009 with Upstream Marketing and 
Communications Inc. to buy its  
PR activities in China, Singapore and 
Australia. These businesses will form  
the Bite Asia Pacific region, allowing Bite 
to offer a global solution to its existing 
and potential clients. 
Asia Pacific
With 1 6 offices and three licensed partners, Next Fifteen has a 
considerable presence in a region where local knowledge is often  
the most vital criterion for success in business.

 Business review 10-21 18 Next Fifteen Communications Group plc Annual Report 2009
Overview
The year to 31 July 2009 was a difficult 
one. It started with strong momentum 
carried over from the last financial year, 
but with the unfolding of the world 
financial crisis in the first quarter, by the 
end of the first half, in January 2009, the 
business was in a very different place.  
For the whole of the 2009 calendar year 
the business has been anticipating and 
reacting to changes in client budgets 
and trying to steer a course which 
maintained its ability to service client 
needs at an acceptable staff-cost ratio. 
Revenue grew by 3.6% to £65.4m (2008: 
£63.1m), but when adjusting for currency 
movements and the consolidation of a 
previously equity accounted associate, 
underlying activity was down 13%. This 
reduced activity resulted in headcount 
adjustments of a matching scale, which 
is the main element of the separately 
identified reorganisation costs of £1.95m. 
There are a number of adjustments that 
distort the underlying performance of 
the Group and in this review the 
adjusted profit and earnings numbers 
have been used. Adjusted profit before 
income tax fell by 20%, to £5.2m (2008: 
£6.6m) (see note 5), and the adjusted EPS 
fell by 25%, to 6.48p (2008: 8.62p) (see 
note 10). The Group EBITDA
1
 was £5.5m 
(2008: £7 .4m) and it generated £4.8m  
cash from operating activities (2008: 
£8.5m), which helped the Group 
maintain a positive net funds position  
of £1.8m (2008: £3.4m)
2
. 
Foreign exchange risk
The Group has established treasury 
policies and procedures which monitor 
exposure to the US dollar and euro, 
which are the two main operating 
currencies other than sterling. At the 
beginning of the financial year the  
policy of providing protection for the 
anticipated cash profits arising in these 
currencies was in place, with the US 
dollar protected at 1.975 (compared  
with the actual rate of 2.0 for the 
previous financial year) and the euro  
at 1.389 (compared with the actual rate  
of 1.348 for the previous financial year). 
The significant weakening of sterling, 
firstly against the US dollar from August 
2008 and then against the euro from 
November 2008, meant that the 
moderate amount of range-flexibility  
in the cover was breached and over the 
course of the year the contracts that 
matured generated realised losses of 
£2.07m, of which £0.38m was reflected 
in the fair values in the opening balance 
sheet. Most of the contracts expired 
during the year and the Group has 
reassessed its policy on placing forward 
cover, with the result that cover periods 
have shortened and cover is now based 
on the expected surplus cash receipts 
returned to the UK within the current 
financial year only.
IFRS and IAS impacts
The use of IFRS in the consolidated 
accounts continues to generate a 
number of areas of increased volatility  
in reported pre-tax profits compared 
with the position under UK GAAP . In the 
income statement this year, acquisition 
costs have been written off as incurred 
not only on acquisitions that did not 
complete but also on successful ones, 
which completed after the year end, 
which would previously have been 
treated as part of the investment  
(see note 30). 
Under IAS 27 , all entities that are 
controlled within a group must be 
included in the consolidated financial 
statements. Under the agreement 
signed in 2006 which gave the Group  
its 40% ownership stake in 463 
Communications (‘463’), Next Fifteen  
had the right to take a controlling stake 
in 463 during the whole of the financial 
year ended 31 July 2009. Even though 
this right was not exercised until October 
2009, the financial statements for this 
year show 463 on a consolidated basis, 
with the minority interests reflecting the 
60% non-owned holding.

Geographic and client analysis
The Group has 43 offices in 19 countries 
and a further four licensed partners.
During the last year the proportion of 
the Group’s revenue outside the UK was 
around 75%. US and Canada remained 
the largest region, accounting for 48%  
of revenue. With the UK share of revenue 
being 25%, the Group generated 73% of 
its revenue in the two strongest markets 
for public relations services. In Europe 
and Africa the businesses experienced  
a downturn in activity in 2009 of 13% but 
the stronger euro reduced the reported 
fall in revenue to 3%, at £9.8m (2008: 
£10.1m). The Asia Pacific region grew by 
17% to £7 .8m (2008: £6.7m), thanks to 
stronger currency translation and strong 
results posted by its operations in India, 
Malaysia and Japan, but the underlying 
performance overall was flat.
It is also pleasing to note that the spread 
of the Group’s key clients has remained 
similar to last year. The top ten clients 
now represent approximately 36% of the 
revenue of the business, with no single 
client accounting for more than 7%  
of the total.
Margin performance
The adjusted profit margin of the Group 
fell to 8.0%, from 10.4% last year, as a 
consequence of the sudden loss of 
revenue in some markets and the 
foreign exchange contract losses noted 
above. Excluding head office costs 
(which include the foreign exchange 
contract losses), the adjusted profit 
margin was 14.9%, compared with 15.9% 
last year. The Group has worked very 
hard in difficult economic circumstances 
to stay close to its medium-term goal of 
getting this figure up to 16%. The US is 
operating well above this level, at an 
impressive 19.1% but there is still much  
to achieve in some of the smaller  
and less sophisticated markets in the 
APAC region. The staff-cost-to-revenue 
ratio is critical to managing margin 
performance and this was reduced to 
67% (2008: 67 .3%), but is still 2% higher 
than our medium-term target of 65%.
Cash flow
The net cash generated from operations 
was strong once again, at £6.3m, which 
was 1 77% of operating profit. The main 
investment activities in the year requiring 
a cash payment were £2.5m for the 
purchase of the remaining stakes in  
Lexis in October 2008 and a deferred-
consideration payment for OutCast in 
November 2008 of £1.8m. Dividends 
paid to Next Fifteen shareholders  
totalled £0.9m.

Balance sheet
The key movement in the Group’s 
balance sheet is the further goodwill 
arising from the final 12.85% stake 
acquired in Lexis during the year. This 
transaction also meant that the share 
purchase obligation was satisfied and 
the share purchase reserve unwound. 
The cash balances were £7 .1m compared 
to £9.5m last year following the 
acquisition payments referred to above. 
The net funds position after deducting 
bank loans and finance leases was £1.8m 
(2008: £3.4m). Net assets at 31 July 2009 
were £24.9m (2008: £19.6m).
Treasury and funding
The Group has a revolving-credit facility 
from Barclays Bank of £5m to March 201 1, 
which it used to fund the purchases of 
Lexis, the Bite minorities and OutCast. 
The facility is available in a combination 
of sterling, US dollar, and euro at an 
interest rate of 1.25% over LIBOR. In 
addition, the Group has a £6m revolving-
credit facility with Barclays Bank, 
repayable in December 201 1, to help 
fund any future acquisitions, at  
a rate of 2.25% over LIBOR, of which  
$4m has been used to fund the initial 
consideration for the purchase of  
M Booth in August 2009 and $0.5m  
for the purchase of Upstream Asia in 
October 2009. Also available is an 
overdraft facility of £1.5m, available in 
sterling, US dollar and euro, which is 
reviewed annually in November. 
All of the UK businesses are part of a 
composite accounting system which 
allows the offset of UK overdrawn and 
credit balances. In the US, the Group has 
consolidated facilities with Wells Fargo, 
supported by a $2m credit line for 
working capital purposes. The Group 
aims to return any surplus cash to the UK 
subject to any local transfer restrictions, 
and as far as possible to hold only 
moderate non-deposit cash balances in 
overseas subsidiaries, subject to working 
capital needs.
Taxation 
The total tax charge for the year is  
£0.9m (2008: £1.7m) on consolidated 
profit before tax of £3.1m (2008: £5.5m).  
During the year the Group implemented 
a new transfer pricing policy which 
resulted in a more tax efficient allocation 
of worldwide profit and a reduction  
in the Group’s effective tax rate to 28%, 
2% lower than last year.  The Group 
considers 28%–30% to be a realistic 
effective tax rate range for the  
current year.
Earnings 
Basic earnings per share, adjusted for  
the highlighted items shown in note 5, 
fell 25% to 6.48p (see note 10). This fall 
reflected the reduced profit levels but 
was mitigated by the improvement  
to the tax charge in the year but also 
reflects the increased number of shares 
in issue following shares issued for the 
acquisition of the final stake in Lexis.
Dividends
The proposed final ordinary dividend per 
share is 1.25p, which takes the total for 
the year to 1.7p, held in line with a total 
dividend of 1.7p last year. It will be paid 
on 5 February 2010, assuming that  
it is approved at the AGM on 26 January 
2010. The Board continues to view its 
dividend policy over the medium term 
and aims to strike a balance between  
the relevance placed on dividends by 
shareholders and the needs of the 
Company to invest for future growth.

Introduction 
This report provides information on Directors’ remuneration. As the Company is listed on AIM, it does not have to comply with 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the ‘Regulations’). The Board will, however, continue to follow best 
practice and comply with the Regulations to the extent it considers reasonable, and a resolution will be put to shareholders  
at the Company’s Annual General Meeting inviting them to approve this report. 
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) and its role 
For the year ended 31 July 2009 the Committee consisted of the Company’s two non-executive Directors, Ian Taylor 
(Committee Chairman) and Will Whitehorn. The Chief Executive attends certain meetings of the Committee by invitation  
to discuss other executives’ performance, as appropriate. During the year the Committee received advice from the Chief 
Executive in respect of the remuneration of the Finance Director. The Committee takes professional advice as and when  
it considers this necessary.  
The Committee’s principal function is to determine the remuneration packages of the Company’s senior executives and 
executive Directors, and make recommendations to the Board concerning the allocation of bonuses and long-term incentive 
rewards to the two executive Directors and to senior executives in the Group. In addition, it considers the objectives set for 
each senior executive and how he or she has performed against those targets. Its key terms of reference are to: 
• determine and agree with the Board a general policy for the remuneration of the executive Directors and senior executives; 
• determine the total individual remuneration package of each executive Director; 
• determine the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements for executive Directors; and 
• determine and approve the long-term performance-incentive arrangements for executive Directors and senior executives 
of the Group. 
It takes into consideration the performance of the senior executives and Directors and sets the scale and structure of their 
remuneration and the basis of their service agreements, with due regard to the interests of shareholders. No one may 
participate in decisions regarding his or her own remuneration. The Committee’s terms of reference are published on  
the Company’s website. 
Remuneration policy 
The Group’s remuneration policy aims are to: 
• attract, develop, motivate and retain at all levels, talented people, of the calibre required to continue the Group’s growth 
and development; 
• ensure that key executives are appropriately rewarded for their contribution to the Group; and  
• encourage the holding of Company shares as an effective way of aligning the interests of employees with those  
of shareholders. 
In framing this policy, the Remuneration Committee and the Board have given consideration to the provision of the 
Combined Code and the QCA guidelines for AIM companies. In arriving at its recommendations, the Committee considers 
salary surveys covering AIM, small cap, and international PR companies. 
Remuneration package for executive Directors 
The policy for executive Directors’ remuneration is to ensure they are fairly rewarded for their individual contribution to  
the Group’s performance. This is done through a combination of a competitive salary and the opportunity to increase 
remuneration with short-term and long-term incentives. Executive remuneration packages are reviewed each year.  
The remuneration package for executive Directors consists of a basic salary, benefits, an annual performance-related bonus, 
pension and participation in a long-term incentive plan. Details for each Director are set out below. As the Chief Executive  
has a large shareholding in the Company, this is also taken into consideration when decisions are made regarding short-term 
and long-term incentives. The ongoing value of his shareholding is considered to be a long-term incentive for the Chief 
Executive, and therefore less emphasis is placed on other long-term incentives for him.  Remuneration report continued 
30   Next Fifteen Communications Group plc Annual Report 2009 
Short-term incentives 
Executive Directors’ remuneration includes an element of performance-related pay so that awards can be aligned to 
improvements in shareholders’ value. The level of bonuses is entirely at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Bonuses are based on the performance of the Group as a whole against budgets, and the Committee’s assessment of the 
performance of individuals against the personal objectives they have been set. 
Long-term incentives 
The Remuneration Committee recommends the award of share options and performance shares to executive Directors  
(apart from the Chief Executive) and senior executives to incentivise and retain them. In January 2005 shareholders approved 
the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), which provides share option and performance share awards to Directors  
and senior employees. 
Under the terms of the LTIP, participants are either awarded share options with a grant price equal to the market price on  
the day before the grant date, or are awarded performance shares in the Company which are released to the participant  
upon both the satisfaction of certain performance conditions and the participant remaining an employee of the Group. 
During the year the following performance shares were awarded to Directors: 
Name of Director Number of shares Grant date 
End of  
performance  
period 
Executive Directors   
David Dewhurst 80,000 November 2008 31 July 2011 
Non-executive Directors   
Will Whitehorn 30,000 October 2008 31 July 2011 
Ian Taylor 30,000 October 2008 31 July 2011 
The share options and performance shares under the LTIP are subject to the following performance conditions: 
• The adjusted Earnings per Share (‘EPS’) of the Group must exceed the Retail Prices Index (‘RPI’) by an average of 15% or 
more per annum over the performance period for 100% of the award to vest. 
• If there is an average of between 5% and 15% EPS growth over RPI per annum over the performance period, between 20% 
and 100% of the award will vest on a straight-line basis. 
• If EPS does not grow an average of 5% or more over RPI per annum over the performance period, none of the award  
will vest. 
The performance period over which the above test is measured is three consecutive financial years of the Group commencing 
with the financial year in which the award is granted. 
EPS growth will be calculated from the information published in the Group’s accounts. The awards will vest when the 
preliminary results for the final financial year of the relevant performance period are released. 
Various employees and Directors still have options that were issued under previous Next Fifteen Executive Share Option 
Schemes. Under such schemes, share options were issued at the market price on the day before the option was granted (or 
on another date no more than 30 days prior to the grant date). The share options become exercisable on the following dates: 
• The first one-third of the total number granted on the third anniversary of the date of granting. 
• The second one-third of the total number granted on the fourth anniversary of the date of granting. 
• The final one-third of the total number granted on the fifth anniversary of the date of granting.

The share options will lapse on the date of cessation of the participant’s employment with the Group or ten years after the 
date on which the options were granted. 
For all options granted after 30 November 1999 there is a performance criterion that the options may not be exercised unless 
the Group’s earnings per share has, over a three-year period beginning not earlier than the financial year in which the option 
is granted and ending on the financial year preceding the year in which the option is exercised, grown by at least 30%. 
Options granted before this date did not have specific performance criteria. Share price growth was expected to be derived 
from EPS growth but without a hurdle-rate for exercise. 
Directors’ service contracts 
All executive Directors have rolling contracts that are terminable on six months’ notice. There are no contractual entitlements 
to compensation on termination of the employment of any of the Directors other than payment in lieu of notice at the 
discretion of the Company. The executive Directors are allowed to accept appointments and retain payments from sources 
outside the Group, provided such appointments are approved by the Board in writing. Details of the executive Directors’ 
current service contracts are:

General Meeting. Non-executive Directors are not entitled to any pension benefit or any payment in compensation for early 
termination of their appointment. Details of the date of the current letters of appointment for non-executive Directors are:

Performance graph 
The following graph illustrates the Group’s total shareholder return since 31 July 2004 relative to the FTSE Media Index. 
Since March 2005, the Company has been listed on AIM in the Media sector, but there are no five-year historical data for this 
sector. The Committee considers that a comparison of its total shareholder return to that of similar businesses on the full list is 
more relevant than a comparison with the FTSE AIM All-Share index. 
 
The graph looks at the value, by the end of July 2009, of £100 invested in the Company compared with £100 invested in the 
FTSE Media Index.

  Directors’ statement on corporate governance 
34   Next Fifteen Communications Group plc Annual Report 2009 
The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good corporate governance. The Company is committed to high 
standards of corporate governance throughout the Group and has adopted appropriate measures for a Company of its size. 
This report sets out the measures it has taken. 
The Board 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the strategic direction, investment decisions and effective control of the Group.  
As Tim Dyson, the Chief Executive, is located in San Francisco, the Board meets mainly by telephone conference (at least 
monthly and at other times when required). They meet face-to-face when possible and aim to do so at least quarterly. There is 
a schedule of matters reserved for Board approval which is regularly reviewed and includes, among other things, the Group’s 
annual budget, establishment of new subsidiaries, property leases, significant acquisitions or disposals of fixed assets, and 
significant client contracts. During the year, 19 Board meetings were held, which included three face-to-face meetings (the 
others being by telephone conference). All Directors attended all meetings, save for Ian Taylor, who was unable to attend two 
meetings, and David Dewhurst, who was unable to attend one meeting. 
The Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee comprise the two non-executive Directors, Ian Taylor (Committee 
Chairman) and Will Whitehorn. The Nomination Committee comprises Will Whitehorn (Committee Chairman), Ian Taylor  
and Tim Dyson. There were two Remuneration Committee meetings and two Audit Committee meetings during the year, 
and these were attended by all members. 
Prior to each monthly Board meeting, every member of the Board receives an agenda, supporting documents and when 
relevant, monthly trading results, together with a detailed commentary. The non-executive Directors are encouraged to ask 
for further information if necessary. 
The non-executive Directors held meetings during the year without the executives present to discuss, among other things, 
the performance of the Company and that of the executive Directors. 
Chairman and Chief Executive 
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and clearly defined. The Chairman, Will Whitehorn, is responsible 
for the leadership of the Board and the Chief Executive, Tim Dyson, is responsible for managing the Group’s operations. 
Board balance and independence 
There were no changes to the Board during the year to 31 July 2009. The Board comprises two executive Directors: Tim Dyson, 
Chief Executive, and David Dewhurst, Finance Director. There are two non-executive Directors: Will Whitehorn, Chairman, and 
Ian Taylor, who is also the Company’s senior independent Director. Biographies of all the Directors are set out on pages 22  
and 23. The Board considers that the current Board structure is appropriate, and it complies with the QCA guidelines for AIM 
companies which permits an independent Chairman to be counted as one of the two independent non-executive Directors. 
The Board views both Ian Taylor and Will Whitehorn as independent by the criteria set out in the Combined Code, and free 
from any relationship or circumstance which could affect their independent judgement. 
Appointments to the Board 
Appointments to the Board are the responsibility of the Board upon recommendation of the Nomination Committee.  
There was no requirement for a Nomination Committee meeting during the year. 
Information and professional development 
The Directors have adopted a number of policies and procedures to help them operate effectively. These include access  
to independent professional advice. Appropriate training for new and existing Directors is provided where necessary. 
Re-election of Directors 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association one-third of the Directors must retire by rotation each year.  
This year Will Whitehorn and Ian Taylor will retire and will be subject to re-election.

Remuneration 
The Remuneration report on pages 29 to 33 sets out details of the Directors’ remuneration and the work of the  
Remuneration Committee. 
Financial reporting 
The Statement of the Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of the Financial statements is set out on page 37. The Directors  
have reviewed the Group’s budget and cash requirements for the year ending 31 July 2010 and considered outline plans for 
the Group thereafter. The Directors are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going-concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements. 
Internal control and principal risks 
The Directors have responsibility for the system of internal control for the Group and for reviewing its effectiveness. It is the 
responsibility of management to implement Board policies on risk and control. The Group’s system of internal control is 
designed to manage and reduce, rather than eliminate, risk. 
The Board assesses key areas of internal control and risk management and sets policies accordingly. At least once a year each 
of the core businesses is given the task of identifying and setting out its own key risks. The resulting document must contain a 
review of the extent and likelihood of each risk and the effectiveness of the controls that manage these risks. The Board also 
requires the businesses to identify and report any significant risks that arise during the year as soon as they arise. The Audit 
Committee reviews the businesses’ risk documents and produces a significant-risks document for the Group which is 
considered and approved by the Board. It identifies ways to manage and control these risks and sets policies accordingly. 
The Board can therefore confirm that there is a process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks facing the 
Group. It has been in place throughout the year, and is up-to-date (as at the date of approval of these financial statements).  
It is regularly reviewed and accords with the Turnbull guidance. 
The Board considers the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group to be: 
• Employee risk – ensuring that the right people are in the right roles and key employees are retained. As a public relations 
business, the Company is heavily reliant on key employees who are vital to its success. The ability to recruit new talent  
and retain existing employees remains an important issue for the Group. The Group’s HR teams regularly consider  
talent-management issues and the remuneration and motivation of staff. 
• Client risk – the loss of a major client. The Group is continuing to reduce the percentage of total revenue that comes from  
a few major clients; however, the loss of clients is still a risk to the Group. In the technology sector, merger and acquisition 
activity has led to increased consolidation of companies, which can also lead to the loss of clients. All businesses continue 
to actively seek new clients to keep the reliance on major clients to a minimum. 
• Currency risk – although the Company is listed in the UK, it makes much of its profit outside the UK. This exposes it to the 
risk of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Group has established treasury policies and procedures to mitigate this 
risk as much as possible. A sub-committee of the Board has been established to consider if and when hedging products 
should be put in place. 
• Regional risk – as a global company, the Group needs different approaches  in different regions as the economy changes. 
The Group needs to ensure it has appropriate strategies and policies to respond to regional changes.  
The Board has considered the need for a separate internal audit function but has decided that, because of the size of the 
Group, this function will continue to be carried out by existing finance staff. This decision will be reviewed annually.  Directors’ statement on corporate governance continued 
36   Next Fifteen Communications Group plc Annual Report 2009 
Audit Committee and auditors 
The Audit Committee meets periodically and at least twice per year with the external auditors, and with other Directors  
and management attending by invitation. The primary role of the Committee is to keep under review the Group’s financial 
reporting procedures and financial systems and controls and to ensure the integrity of the financial information reported  
to shareholders. Its key terms of reference are: 
• reviewing the findings of the audit work undertaken by the Group’s auditors; 
• reviewing the effectiveness of the financial reporting and internal control procedures; 
• reviewing the relationship with external auditors; and 
• determining the level of the auditors’ fees. 
Its terms of reference are available on the Company’s website www.nextfifteen.com. The independence and objectivity of  
the auditors are considered by the Committee on a regular basis. The split between audit and non-audit work for the year  
is set out in note 4 to the financial statements. The non-audit fees were in respect of non-audit tax services, advice on the 
Company’s share option and long-term incentive schemes and corporate finance advisory work. This work is not considered 
to affect the independence or objectivity of the auditors. The Committee also receives an annual confirmation of 
independence from the auditors. 
Relations with shareholders 
The Company meets regularly with its institutional shareholders and is keen to encourage shareholder participation at  
the Annual General Meeting, at which the Chief Executive makes a presentation summarising the progress of the Group 
throughout the year and invites any questions from attendees. Proxy votes are disclosed following a show of hands on each 
resolution. Prior to last year’s Annual General Meeting all shareholders were given the opportunity to submit questions to  
the Board even if they were unable to attend. These questions were answered by the Board and a video of this question- 
and-answer session was uploaded to the Company’s website. The Company also publishes its annual and interim reports  
on its website, as well as the Company’s regulatory news announcements and some analyst reports. The Company has also 
started adding video clips to its website when it announces its interim and full-year results to explain the results further.  
These measures enable information on the Company to reach a greater number of investors and interested stakeholders. 
The Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director regularly attend one-to-one meetings with key institutional shareholders 
after the publication of the Company’s interim and preliminary results. While the other non-executive Director does not 
ordinarily attend meetings with major shareholders, he would do so if requested by the shareholders.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements. The Directors are required to 
prepare the financial statements for the Group in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’), as adopted by the European Union, and the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading 
securities on the Alternative Investment Market. The Directors have chosen to prepare financial statements for the Company 
in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial period the Group’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, 
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of 
Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable 
International Financial Reporting Standards. A fair presentation also requires the Directors to: 
• consistently select and apply appropriate accounting policies; 
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and  
financial performance. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view  
of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• prepare the financial statements on a going-concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements. 
Financial statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility  
also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

in shareholders’ funds and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation  
of the Group financial statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’), as adopted  
by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in preparation of the Parent Company 
financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with sections 495 and 496 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of  
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.  
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion:  
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 July 
2009 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
• the Parent Company’s financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of IAS Regulations.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

1 Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below.  
These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated. 
A. Basis of preparation 
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted 
by the European Union (‘adopted IFRS’). 
The income statement for the year ended 31 July 2008 presented gains or losses on forward foreign exchange contracts that 
were settled during the year within other operating charges. The movement in the fair value of forward foreign exchange 
contracts open at the opening and closing balance sheet dates was presented within finance expense. The income statement 
for the year ended 31 July 2008 has been restated to ensure that these items are both presented within other operating 
charges. This resulted in a decrease in finance expense and a corresponding increase in other operating charges of £589,000. 
There is no impact on profit for the year. 
B. Transitional provisions of IFRS accounting policies 
The Group’s date of transition to adopted IFRS is 1 August 2006. IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards sets out the procedures that the Group has followed as the basis for preparing its consolidated financial statements 
under IFRS. The Group was required to establish its IFRS accounting policies as at 31 July 2008 and, in general, apply these 
retrospectively to determine the IFRS balance sheet at the date of transition. 
The standard provides a number of optional exemptions to this general principal. The most significant of these are set out 
below, together with the description in each case of the exemptions adopted by the Group. 
i) Business combinations that occurred before the transition date (IFRS 3 Business Combinations) 
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations that took place before the date of 
transition. As a result, in the transition balance sheet, goodwill arising on past business combinations remains as stated under 
UK GAAP as at 31 July 2006. 
ii) Fair value or revaluation at deemed cost (IAS 16 Property and Equipment) 
The option to restate items of property, plant and equipment to their fair value at the transition date has not been taken  
by the Group. For all items, the Group has elected to take their carrying value as shown previously under UK GAAP as their 
deemed cost. 
iii) Foreign currency translation reserve (IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange) 
For accounting periods beginning on or after the transition date, IFRS requires amounts taken to reserves on the translation  
of foreign subsidiaries, associates and branches to be recorded in a separate foreign currency translation reserve and to be 
included in the future calculation of profit or loss on disposal of the subsidiary, associate or branch. The foreign currency 
translation reserve was set at zero at the transition date. 
C. Basis of consolidation 
The Group’s financial statements consolidate the results of Next Fifteen Communications Group plc and all of its subsidiary 
undertakings using the acquisition method of accounting. 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. 
In the consolidated balance sheet, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised 
at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the date on which control is obtained.   Notes to the accounts continued 
46   Next Fifteen Communications Group plc Annual Report 2009 
1 Accounting policies (continued) 
C. Basis of consolidation (continued) 
Where the Group obtains and recognises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an associate 
undertaking, the associate becomes a subsidiary. The assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities and results are accounted for in 
line with subsidiary accounting discussed above, effective from the date in which control is recognised (the acquisition date). 
Control can be gained where the right to purchase the majority shareholding exists, whether or not that right is exercised. 
Where the recognition of control is accompanied with a purchase of a shareholding in the now subsidiary, goodwill is 
calculated at the acquisition date. Goodwill is calculated separately for each tranche of shares acquired and is based on the  
fair value of the consideration less the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. The original holding 
(prior to the recognition of the associate as a subsidiary) is revalued based on existing fair values at the acquisition date  
and any gain or loss is recognised in a separate revaluation reserve within equity in the consolidated balance sheet.  
See V(III) for information regarding accounting for the increase in stake of a subsidiary.  
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies (Next Fifteen 
Communications Group plc and its subsidiaries) are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies for subsidiaries have been changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 
D. Merger reserve 
Where the conditions set out in section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 (section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 after  
1 October 2009) are met, shares issued as part of the consideration in a business combination are measured at their fair  
value in the consolidated balance sheet, and the difference between the nominal value and fair value of the shares issued  
is recognised in the merger reserve. 
E. Associates 
Where the Group has the power to exercise significant influence (but not control) over the financial and operating policy 
decisions of another entity, it is classified as an associate. Associates are initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet 
at cost. The Group’s share of post-acquisition profits and losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except 
that losses in excess of the Group’s investment in the associate are not recognised unless there is an obligation to make good 
those losses. 
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and its associates are recognised only to the extent of unrelated 
investors’ interests in the associate. The investor’s share in the associate’s unrealised profits and losses resulting from these 
transactions is eliminated against the carrying value of the associate. 
F. Revenue 
Billings represents amounts receivable from clients, exclusive of VAT, sales taxes and trade discounts in respect of charges for 
fees, commission and rechargeable expenses incurred on behalf of clients. 
Revenue is billings less amounts payable on behalf of clients to external suppliers where they are retained to perform part  
of a specific client project or service, and represents fees, commissions and mark-ups on rechargeable expenses. Revenue is 
recognised on the following basis: 
• Retainer and other non-retainer fees are recognised as the services are performed, in accordance with the terms of the 
contractual arrangement. 
• Project fees are recognised on a percentage completion basis as contract activity progresses, if the final outcome can be 
assessed with reasonable certainty. The stage of completion is generally measured on the basis of the services performed  
to date as a percentage of the total services to be performed. 
• Expenses are recharged to clients at cost plus an agreed mark-up when the services are performed.

G. Intangible assets 
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the interest in the fair value of identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Cost comprises the fair values of assets given, liabilities assumed and 
equity instruments issued, plus any direct costs of acquisition. Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any 
impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement. 
Software Licences for software that are not integral to the functioning of a computer are capitalised as intangible assets.  
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, 
and that are expected to generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. 
Direct costs include software development employee costs. 
Amortisation is provided on software at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly 
over its expected useful life of five to seven years. 
No amortisation is charged on assets in the course of construction until they are available for operational use in the business. 
Capitalised computer software that is not an asset in the course of construction is amortised on a straight-line basis over its 
useful economic life. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense  
as incurred. 
Trade names Trade names acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Trade names 
have a finite useful life and are carried at costs less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line 
method to allocate the cost of trade names over their estimated useful lives of 20 years. 
Customer relationships Contractual customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at  
the acquisition date. The contractual customer relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected life of the customer relationship  
of three to five years. 
H. Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and 
equipment at annual rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly over its expected 
useful life as follows: 
Short leasehold improvements – Over the term of the lease, or until the first break clause. 
Office equipment – 20% – 50% per annum straight-line. 
Office furniture – 20% per annum straight-line. 
Motor vehicles – 25% per annum straight-line. 
I. Impairment 
Impairment tests on goodwill are undertaken annually at the financial year end. Other non-financial assets (including 
investments in associates but excluding deferred tax) are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is measured as the higher of value in use and  
fair value less costs to sell, the asset is impaired accordingly. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the 
asset’s cash-generating unit, defined as the lowest group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows. Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination giving rise to the goodwill. 
Impairment charges are included within amortisation in the consolidated income statement, except to the extent they 
reverse gains previously recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed.  Notes to the accounts continued 
48   Next Fifteen Communications Group plc Annual Report 2009 
1 Accounting policies (continued) 
J. Foreign currency 
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment  
in which they operate (their ‘functional currency’) are recorded at the exchange rates ruling when the transactions occur. 
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in 
the income statement. Foreign exchange movements on inter-company loans with indefinite terms, and for which there  
is no expectation of a demand for repayment, are recognised directly in equity.    
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the 
accounting period. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those 
operations, are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translating 
the opening net assets at opening rates, the results of overseas operations at average rates and on foreign currency 
borrowings are recognised directly in the foreign currency translation reserve within equity. 
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative translation differences recognised in the foreign currency translation 
reserve relating to that operation up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated income statement as part  
of the profit or loss on disposal. 
K. Segment reporting 
A business segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing an individual product or 
service or a group of related products or services that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other 
business segments. A geographical segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing 
products or services within a particular economic environment and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from 
those of components operating in other economic environments. 
Primary segment: The Group has one business segment, being the provision of public relations services. 
 A second business segment, being research, is not large enough to require segmental disclosure. 
Secondary segments: The Group operates in four geographical segments, being the UK, Europe and Africa, US and Canada, 
and Asia Pacific. 
L. Financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual 
provisions of the asset or liability. The Group’s accounting policies for different types of financial asset and liability are 
described below. 
Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and will subsequently be measured at amortised cost 
less allowances for impairment. An allowance for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective 
evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty, or default or significant delay in payment) 
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of 
the allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows 
associated with the impaired receivable. Such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being 
recognised as an expense in the other operating charges line. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be 
collectable, the gross carrying value is written off against the associated allowance. 
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and short-term call deposits held with banks.  
Bank overdrafts are shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, except where 
there is a pooling arrangement with a bank that allows them to be offset against cash balances. In such cases the net cash 
balance will be shown within cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet.

1 Accounting policies (continued) 
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments utilised by the Group are protection contracts on US dollar 
interest rate contracts (cap-and-collar) and US dollar and euro foreign exchange contracts. Derivative financial instruments  
are initially recognised at fair value at the contract date and continue to be stated at fair value at the balance sheet date  
with gains and losses on revaluation being recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. 
The fair value of derivative financial liabilities is determined by reference to third party, market valuations. 
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recognised at their fair value net of direct issue costs and, 
thereafter, at amortised cost. Finance costs are charged to the consolidated income statement over the term of the debt so 
that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Finance costs include issue costs which are initially 
recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument and unwound over the term of the debt. 
Share purchase obligation Put option agreements that allow the Group’s equity partners to require the Group to purchase  
the minority interest are recorded in the balance sheet as liabilities. On initial recognition, the liability is measured at the 
present value of the ultimate expected payment with the corresponding debit included in the share purchase reserve. 
Subsequent movements in the present value of the ultimate expected payment are recognised in the consolidated  
income statement. 
Trade payables Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and, thereafter, at amortised cost. 
M. Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. 
N. Borrowing costs 
Finance costs of borrowing are recognised in the income statement over the term of the borrowings. 
O. Retirement benefits 
Pension costs which relate to payments made by the Group to employees’ own defined contribution pension plans are 
charged to the consolidated income statement as incurred. 
P. Share-based payments 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The share-based payments are measured at  
fair value at the date of the grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The cumulative expense is 
adjusted for failure to achieve non-market vesting conditions. 
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model on the grounds that there are no market-related vesting conditions.  
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the Board’s best estimate, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
Q. Leased assets 
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased asset have been transferred to the Group  
(a ‘finance lease’), the asset is treated as if it had been purchased outright. The amount initially recognised as an asset is the 
lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments payable over the term of the 
lease. The corresponding lease commitment is shown as a liability. Lease payments are analysed between capital and interest. 
The interest element is charged to the consolidated income statement over the period of the lease and is calculated so that it 
represents a constant proportion of the lease liability. The capital element reduces the balance owed to the lessor. 
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group (an ‘operating lease’), 
the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term. The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction to the rental expense over the lease term  
on a straight-line basis. 
The land and buildings elements of property leases are considered separately for the purposes of lease classification.  Notes to the accounts continued 
50   Next Fifteen Communications Group plc Annual Report 2009 
1 Accounting policies (continued) 
R. Deferred taxation 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet differs 
from its tax base, except for differences arising on: 
• the initial recognition of goodwill; 
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and 
• investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal  
of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised. 
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered). 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either: 
• the same taxable group company; or 
• different group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities 
are expected to be settled or recovered. 
Where a temporary difference arises between the tax base of employee share options and their carrying value, a deferred  
tax asset should arise. To the extent the future tax deduction exceeds the related cumulative IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments 
(‘IFRS 2’) expense, the excess of the associated deferred tax balance is recognised directly in equity. To the extent the future 
tax deduction matches the cumulative IFRS 2 expense, the associated deferred tax balance is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. 
S. Dividends 
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.  
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting. 
T. Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) 
As the Group is deemed to have control of its ESOP trust, the trust is treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for the purposes 
of the Group accounts. The ESOP’s assets (other than investments in the Company’s shares), liabilities, income and expenses 
are included on a line-by-line basis in the Group financial statements. The ESOP’s investment in the Group’s shares is deducted 
from equity in the consolidated balance sheet as if they were treasury shares and presented in the investment-in-own-shares 
reserve. 
U. Treasury shares 
When the Group re-acquires its own equity instruments, those instruments (treasury shares) are deducted from equity.  
No gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s 
treasury shares. Such treasury shares may be acquired and held by other members of the Group. Consideration paid or 
received is recognised directly in equity.

1 Accounting policies (continued) 
V. Significant estimates and judgements 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the Group to make certain estimates and assumptions  
that have an impact on the application of the policies and amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. 
Estimates and judgements are evaluated based on historical experiences and expected outcomes and are believed to be 
reasonable at the time such estimates and judgements are made, although actual experience may vary from these estimates. 
I. Impairment of goodwill In line with lAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group is required to test the carrying value of goodwill,  
at least annually, for impairment. As part of this review process the recoverable amount of the goodwill is determined using 
value-in-use calculations, which requires estimates of future cash flows and as such is subject to estimates and assumptions. 
Further details are contained in note 11. 
II. Taxation The Group is subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions and significant judgement is required in determining 
the provision for income taxes. The Group recognises assets/liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the tax 
treatment. Where the final tax outcome is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact 
the income tax and deferred tax provisions. 
III. Accounting for the increase in stake of a subsidiary IFRS 3 Business Combinations does not provide guidance on this subject, as 
increasing the holding in a business which is already treated as a subsidiary is outside the scope of IFRS 3. The purchase of  
an additional stake in a business does not constitute a business combination as the business combination occurred when 
control was established. The Board has exercised judgement regarding the accounting treatment of increasing the holding  
in a subsidiary, and the part or full acquisition of a minority interest is treated as giving rise to additional economic interest 
held by the Group. A purchase will generally result in the recognition of goodwill and reduced minority interest. Goodwill is 
recognised according to the fair value of the consideration and the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the date  
of the purchase. 
W. New standards and amendments not applied 
Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that have been published as mandatory for later 
accounting periods but are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group are as follows: 
a) Interpretations to existing standards and new standards which are not yet effective but are mandatory to the Group’s future 
accounting periods, which the Group has not early adopted 
IFRS 8 Operating Segments (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009) replaces IAS 14 and aligns 
segment reporting with the requirements of the US standard and SFAS 131 Disclosures about Segments and an Enterprise 
and Related Information. The new standard uses a ‘management approach’ under which segment information is presented 
on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. 
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements revised (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009).  
IAS 1 has been revised to enhance the usefulness of information presented in the Group financial statements. 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009) requires that all 
acquisition costs must be expensed, contingent consideration is to be measured at fair value at the acquisition date and  
any subsequent movements must be recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement. In addition, equity 
interests held prior to control being obtained must be re-measured at fair value at the acquisition date, with any gain or  
loss recognised in the consolidated income statement. Increases in ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result  
in a change of control are treated as transactions amongst equity holders and reported within equity.  Notes to the accounts continued 
52   Next Fifteen Communications Group plc Annual Report 2009 
1 Accounting policies (continued) 
Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 July 2009). This amendment relates in particular to acquisitions of subsidiaries achieved in stages and disposals of 
interests, with significant differences in the accounting depending on whether control is gained or not, or a transaction  
simply results in a change in the percentage of the controlling interest. The amendment does not require the restatement  
of previous transactions. The amendment to IAS 27 must be adopted at the same time as IFRS 3 Revised. 
IAS 23 Borrowing Costs revised (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). The revised standard 
eliminates the option of expensing all borrowing costs and requires all borrowing costs to be capitalised if they are directly 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset. 
IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations (effective for accounting periods beginning on or  
after 1 January 2009) requires that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only and that  
all cancellations, whether by the entity or other parties, should receive the same accounting treatment. 
Amendments to IFRS 7 (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). This amendment requires  
the analysis of each class of financial asset and financial liability into a three-level fair value measurement hierarchy. It also 
implements some changes to the definition of and disclosures associated with liquidity risk. 
IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement: Eligible Hedged Items (effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2009) clarifies the principles that determine whether a hedged risk or portion of cash flows  
is eligible for designation. 
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 
2009) clarifies that the presentation currency does not create an exposure to which an entity may apply hedge accounting 
and the hedging instrument(s) may be held by any entity or entities within the Group, other than the entity being hedged. 
IAS 24 Related Party Transactions (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011) clarifies and simplifies 
the definition of a related party. 
b) Interpretations to existing standards which are not yet effective and not relevant for the Group’s operations 
IFRS 1, lAS 27 Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly controlled Entity or Associate (effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009). 
IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009). 
IFRIC 18 Transfer of Assets from Customers (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009). 
Amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1 Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation (effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). 
Amendments to IFRIC 9 and IAS 39 Embedded Derivatives (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after  
30 June 2009). 
Amendments to IFRS2 Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions (effective for accounting periods beginning  
on or after 1 January 2010). 
The Group does not consider that these standards will have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group  
in the period of initial application. The impact of the revisions to IAS 27 and IFRS 3 will depend on the circumstances of the 
business combinations occurring on or after 1 August 2009.

Forward foreign exchange contracts held by the Group are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet at each reporting date and the movement on such 
contracts is recognised within operating expenses in the income statement. These financial instruments comprise financial products used for hedging currency 
exposure on US dollar and euro. The movement in fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts since 31 July 2008 is a credit of £325,000 (2008: charge  
of £589,000).

The reorganisation costs of £1,950,000 relate to redundancies across the Group, the closure of the Text 100 Seattle office and the costs associated with the merger 
of Inferno Communications Limited (‘Inferno’) into Bite Communications Limited (‘Bite’) on 1 May 2009. £115,000 of the costs can be attributed to the closure of the 
Seattle office (£82,000 due to headcount reductions and £33,000 due to other office closure costs), and £584,000 of the reorganisation costs relate to the merger of 
Inferno with Bite (£282,000 of these costs can be attributed to the onerous lease provision and dilapidations provision on the premises occupied by Inferno until 
the date of the merger. £170,000 can be directly attributed to redundancy costs and the remaining £132,000 relates to other office closure costs). The remaining 
£1,251,000 of reorganisation costs have been incurred as a result of headcount reductions required to reflect revenue expectations in the worsening economy. 
4
A total interest charge of £95,000 (2008: £312,000) has been recognised during the period. £61,000 (2008: £128,000) of the charge relates to the unwinding of the 
discount on the deferred consideration payable for OutCast Communications Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group since June 2005), and £34,000 
(2008: £184,000) relates to the unwinding of the discount on the share purchase obligation for Lexis Public Relations Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of the 
Group since October 2008). This interest charge is notional and relates to the difference between the discounted liability recognised and the actual liability settled. 
5
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed for impairment 
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment charge has been recognised for the 
goodwill recognised by Bite Communications Limited (‘Bite’) on acquisition of Credo Communications Limited (‘Credo’) on 31 December 2005. The operations 
were transferred into Bite and the decision has been made to write down the goodwill by £116,000 due to Credo client revenue reductions. See note 11.

On 1 August 2008, the Group recognised control of 463 Communications LLC (‘463 LLC’) and acquired intangibles of £470,000 relating to trade name (£192,000) 
and customer relationships (£278,000). 
On 1 September 2008, Bite Communications Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) purchased the business and certain assets of AimPR Public 
Relations AB, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden, and acquired intangibles of £187,000 relating to customer relationships including £4,000 of capitalised  
legal and professional fees.   
See note 27. 
Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of cash-generating unit (‘CGUs’) for impairment 
testing as follows: 
 
2009  
£’000 
2008 
£’000 
Bite (UK) 1,628 1,744
Bite (US) 321 269
Lexis (UK) 8,383 6,876
OutCast (US) 6,377 5,338
Context Analytics (US) 30 24
 16,739 14,251
The recoverable amounts of all CGUs have been determined from value-in-use calculations using a projection period of five 
years for each cash-generating unit. The basis for this is the 2010 budget approved by the Board, with a further four years 
based on projected pre-tax cash flows extrapolated using a growth rate of 2.5%. After the initial projection period, a steady 
long-term growth rate of 2.5% has been applied to the pre-tax cash flow forecast into perpetuity. This is considered prudent 
based on experience and current expectations of the long-term industry growth rate. A pre-tax discount rate, being the 
Group’s weighted average cost of capital of 10.0% (2008: 12.2%), has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.  Notes to the accounts continued 
60   Next Fifteen Communications Group plc Annual Report 2009 
11 Intangible assets (continued) 
The Board has considered reasonable possible sensitivities in key assumptions on which the value-in-use calculations are 
based. If growth rates reduced to 1%, or if the discount rate increased to 20%, this would not cause the carrying values of the 
groups of CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts in all cases except for Lexis. Sensitivity analysis shows that if the discount 
rate is increased in isolation to 17.2%, the estimated recoverable amount of Lexis is equal to carrying value. 
The review performed at year end resulted in the impairment of Credo, part of the Bite (UK) CGU. Credo was acquired on  
31 December 2005 and was fully integrated into Bite Communications Limited. The impairment loss of £116,000 arose due  
to Credo client revenue reductions. 
There was no other impairment of goodwill as the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value in all  
other cases.

14 Investment in associates 
On 31 January 2006 the Company invested in a 40% stake of 463 Communications LLC (‘463 LLC’) for a consideration of 
$20,000 and has, until 1 August 2008, treated this as an associate undertaking in the Group accounts under the equity method 
of accounting. The carrying value of the investment at 31 July 2008 was £190,000.  
On 1 August 2008 the Group had the right to purchase an additional 11% of 463 LLC (taking the holding to 51%) and acquire 
control of the business. Since this date 463 LLC has been accounted for as a subsidiary.

Provisions comprise liabilities where there is uncertainty about the timing of settlement, but where a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount. The provision covers the cost of rent, rates and dilapidations on an unoccupied leasehold property due 
to the merger of Inferno Communications Limited into Bite Communications Limited on 1 May 2009, for which the lease runs 
to December 2010. No reimbursement for a sub-lease is expected, and the effect of discounting is deemed immaterial.

OutCast Communications Corporation (‘OutCast’) became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group in June 2005. £176,000 of the current deferred consideration 
liability relates to the final payment due in October 2009 of discounted cash consideration for OutCast. 
On 1 September 2008 Bite Communications Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group) acquired the business and certain assets of AimPR Public Relations 
AB (‘AimPR’), a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Initial consideration of SEK990,000 (£84,000) was paid and a further SEK1,206,000 (£100,000) deferred.  
Prior to the 31 July 2009, SEK574,000 (£48,000) of this deferred consideration was settled with SEK632,000 (£52,000) outstanding at the year end. 
In November 2008 $3,023,000 (£1,843,000) of deferred consideration was paid for OutCast, £1,145,000 for Lexis Public Relations Limited (‘Lexis’) and in February 
2009, £48,000 of deferred consideration for AimPR was paid. Total deferred consideration paid during the year was £3,036,000.

Deferred tax has been calculated using the anticipated rates that will apply when the assets and liabilities are expected to 
reverse based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The recoverability of deferred tax 
assets is supported by the expected level of future profits in the countries concerned. 
20 Financial instruments 
Financial risk management, policies and strategies 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, finance leases, cash and short-term deposits and derivative 
financial instruments. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s operations.  
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and payables, which arise directly  
from operations. 
The Group enters into derivative transactions, primarily cap-and-collar interest rate and forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The purpose of such contracts is to protect the profits and surplus funds arising in principal markets from currency 
fluctuations and to manage the interest rate risks on the Group’s sources of finance. At 31 July 2009 a total of $2,400,000  
and €1,875,000 was protected by the derivative foreign exchange transactions entered into by the Group. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk and  
credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.

Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations 
with floating interest rates and cap-and-collar interest rate derivatives. 
The Group’s policy is to manage its interest costs arising on variable rate debts by entering into interest rate cap-and-collar 
contracts. These agreements are designated to protect underlying debt obligations against significant increases in interest 
rates as required under the terms of the Group’s revolving loan facility with Barclays Bank. At 31 July 2009 all US dollar 
borrowings have been capped at 6.25%. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held 
constant, of the Group’s profit before tax at 31 July 2009 based on year end balances and rates.

A rise in US interest rates of 2% would give a positive movement of £240,000 (2008: £260,000) in the fair value of the interest 
rate cap-and-collar contract. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group manages its risk to a shortage of funds with a mixture of long and short-term committed facilities. As at 31 July 
2009 the Group had undrawn committed facilities of £6,000,000 (2008: £7,500,000). In addition, the Group has an overdraft 
facility of £1,500,000 at a rate of 2.25% above Barclays Bank's base rate, available in sterling, US dollar and euro, and an 
overdraft facility of £1,206,000 ($2,000,000) at a rate of Wells Fargo Bank’s prime rate or LIBOR +1.25%, available in US dollars. 
The Barclays Bank’s overdraft facility is reviewed at the bank’s discretion with no expiry date. The Wells Fargo Bank’s overdraft 
facility is reviewed on an annual basis and expires in December 2009. The following table summarises the maturity profile 
based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date of the Group's financial liabilities at

Currency risk 
As a result of significant global operations, the Group’s balance sheet can be affected significantly by movements in the 
foreign exchange rates against sterling. This is largely through the translation of balances denominated in a currency other 
than the functional currency of an entity. It is the Group’s policy to manage these risks through the use of currency derivatives 
and spot transactions. The Group has transactional currency exposures in the Europe and Africa region, foreign currency  
bank accounts and inter-company recharges. The Group uses currency derivatives to protect significant US dollar and euro 
currency exposures against changes in exchange rates. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonable possible changes in exchange rates, with all other variables 
held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax at 31 July 2009 based on year end balances and rates.

Norwegian kroner 20% (8) (33) 
Singapore dollar 20% (180) 3 
South African rand 20% (17) (69) 
A movement in exchange rates of -20% would give a positive movement of £310,000 (2008: £840,000) on the US dollar 
currency derivatives and £340,000 (2008: £640,000) on the euro currency derivatives.  
Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables which represent the Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets. The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third 
parties. It is the Group’s policy that customers who wish to trade on credit terms be subject to credit verification procedures.  
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts has 
not been significant. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of provisions for impairment of trade receivables, 
estimated by the Group’s management based on experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. 
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are reputable banks with high credit ratings assigned by 
international credit-rating agencies, although the Board recognises that in the current economic climate these indicators 
cannot be relied upon exclusively.

Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of  
the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed below, cash and cash equivalents attributable to  
equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings disclosed in notes 21, 24 and 25.

Externally imposed capital requirement 
Under the terms of the Group’s banking covenants the Group must meet certain criteria based on gross borrowings to 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and impairment, interest cover and guarantee ratios on turnover, 
operating profit, total assets and total operating cash flows to consolidated gross financing costs. There have been no  
un-waived breaches of the banking covenants in the current or prior years. 
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities 
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument can be exchanged in an arm’s-length transaction between informed 
and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale. 
The book value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities equals the fair value of such items as at 31 July 2009, with the 
exception of obligations under finance leases. The book value of obligations under finance leases is £267,000 (2008: £800,000) 
and the fair value is £291,000 (2008: £896,000).

23 Share options (continued) 
Under the Next Fifteen Executive Share Option Schemes, save as explained hereafter, all options are normally exercisable on 
or after the third anniversary of the date of grant and remain exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the date of the grant,  
to the extent that they have vested. Options will vest in respect of one-third of the shares on each of the third, fourth and fifth 
anniversaries of their date of grant. Options granted to employees in California from 23 October 2001 are exercisable at a rate 
of 20% per year over five years from the date of grant. The vesting of all share options granted after 30 November 1999 is 
conditional on achievement of a performance criterion of the Group’s earnings per share growing over a three-year period 
after the grant by at least 30%. 
3,559,230 share options/performance shares issued by the Company under the Next Fifteen Communications Executive  
Share Option Schemes and Long-Term Incentive Plan are options over unissued shares. The remaining 2,115,319 
options/performance shares/conditional shares will be largely satisfied by either shares held by the Employee Share 
Ownership Plan (951,061) or by shares held by the Company in treasury (1,164,258) (see note 24). 
Under the Next Fifteen Long-Term Incentive Plan, the performance test for share options and performance shares is measured 
over a period of three consecutive financial years of the Group, commencing with the financial year in which the award is 
granted. The performance condition is an earnings per-share target. The growth of adjusted earnings per shares (‘EPS’) of  
the Group must exceed the Retail Prices Index (RPI) by an average of 15% or more per annum over the performance period  
for 100% of the award to vest. If the growth of adjusted EPS is between an average of 5% and 15% EPS growth over RPI per 
annum over the performance period, between 20% and 100% of the award will vest on a straight-line basis. If EPS does not 
grow by an average of 5% or more over RPI per annum over the performance period, none of the award will vest. For all 
grants of options and performance shares after November 2007 there is also a second performance test associated with  
the profit growth of the group company in which the participant is employed. If during the performance period the profit 
before tax of the Company is in line with budget then the award will vest at the level determined by the first performance  
test (the ‘Initial Calculation’). For each 1% that the Company exceeds budget a further 2% of the shares awarded under the 
option or performance share award will vest in addition to the Initial Calculation up to a maximum of 25%. For each 1% that 
the Company’s profit before tax is below budget 2% of the shares awarded under the option or performance share award  
will be deducted from the Initial Calculation up to a maximum of 25% (provided that an award can never be below zero).  
Each participant can therefore receive up to 125% of their initial award. 
On 1 May 2009 Inferno Communications Limited (‘Inferno’), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, merged into Bite 
Communications Limited (‘Bite’), also a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group. Following the merger there was a one-off grant 
of performance shares to two senior members of Inferno who transferred to Bite.  The extent to which the award will vest shall 
be determined by reference to the retention of key clients by Bite for which the participants are the key account directors.  
If the client remains with Bite on 1 May 2010 60% will vest and the final 40% will vest if the client still remains on 1 May 2011. 
24 Investment in own shares 
Employee shares ownership plan (ESOP) 
The purpose of the ESOP is to enable the Company to offer participation in the ownership of its shares to Group employees 
principally as a reward and incentive scheme. Arrangements for the distribution of benefits to employees, which may be the 
ownership of shares in the Company or the granting of options over shares in the Company held by the ESOP, are made at 
the ESOP’s discretion in such manner as the ESOP considers appropriate. Administration costs of the ESOP are accounted for 
in the profit and loss account of the Company as they are incurred. 
At 31 July 2009 the ESOP held 951,061 (2008: 1,515,178) Ordinary Shares in the Company, which represents 1.7% (2008: 2.8%) 
of the Ordinary Share capital. The ESOP reserve of £644,000 (2008: £663,000) represents the cost of these shares held by the 
ESOP in the Company at 31 July 2009. The nominal value of shares held was £23,777 (2008: £37,879), and the market value  
at 31 July 2009 was £456,509 (2008: £622,000). The right to receive dividends on all shares has been waived. 
During the year to 31 July 2009, a number of employees exercised their options. In total 190,000 (2008: 138,419) ESOP options 
were exercised, for proceeds of £63,301 (2008: £63,000), as were 374,117 performance shares. 
Treasury shares 
The Group holds 1,164,258 (2008: 950,000) treasury shares at a cost of £595,000 (2008: £504,500). During the year to 31 July 
2009 the Group purchased 214,258 of its own shares at the market value of £91,000 shown in the treasury shares reserve.  
The nominal value of shares held at 31 July 2009 was £29,106 (2008: £23,750), and the market value was £558,844  
(2008: £390,000). The right to receive dividends on all shares has been waived.  Notes to the accounts continued

27 Acquisitions 
1. On 1 August 2008 the Group recognised control of 463 Communications LLC (‘463 LLC’). 463 LLC is a venture based  
in Palo Alto and Washington, DC, working to position technology companies, organisations and coalitions in global  
policy debates. 
 On 31 January 2006 the Company invested in a 40% stake of 463 LLC for a consideration of $20,000 and has, until  
1 August 2008, treated this as an associate undertaking in the Group accounts under the equity method of accounting. 
The carrying value of the investment at 31 July 2008 was £190,000. 
 On 1 August 2008 the Group had the right to purchase an additional 11% of 463 LLC (taking the holding to 51%) and 
acquire control of the business. Since this date 463 LLC has been accounted for as a subsidiary. 
 From 1 August 2008 (the date of acquisition) to 31 July 2009, 463 LLC contributed $3,799,000 (£2,401,000) to revenue  
and $959,000 (£606,000) profit before interest, tax and amortisation of intangibles. 
 The sale and purchase agreement relating to the acquisition of 463 LLC provides the Group with the opportunity to 
purchase 100% of the business and it is the Group’s intention to do so. 
Details of the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities brought onto the balance sheet as at 1 August 2008 are as follows:

The fair value adjustment relating to intangible assets is due to the recognition of $380,000 (£192,000) in respect of the 463 LLC trade name and $430,000 
(£217,000) in respect of customer relationships, which have been independently valued. The trade name will be amortised over its useful economic life of 20 years, 
and the customer relationships will be amortised over three years. 
2
The inflow of cash and cash equivalents on acquisition is the cash acquired of $387,000 (£195,000). Control of 463 LLC was acquired for nil consideration. 
2. On 1 September 2008 Bite Communications Limited (‘Bite’), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired the business 
and certain assets of AimPR Public Relations AB, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. This business was integrated into 
Bite’s existing Swedish operation.

The fair value adjustment relating to intangible assets is due to the recognition of SEK2,174,000 (£183,000) in respect of customer relationships. The customer 
relationships will be amortised over five years. Total intangibles of SEK2,222,000 (£187,000) have been capitalised including SEK48,000 (£4,000) of legal and 
professional fees. 
2
Initial consideration of SEK990,000 (£84,000) was paid on the date of acquisition. A further SEK574,000 (£48,000) was paid in February 2009 based on revenue of 
retained clients during the first six months. An estimated SEK632,000 (£52,000) of consideration has been deferred and the amount paid will be based on revenue 
of retained clients over the 12 months following completion.  
3. On 27 October 2008, the Group acquired the remaining 12.85% stake in Panther Communications Group Limited 
(‘Panther’), the parent company of Lexis Public Relations Limited (‘Lexis’). The stake was acquired for a total consideration  
of £1,771,000, of which £1,328,000 was satisfied in cash and £443,000 in shares (1,098,591 shares), taking the Group’s  
total stake to 100%. Based on the acquisition balance sheet, additional goodwill of £1,507,000 has been capitalised. 
 On 27 October 2008, the Group paid £1,145,000 relating to the deferred consideration for the purchase on 4 April 2008  
of a 10.55% stake in Panther. 
4. On 3 November 2008, the Group paid US$3,023,000 (£1,843,000) relating to the deferred consideration for the purchase  
of OutCast Communications Corporation (‘OutCast’). OutCast is a wholly owned subsidiary acquired in June 2005.

29 Related-party transactions 
The ultimate controlling party of the Group is Next Fifteen Communications Group plc (incorporated in England and Wales).  
The Company has a related-party relationship with its subsidiaries (note 28) and with Directors and executive officers.

During 2009 there were no other related-party transactions. 
30 Events after the balance sheet date 
M Booth & Associates Inc 
On 3 August 2009, the Group acquired New York based M Booth & Associates Inc (‘M Booth’), a leading PR consultancy in 
North America. The initial consideration paid in cash on completion was $4,000,000 (£2,413,000). Deferred consideration of up 
to a maximum of $13,250,000 (£7,992,000) may be payable over the course of the next four years subject to the achievement 
of certain revenue and profit performance targets. The total maximum consideration is therefore $17,250,000 (£10,405,000). 
The first $11,250,000 (£6,786,000) of deferred consideration that may be payable may be satisfied by cash or up to 25% in 
shares, at the option of the Group. The final $2,000,000 (£1,206,000) that may be payable may be satisfied 100% in shares,  
at the option of the Group. 
For the year ended 31 December 2008, M Booth had consolidated revenues of $10,400,000 (£6,273,000) and profit before tax 
of $1,000,000 (£603,000). The consolidated gross assets at 31 December 2008 were $4,300,000 (£2,594,000). The business  
will be acquired with $1,500,000 (£905,000) of net working capital. The above numbers have been extracted from the 
management accounts of M Booth and are therefore unaudited. 
Acquisition costs of $154,000 (£97,000) were paid in relation to the purchase of M Booth, and recognised within the 
consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 July 2009. 
Upstream Marketing and Communications Inc 
On 27 October 2009, the Group acquired the marketing communications trading subsidiaries of Upstream Marketing  
and Communications Inc (‘Upstream Asia’), which will be integrated into the Bite Communications Group. The initial 
consideration was US$900,000 (£551,000) paid in cash and the assumption of US$200,000 (£122,000) of Upstream Asia’s 
liabilities, making a total of US$1,100,000 (£673,000). The Group owns 55% of Upstream Asia, and a Hong Kong based 
company Asset Pioneer Limited (‘Asset Pioneer’) owns the residual 45%. The Group has entered into an option deed  
under which it has a right to acquire Asset Pioneer’s shares over a five-year period based on the profitability of the  
acquired businesses.  
Acquisition costs of US$103,000 (£63,000) were paid in relation to the acquisition of Upstream Asia, and recognised within  
the consolidated income statement in October 2009. 
463 Communications LLC 
On 31 October 2009, the Group acquired a further 30% stake in 463 Communications LLC (‘463 LLC’), taking the Group’s total 
stake to 70%. The stake was acquired for a total consideration of $2,139,000 (£1,298,000), of which $1,426,000 (£865,000)  
was satisfied in cash and $713,000 (£433,000) in shares (805,095 shares). The fair value of the shares was determined by 
reference to the average of the mid-market price of the Company’s shares for the ten trading day period ended four days  
prior to issuance.  
No external acquisition costs were paid in relation to the increased interest in 463 LLC.   
Information required in order to calculate and recognise goodwill and acquired intangibles in relation to M Booth, Upstream 
Asia and 463 LLC is not yet available, and will be shown in the Interim Report for the six months ending 31 January 2010.

1 Accounting policies  
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and are in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards in the United Kingdom. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has  
not presented its own profit and loss account.  
Merger reserve  
In accordance with the provisions of merger relief under section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 (section 612 of the 
Companies Act 2006 after 1 October 2009), where the Company issues shares as part of an acquisition the Company records 
the cost of the investment at the nominal value of the shares issued and records the excess of fair value over nominal value  
as a merger reserve.  
Tangible fixed assets  
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at annual rates 
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows:  
Office equipment  – 20%-50% per annum straight-line.  
Computer software  – 14%-20% per annum straight-line.  
Payments on account in respect of tangible fixed assets which are not yet operational in the business are recorded in a 
separate fixed asset category called ‘Assets in the course of construction’, and represent the cost of purchasing, constructing 
and installing tangible fixed assets ahead of their productive use. Only the incremental costs which are directly attributable to 
the asset in the course of construction are capitalised.  
No depreciation is charged on assets in the course of construction until they are brought into operational use in the business, 
at which point the assets are transferred into the relevant asset category on the fixed asset register and depreciated over  
their useful economic life. Upon review management determined that the expected useful life the new IT system should  
be increased from five to seven years. 
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  
Foreign currencies  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are expressed in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling  
at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency transactions are expressed in sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the dates 
of the transactions. Exchange gains and losses and translation differences are taken directly to the profit and loss account.  
Financial instruments  
Derivative financial instruments utilised by the Company are interest rate cap-and-collar contracts and forward foreign 
exchange contracts. The Company does not enter into speculative derivative contracts. All such instruments are used  
to alter the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the Company in line with the Group’s risk management policies. 
Premiums payable under foreign exchange contracts are expensed over the life of the contract and any gains and losses 
arising on these contracts are deferred and are recognised in the profit and loss account only when the protected  
transaction has itself been reflected in the Company’s financial statements.  
Leasing transactions  
Assets held under finance leases are included in the balance sheet. The amount capitalised is the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. Depreciation on the relevant assets is charged to the profit and loss account over the shorter of  
the estimated useful economic life and the period of the lease. The interest element on these obligations is charged to the 
profit and loss account so as to approximate a constant interest rate over the life of each agreement. Operating lease rentals 
are charged to the profit and loss account in equal amounts over the lease term.  
Pension costs  
Pension costs, which relate to payments made by the Company to employees’ own defined contribution pension plans,  
are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.  
Investments  
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.

1 Accounting policies (continued) 
Deferred taxation  
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax,  
or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise, based on current tax rates and law. 
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different 
from those in which they are included in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising 
from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries 
where there is no commitment to remit these earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as 
more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.  
Share-based employee remuneration  
There are share options granted prior to 7 November 2002 which remain outstanding at 31 July 2009. Details of all grants are 
disclosed in note 23 of the consolidated financial statements.  
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model on the grounds that there are no market-related vesting  
conditions. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the Board’s best estimate, for the effects of  
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. Details of the risk-free rate and dividend yield used  
to underpin these assumptions are included in note 22 of the consolidated financial statements. The market price on any 
given day is obtained from external publicly available sources.  
Employee share ownership plan  
The cost of the Company’s shares held by the ESOP is deducted from shareholders’ funds in the Company and Company 
balance sheet. Any gain or loss made by the ESOP on disposal of the shares it holds is also recognised directly in shareholders’ 
funds. Other assets and liabilities of the ESOP (including borrowings) are recognised as assets and liabilities of the Company.  
Finance costs  
Finance costs are charged to profit over the term of the debt so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying 
amount. Finance costs include issue costs which are initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated 
capital instrument.  
Dividends  
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.  
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting as required by  
FRS 21 Events After the Balance Sheet Date.  
Dividends receivable from investments are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which they are paid.  
Treasury shares  
When the Company re-acquires its own equity instruments, those instruments (treasury shares) are deducted from equity.  
No gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s 
treasury shares. Such treasury shares may be acquired and held by other members of the Group. Consideration paid or 
received is recognised directly in equity. 
Cash flow statement  
The Company has applied the exemption allowed under FRS 1 and has not presented a cash flow statement. The cash flow 
statement has been presented in the Group financial statements.  
2 Profit and loss account of the parent company  
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the parent company is not presented 
as part of these accounts. The parent company’s loss after tax for the financial year was £313,000 (2008: profit of £3,429,000).    Notes forming part of the Company financial statements continued

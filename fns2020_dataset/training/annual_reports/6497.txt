Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
Genel Energy plc is an Anglo-T urkish exploration 
and production company with world-class oil and  
gas resources. 
Formed by the merger of Vallares PLC and  
Genel Energy International Limited, we are the 
largest independent oil producer in the Kurdistan 
Region of Iraq and the first T urkish business to list  
on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. 
We own a portfolio of high-quality assets with robust 
growth options over the short, medium and long-term. 
An excellent capital base and a high-calibre Board and 
management team underpin these assets. 
With these strengths, Genel Energy is building a 
leading regional E&P business from our operational 
bases: in Ankara, T urkey; in Taq Taq, Erbil and 
Suleimaniah in the Kurdistan Region; and in London.

What sets  
us apart
World-class assets
Genel Energy’s assets are located in one of the last great frontiers of global energy – the Kurdistan Region 
of Iraq. Our oil producing ﬁelds of T aq T aq (in which we hold a 44% interest) and T awke (25% interest) 
have currently-estimated gross proven and probable (2P) reserves of 1.2 billion barrels of oil (bbls) and 
proven, probable and possible (3P) reserves of 1.9 bbls.
In 2011, our net production reached an average of more than 42,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) and we 
have extensive ﬁeld development plans to materially increase this over the next two years. Our exploration 
portfolio is equally exciting; over the next 18 months we plan to conduct the biggest and most widespread 
exploration programme in the Kurdistan Region, targeting a net 729 million barrels of oil equivalent 
(mmboe) total estimated mean unrisked resources across the six licences. We have signiﬁcant resource 
upside with our licences spanning the entire Kurdistan Region, a hydrocarbon province with a track record 
of over 70% exploration success.
T urkish energy champion
As the leading independent Turkish E&P company, Genel Energy is an ambassador for the Turkish energy 
sector . We are also the ﬁrst Turkish business to list on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.  
Our Turkish heritage and support places us in a compelling position. We believe it will help us to access 
new opportunities in strategically selected regions.
Balance sheet strength
Genel Energy has signiﬁcant ﬁnancial resources. With cash of $1.9 billion, our ﬁnancial strength is matched 
by few other independent E&P companies of a similar size. Going forward, we will manage our existing 
assets in the Kurdistan Region on a cash-ﬂow neutral basis, preserving our cash balance for the pursuit  
of other strategic opportunities.
Calibre of team
Genel Energy’s Board has considerable experience in oil and gas and corporate life. It is committed to the 
highest standards of corporate governance. 
With nearly a decade’s experience in the Kurdistan Region – longer than any other E&P company – our 
operations team has a proven track record of delivery and an in-depth knowledge of conducting business 
on the ground, along with strong relationships with local and Turkish authorities.  World class

Genel Energy began operating in the Kurdistan Region in 2002 and has been 
instrumental in developing the local energy industry . We were one of the first 
energy companies to engage with the Kurdistan Region after the Iraq war and, 
through our licence at T aq T aq, the first company to execute a Production 
Sharing Contract (PSC) with what became the Kurdistan Regional Government 
(KRG). Genel Energy has since secured interests in five additional PSCs and 
established a high-quality production and exploration portfolio, while 
maintaining a positive working relationship with the KRG.

Our interests have grown in parallel with

Our asset base, one of the most prospective 
of the 40 E&P companies in the Kurdistan 
Region, has significant growth options 
across the short, medium and long-term. 
We believe we have both the people and 
the operating capability to realise the value 
of our portfolio to the benefit of our 
shareholders and the Kurdistan Region.
The T aq T aq and T awke fields produced 
over 140,000 bopd gross at the end of 2011, 
making them the highest producing fields 
in the Kurdistan Region. This production is 
projected to grow to over 200,000 bopd by 
2013. Our exploration portfolio covers  
a diverse geography with different 
hydrocarbon systems and, with a historic 
exploration success rates of over 70% in  
the Kurdistan Region, we are optimistic  
of the material growth potential of future 
exploration success.

I am very pleased

Chairman’s  
statement
Rodney Chase, Chairman 13
Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
Your Board
As you look at the proﬁles of the members 
of the Board, I hope that you will agree 
that we have brought together a group  
of individuals of outstanding quality.  
It includes people with considerable 
experience in oil and gas and corporate life 
– both globally and in the City of London. 
In addition, we have individuals who have  
a proven track record of engagement with 
key stakeholders in Turkey and Kurdistan. 
This is important as our Turkish roots and 
regional relationships form an important 
part of our competitive advantage. 
The Board is acutely aware of the  
trust that our shareholders have placed  
in us. We have at our disposal cash  
of $1.9 billion, and are in a position to  
execute signiﬁcant acquisitions. If we  
do not see good opportunities to make  
suitable acquisitions, we will return  
capital to shareholders in the most 
appropriate and value accretive way.
I intend that we will comply fully with  
the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The Board has 
established several Committees:  
Audit, Nominations, Remuneration and 
Health, Safety, Security and Environment. 
Importantly, all Committees are comprised 
only of Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. I am committed to protecting 
the interests of all shareholders through 
compliance with all aspects of corporate 
best practice. More details of our approach 
are outlined in the Corporate Governance 
section of this report, on pages 52-63. 
My fellow Directors and I are also ﬁrmly  
of the belief that we must conduct our 
business in a way that allows us to  
work together with our key stakeholders, 
especially the local communities in which 
we work.
I have worked for over 40 years in the  
oil and gas business, and this Company’s 
prospects truly excite me. I hope that, after 
you examine this report, you will agree  
that we have in place the foundations of  
a Company that can offer our shareholders  
an opportunity where the rewards could  
be signiﬁcant. Our competitive advantages 
include a highly prospective set of  
world class assets and a team capable  
of maximising their inherent value. We  
have deep links with both Turkey and the 
Kurdistan Region, and a robust balance 
sheet available for strategic opportunities 
and asset consolidation. We will also aim to 
create value with the drill bit, building on an 
existing estimated total net reserves and 
unrisked resource base of 1.6 billion barrels 
of oil equivalent.
I realise that working in the Kurdistan 
Region, where our current resources are, 
will bring challenges. These challenges, 
however , created the environment that 
enabled Genel Energy to secure its 
excellent resource portfolio, which in  
more mature environments would not be 
available to an independent E&P company. 
The Board and our management team  
will work hard to manage these aspects  
of our business while retaining the 
entrepreneurial culture that has brought  
us to this exciting point.
From the beginning, we determined that the 
journey we are on to secure value for our 
shareholders must be one that is guided in 
accordance with the highest standards of 
UK-listed companies. My role, as well as  
that of my fellow Directors, is to ensure that, 
while executing our strategy, we manage  
our business to these high standards of 
corporate governance and with a thorough 
understanding and management of the risks 
in our chosen areas of operation. 
The executive team
We are fortunate to have a very strong 
executive team and, in T ony Hayward, we 
have a leader of exceptional experience  
in the resources sector . His team have 
considerable experience in the Kurdistan 
Region and are intent on extracting  
the maximum value from our assets. 
Importantly, in Mehmet Sepil, we have a 
President who is highly respected in both 
Turkey and the Kurdistan Region, with a 
track record of forming strong, valuable 
networks across their Governments  
and institutions.
In addition to our presence in Turkey and  
in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, we have  
now established a strong corporate team 
in London.
Enhancing value
Genel Energy’s value will be secured  
and enhanced by the appropriate 
management of risks combined with  
the success of our drill bit. All new 
opportunities, as well as our ongoing 
activities to further develop our assets  
in the Kurdistan Region, will be assessed 
against these criteria. 
I am conﬁdent that, with a sustained and 
rigorous focus on our strategy, combined 
with the robust corporate governance 
structure we have in place, our journey  
to build a major E&P company will be an 
exciting one for our employees, shareholders 
and the communities in which we work.

Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
A joint statement 
from the Chief 
Executive Officer  
& President
Genel Energy is the largest independent 
UK-listed E&P company by proved and 
probable (2P) reserves, with an estimated 
total working interest reserves and unrisked 
resource base of some 1.6 billion barrels of 
oil equivalent (bboe), including 2P reserves 
of 412 million barrels of oil (mmbbls). 
A decade in the region
We have deep roots in Kurdistan. Our 
Turkish management made Genel Energy 
the ﬁrst company to execute a PSC with 
the Interim Joint Regional Administration 
of Northern Iraq in 2002, when we 
acquired our interest in the Taq Taq ﬁeld, 
and we have been working in Kurdistan 
ever since. Over the last decade, Genel 
Energy has been a core contributor to  
the development of the Kurdistan energy 
industry, which did not exist prior to our 
involvement. Our management team has a 
deep understanding of the Kurdistan region 
and unrivalled regional relationships as 
well as extensive oil and gas experience 
and industry knowledge.
We have contributed to the region through  
a number of initiatives, including medical 
and educational programmes, and we are 
committed to building on our history of 
operating responsibly in Kurdistan. Details  
of our commitment to a sustainable way 
of working and our activities supporting 
these commitments are outlined in the 
Corporate Responsibility section of this 
report on pages 38-41.
Building an operating base in Ankara, Turkey 
over the last decade, Genel Energy has 
evolved to become an ambassador for 
Turkish business.  
We have directly contributed to the 
economic development and wellbeing  
of the Kurdistan Region, to the mutual 
beneﬁt of Turkey, Kurdistan and our 
Company. We are also the ﬁrst Turkish 
business to list on the Main Market of  
the London Stock Exchange, a proud 
moment for all involved.
The creation of Genel Energy plc
Vallares PLC was listed on the London Stock 
Exchange in June 2011 with the purpose of 
acquiring an emerging market E&P company 
with a portfolio of producing, development 
and exploration assets, that required  
both capital and capability to take the 
business to the next stage. The Initial Public  
Offering raised over $2.0 billion (£1.3 billion).  
Vallares and Genel Energy International 
came together in November 2011 to form  
Genel Energy plc. 
Since the June IPO, we have achieved  
a number of key operational milestones:
 Assembled an asset portfolio of  
world-class ﬁelds and prospects, 
comprising an estimated net resource 
base of some 1.6 billion barrels of  
oil equivalent;
 Established a top-class, highly experienced 
independent board, heading a small 
international management team based in 
London. This complements an operating 
headquarters in Ankara with 80 technical 
specialist and administration staff, and 
some 450 employees of TTOPCO on the 
ground in Kurdistan;
 Recorded a signiﬁcant reserve  
upgrade of 78% to 509 mmbbls  
gross in the proven and probable 
reserves of our Tawke ﬁeld and an 
associated commitment to increase 
production capacity to 100,000  
bopd in 2012; 
 Planned to increase production from  
the T aq T aq ﬁeld to 200,000 bopd by 2014, 
enabled by the planned construction of 
the new Kurdistan Iraq Crude Export 
(KICE) pipeline from the ﬁeld to the main 
Kirkuk-Ceyhan export line;
 Announced in January 2012 our 
intention to increase our interest in  
the Chia Surkh exploration licence from 
20% to 80% and become the licence 
operator (subject to approval by the 
Kurdish Regional Government which 
remains pending); 
 Committed to a major exploration 
programme of seven high-impact wells 
during 2012 and early 2013, the largest 
and most comprehensive programme  
in the Kurdistan Region; and
 Begun the process to seek a premium 
listing on the main market in London 
and we are engaged in a constructive 
dialogue with the UK Listing Authority. 
Our objective remains to achieve a 
premium listing in 2012.
Our strategy
We have a clear strategy that we are  
focused on delivering in order to achieve 
long-term value for our shareholders:
 Maintain the highest level of  
corporate governance;
 Continue to fund our existing Kurdistan 
Region assets’ development and 
exploration from operating cashﬂows;
 Create value with the drill bit; and
 Build a major regional E&P company over 
the next 3 to 5 years through development 
of our assets in the Kurdistan Region, 
acquisition in the Middle East and  
Africa, and participation in future  
licencing rounds.
Further details of our strategy are  
set out on page 22.
Realising the potential from  
our existing producing assets
We have interests in the two largest 
producing ﬁelds in Kurdistan, Taq Taq 
(Genel Energy 44%) and Tawke (Genel 
Energy 25%), with access to local and 
international markets. In these ﬁelds,  
the combined gross proven, probable  
and possible (3P) reserves are 1.9bn  
boe (677 mmbbls net to Genel Energy).  
Over the last few years there has been 
strong reserve growth in both ﬁelds as 
they underwent simultaneous appraisal 
and development.
The 2012 appraisal drilling programme  
has the potential to further grow reserves 
at both ﬁelds as we target areas where  
we have few or no well penetrations. 
Production on Taq Taq commenced in 2008 
and has grown to an average daily 
production of over 66,000 bopd gross in 
2011. Over the next 24 months, we intend to 
continue the appraisal and development 
programme at Taq Taq in order to increase  17
Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
Unrisked Net Reserves  
and Resources
1.6bn boe
Cash
$1.9bn
production to some 200,000 bopd by 2014. 
This growth is subject to the development 
of supporting infrastructure and the 
construction of the Kurdistan Iraq Crude 
Export (KICE) pipeline. Until this pipeline  
is complete, production from Taq Taq is 
limited by trucking capacity to 90,000 – 
100,000 bopd which is less than the current 
production capacity of 120,000 bopd.
The KICE pipeline is proposed to run from 
the ﬁeld to the main Kirkuk-Ceyhan export 
line. When completed, it is expected that it 
will allow us to increase T aq T aq production 
to circa 200,000 bopd and to cut transport 
costs from circa $3 to $1 per barrel. We are in 
advanced discussions with the Kurdish 
Regional Government in relation to the 
speciﬁc details of the project (including 
timing, ﬁnancing and cost recovery) and 
expect to conclude these discussions shortly. 
At Tawke, average daily production 
exceeded 59,000 bopd gross in December 
2011. We expect to increase production 
capacity from 75,000 to 100,000 bopd 
this year and have studies underway to

Our Resource Base today
Genel Energy’s estimated net resource base is 1.6 bn boe. Proven and probable net reserves in  
our two producing fields (T aq T aq and T awke) are 412 mmbbls with further possible net reserves  
of 266 mmbbls, contingent net resources are 175 mmboe and unrisked prospective net resources  
are 729 mmboe.
support production volumes of 150,000  
to 200,000 bopd by 2014.
Genel Energy’s revenue from its production 
in the Kurdistan Region is earned from a 
mixture of domestic and export sales. There 
is a deep and proven domestic market for  
oil within the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, with 
purchasers collecting directly from the ﬁeld 
by truck. There is also an established export 
route via the main Iraq oil export pipeline to 
the Ceyhan port terminal in Turkey although 
exports are currently limited by continuing 
issues surrounding export payments.
Since resuming local sales in the third 
quarter of 2011, circa 50% of gross Taq 
Taq production has been sold into the 
domestic market to local reﬁneries.  
At Tawke, local sales were ramped up  
in October 2011 and since the fourth 
quarter of 2011 circa 50% of gross  
Tawke production has been sold locally. 
Operating cash ﬂows generated from  
our current sales are sufﬁcient for Genel 
Energy to fund our existing Kurdistan 
development and exploration programme. 18

Developing Genel Energy’s low-risk, 
high impact exploration portfolio
Our existing Kurdistan exploration portfolio 
across our six PSC licences offers a good 
distribution of risk by running through 
diverse geographies with different 
hydrocarbon systems, from Peshkabir in  
the north to Chia Surkh in the south. During 
2012 and early 2013, we plan to carry out the 
largest and most widespread exploration 
programme being conducted by any  
one company in the Kurdistan Region. 
We plan to drill seven high impact 
exploration wells, targeting some  
700 mmboe of unrisked mean resources, 
net to Genel Energy, in a hydrocarbon 
province where the exploration success 
rate is historically 70%. 
Three of the seven exploration wells  
have already spudded. Ber Bahr-1, in  
the Ber Bahr licence area, is targeting 
unrisked resources estimated at circa 500 
mmboe, with results expected at the end 
of the second quarter. The Peshkabir-1  
well is targeting approximately circa  
300 mmboe of unrisked resources in a 
large anticline adjacent to the Tawke ﬁeld. 
Moveable oil has already been detected 
and the well is expected to complete in  
the third quarter of 2012. Miran East-1 is 
targeting the eastern structure of the 
Miran ﬁeld which is contiguous with  
the hydrocarbon bearing Miran West 
structure. Results are expected in  
the second half of 2012.
Outlook and opportunities
T o maximise the value of our business, Genel 
Energy will focus on the following priorities:
 Increasing our production and reserves 
in our existing Kurdistan business 
through the appraisal and development 
of our existing producing ﬁelds and 
through exploration as we embark on 
the most active exploration programme 
in the Kurdistan Region.
The oil and gas sector has been key to  
the Kurdistan Region’s economic growth. 
The US Geological Society has estimated 
that the Kurdistan region has some  
40 billion boe and some 60T cf of gas.  
The oil industry has enjoyed signiﬁcant 
success with cumulative gross discoveries 
of more than 5 bn bbls, with production 
growing from 2,000 bbls/d in 2006  
to some 250,000 bopd currently. The  
region is developing rapidly, with over  
40 oil companies awarded PSCs,  
including ExxonMobil. 
The revenue on our production in the 
Kurdistan Region is obtained from a 
mixture of domestic and export sales.
Domestic market
There is a deep and proven domestic 
market for oil within the Kurdistan Region 
of Iraq, with purchasers collecting directly 
from the ﬁeld by truck. Pricing per barrel 
is structured around a tender process 
conducted by the KRG and payment is 
made directly to the producers one month 
in advance. Sales are made to both 
government reﬁneries and private 
companies. T otal capacity in the domestic 
market is estimated at around 160,000 bopd 
and is expected to rise to approximately 
250,000 bopd over the next few years.  
T aq T aq and T awke currently account for 
over 75% of crude oil sales by independent 
producers and Genel Energy enjoys strong 
longstanding relationships with local buyers.
Export market
There is an established export route for oil 
produced in the Kurdistan Region via the 
main Iraq oil export pipeline to the Ceyhan 
port terminal in T urkey . The pipeline operates 
at approximately 65% of its 1.6 mmboed total 
capacity . Currently, any oil exported from T aq 
T aq is trucked to the Khurmala delivery point 
to enter the pipeline. Our T awke ﬁeld already 
has a tie-in to the pipeline.
The State Oil Marketing Organisation 
(SOMO) in Iraq is responsible for selling  
the export crude, with payments made  
to the Iraqi central Government. The 
Kurdistan Region’s share is then paid by 
the Iraqi Central Government to the KRG, 
which in turn pays the oil contractors, 
including Genel Energy. Exports are limited 
by continuing issues surrounding both  
export payments and the evolving  
political landscape.
We aim to increase the share that export 
sales make up of our revenue mix in order 
to realise international oil prices, however 
this will be subject to increasing the export 
capacity from T aq T aq with the 
construction of the KICE pipeline, and the 
resolution of issues surrounding oil 
revenue sharing between the Central 
Government of Iraq and the KRG.

With the combination of our asset portfolio, 
long-standing relationships and our ﬁnancial 
strength, we are in a strong position to 
further develop our existing assets in the 
Kurdistan Region, acquire additional 
opportunities in the Middle East and Africa 
region and to participate in future licensing 
rounds. As the region develops politically,  
we are one of the best-placed resource 
companies to beneﬁt from any de-risking of 
the geopolitical landscape and a consequent 
realisation of sustained oil export prices.
Turkey is a growing inﬂuence in the region 
both politically and economically. Turkey and 
the Kurdistan Region are developing close 
economic ties. In 2011, of the approximate  
$8 billion invested in Iraq, $6 billion of this 
was invested in the Kurdistan Region. The 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq has the potential to 
play a signiﬁcant role in expanding Turkey’s 
energy supply base, the majority of which is 
currently sourced from Iran, Iraq, Russia and 
Azerbaijan. It is in the interests of Turkey,  
the Kurdistan Region and Iraq to develop  
the oil and gas supply route into Turkey.  
This evolving geopolitical situation will likely 
beneﬁt Genel Energy, as Turkey’s leading 
independent energy company.
We are reviewing a range of exciting 
opportunities that ﬁt within our strategy to 
expand our position beyond the Kurdistan 
Region in the Middle East and into Africa.  
We are planning to make one or more 
acquisitions and to participate in new 
licensing rounds in the region. In pursuing 
acquisitions we have four key objectives: to 
diversify our geographical foot print within 
the Middle East and Africa; to extend the life 
of our exploration portfolio; to acquire assets 
that do not dilute the world class quality or 
ﬁnancial returns of our existing portfolio; 
and to acquire new expertise and  
operating capabilities.
Our strong cash resources of $1.9 billion, 
provides a material competitive advantage  
in contrast to most other independent E&P 
companies, many of which struggle to fully 
develop their resources portfolio due to 
capital constraints. This is likely to provide  
a range of value-accretive opportunities for 
Genel Energy. 
We look forward to our shareholders  
and stakeholders joining us on our  
exciting journey.

Regardless of political differences, the 
economies of Iraq and the Kurdistan Region 
are highly dependent on the production and 
export of oil and gas. The oil sector currently 
provides Iraq with about 80% of its foreign 
exchange earnings and some 90% of 
government revenue – accordingly a 
productive oil sector in both the Kurdistan 
Region and across Iraq is core to Iraq’s 
future success. 
Despite a ﬂuid political environment the KRG 
has successfully enabled the development of 
a vibrant oil and gas sector . Genel Energy 
was one of the ﬁrst international oil and 
gas companies to enter the Kurdistan 
Region, signing the ﬁrst PSC at T aq T aq in 
2002. Following the ratiﬁcation of the Iraq 
constitution in 2006, the KRG passed the 
Kurdistan Oil and Gas Law in 2007 which 
increased the number of new companies 
entering the region. Initially, the sectors 
development was spearheaded by venture 
capital investors who were followed by 
mid-cap energy companies, with over 40 
licences awarded to some 40 international 
oil companies to date. There is a growing 
conﬁdence in the region and the quality  
of its assets. Most recently, ExxonMobil 
signed six PSCs with the KRG in late 2011.
Kurdistan is a stable and secure operating 
environment with a vibrant and rapidly 
growing economy. Since 1991, the 
Kurdistan Region has operated as an 
autonomous region of Iraq. Its status as  
a semi-autonomous region was formally 
enshrined in the Iraq constitution of 2006 
and it now functions with its own national 
ﬂag, army and border control. 
The KRG has shown a willingness to 
embrace the private sector . Evidence of 
the KRG’s success here is in the rise in  
per capita GDP – from US$800 in 2003  
to some US$4,500 in 2010. Turkey has

Our strategy for growth
Genel Energy has a four-pronged strategy to 
achieve long-term value for our shareholders.
Maintain the highest level of corporate governance
We believe that it is essential to demonstrate adherence to  
the highest standards of corporate governance. This approach, and 
our commitment to operating responsibly, will assist in maintaining 
the trust of our shareholders and key stakeholders, as well as 
providing a strong overarching structure for key decision making 
within the business.
Our Board’s Independent Non-Executive Directors – Rodney Chase, 
Jim Leng, Sir Graham Hearne, George Rose, Mark Parris and 
Mehmet Ög˘ütçü – have the majority voting rights on the Board.  
Our Board Committees are comprised only of Independent  
Non-Executive Directors.
The Board is continually measuring and monitoring the  
major risks to which its operations in the Kurdistan Region  
of Iraq are exposed. In this, the Board is supported by the  
executive team’s local expertise, industry knowledge and  
strategic relationships.
Further details of our overall approach are contained in  
our Corporate Governance report on pages 52-63.
Maximising the potential from our existing assets in the Kurdistan Region on  
a cash flow-neutral basis
The development and exploration of our assets in the Kurdistan 
Region of Iraq will be funded from proceeds received from local sales 
and export sales. We have appraisal and development plans in place 
to grow both production and reserves on our two producing assets, 
T aq T aq and T awke. We plan to grow gross production to c. 200,000 
bopd on T aq T aq and c. 150,000 to 200,000 on T awke by 2014.  
These plans are supported by a combination of development drilling 
and infrastructure upgrades. Construction of the KICE pipeline  
will require a working capital commitment from Genel Energy, 
however this is expected to be fully reimbursed by the KRG  
following construction.
Operating cash ﬂows generated from our current sales are sufﬁcient 
for us to fund our existing development and exploration program in 
Kurdistan. This is supported by our low capital cost, with ﬁnding and 
development costs on average in the range of $2 – $3 per barrel  
of oil. Regardless of whether or not a positive, long-term solution 
surrounding the issue of Kurdistan oil export payments is achieved, 
we will still be able to develop our existing Kurdistan assets while 
preserving cash to expand our portfolio.
Create value with the drill bit
We are committed to realising the value in our portfolio and we  
have a signiﬁcant drilling programme to explore, appraise and 
develop our assets. 
Across our six PSCs we and our partners have an exciting 
exploration programme that we believe will bring signiﬁcant value 
over the short and medium term. This includes a plan to drill seven 
exploration wells, targeting some 700 mmboe of unrisked mean 
resources net to Genel Energy.
As well as targeting our exploration licences of Ber Bahr , Peshkabir , 
Miran and Chia Surkh, we plan to test the deep prospectivity of both 
T aq T aq and T awke. We are optimistic that this programme will add 
signiﬁcant reserves and resources to our portfolio.
Build a major regional E&P company over the next 3 to 5 years
We will not let our substantial cash resources lie idle. We are 
constantly reviewing opportunities in our chosen areas of future 
expansion, in particular in the Middle East and Africa. 
With our Turkish identity, we believe we have a powerful  
advantage when looking for quality assets and prospects in the 
Middle East and African region. These opportunities will include 
licence rounds, farm-outs and acquisitions of established but 
under-resourced companies.
In pursuing acquisitions we have four key objectives: to diversify our 
geographical footprint; to extend the life of our exploration portfolio, 
to acquire material positions in world class assets; and to acquire 
new expertise and operating capabilities.
We will underpin our expansion by growing our operating capacity 
supported by our balance sheet and established team. 23

Our business model 
delivering value
Genel Energy’s business model is simple, clear 
and effective. We explore, develop and produce 
oil and gas, we focus in areas where we can 
achieve material positions in material assets  
and we add to our resource portfolio through 
mergers and acquisitions.

Explore, develop and produce
Fundamentally we are an oil and gas 
exploration and production company. Our 
business model is to unlock the value of 
oil and gas assets through the life cycle – 
from exploration to prove up reserves, 
investment in facilities and infrastructure 
to bring oil to market, and maximising 
production to generate cashﬂow. 
To extract maximum value from our 
portfolio we continue to grow our 
resources hopper through exploration, 
and we will progressively de-risk our 
assets by converting resources into 
reserves through appraisal. We are also 
continuing to invest in our sub-surface 
capability to support this development. 
High impact exploration  
and appraisal
In the Kurdistan Region, we are rapidly 
assessing our low-risk, high-impact 
exploration portfolio across six PSCs.  
We will similarly fast-track the exploration of 
any new assets to assess our resource base.
Facilities and infrastructure 
development
To support the ramp-up of production,  
we are undertaking signiﬁcant facilities 
and infrastructure development in 
conjunction with our partners. On Taq Taq, 
we are engaged in the second phase of 
construction of the central process facility 
and working towards developing the KICE 
pipeline project.
Production
Genel Energy working interest production 
has increased signiﬁcantly with a 
compound annual growth rate of 83% 
from 2009 to 2011. We aim to increase 
gross production at Taq Taq and Tawke 
together from an average of 117,000 bopd 
in 2011 to over 200,000 bopd in 2013.
See our Operating Review on pages  
26-33 for more details of our current 
resource activities.
Material positions in  
material assets
We see achieving scale as a key  
component of achieving a high-quality 
return on invested capital. We are focused 
on establishing material positions in  
high quality resource assets and it is our 
preference to operate assets where we can.
This objective is encapsulated by our 
activity in the Kurdistan Region, where we 
are the largest producer and the largest 
holder of reserves. We are joint operator  
of the Taq Taq ﬁeld – the largest producing 
ﬁeld in the Kurdistan Region and a world 
class asset with the potential to be a billion 
barrel ﬁeld. At Ber Bahr we hold a majority 
operating interest and we have signed 
agreements to increase our stake and 
become operator at Chia Surkh in the near 
future (subject to receiving approval from 
the KRG which remains pending). These 
interests, together with our interests in 
Tawke, Miran and Dohuk, give us a 
signiﬁcant presence in the region.
 
 
Add resources through M&A
Our priority when assessing whether we 
can access new resources is that the deal 
is value accretive. At the present time, we 
believe the Middle East and Africa present 
the best opportunities for this and would 
also offer geographic diversiﬁcation. Our 
focus is on identifying new assets that  
will add signiﬁcant, sustainable value to 
our business.
We have cash of $1.9 billion available  
to deploy for our strategic expansion,  
which may be by merger, acquisition or 
partnership. We are currently reviewing 
opportunities that ﬁt within our future  
as an international Anglo-Turkish  
E&P company and one of the leading 
independents in the Middle East and 
Africa region. 24
Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report

Our Key Performance 
Indicators
Our initial review has identiﬁed seven KPIs covering both ﬁnancial 
and non-ﬁnancial measures that are both consistent with those 
areas that were given focus by the business before the merger  
and appear to be appropriate going forward.
As well as identifying the most appropriate KPIs, the review 
process allocated accountability for each KPI to speciﬁc owners 
and started to put in place a structure for monitoring and  
reporting on each measure.
We will continue to review our KPIs during 2012 to ensure that 
these seven remain the most appropriate for the business going 
forward and to embed these further within the organisation’s 
internal reporting and monitoring process.
In order to provide comparability to future performance,  
the KPIs reported for the period to 31 December 2011 and 
their comparatives reﬂect management’s best estimate of 
performance of the operational business in the relevant periods.
Following the merger that brought the  
Company to its current form on 21 November 
2011, management carried out a review of the 
KPIs used in the existing business to assess  
which of these were the most appropriate to 
measure performance and deliver our strategy 
going forward.
Net reserves and resources
Our strategy is to enhance the value of our commercial oil  
and gas assets through drilling and to explore for and discover 
additional oil and gas resource.
We assess our resources by measuring 2P reserves and total 
unrisked resources.
2P reserves are the aggregation of Proved Reserves and 
Probable Reserves. 
Unrisked Prospective Resources are those quantities of 
petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially 
recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application  
of future development projects.
At both Taq Taq and Tawke there has been recent reserve  
growth as a result of appraisal and development.
At the end of 2011, our net 2P reserve base increased by 60% 
from 257 mmbbls in 2010 to 412 mmbbls. Total net reserves  
and unrisked resources increased by 45% to 1.6bn boe.

Fatalities and LTI Spills – loss of primary containment (LoPC)
The Board and management are, and always have been, committed 
to safe and reliable operations. Maintaining zero fatalities is of  
the highest importance to the business. A low LTI indicates how 
successful our safety programmes are in preventing injury. LTI 
measures the number of hours lost due to injury per million work 
hours across all of our sites.
Asset integrity is a major priority for our Company and we plan and 
execute the operations of our business and our engagement of 
subcontractors so as to minimise risk and mitigate potential impact.
A key measure of our success in achieving asset integrity is 
minimising the number of incidents where there has been a loss  
of primary containment (LoPC). LoPC records any unplanned or 
uncontrolled release of material (excluding small or non-hazardous 
releases such as water) from a piece of equipment used for 
containment – for example a pipe, vessel or tank.

Production growth is a key measure of  
Genel Energy’s operational performance  
and achievement of its strategy. 
Net production is calculated on a working 
interest basis and is measured in average 
barrels of oil produced daily (bopd).
In 2011 gross average daily production  
at Taq Taq and Tawke increased to  
66,000 bopd and 52,000 bopd respectively.  
Genel Energy’s working interest production 
across both ﬁelds was 42,000 bopd on 
average in 2011.
Successful capital spend in terms of  
both the development of our assets and 
exploration activity is a key component  
of our strategy. Success is measured  
by our reserves and production KPIs,  
and investment of capital in the future  
of the business is shown through  
capital expenditure.
Capital expenditure is measured by  
absolute spend on exploration and 
evaluation assets and to oil and gas 
property, plant and equipment.
We have presented historic capital 
expenditure, but this is not indicative  
of future spend. Our capital spend for  
2012 and future years will be determined  
by our development plans for our assets.

Operating Review: 
Production
In 2011, Genel Energy made good progress in the growth of both 
reserves and production on our two producing fields, T aq T aq  
and T awke. Over the last few years, both fields have undergone 
simultaneous appraisal and development programmes and today 
their combined gross proven, probable and possible reserves  
stand at some 1.9bn boe. In 2011, Genel Energy’s working interest 
production across both fields increased by 147% to 42,000 bopd. 
Both fields have finding and development costs of $2-$3/bbl and 
operating costs of around $1/bbl.
Murat Özgül, Chief Commercial Ofﬁcer
Our partners in the Taq Taq ﬁeld
Genel Energy and Addax currently hold 44% 
and 36% PSC working interests, respectively, 
in the T aq T aq ﬁeld. The KRG holds the 
remaining 20% PSC working interest, 
although, in line with the terms of Genel 
Energy’s other PSCs, the KRG is not liable  
for its PSC working interest share of costs, 
which are paid by Genel Energy and Addax. 
Accordingly, Genel Energy and Addax’s 
paying interests under the T aq T aq PSC are 
55% and 45% respectively. Addax is an 
international oil and gas exploration and 
production company focused on Africa and 
the Middle East, and part of the Sinopec 
Group, one of the largest oil and gas 
producers in China.
Oil production and  
production capacity
At T aq T aq, gross 2P reserves have 
increased, over the last 18 months, from  
483 mmbbls to 647 mmbbls (285 mmbls  
net to Genel Energy) and gross average daily 
production from the ﬁeld has doubled from 
33,000 bopd in 2010 to 66,000 bopd in 2011. 
At the end of 2011, we had 10 producing wells 
and processing capacity of some 120,000 
bopd. In December 2011, we reached 
production of some 84,000 bopd, the 
highest level of production to date.
T aq T aq’s production output is limited  
by trucking capacity. Currently, all oil is 
trucked from the site and we have a trucking

day. This limits production from the ﬁeld to 
between 90,000 and 100,000 bopd.
Planned expansion
Over the next 24 months we will continue 
the appraisal and development programme 
of the ﬁeld with the objective of lifting 
production to around 200,000 bopd by 
2014. The well capacity for this level of 
production is in hand and we are 
undertaking the second phase of 
construction of the central processing 
facility. This is planned to be operational  
in the second half of 2013, adding an 
additional 90,000 bopd processing  
capacity for a total processing capacity  
of over 200,000 bopd by early 2014. 
To enhance our production capacity and 
provide a more efﬁcient route to market,  
we and our operating partner Addax plan  
to construct the KICE pipeline from the Taq 
Taq ﬁeld to tie in to the Kirkuk-Ceyhan 
Pipeline near Fish Khabur . 
Outlook
We are targeting production of between 
120,000 and 150,000 bopd from circa 20 
wells by the end of 2013 and we intend to 
ramp-up production progressively, with a 
target of c.90,000 bopd on average for 2012.
To reach our target production, we intend 
to drill ﬁve development wells in 2012 and  
a further three by the fourth quarter 2013. 
To support production, we are completing 
permanent facilities onsite and a power 
plant to utilise our onsite produced gas.
As well as our planned increase to 
production, we will continue our 
programme of appraisal at Taq Taq.  
The ﬁeld is covered by good quality  
3D seismic data but there are areas to the 
north west and south east where we have 
few or no well penetrations, providing the 
potential for further upside to the estimates 
of oil in place. The current oil in place 
estimated by McDaniel & Associates  
is 1.7 billion bbls.
Our well results and ﬂow rates have given 
us continued conﬁdence in the high quality 
of the reservoir . The recovery factor today 
is estimated at between 35% and 40% but 
this is expected to rise over the next few 
years, as additional reservoir performance 
data is gathered.

Our partners in the Tawke ﬁeld
Genel Energy was assigned a 25% PSC 
working interest in the Tawke ﬁeld by the 
KRG in 2009. The KRG retains a 20% PSC 
working interest, leaving DNO International, 
the operator of the Tawke ﬁeld, with a 55% 
PSC working interest. DNO International is 
an independent E&P company, listed on the 
Oslo Stock Exchange.
Oil production and capacity
In January 2012, Tawke’s gross 2P reserves 
were upgraded from 286 mmbbls to 509 
mmbbls (127 mmbls net to Genel Energy). 
This was an increase of 78% and brought 
the reserves in line with the operator’s 
estimate for the ﬁeld. Gross average daily 
production from the ﬁeld grew from 12,000 
bopd in 2010 to 52,000 bopd during 2011 
and by the end of 2011, Tawke reached 
60,000 bopd. At the end of 2011, we had  
13 producing wells and production capacity 
of 75,000 bopd.
Planned expansion and outlook
In 2012, Genel Energy and DNO International 
are undertaking projects to upgrade the 
processing facilities and the pipeline capacity 
to expand production capacity from 75,000 
bopd to 100,000 bopd. Our intention is to 
drill 3 development wells in 2012 to take 
gross production to approximately 100,000 
bopd by the end of the year , with a target of 
60,000 to 70,000 bopd on average for 2012.
Studies are underway to support plans to 
achieve 2014 target production of 150,000 
– 200,000 bopd with further upgrades to 
our central processing facility. 
As with Taq Taq, the Tawke ﬁeld has been 
appraised as it has been developed and 
there are areas of the ﬁeld where well 
penetrations remain limited. In the case  
of Tawke, the entire northern ﬂank of the 
ﬁeld is un-appraised with the potential  
for gross incremental reserves of around 
150 mmbbls. The Tawke 16 well that 
spudded in December 2011, will be a key  
well in deﬁning this potential upside.

Operating Review: 
Exploration & Appraisal
Genel Energy’s exploration programme has the prospect of adding 
significant resources over the short to medium term. Our current 
drilling plans include seven high impact exploration wells to be 
completed through the remainder of 2012 and the early part of 
2013. This is by far the largest and most widespread exploration 
programme being conducted by anyone in the Kurdistan Region. 
In total, the programme will target net unrisked resources of more 
than 700 mmboe in a hydrocarbon province where exploration 
success has historically been greater than 70%. 
Over the next 18 months, Genel Energy and its partners are working to execute a signiﬁcant, high-impact exploration and appraisal 
programme to ensure a fast-track assessment and exploitation of our portfolio. 
The Group generally uses independent contractors in its oil and gas operations to carry out its drilling activities. While demand for 
contractors can be high, resulting in increased costs or lack of availability, we have not experienced such disruptions to our operations 
and are typically able to engage with drilling contractors when required.

Ber Bahr
The Ber Bahr -1 well spudded in October 2011 
and is testing a large surface anticline and 
major reservoir targets in the Jurassic and 
T riassic. Pre drill unrisked gross resources 
were estimated at 500 mmboe and the well  
is expected to complete around the end  
of the second quarter of 2012. In the event  
of success we would conduct a 3D seismic 
program and drill the ﬁrst appraisal well to 
the northwest of Ber Bahr-1.
Peshkabir-1
The Peshkabir-1 well spudded in December 
2011 and is testing a large anticline directly 
along strike from the Tawke ﬁeld. Major 
reservoir targets are the Cretaceous, 
Jurassic and Triassic. Pre drill unrisked 
gross resources are estimated at  
300 mmboe. An open hole drill stem test  
has demonstrated the presence of moveable 
oil in the Upper Cretaceous and the well is 
now being deepened. We expect to complete 
the well in the third quarter of 2012.
Tawke Deep
The Tawke Deep well which we expect to 
spud in the fourth quarter of 2012, will test 
the Jurassic and Triassic reservoirs that 
have yet to be penetrated in the Tawke 
structure. Gross pre drill unrisked resource 
is estimated at 200 mmboe.
Taq Taq Deep
The Taq Taq Deep well which we expect to 
spud in the fourth quarter of 2012 will test 
the Jurassic and Triassic reservoirs in  
the Taq Taq structure. A well drilled in  
the mid-1970s on T aq T aq tested gas from  
the Jurassic/Triassic interval. The pre  
drill unrisked gross resource estimate  
is 250 mmboe.
Kirwa Chirmila
The Kirwa Chirmila well is expected to spud 
in the third quarter of 2012 and will test a 
shallow Tertiary Pilaspi Formation prospect 
immediately to the south west of Taq Taq. It 
will complete our work program obligations 
on the Taq Taq and Kirwa Chermila licence.
Chia Surkh
At Chia Surkh, we are in the process of 
increasing our interest to 80% and 
assuming the operatorship. Completion  
of the transaction is conditional on the 
receipt of various consents, approvals and 
assurances, including the approval of the 
KRG Oil and Gas Council. The application 
for approval remains pending and all parties 
continue to work with the government to 
secure ﬁnal approval for the transaction. 
We will commence a 2D seismic survey  
in the second quarter with the ﬁrst well 
planned to spud in the third quarter of 2012. 
The principal reservoirs are in the Tertiary 
section. The structure was originally drilled 
before the 1950s and tested oil at rates up 
to 4000 bopd. The pre drill un-risked gross 
resource estimate is 300 mmboe.

Miran
The Miran discovery, in which Genel Energy 
has a 25% working interest, is estimated  
by the operator to contain more than 4tcf 
of gas and 175 mmboe of contingent  
and risked prospective resource in the 
Cretaceous and Jurassic and Triassic 
reservoirs. The Miran West-3 appraisal well 
which spudded in August 2011 was designed 
to appraise the Miran West structure. The 
primary objective of the well remains to 
test the productivity of the Jurassic. Testing 
to date has conﬁrmed that the Upper 
Cretaceous is oil bearing and the Lower 
Cretaceous is gas bearing. Further drilling 
will appraise the Jurassic reservoir intervals 
as planned and this, together with the 
recently completed 3D seismic survey will 
provide a better estimate of the potential 
recoverable gas reserves and assist in 
development planning. The Miran East-1 
exploration well which is being drilled on a 
separate structure to the existing discovery 
spudded in March 2012. It is likely that we 
will see a phased development of Miran, 
with early gas into the domestic Kurdistan 
Region market followed in the future by 
exports to Turkey. 
Dohuk
The Dohuk well completed at the end  
of 2011 and made a modest discovery.  
The well encountered a gas column in  
the Cretaceous that ﬂowed at rates of  
11 mmscfd from a restricted zone. A heavy 
oil column was also encountered in the 
Jurassic that ﬂowed at non stable rates  
up to 450 bopd. The plan is to complete  
a 3D seismic survey in 2012, conduct 
subsurface studies and look at options  
for an early gas development into the 
domestic market. There are two plants 
currently burning fuel oil in the local area 
that could potentially use Dohuk gas.

Operating costs
Cost of sales of $21.4 million includes 
depletion and depreciation charges of $18.3 
million and production costs of $3.1 million, 
both of which include costs for both export 
and domestic sales volumes shipped. The 
depreciation charge includes the cost  
of amortising the values attributable to  
2P reserves following the application of 
acquisition accounting. 
Administration expenses were $65.1 million 
for the period and included $53.3 million for 
various advisors’ services associated with 
the acquisition of GEIL, $3.0 million of IPO 
transaction costs and share based payment 
charges of $3.1 million. 
Finance income
Finance income of $4.8 million represents 
interest income received on cash balances.
Taxation
All corporation taxation due is paid on 
behalf of the Company by the KRG from its 
share of revenue. No taxation expense has 
been presented because the quantum of 
taxation paid on our behalf by the KRG is 
not known. When it becomes possible to 
measure the amount of taxation paid,  
we will present a taxation expense in the 
income statement with a corresponding 
grossing up of revenue.
of 912 pence per share (the market value of 
shares on 21 November 2011). The Company 
also settled GEIL ’s outstanding debt.  
On completion of the Acquisition, the 
functional currency of the Company was 
changed from Sterling to US dollars.
Result for the period
The Company was incorporated on 1 April 
2011 and acquired its ﬁrst trading business 
on 21 November 2011. The reported results 
and ﬁnancial statements therefore reﬂect 
the trading of GEIL from 21 November 2011 
but include corporate and other costs from 
1 April 2011. As a result, the Group recorded 
a loss for the period ending 31 December 
2011, primarily as a result of costs 
associated with the acquisition of GEIL 
together with costs associated with  
listing the Company on the London  
Stock exchange. 
Revenue 
Revenues of $24.0 million represent 
amounts received and receivable from 
shipments of oil to domestic customers since 
the acquisition of GEIL on 21 November 2011. 
No payments were received from the KRG in 
the period for shipments of export oil and 
therefore, in line with the Group’s accounting 
policy, no export revenues have been 
recognised in the period. 
Financial Strategy
Our ﬁnancial strategy is to run our  
existing operations in the Kurdistan  
Region on a cash neutral basis and deploy 
our signiﬁcant cash resource to acquire  
and develop high quality oil and gas  
assets as and when attractively priced 
opportunities arise.
Fundraising
Following the incorporation of the Company 
on 1 April 2011, £1.3 billion ($2.0 billion) of 
cash (net of costs) was raised through IPO 
on 22 June 2011 for the purposes of 
acquiring or establishing a major company, 
business or asset that has signiﬁcant 
operations in the oil and gas sector . This 
was planned to be achieved through the 
acquisition of interests in, or merger with, 
one or more complementary companies, 
businesses or assets.
Acquisitions
On 21 November 2011, the Group completed 
the acquisition of GEIL, a Turkish oil and gas 
exploration and production business with 
PSCs in Kurdistan. Total consideration paid 
of $1,866.6 million was satisﬁed principally 
through the issue of 130,632,522 ordinary 
shares and suspended voting ordinary 
shares in Genel Energy plc at a share price

Dividend
In line with the Group strategy to deploy 
cash to acquire and develop high quality 
assets, no dividend will be paid for the 
period ended 31 December 2011. 
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure in the period  
amounted to $16.8 million, including  
$4.2 million in respect of oil and gas  
assets and $10.7 million for exploration  
and evaluation assets. 
Cash ﬂow
Total cash ﬂow for the period to  
31 December 2011 was $1,912.9 million, 
consisting of net cash outﬂow from 
operations of $23.4 million, $16.8 million 
out ﬂow for capex, $2,032.9 million in ﬂow 
from the issue of shares on IPO and $79.8 
million (including net debt acquired) out 
ﬂow in respect of the acquisition of GEIL. 
Net cash
At 31 December 2011, the Group had a cash 
balance of $1,912.9 million. This cash is held 
primarily for the purpose of acquiring 
further high quality, attractively priced 
assets. It is planned that, going forward,  
the existing business in the Kurdistan 
Region will be run on a largely cash  
ﬂow neutral basis. 
Net assets 
Net assets at 31 December 2011 amounted 
to $3,841.8 million and consist primarily  
of oil and gas assets of $1,841.0 million, 
exploration and evaluation assets of  
$227 .7 million, and cash of $1,912.9 million.
Liquidity / counterparty risk 
management 
The Group monitors its cash position, cash 
forecasts and liquidity on a regular basis. 
Cash is held in government gilts or treasury 
bills or on term deposits with a number  
of banks with appropriate credentials.  
Banking credentials are assessed using  
a combination of sovereign risk, credit 
default swap pricing and credit rating. 
Going concern
The Directors have assessed that the  
cash balance held provides the Group  
with adequate headroom over forecast 
operational and potential acquisition 
expenditure for the 12 months following  
the signing of the Annual Report for the 
period ended 31 December 2011 for the 
Group to be considered a going concern.
Functional and  
presentation currency 
The Directors have assessed the  
functional and presentation currency  
of the companies of the Group to be  
US dollars on the basis that the main 
operations of the group generate US dollar 
cash ﬂows and as such future dividend ﬂow 
and funds available for reinvestment will be 
US dollar denominated. In addition, future 
acquisitions will be in the oil and gas sector 
and the value of these and future cash 
ﬂows are likely to be US dollar driven. 
Accounting policies
UK listed companies are required to comply 
with the European regulation to report 
consolidated statements that conﬁrm to 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union. 
Principal accounting policies adopted by  
the group and applicable for the period 
ended 31 December 2011 are shown on

Corporate 
responsibility
Genel Energy is committed to conducting its operations in 
a manner that embraces safety, ethical integrity, responsible 
environmental management, and the development of 
positive and enduring relationships with the people and 
communities who are affected by our activities.
 We promote diversity, fairness and 
respect working environment;
 We respect personal privacy and 
conﬁdentiality; and
 We are committed to developing our 
employees and providing recognition 
based on success and achievement.
On site
We are committed to conducting all of our 
operations in a manner that protects the 
Group’s employees and contractors from 
injuries, fatalities and illnesses, as well as 
having regard to the health and safety  
of the general public. We aim to conduct 
our operations in compliance with local 
regulations, as well as international best 
practice such as the International 
Environmental Guidelines relating to  
Crude Oil Exploration and Production,  
and the standards of the World Bank,  
US Environmental Protection Agency  
and the World Health Organization.
Our ability to set the tone on HSS matters  
is strongest at the sites where we are 
operator . The Group’s active management 
of the TTOPCO exploration, drilling, 
production and management systems holds 
those operations to a higher standard than 
would ordinarily be required in the region. 
Prior to the formation of Genel Energy plc, 
GEIL operated as a private E&P company 
and had a track record of positive 
engagement with its stakeholders. We are 
building upon this work to create an accurate 
assessment of the impact of our activities 
and success in operating responsibly. 
Genel Energy has only operated  
as a publicly-listed company since 
November 2011. Since that time we have  
put in place a Code of Conduct and a 
supporting set of policies and procedures 
outlining our way of working. They outline 
our approach to conducting our business 
in a manner that will promote a positive 
impact on our stakeholders. Details of our 
Code of Conduct and supporting policies 
are summarised on pages 53 and 54 of 
this Annual Report, and available on our 
website at (www.genelenergy.com).
In the following pages we will explain  
our guiding principles and supporting 
conduct regarding:
 Health safety and security;
 Environmental policy; and
 Social and community engagement. 
Health, safety and security
“The provision of a safe  
and respectful working 
environment is central to  
the success of our business.”
Genel Energy Code of Conduct
At 31 December 2011, Genel Energy plc 
employed 87 people. Of these, 50 are based 
in Turkey, 25 are based in the Kurdistan 
Region, and 12 are based in London. Some 
455 people are employed by TTOPCO.
We are committed to creating a safe and 
healthy environment for all employees  
and contractors, and our Code of Conduct 
emphasises the following:
 We do not compromise health and 
safety for proﬁt or production;
 We do not tolerate any improper 
behaviour or harassment;
Feedback to the Group regarding its safety 
and environmental programme at Taq Taq 
has been very positive, most recently 
following a site visit from the Ministry  
of Natural Resources in January 2012.
At sites where we are not an operator ,  
we continue to engage our partners in an 
active dialogue on HSS standard and best 
practice. We intend to set the pace in the 
Region on HSS standards. For instance, we 
require all of our operational partners to 
provide timely reporting on HSS statistics, 
including near misses, and will continue  
the progress made on timely and periodic 
reporting throughout 2012.
We structure our operations with safety  
in mind at all times, using engineering 
controls, ﬁre and gas safety precautions 
and regular maintenance and emergency 
shutdown programs. Our contingency 
planning includes total system response 
capabilities, such as emergency shutdown 
procedures, blowout contingency plans,  
and H2S contingency plans, to minimise  
the consequences of accidents or natural 
disasters, ensuring the reliability and 
availability of communications, ﬁrst aid, 
medical support, emergency equipment  
and replacement accommodation in  
times of emergency.

Employees and training
We recognise that training is an integral  
and important part of our operations. Our 
continued development in this area will  
be achieved through training, mobility and 
ongoing support for our employees and 
contractors. Enhancing personal awareness 
of the potential hazards associated with  
an employee or contractor’s work, and  
the control measures and procedures 
necessary to minimise the risk of personal 
harm or loss and damage, whether to our 
assets or to the surrounding environment, 
is key to the performance of our business 
and our standing in the community. 
Measuring our performance
We have adopted the “Total Loss Approach” 
to accident prevention. All actual losses  
are investigated and measures to prevent 
accidents are put in place and routinely 
evaluated. Additionally, all potential causes 
of accidents are identiﬁed, reported and 
measured to mitigate the risk of accidents 
occurring. By using the Total Loss 
Approach, we aim to minimise the number 
of accidents experienced within the Group.
We measure our performance by utilising 
the industry accepted measure of lost time 
injury (LTI) and whether we have suffered 
any employee or contractor fatalities. Any 
fatality is a tragedy and our absolute 
priority is zero fatalities. 
In 2011, the Group saw only four LTI cases, 
three of which were at TTOPCO. We did not 
have any fatalities. The Group’s L TI statistics 
since 2009 are set out below.
Environmental policy
“We will be active participants 
in the global debate on 
environmental stewardship.”
Genel Energy Code of Conduct
It is right that a company of our stature and 
role in the community places the utmost 
emphasis on environmental policy. We will 
be at the forefront of the environmental 
debate in Kurdistan:
 We aim to maintain high standards  
of environmental protection  
and stewardship; 
 The location and size of new pits  
and pads for completion and  
workover equipment are selected  
so as to minimize disruption of surface 
resources and preserve the potential  
for the reclamation of the site; and
 Our strategic and operational decisions 
will be guided by best international 
environmental practices for the energy 
and mining industries, in addition to 
local requirements and expectations.
Reducing emissions and waste
We aim to prevent or reduce discharges, 
emissions and wastes capable of  
adversely affecting the living and  
working environment. Our environmental 
policies identify the potential impacts  
of exploration, drilling, development, 
production and processing at each site,  
and identify methods to contain and 
control any such matters to the most 
practical extent. We are committed to the 
continued development of formal systems 
and procedures throughout the Group. 
Assessment and audit
The Company regularly conducts its  
own environmental impact assessments 
and environmental monitoring studies,  
including risk assessment, risk mitigation 
and contingency planning and audits, and 
places a high value on regular reporting 
and knowledge. The Group intends to 
involve third-party auditors when necessary 
to ensure that its own assessments and 
related control measures remain relevant 
and effective.
Environmental actions for 2012
Our environmental policy is not static.  
A company with our aspirations needs  
a dynamic approach and a desire  
to continually, review and improve  
its standards, and we encourage a  
Group-wide culture of commitment  
to international standards. 
During 2012, we will be updating our 
stakeholders on our progress on improving 
and reﬁning our formal systems and 
processes. Our targets for 2012 include,  
but are not limited to, the following:
 reducing transportation-related  
air emissions and working towards  
the eradication of discharges of 
contaminants to surface water (fresh 
and salt water) and ground water;
 reducing the generation of waste 
through each phase of the life-cycle  
of transportation vehicles, vessels  
and infrastructure;
 maintaining and refreshing emergency 
management systems which are in place 
in order to respond to spills and other 
transportation-related accidents;
 closely monitoring contractors across 
our operatorships to ensure that 
international standards are adhered to;
 to continue to invest in and improve 
engineering hardware so as to reduce 
incident rates; and
 promote the use of alternative and 
renewable energy where applicable.

Library in T aq T aq T own
Through TTOPCO, we are constructing a brand new library in the Taq Taq sub-district, 
targeting the following objectives:
 To provide access to books and educational materials to the remote communities in Taq Taq, 
particularly where there is no other meaningful access to information in these areas. 
 To support vulnerable groups and children with special needs through improved access  
to learning materials. 
 To promote and improve literacy rates among the local population, and to help 
underprivileged children in the Taq Taq region gain access to education.
 To empower local residents and contribute to the development of the region through 
improved awareness of social issues.
The town of Taq Taq is located 120 km 
north-west of Sulaimaniyah, and 
approximately 25 kilometres from the Taq 
Taq drilling site. Together with some 66 
surrounding villages, the population of 
Taq Taq is approximately 22,000 people.
Thirty-three schools exist in Taq Taq  
and the surrounding villages, but there is  
only one library, built by a Humanitarian 
Foundation in 2003. Much of the 
population of Taq Taq does not have 
access to information and knowledge 
facilities, which we see as vital to the 
development of the region as it grows. 
Access to textbooks and other 
information resources is limited, and  
local studies have identiﬁed the absence 
of books and school libraries in the region 
as a key factor in poor local performance 
at national examinations. 
Identifying a need
Through dialogue with, and feedback 
from, local communities, we identiﬁed 
that a library and community centre 
would be a substantial project capable  
of making a real difference to the area. 
The construction of a library with modern 
facilities can and will empower the 
residents of Taq Taq through knowledge 
and learning, providing access to books, 
periodicals and other information  
sources on subjects as varied as politics, 
economics, mathematics, media and 
information technology. We also hope that 
the library will encourage awareness in the 
community of social issues, such as human 
rights, child protection, and responsibility 
for the environment. 
Project status
A proposal for construction of the library,  
to be over 500 sqm in size, was put out  
to tender in 2011 and awarded to a local 
construction company, providing further 
stimulus for the area. The project broke 
ground in November 2011 and construction 
is well underway, with completion expected 
by the end of 2012, at a total estimated  
cost of over $500,000.
In addition to holding over 10,000 volumes, 
which will be purchased by TTOPCO, the 
library will be ﬁtted with several computers 
to provide internet access to local residents 
of all ages. Additional facilities will include 
both adult and children’s areas for reading, a 
library bookstore, and a community meeting 
room with a capacity of (20-30) people to 
offer a variety of programs and events 
targeted to different age groups and 
interests. TTOPCO has also made a donation 
to the KRG to cover the ﬁrst year’s running 
costs, around $63,000, including all costs 
associated with training. The library will be 
fully staffed from the outset, with staff 
initially responsible for the indexing and 
cataloging of all materials, before branching 
out to other areas of interest, such as 
co-ordinating teaching and training with the 
local department for education.
Yet our ambition for the project goes 
further: We do not believe the principles of 
education and knowledge-sharing should be 
conﬁned to the four walls of the new library. 
For those who cannot access the library due 
to ill health or lack of transportation, 
particularly in more remote rural areas,  
a mobile library will be introduced to bring 
to books and reading materials  
to those who would not otherwise have 
access to them, on a weekly, fortnightly, 
or monthly basis depending on location. 
The project will be run on a sustainable 
basis by Ministry of Culture employees 
from its completion.

Social And Community Engagement
“Protecting and sustaining  
the communities in which  
we operate are fundamental  
to maintaining our licence  
to operate and being a 
sustainable business.”
Genel Energy Code of Conduct
We have a role to play in the communities 
with whom we operate. We invest our time 
and resources in support of recognised local, 
national and/or international initiatives in 
the following ways:
 Partnering with, and investing in, 
communities close to our operations to 
achieve mutual long-term beneﬁts. Strong 
community relations allow us to continue 
and expand our operations on a local, 
regional and global level;
 Maintaining proactive and constructive 
engagement with the local communities 
affected by our planned and operating 
assets, and investing to help them develop 
in a sustainable manner; and
 Contributing to socio-economic 
development through tax payments, 
royalties and other local payments and 
donations.
Community initiatives
Our core exploration and production 
activities take place in the Kurdistan Region 
in Northern Iraq – a region that has suffered 
through signiﬁcant upheavals over many 
decades. Since 2002, we have endeavored to 
contribute to and partner with surrounding 
communities through a mixture of  
initiatives, including:
 medical support; 
 water supplies to local villagers; 
 planning joint projects with  
local universities; 
 ﬁnancial and other support for local 
schools; and 
 building recreational infrastructure. 
A local partner
Whenever possible, we will hire our staff on 
site locally. In 2011, we trained some 250 local 
engineers, geologists and local university 
students. We are committed to developing 
the employment skills of the people in the 
communities in which we operate.
Koysanjaq (Koya) town is located 75 Km south of Erbil, in the same administrative district  
as the Taq Taq site. The town has grown rapidly, and there are currently more than 13,000 
families living in the town. Despite a growth in the number of inhabitants, there are only  
11 nurseries, with over 1,000 children in need of nursery places. There is a stark need to 
improve access to adequate child care services in the region. 
In 2011, TTOPCO commenced discussions 
with the Koya Local Authority to provide 
equipment to the Koya Nursery, a 
government-funded child care facility. 
Upon visiting the project, we found 
existing resources at the Koya to be 
limited. The nursery had 45 children who 
attended, but consisted of only three small 
rooms with very little in the way of 
equipment. The nursery receives only a 
modest budget from the local authority, 
most of which tends to be put towards 
feeding the children who attend. 
We identiﬁed the provision of equipment 
for this nursery as a priority need for  
the area, albeit one requiring relatively 
modest expenditure. A donation of 
$6,000 worth of equipment for the  
local nursery was included as one of the  
CSR projects in the TTOPCO budget for 
2012. So far this year we have bought  
new equipment for the nursery ranging  
from new air conditioner units and  
water dispensers, to computers and 
television sets.
Donations such as this are often just as 
important to a local community as the 
larger projects that we undertake. We are 
ﬁrmly of the belief that it should be the 
needs of the community that drive our 
contributions, and every donation or 
project, large and small, has the capacity  
to make a difference. We at Genel Energy 
are as proud of our support to the Koya 
Nursery as we are of all our contributions  
to the local community.

Annual Report 
2011
Principal  
risks and 
uncertainties
The Board, its Committees and the senior 
management team are actively engaged  
in monitoring and limiting, where possible,  
the risks to which the Group is exposed.  
The Audit Committee makes 
recommendations to the Board on the 
Group’s risk management arrangements. 
Set out below are what we believe at this time 
to be the principal risks and uncertainties that 
could affect the Group. In respect of each of 
these risks, we have identiﬁed their relevance 
to the strategy of the Group and their 
potential impact. The realisation of any of  
the risks set out below could have adverse 
implications for our business, including the 
Group’s ﬁnancial condition, reputation, results 
of operations and trading price, as well as  
the liquidity of our securities. Accordingly,  
we encourage you to read them in full. 
In summary, the risks fall into four  
broad categories:
 Commercial risks in relation to the business 
environment in which the Group operates;
 Political risks in relation to the political, 
social and economic stability of the 
Kurdistan Region and Iraq;
 Legal and regulatory risks in relation to  
he frameworks governing the Group’s 
operations; and
 Health, security, safety and environment 
risks which may prevent the Group from 
maintaining positive relationships with  
its stakeholders (including the local 
communities in which it operates).
It should be noted, for completeness, that 
there may be additional risks unknown to the 
Group and other risks, currently believed to 
be immaterial, which could turn out to be 
material. In addition, it should be noted that 
not all of the risks and uncertainties set out 
below are within our control.
Commercial risks
The Group’s estimates of its Contingent 
Resources and Prospective Resources can 
change with time, and there can be no 
guarantee that the Group will be able to 
develop these resources commercially.
The Group operates in a competitive industry 
and its ability to generate returns depends  
on its ability to exploit, develop and 
commercialise present assets, as well  
as to select and acquire suitable assets 
for exploitation, development and 
commercialisation in the future.
The Group’s inability to develop its Contingent 
and Prospective Resources may have a 
material and adverse effect on it’s business, 
ﬁnancial conditions, results of operations  
and prospects.
The Group relies on its ability to complete 
major projects on time and within budget
The Group is reliant on its completion of 
major projects to maintain its projected 
growth levels. In particular , there is a need  
to ensure projects (including the delivery  
by contractors and suppliers) are managed  
on time and within budget, using  
efﬁcient technologies to achieve the  
required speciﬁcations.
If projects are not executed on time and to 
budget, the planned growth and proﬁtability  
of the Group will not be achieved.
The Group continues to monitor the progress 
of all major projects as appropriate. Review 
outcomes and key concerns are reported  
to the executive team, and appropriate  
actions are agreed.
Third-party contractor performance is 
continually monitored, however , if a third 
party fails to meet the Groups performance 
requirements, there can be no guarantee  
that the Group will be able to replace such 
third party without further disruption to  
the project.
The Group cannot guarantee how long it 
will take to identify and acquire further 
appropriate acquisition targets
The Group raised money through IPO in  
June 2011 for the purpose of acquiring or 
establishing a major company, business or 
asset that has signiﬁcant operations in the 
resources sector . In continuation of this 
purpose, the Group is seeking further high 
quality assets to add to its portfolio at the 
right price.
The Group continues to hold a signiﬁcant 
cash balance, but a failure to identify further 
businesses or assets on which to spend  
these resources could have an impact on  
the valuation of the Group and returns made  
to its shareholders.
If appropriate targets for substantial 
investment are not available within a 
reasonable timeframe then the potential  
for creation of shareholder value through 
inorganic or , through subsequent 
development of acquired assets, organic 
growth of reserves and resources, production, 
revenue and cash generation will be reduced.
Political risks
The Iraq Oil Ministry has historically 
disputed the validity of PSCs entered  
into by the KRG.
The Group has title to assets in the Kurdistan 
Region pursuant to six PSCs entered into with 
the KRG.
If the validity of the PSCs is successfully 
challenged, the Group could be required by 
the KRG to accept contractor entitlements 
that are materially less favourable than  
the current PSCs.
Based on legal advice obtained by the 
Company, the Directors believe that the 
Company has good title to its oil and  
gas assets. 
The Group’s activities are dependent  
on the availability of infrastructure and 
services, including pipelines, utilities  
and third-party services in the  
Kurdistan Region.
Currently, all of the Group’s oil production 
from the T aq T aq ﬁeld is transported to  
the Kirkuk-Ceyhan Pipeline by trucks,  
which is potentially less safe, secure and 
environmentally sound than transport  
by pipeline.
Construction of a pipeline connecting the T aq 
T aq ﬁeld to the Kirkuk-Ceyhan Pipeline has 
not commenced. It is not yet known whether , 
or on what terms, the Group could obtain 
access to any other connecting pipeline.
The maximum capacity that can be 
transported by truck is 120,000 bopd. If 
production at the T aq T aq ﬁeld exceeds 
120,000 bopd, the Group may not be able  
to maximise the potential beneﬁts of this 
increase without the new pipeline. 
The Group continues to monitor the 
availability of transport options, to enhance 
the effectiveness of its operations. The  
Group is in advanced discussions with the 
KRG regarding the KICE pipeline, (including 
timing, ﬁnancing and cost recovery) and 
expects to conclude these discussions  
shortly . F ollowing completion of these 
discussions and execution of the deﬁnitive 
agreements, it expects its construction to 
begin later in 2012. 
If a major accident causes environmental 
damage, or the KRG revokes or amends 
licences, the Group may be restricted from 
transporting oil by truck to the Kirkuk-Ceyhan 
Pipeline. The Group has put in place health, 
safety and other procedures, to minimise the 
impact of unexpected disruptions to the 
supply of essential services.
Disruptions in the supply of essential utility 
services, such as water and electricity, could 
halt or delay the Group’s production.
Unexpected disruptions to the supply of 
essential utility services may cause loss of life, 
damage to the Group’s equipment and delay 
to the recommencement of operations.
Oil ﬁeld operators in the Kurdistan Region 
are not currently receiving their full 
entitlement to the proceeds of export  
sales under the PSCs granted by the  
KRG because the Iraqi Government is 
withholding some of these entitlements.
TTOPCO (the operator of T aq T aq) and DNO 
International (the operator at T awke) are 
among the affected operators. The Group’s 
strategy to increase progressively the share 
that exports sales make up of its revenue mix  43
Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
will depend on there being greater clarity and 
consistency to export payments.
Export payments to operators may be 
delayed or discontinued, resulting in delays  
to the Group’s development plans over the 
longer term (subject to prevailing market 
conditions) or leaving the Group unable to 
fund its capital expenditure commitments to 
its existing assets on a cash ﬂow neutral basis. 
The Group continues to have a regular 
dialogue with the KRG and the Iraqi 
Government as part of its engagement with 
stakeholders. Genel Energy’s sales into the 
local market in the Kurdistan Region have 
provided a consistent and reliable revenue 
stream that will allow the Group to operate 
and develop its existing assets on a cash  
ﬂow neutral basis.
The Kurdistan Region and Iraq have a 
publicised history of political and social 
instability, which has culminated in 
security problems that may affect the 
Group, its operations and personnel.
There continue to be regular clashes between 
the T urkish military and the PKK in Southern 
T urkey . The Iraqi government and the KRG 
have condemned the recent activities of the 
PKK, but have also expressed concerns in  
the past about T urkish cross-border military 
incursions into Northern Iraq.
Should diplomatic relations between Iraq or  
the KRG and T urkey deteriorate, the public 
perception of the Group in Iraq and the 
Kurdistan Region may be affected. 
The Group assesses political, social, legal  
and economic risks as part of its evaluation  
of potential projects. It actively monitors 
developments in Iraq and the Kurdistan 
Region. The Group continues to have a 
regular dialogue with its key stakeholders  
in the region, such as the KRG, the Iraqi 
Government, the T urkish government and 
other regional public bodies, to discuss 
developments that are relevant to  
its operations.
The Group has taken measures to protect  
its employees, equipment and other assets 
from various security risks. Steps include  
the provision of security personnel and 
surveillance equipment, and the imposition  
of security checks and procedures at the sites 
that it operates. However , there can be no 
guarantee that such measures will prove 
effective against all safety risks.
F ailure to manage relationships with  
local communities, government and 
non-government organisations could 
adversely affect the Group.
As a consequence of public concerns  
about the perceived ill effects of economic 
globalisation, business generally, and large 
multinational corporations in particular , face 
increasing public scrutiny of their activities. 
The Group’s operations may be located in or 
near communities that may regard its 
operations as detrimental to  
their environmental, economic or  
social circumstances.
Negative community reaction could have  
a negative impact on the Group’s ability to 
operate efﬁciently or the ability to ﬁnance,  
or even the viability of an operation. Such 
reactions could also lead to disputes with 
national or local governments or with local 
communities and give rise to disruption  
to projects or operations, or material 
reputational damage, which could in turn 
affect the Group’s revenues, results of 
operations and cash ﬂows. 
The Company has published a Code of 
Conduct and has adopted an Anti-Bribery 
Policy under which it partners with and 
invests in communities (local, regional and 
global) to achieve mutual long-term beneﬁts. 
The Company contributes to socio-economic 
development, through taxes, royalties and 
other lawful local payments and donations, 
and is an active participant in the ongoing 
global debate on environmental and social 
stewardship. The Code of Conduct and further 
details of the Group Community policy are 
available to view at www.genelenergy .com. 
The Anti-Bribery Policy is described on pages 
53 and 54 of this Annual Report. 
Legal and regulatory risks
There remains an ongoing dispute between 
the KRG and the Iraq Central Government 
in relation to both export payments and 
the awarding of new PSCs. New laws may 
be enacted in the future, governing the 
regulation of Iraqi oil and gas resources. 
The dispute between the KRG and Iraqi 
Central Government may require new laws 
and regulations to be introduced to resolve 
the situation.
The enactment of any new law may alter the 
regulation of oil and gas resources in Iraq and 
the Kurdistan Region, reduce the value of  
the Group’s existing PSCs and increase the 
regulatory requirements on the Group. 
Additionally, depending on the content of  
any future enacted law, the Group’s existing 
PSCs with the KRG may be subject to review 
or revision of terms. Increased legislative 
requirements could mean that the Group 
incurs additional expenditure obligations  
and have a material and adverse effect on  
the Group’s business, ﬁnancial conditions, 
results of operations and prospects.
The Group may be unable to obtain or 
renew required drilling rights, concessions, 
licences, permits and other authorisations 
(together , “Licences”) or such Licences 
may be suspended, terminated or revoked 
prior to their expiration.
The Group conducts its exploration, 
development and production operations 
pursuant to drilling rights under a wide 
variety of Licences.
There can be no assurance that the KRG will 
not signiﬁcantly alter the conditions of, or 
that any third party will not challenge,  
the Licences held by the Group.
If the Group fails to fulﬁl the speciﬁc terms  
of any of its Licences, or if it operates its 
business in a manner that violates applicable 
law, government regulators may impose ﬁnes.
Any delay in obtaining or renewing the 
Licences of the Group, or any suspension, 
unfavourable alteration challenge thereto, 
may result in a delay in investment or 
development of oil and gas resources and 
may have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s results of operations, cash ﬂows  
and ﬁnancial condition.
The Group continues to maintain a regular 
dialogue with its key stakeholders in the 
region, such as the KRG, the Iraqi 
Government, the T urkish government and 
other regional public bodies, and expects to 
obtain and maintain all approvals necessary 
to operate its business.
HSSE risks
The Group’s operations are subject to 
general and speciﬁc regulations and 
restrictions governing workplace health 
and safety requirements, environmental 
requirements, social impacts, and other 
laws and regulations.
The Group’s primary operational safety risks 
are those inherent in the oil and gas industry, 
including the release of hydrogen sulphide 
gas during ﬂaring at the T aq T aq ﬁeld, ﬁres, 
blowouts, explosions, equipment or system 
failures and transportation accidents, which 
may result in death, injury of staff or  
local residents.
Certain of the Group’s operations may  
also create environmental risks in the  
form of spills, and the release of gas or soil 
contamination from site operations, recycling 
and waste disposal. 
A health, safety, security or environmental 
incident could lead to the Group having to 
make material changes to its facilities or 
processes and pay compensation to any 
injured parties. There can be no assurance 
that the Group will not incur substantial 
ﬁnancial obligations, which may lead to  
an adverse effect on the Group’s business, 
ﬁnancial condition and prospects.
The Group has implemented health, safety 
and environmental policies and complies with 
international environmental guidelines for 
crude oil exploration and production, for 
example those issued by the World Health 
Organisation. The Group monitors compliance 
with its health, safety and environment 
policies regularly through a reporting  
system, inspections, third-party audits and 
management site inspections as overseen  
by the Group HSSE Committee.  Calibre

Genel Energy is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. As part of the process 
leading up to our re-listing in November 2011, the Group took the steps necessary to ensure full 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
As envisaged by the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has established a series of 
committees to aid its effectiveness: the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee, the Health, 
Safety , Security and Environment Committee and the Remuneration Committee. The Committees 
assist the Board in exercising its authority , including monitoring the performance of the business  
to gain assurance that progress is being made towards the corporate objective within the limits 
imposed by the Board.
Corporate Governance
Our objective is to create long-term value for shareholders  
through the exploration, development and production of oil and 
gas resources. We have unique assets that are important to the 
growth of many of the world’s economies. In doing this, we have 
committed to a high level of governance and developing a culture 
that values exemplary ethical standards, personal and corporate 
integrity and respect for others. The Board governs the Group 
consistently with our business strategy and commitment to a 
transparent and high-quality governance system.
Our view is that governance is not just a matter for the Board and 
that a good governance culture must be fostered throughout the 
organisation. Our expectations of our employees and those to 
whom we contract business are set out in the Genel Energy plc 
Code of Conduct, which is summarised below and can be viewed  
at www.genelenergy.com. 
This report outlines our current system of governance and future 
expectations, and sets out how the Company has further evolved 
since the completion of the Vallares/Genel Energy merger on  
21 November 2011. 
Genel Energy plc is a Jersey-incorporated company. We are 
committed to complying with the regulatory requirements  
in Jersey and the UK, together with prevailing standards of best 
practice, and are in compliance with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
Corporate governance principles continue to be reﬁned by 
regulators, including new guidance on Board effectiveness from  
the UK Financial Reporting Council, the implementation of the 
Stewardship Code for investors in the UK and a continued focus  
on diversity of skills, experience, nationality and gender on Boards. 
Standard Listing
The Company’s voting shares in issue at the date of this document 
have been admitted to the Ofﬁcial List with a Standard Listing. 
Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules sets out the requirements for  
and continuing obligations of, companies with Standard Listings.
Notwithstanding its Standard Listing, the Company intends to 
comply voluntarily with those sections of the Listing Rules that 
would otherwise apply only to companies with a Premium Listing, 
such as the Listing Principles set out in Chapter 7 of the Listing 
Rules. The Company will not be subject formally to such sections, 
and is not required to comply with them by the UKLA, but 
nevertheless sees such compliance as an important part of its 
corporate governance framework and a statement of intent 
towards obtaining a Premium Listing.
Model Code
The Board has voluntarily adopted the Model Code for directors’ 
dealings contained in the Listing Rules. The Board is responsible  
for taking all proper and reasonable steps to ensure compliance 
with the Model Code by the Directors. Compliance with the Model 
Code is being undertaken on a voluntary basis. As the Model Code 
only applies to companies with a Premium Listing, the FSA does  
not have the authority to (and will not) monitor the Company’s 
voluntary compliance with the Model Code, nor to impose  
sanctions in respect of any failure by the Company to so comply. 53

Summary of Key Principles of the Genel Energy  
Code of Conduct
The Group Code of Conduct, which was adopted by the Board  
on 21 November 2011, deﬁnes what we stand for as a company  
and sets out the principles that guide all of our business activities. 
Basic principles are to strive for operational excellence and to 
operate in a responsible, ethical and safe manner with the highest 
standards of ﬁnancial reporting, corporate governance, and 
compliance with all applicable laws. Every ofﬁcer and employee  
of the Group has a personal responsibility to comply with the  
letter and the spirit of the Code, and all personnel are encouraged  
to raise a concern and report any suspected or known violations  
of the Code without fear of retaliation.
The Code is divided into four sections: business conduct,  
workplace, business partners, and communities and environment. 
Each section sets out an overall guiding principle and statements  
of expected conduct.
Business Conduct
We are committed to conducting business in an open, honest  
and ethical manner . We do not tolerate any form of bribery or 
corruption and we are committed to complying with all applicable 
laws. We seek to avoid conﬂicts of interest. We ensure that  
all ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information created within the  
Group is complete and accurate, and we strive to provide accurate 
and timely information to external stakeholders, including any 
governments in the locations in which we operate. We take  
steps to protect against inappropriate use of conﬁdential and 
privileged information, and we protect and use our businesses 
assets appropriately.
Workplace
Achieving high standards of personal wellbeing, including provision 
of a safe and respectful working environment, is central to the 
success of our business. We are committed to creating a safe and 
healthy environment for all employees and contractors. We will not 
compromise our health and safety values for proﬁt or production. 
We do not tolerate harassment or other improper behaviour and 
we promote diversity, fairness and respect in the workplace. We 
respect the personal privacy of our employees and others. We are 
committed to developing our employees and providing recognition 
based on success and achievement.
Business Partners
We will maintain our standards of business conduct in our  
dealings with all business partners, to promote mutually  
beneﬁcial relationships and protect our reputation. We shall trade  
lawfully and properly at all times and respect all relevant legal 
requirements and expected practices, including trade controls.  
We will not seek to win or maintain business by acting illegally  
or contrary to our contractual agreements. Our relationships with 
customers and suppliers should be fair and honest, at commercial 
rates, and in compliance with contractual undertakings and 
applicable laws. We expect all third parties acting on our behalf  
to follow the principles of our Code and this will be integral to  
their appointment.
Communities and Environment
Protecting and sustaining the communities and environment in 
which we operate are fundamental to maintaining our licence to 
operate and being a sustainable business. We aim to maintain high 
standards of environmental protection and we do not compromise 
our environmental values for proﬁt or production. We work to 
uphold human rights and our standards include the United  
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We seek to 
maintain proactive and constructive engagement with the local 
communities affected by our operations and assets, and invest to 
help them develop in a sustainable manner . We will contribute to 
socio-economic development and provide transparency in respect  
of our contributions and their impact.
Anti-Bribery policy
The Company is making good progress in implementing anti-bribery 
policies and procedures and related training programs across the 
Group, which are designed to meet relevant anti-bribery legal 
standards, including the UK Bribery Act. As stated in our Code of 
Conduct, we are committed to the highest standards of ﬁnancial 
reporting, corporate governance, and operational excellence.
In February 2012, the Genel Energy Anti-Bribery Policy was 
ofﬁcially launched and the CEO sent a personal message to all 
employees putting the policy into force. The CEO’s message and 
the Anti-Bribery Policy conﬁrm and make very clear that we will 
not tolerate any form of bribery or corruption and that we will 
employ adequate procedures to prevent, detect and deter all  
forms of bribery and corruption. The Company’s Anti-Bribery  
Policy applies to all directors, ofﬁcers, employees and agents of 
Genel Energy, and to subsidiaries as well as all joint ventures in 
which we or any of our afﬁliated companies have a majority 
interest or control. Where we have a minority interest or do not 
have control, we will make a good faith effort to convince the board 
or management of the entity to implement an anti-bribery policy 
consistent with the principles of our policy.
In addition to setting out a clear prohibition on bribery and 
conﬁrming that all business will be conducted in compliance with  
all applicable laws and regulations and the highest ethical standards, 
the Anti-Bribery Policy speciﬁcally addresses and provides guidance 
on facilitation payments (which are prohibited by the Policy), health 
and safety payments, business courtesies, recruitment, anti-bribery 
issues relating to corporate and M&A transactions, maintaining 
accurate books and records and ﬁnancial controls, record retention 
for anti-bribery compliance purposes, reporting of violations and 
disciplinary actions, training, monitoring and audit, and to whom 
employees may go with questions and for assistance. 54

in place a Whistleblowing Policy as well as our Code of Conduct.  
All employees are encouraged to report and express their concerns

is our insistence that nobody who raises a concern will suffer any 
form of retaliation or be put at a disadvantage for doing so.

Roles of the Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,  
Senior Independent Director and President
The Chairman is Rodney Chase. The Chairman reports to  
the Board and is responsible for the leadership and overall 
effectiveness of the Board and setting the Board’s agenda.  
Speciﬁc responsibilities of the Chairman include ensuring the 
effective running of the Board, ensuring that the Board agenda  
is forward-looking with an emphasis on strategic issues, ensuring  
the performance of the Board and its Committees is in compliance 
with approved procedures and best practice, promoting a culture  
of openness and debate by ensuring constructive relations 
between Executive and Non-Executive Directors, and ensuring 
effective communication between the Group and its shareholders. 
The Independent Non-Executive Directors will meet during 2012  
to appraise the performance of the Chairman. The changes  
to Mr Chase’s other directorships since his appointment  
as Chairman will have no impact on his continued ability  
to perform his duties for the Company.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is Tony Hayward. The Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer is responsible for all executive management matters  
of the Group. He reports to the Chairman and to the Board  
directly. All members of executive management including the 
President, report directly to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer . Speciﬁc 
responsibilities of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer include the day-to-
day management of the Group within delegated authority limits, 
identifying and executing strategic opportunities, managing the 
Group’s risk proﬁle and ensuring appropriate internal controls,

and an intermediary for other Directors if necessary.

retain while he holds an executive position within the Group and  
for as long as Genel Holding and its Associates are between them 
entitled to exercise or to control the exercise of, in aggregate,  
10% or more of the Voting Rights in the Company. As President,  
Mr Sepil provides the Company with a combination of local 
expertise, industry knowledge and strategic relationships.  
Mr Sepil plays a leading role in government and public affairs and  
in communications and relationships with key stakeholders, such

and nine (including the Chairman) non-executive. Six (including  
the Chairman) are independent and ﬁve non-independent.

Annual Report. 
Independence of the Board
The Independent Non-Executive Directors (Rodney Chase, Jim 
Leng, Sir Graham Hearne, George Rose, Mark Parris and Mehmet 
Ög ˘ütçü) will ensure that the management and decisions of the 
board are properly checked and balanced. They have a voting 
majority over the Directors who are not independent, to ensure  
the strongest possible governance.
The Directors who are not independent include the founders  
of the Company (Nathaniel Rothschild, Non-Executive Director;

and Gulsun Nazli Karamehmet Williams and Murat Yazici who have 
been nominated for appointment to the Board by Focus 
Investments and Genel Holding, respectively. 
The test of independence for a Director is whether he/she  
is ‘independent of management and any business or other 
relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of 
objective, unfettered or independent judgement by the Director  
or the Director’s ability to act in the best interests of the Group’.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring potential 
conﬂicts of Directors (as well as the President and certain senior 
managers) and determining whether such persons have an actual 
or potential conﬂict of interest in their dealings with the Company. 
This includes establishing a process for circulating questionnaires 
to such persons at least once a year to identify any potential  
or existing conﬂicts of interest, informing such persons of their 
continuing duty to provide the Audit Committee with the relevant 
information and/or any updates as they deem necessary, ensuring 
that an up to date list of any authorised conﬂicts of interest 
granted to such persons is maintained (following authorisation  
of any relevant conﬂict by the Board) reviewing the negotiation  
of any relevant transaction or arrangement to ensure that it has 
been or will be conducted on arms’ length terms, and ensuring 
implementation of the Conﬂicts Procedures and any similar  56

The Non-Executive Directors contribute international and 
operational experience, understanding of the sectors in which we 
operate, knowledge of world capital markets, and an understanding 
of the health, safety, environmental and community challenges that 
we face. The Executive Directors bring additional perspectives to 
the Board’s work through a deep understanding of the Group’s 
business. The Board works together as a whole to oversee strategy 
for the Group and monitor pursuit of the corporate objective.
It is made clear in each Director’s terms of appointment that  
they must be prepared to commit sufﬁcient time and resources  
to perform the role effectively. Under its Terms of Reference,  
the Nomination Committee must require each potential Director 
candidate to disclose their existing business interests, and assess 
any potential conﬂicts prior to making a recommendation to  
the Board on whether to appoint them as a Director . The Audit 
Committee will circulate a questionnaire to all Directors each  
year to ensure that this information is kept up-to-date.
Directors commit to the collective decision-making processes  
of the Board. Individual Directors debate issues openly and 
constructively and are free to question or challenge the opinions  
arrangements adopted by the Company from time to time.  
If a conﬂict issue is identiﬁed, the Audit Committee must ensure 
that the Board is briefed on it as and when appropriate, and make 
recommendations to the Board for its authorisation (and the 
proposed terms of such authorisation).
Factors affecting the independence of the Directors, President  
and certain senior managers may include (in relation to each  
such person and their ‘connected persons’), directorships  
or shareholdings held in other companies, interests in existing  
or proposed transactions involving any Group company, advisory 
relationships held with any Group company, trusteeships of any  
Group company pension schemes or their trustee companies, 
opportunities to take up offers that have been made to any Group 
company, opportunities to make a proﬁt as a result of their role  
in the Company, and ownership of property that could be affected 
by the activities of any Group company.
The Board considers that there is an appropriate balance between 
Executive and Non-Executive, Independent and Non-Independent 
Directors, with a view to promoting shareholder interests and 
governing the business effectively. In addition, the Board will  
have extensive access to members of senior management, who  
will attend all the regularly scheduled Board meetings by invitation, 
where they will make presentations and engage in discussions  
with Directors, answer questions, and provide input and 
perspective on their areas of responsibility. The Independent 
Non-Executive Directors will also meet separately from the  
rest of the Board from time to time.
Changes to the Board during 2011-2012
There have been a number of changes to the composition of the 
Board in the period from its incorporation on 1 April 2011 until  
3 April 2012, reﬂecting the completion of the Acquisition and 
development of the Company.

of others. Directors also commit to active involvement in Board 
decisions and the application of strategic thought to matters in 
issue, and are prepared to question, challenge and critique. 
Directors are clear communicators and good listeners who  
actively contribute to the Board in a collegial manner .
The Directors receive appropriate brieﬁng papers on substantive 
items, which are, in general, circulated a week before the relevant 
Board meeting to give the Directors adequate time to prepare for 
the meeting, and to enable any Director who is unable to attend 
the meeting to have reviewed the matters for discussion and, if 
necessary, to provide their comments in advance of the meeting.
The Board believes that a mix of skills and a breadth of experience 
are important to ensure that the Board and its Committees 
function cohesively as a whole and effectively lead the Group. The 
Nomination Committee has a formal process by which it will assess 
the overall knowledge, skills and experience required on the Board, 
and will work with the Board to ensure that it is progressively 
refreshed as appropriate to meet the future needs of the business. 
Further information on the Nomination Committee’s process is  
set out on pages 61 and 62 of this Annual Report.
Group and industry knowledge
In order to govern the Group effectively, Non-Executive Directors 
must have a clear understanding of the Group’s overall strategy, 
together with knowledge about the Group and the industries in 
which it operates. Non-Executive Directors must be sufﬁciently 
familiar with the Group’s core business to be effective contributors 
to the development of strategy and to monitor performance.  
The Chairman, with the support of the Company Secretary, is 
responsible for ensuring that all new Non-Executive Directors 
receive a full, formal and tailored induction upon appointment  
to the Board. 
The Chairman, with the support of the Company Secretary, and the 
General Counsel is also responsible for ensuring the provision of 
development programmes. During the coming year , development 
activities will include business brieﬁngs intended to provide each 
Director with a deeper understanding of the direction of the 
business and bespoke sessions on speciﬁc topics of relevance, such 
as any changes in corporate governance standards.
All of the Directors received a comprehensive brieﬁng on their 
duties and responsibilities as Directors of a listed company by  
the Company’s advisors as part of the Acquisition process.  
Further brieﬁngs have taken and will continue to take place in  
2012 as necessary, to ensure that the Directors are kept informed 
of relevant developments and that updates on relevant changes 
and developments to the business are provided at Board meetings.
Terms of appointment
Each Non-Executive Director’s letter of appointment clearly deﬁnes 
the role of Non-Executive Directors, including the expectations  
in terms of independence, participation and time commitment.  
In summary, Non-Executive Directors are expected to scrutinise  
the performance of management and satisfy themselves as to  
the adequacy and integrity of ﬁnancial statements. Non-Executive 
Directors are also expected to commit sufﬁcient time to carry out 
their role, and to disclose circumstances that may affect, or be 
perceived to affect, their ability to exercise independent judgement 
so that the Board can assess independence on a regular basis.
Independent advice
The Board and its Committees may seek advice from independent 
experts at the expense of the Company whenever it is considered 
appropriate. Individual Directors may seek independent legal 
advice at the expense of the Company, in accordance with the 
Board’s agreed procedure.
Share ownership
Some, but not all, of the Directors are interested (directly and 
indirectly) in shares of the Company through various routes. Share 
Matching Awards have been granted to four of the Independent 
Non-Executive Directors, described on page 71 of the Remuneration 
Report. Founder Shares were granted to the Founders for their initial 
capital commitment to the Company, and Founder Securities have 
been granted to the Founders to encourage them to grow the 
Company. Further details of these arrangements and other interests 
held by Directors are set out on pages 72 and 73 of this Annual 
Report. The Executive Directors will also be eligible to participate in 
the Performance Share Plan once it is approved by the shareholders 
at the Company’s Annual General Meeting in May 2012.
All dealings by Directors are subject to the Group’s share  
dealing code. 
Company Secretary
As the Company is registered in Jersey, Capita Securities Limited 
continue to act as the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary 
is responsible for maintaining the information systems and 
processes that enable the Board to fulﬁl its role. The Company 
Secretary, together with the Group General Counsel is also 
responsible to the Board for ensuring that Board procedures are 
complied with and advising the Board on governance matters. All 
Directors have access to the Company Secretary for advice and 
services. Independent advisory services may be retained by the 
Company Secretary at the request of the Board or Committees. 
Review of the Board
The Board is committed to transparency in determining Board 
membership and in assessing the performance of Directors. As ﬁve 
out of eleven Directors were appointed on 21 November 2011, the 
Board is of the view that a meaningful evaluation of the Board, 
Committees and Directors cannot yet take place, and should only 
take place once the Board has worked together for a full year .  
The evaluation policy will therefore be developed and implemented 
in 2012. The Chairman, who is also Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee, will have responsibility for managing the review  58
Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
Corporate 
Governance 
continued
process, but feedback on the Chairman’s own performance will  
be provided to him by the Senior Independent Director . 
The Board has responsibility for conducting regular evaluations  
of its performance, the performance of its Committees, individual 
Directors and the governance processes that support the Board’s 
work. This includes analysis of how the Board and its Directors are 
functioning, the time spent by the Board considering matters and 
whether the Terms of Reference of the Committees have been  
met, as well as compliance with the Company’s other governance 
documents. In addition, the Board (supported by the Nomination 
Committee) has responsibility for evaluating the performance of 
Directors retiring and seeking re-election, and deciding whether  
to recommend the re-election of particular Directors.
Re-election of Directors
Consistent with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors 
will seek re-election at the forthcoming AGM.
The Board remains satisﬁed that each Director continues  
to be fully competent to carry out his or her responsibilities  
as a member of the Board.
Risk monitoring and reporting
The Group intends to measure and monitor continually the major 
risks to which its operations in the Kurdistan Region are exposed 
by leveraging its local expertise, industry knowledge and strategic 
relationships. In particular , the Group expects to continue to have  
a regular dialogue with its key stakeholders in the region, such as 
the KRG, the Iraqi Government, the Turkish government and other 
regional public bodies. 
Further details of the principal risks and uncertainties to which  
the Company’s operations are exposed, and the action taken to 
manage those risks and uncertainties, are set out at pages  
42 and 43 of this Annual Report.
Internal controls
The Board is responsible for maintaining and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems. These 
systems are designed to identify, evaluate and manage the 
signiﬁcant risks to which the Group is exposed. The Board has 
established the processes necessary to meet the expectations of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and Turnbull guidance, which 
include having clear lines of responsibility, documented levels of 
delegated authority and appropriate operating procedures.
The Group has established and rolled out a Code of Conduct, 
Whistleblowing Policy and Anti-Bribery Policy. Training has been 
provided to the Board and to senior management covering the 
obligations and behaviours of a UK listed company, compliance, 
insider dealing and market abuse. Anti-bribery training for all 
applicable staff levels is close to completion and refresher courses 
will be run when appropriate.
Following the Acquisition in November 2011, the Board performed a 
formal review of its internal control systems and ﬁnancial reporting 
procedures before relisting on the standard segment of the Ofﬁcial 
List. The Board assessed the internal controls of the Group against 
those Corporate Governance standards that would be expected  
of a company with a Premium Listing and continues voluntarily to 
assess its internal controls and risk management processes against 
that benchmark.
The Audit Committee has assisted the Board in the performance  
of its responsibilities by reviewing those procedures that relate  
to risk management processes and ﬁnancial controls. The Audit 
Committee considered the reports of the external auditors and 
reporting accountants and provided information as required for 
discussion at Board level. 
The Group’s risk management process is used to identify  
the key risks to the business, the controls by which these are 
managed and how these controls are monitored. The Executive 
Committee has established this process, which has been reviewed 
and approved by the Board. The Executive Committee will review 
and update the risk management process and the risks identiﬁed 
on a quarterly basis and the Board will review these at least  
twice a year .
Budgets are prepared annually following consultation with our 
partners and are reforecast on a regular basis. Daily operational 
reports are provided to the Executive Committee, which is involved 
in the signiﬁcant day to day key aspects of the business. Financial 
and non-ﬁnancial data reporting performance against these 
budgets are prepared each month and incorporated into monthly 
management accounts, which are prepared in accordance with the 
framework provided by the Group’s ﬁnancial procedures manual. 
The content and format of the management accounts are kept 
under review and amended periodically to ensure appropriate 
information is provided. The Executive Committee reports to the 
Board on performance and key issues.
The assessment of controls and risk management processes 
provide a reasonable basis for the Board to make proper judgments 
on an ongoing basis as to the ﬁnancial position and prospects of 
the Group.
The Group continues to evolve its system of internal controls to 
ensure it provides appropriate visibility to the Board on issues that 
are important to the Group. The Board has conducted a review of 
the effectiveness of the system of internal control for the period 
ended 31 December 2011 and up to the date of the signing of the 
ﬁnancial statements. The system is designed to manage, rather 
than eliminate, risk and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. In that 
context, the review, in the opinion of the Board, indicated that the 
system overall was satisfactory.
Remuneration
Further details of our remuneration policies and practices and the 
remuneration paid to the Directors (Executive and Non-Executive) 
are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report at pages 64-71  
of this Annual Report. Shareholders will be invited to consider and 
to approve the Remuneration Report at the 2012 AGM. 59
Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
Communication with stakeholders – our policy
Part of the Group’s Code of Conduct sets a framework for how it 
partners with and invests in communities (local, regional and 
global) to achieve mutual long-term beneﬁts. The Company 
contributes to socio-economic development, contributing through 
taxes, royalties and other local payments and donations, and is an 
active participant in the ongoing global debate on environmental 
and social stewardship. 
AGM
The Company’s ﬁrst AGM will be held at The Atlantic Hotel, Jersey 
on 22 May 2012, and will provide an opportunity for shareholders  
to engage with the Board and senior managers. The business of  
the meeting will be conducted in accordance with its articles of 
association, and the requirements and standards promoted  
by the UK Corporate Governance Code. Separate resolutions on 
substantially separate issues will be put to the meeting and proxy 
forms will allow shareholders to vote for , against or withhold a  
vote on a resolution. Details of the proxy votes counted will be 
announced at the AGM and on the Company’s website after the 
meeting. The Chairman of the Board and the chairmen of each of 
the Committees will be available to answer questions put forward 
to them by shareholders of the Company. The Notice of AGM  
is included in the documents which have been provided with  
this report, and is also available on the Company’ website at  
www.genelenergy.com.
Communications with institutional investors
Communication with shareholders will be given high priority and 
there will be regular dialogue with institutional investors, as well  
as general presentations to analysts at the time of the release of 
the annual and half-year results. The Chairman will attend a number 
of these meetings. The Board receives regular investor relations 
reports covering key investor meetings and activities, as well  
as shareholder and investor feedback. The Group publishes  
its periodic results and other stock market announcements  
on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website  
www.genelenergy.com and regular news updates in relation  
to the Group, including the status of exploration and development 
programmes, will also be included on the website. 
The senior independent non-executive director is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns the Chairman, Chief Executive 
or Finance Director has failed to resolve or for which such contact is 
inappropriate. Each of the Non-Executive Directors is also available 
to attend meetings with major shareholders (without the executive 
directors present), if requested.
Committees
As envisaged by the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has 
established four Committees: the Audit Committee, the Nomination 
Committee, the Health, Safety, Security and Environment 
Committee and the Remuneration Committee. The Committees 
assist the Board in exercising its authority, including monitoring  
the performance of the business to gain assurance that progress  
is being made towards the corporate objective within the limits 
imposed by the Board. Each Committee consists only of 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, and has Terms of  
Reference under which authority is delegated by the Board.  
The Terms of Reference of each Committee are available to  
view at www.genelenergy.com. 
The Committees shall have access to sufﬁcient resources in  
order to carry out their duties, including access to the Company 
secretariat as required, and authorisation to obtain external  
advice at the expense of the Company.

The objectives of the Audit Committee are:
 to increase shareholder conﬁdence by ensuring the  
credibility and objectivity of published ﬁnancial information;
 to assist the Board in meeting its ﬁnancial  
reporting responsibilities;
 to assist the Board in ensuring the effectiveness of the 
internal accounting and ﬁnancial controls of the Company;
 to strengthen the independent position of the Company’s 
external auditors by providing channels of communication 
between them and the Non-Executive Directors;
 to review the performance of the Company’s internal and 
external auditing functions; and
 to assist the Board in monitoring and addressing potential conﬂicts 
of interest between members of the Group and the Directors, 
President and/ or certain senior managers of the Company .
The Audit Committee is responsible, among other things, for 
making recommendations to the Board on the appointment of 
auditors and the audit fee; monitoring and reviewing the integrity 
of the Company’s ﬁnancial statements and any formal 
announcements on the Company’s ﬁnancial performance, as well 
as reports from the Company’s auditors on those ﬁnancial 
statements; and reviewing the Company’s internal ﬁnancial control 
and risk management, whistle blowing arrangements and other 
audit and risk-related arrangements to assist the Board in fulﬁlling 
its responsibilities relating to the effectiveness of those systems,  60

including an evaluation of the capabilities of such systems in light 
of the expected requirements for any speciﬁc acquisition target. 
The Audit Committee is also responsible for resolving conﬂicts 
concerning the Directors, including but not limited to potential 
conﬂicts arising from personal investment activities, other 
professional activities (such as directorships with third parties) and 
related party transactions involving any Director or senior executive. 
The members of the Audit Committee are George Rose, Jim Leng 
and Mark Parris. The Chairman of the Audit Committee is George 
Rose. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, Mr 
Rose has recent and relevant expertise, having held the position of 
Group Finance Director at BAE Systems for 13 years until 2011. Mr 
Rose is a Chartered Management Accountant, and Chairs the Audit 
Committees of both National Grid plc and Laing O’Rourke plc.
The Audit Committee is required to meet at least four times a year . 
Since its formation on 18 June 2011 until 3 April 2012, the Audit 
Committee has met three times. 
Under its Terms of Reference, the Audit Committee must circulate 
minutes to all members of the Board and the external auditor 
following each Committee meeting, and the Committee chairman 
must report more fully to the Board if the Board so requests.
The Audit Committee has carried out various activities in 
accordance with the responsibilities set out in its Terms of 
Reference, including the activities described below. The Company’s 
focus since completion of the Acquisition has been on the 
development and progression of internal controls and audit 
procedures suitable for the Company.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the 2011 Annual Report, 
including the preliminary results, before recommending them to the 
Board. In doing so, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed 
the preliminary results and annual ﬁnancial statements with 
management and the external auditors, focusing particularly on: 
 the quality and acceptability of the accounting policies and 
practices and ﬁnancial reporting disclosures and changes 
thereto;
 areas involving signiﬁcant judgement, estimation or 
uncertainty;
 the basis for the going concern assumption; and 
 compliance with ﬁnancial reporting standards and relevant 
ﬁnancial and governance requirements.
The Audit Committee met regularly with KPMG LLP to review  
and progress the Group’s internal audit plan. The relevant audit 
plan and procedures are aimed at addressing ﬁnancial risk 
management objectives and have been prepared in accordance 
with standards promoted by the Institute of Internal Auditors.  
The Audit Committee will continue to monitor the effectiveness 
of internal audit plans in accordance with the Company’s  
ongoing requirements.
In conjunction with the Company’s internal audit and ﬁnancial 
control functions, the Audit Committee conducted a number  
of reviews of the Company’s systems and processes to progress 
internal ﬁnancial control matters. It also conducted a review of the 
allocation of ﬁnancial risk management oversight to ensure that 
responsibility for overall ﬁnancial risk management and review is 
appropriately allocated between the various components of the 
Company’s governance structure. The ﬁndings of these review 
procedures are in the process of being incorporated into the 
Company’s risk management framework and were provided as 
appropriate for discussion at Board level. The Audit Committee  
has reviewed its Terms of Reference, to ensure they reﬂect its 
responsibilities in the context of the review of internal ﬁnancial 
control systems and ﬁnancial risk management systems.
The Audit Committee is also responsible for resolving conﬂicts 
concerning the Directors, including but not limited to potential 
conﬂicts arising from personal investment activities, other 
professional activities (such as directorships with third parties) 
and related party transactions involving any Director or  
senior executive.
The Audit Committee oversees the relationship with the external 
auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , who were appointed  
auditors in connection with the Acquisition. When considering  
the reappointment of the Company’s external auditors before 
making a recommendation to the Board to be put to shareholders,  
the Committee reviewed and monitored the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the  
audit process. Accordingly, the Committee recommends the 
reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP at the  
forthcoming AGM.
The Audit Committee monitors and approves the provision of 
non-audit services by the Company’s external auditors. The 
provision of non-audit services is generally limited to services  
that are closely connected to the external audit or to projects  
that require a detailed understanding of the Group. Details of fees 
payable for audit and non-audit services are set out at page 98  
of this Annual Report (in Note 6 to the Financial Statements). 
The level of non-audit fees for 2011 reﬂects the services and advice 
provided, including as Reporting Accountant, in connection with 
the large number of one-off transactions in the period, including 
the Vallares IPO, Standard Listing, and Acquisition undertaken by 
the Company in its ﬁrst year of operation. In both circumstances, 
the auditors were determined to be the appropriate advisers for 
the Company to engage given the scale and complexity of the 
work involved. As part of the audit assurance process, the 
Company’s auditors provide appropriate conﬁrmations on 
independence and objectivity, irrespective of any non-audit 
services they provide although the Audit Committee will  
keep this under review to ensure that their role as auditor  
is not compromised. 61

Meetings to 3 April 2012

The objectives of the Nomination Committee are:
 to assist with the maintenance of a high quality Board, by:
 — reviewing the structure, size and composition of the  
Board, in the context of the Company’s strategic, operational 
and commercial requirements,
 — identifying and nominating suitably qualiﬁed candidates  
for the approval of the Board, in accordance with criteria  
and processes approved by the Board, 
 — annually reviewing the time required from Non-Executive 
Directors, and putting in place plans for succession for 
Directors and senior executives;
 to make recommendations to the Board concerning:
 — the re-election of Directors by Shareholders in  
accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
 — the retirement of Directors in accordance with the 
Company’s Articles of Association,
 — the appointment of any Director to executive or other  
ofﬁce, and
 — any matters relating to the continuation, suspension  
or termination of service of Directors; and
 to ensure the quality of the Company’s reporting and disclosure 
in relation to executive recruitment matters.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for assisting the Board  
in determining the composition and make-up of the Board. It is also 
responsible for periodically reviewing the Board’s structure and  62

identifying potential candidates to be appointed as Directors, as  
the need may arise. The Nomination Committee will also determine 
succession plans for both Directors and senior executives, in 
particular the Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , and reviews 
annually the time required from Non-Executive Directors. 
The Nomination Committee assists the Board in ensuring that the 
Board consists of high-calibre individuals whose background, skills, 
experience and personal characteristics will augment the present 
Board and meet its future needs and diversity aspirations.
When performing its duties, the Nomination Committee is  
required by its Terms of Reference to make use of open advertising 
or external advisory services, to consider candidates from a wide 
range of backgrounds, and to consider candidates on merit and 
against objective criteria and with due regard for the beneﬁts  
of diversity on the Board.
The members of the Nomination Committee are Rodney Chase  
(as chairman), Mehmet Ög ˘ütçü and George Rose. 
The Nomination Committee is normally required to meet twice a 
year and whenever necessary to fulﬁl its responsibilities. Since the 
Completion of the Acquisition and the formation of the Nomination 
Committee on 21 November 2011, the Nomination Committee has 
met once at which meeting all members were present.
Prior to 21 November 2011, the selection process for Board 
appointments was performed as part of the Acquisition process. 
External recruitment consultants were not used for this purpose  
as the Board was able to recruit suitable candidates on its own.  
The Board considers that each Director has the knowledge and 
experience to make a valuable contribution to the Company’s 
ongoing success. The Board is committed to transparency in 
determining Board membership and in assessing the performance 
of Directors. As ﬁve out of eleven Directors were appointed  
on 21 November 2011, the Board is of the view that a meaningful 
evaluation of the Board, Committees and Directors cannot yet  
take place, and should only take place once the Board has worked 
together for a full year . The evaluation policy will therefore be 
developed and implemented in 2012. The Chairman, who is also 
Chairman of the Nomination Committee, will have responsibility  
for managing the review process, but feedback on the Chairman’s 
performance will be provided to him by the Senior Independent 
Director . Going forward, the Committee will take the lead in 
identifying and nominating candidates for Board appointments to 
ensure that the composition of the Board retains an appropriate 
balance of the skills and experience required for the Company’s 
business and operations.
Forward-looking agenda items for the Nomination Committee  
to consider in 2012 include a discussion on succession planning,  
a review of the size, structure and composition of the Board, and  
a review of the independence of the Non-Executive Directors.
Under its Terms of Reference, the Nomination Committee must 
circulate minutes to all members of the Board following each 
Committee meeting, and the Committee Chairman must report 
more fully to the Board if the Board so requests.

 to assist the Company in maintaining its relationships with  
the communities in which it operates, including through  
social investment and development activities;
 to assist the Board and other Committees in assessing  
HSSE risks, in determining, implementing and reviewing  
the Company’s HSSE strategy and processes; and
 to ensure the quality of the Company’s reporting and 
disclosure (both internally and to shareholders) in relation  
to HSSE matters.
The Directors recognise that good management includes a  
strong moral and social commitment to all health, safety and 
environmental matters. The Company’s health, safety and 
environment management system deﬁnes the Company’s approach 
to managing its standards across all of its facilities and activities. 
The system provides practical guidance and procedures for all staff 
conducting operations or managing sites to achieve health, safety 
and environment objectives as an integrated part of the Company’s 
overall goals.
The Company is committed to ensuring environmental and social 
sustainability, in line with the Oil and Gas Law of the Kurdistan  63

Region (22/2007) and international and recognised best practice. 
The Company has developed an internal HSSE Policy that reﬂects 
international best practice, including but not limited to, the  
IFC Performance Standard and the ICMM Sustainable  
Development Framework.
The HSSE Committee is responsible for developing and regularly 
reviewing the HSSE Policy, including examining whether the HSSE 
Policy reﬂects the Company’s current priorities, plans and targets 
and whether asset integrity, major hazard risk management and 
other health, safety and environmental management systems  
have been effectively reported to the Board. Operational managers 
responsible for the implementation of the HSSE Policy on site 
report upon request to the HSSE Committee. 
The members of the HSSE Committee are Sir Graham Hearne  
(as chairman), Rodney Chase and Mehmet Ög ˘ütçü.
The HSSE Committee is normally required to meet four times a 
year . Given that the Completion of the Acquisition, the formation  
of the HSSE Committee and the adoption of the HSSE Policy only 
occurred on 21 November 2011, the HSSE Committee has only met 
once in the period up until 2 April 2012 at which all members were 
present. The HSSE Committee will continue to review and develop  
the HSSE Policy and the Company’s other health, safety and 
environmental systems as appropriate.
Under its Terms of Reference, the HSSE Committee must circulate 
minutes to all members of the Board following each Committee 
meeting, and the Committee chairman must report more fully  
to the Board if the Board so requests. 64

Directors’ 
Remuneration Report
Jim Leng, Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee 
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee,  

Remuneration Report of Genel Energy plc. 
In November 2011, the merger of Vallares PLC and Genel Energy 
International Ltd to form Genel Energy plc was completed. At that time, 
the Remuneration Committee started work to develop an executive 
remuneration policy to reﬂect the ambitions and objectives of the 
Company for its shareholders and to reward the executive team in 
delivering these. 
We believe it is appropriate to have in place a remuneration framework 
which is tied to the delivery of shareholder value over an extended period 
of time. Accordingly, a signiﬁcant portion of total remuneration (over 
two-thirds for maximum performance) is in the form of performance-
related pay which will only be earned if stretching performance targets 
have been delivered. 
It is the intention of your Company to put in place a long-term  
share plan for Executive Directors. This plan will complement the two 
existing share plans which are already in place for the Company’s key 
executives below Board level. 
Awards under this long-term share plan, the Performance Share Plan 
(“PSP”), will only be earned dependent on the Company’s Total 
Shareholder Return (“TSR”) against its peers. Its main features are 
described in greater detail on page 68 and in the accompanying Notice  
of the 2012 Annual General Meeting of the Company.
We believe that the PSP will appropriately and directly link total 
remuneration to the delivery of long-term value to our shareholders. In 
line with our commitment to high standards of performance, the PSP also 
incorporates features that include a three-year retention period for any 
vested shares and the inclusion of “malus” provisions enabling the 
Committee to reduce or cancel awards in certain circumstances.
Although not a necessity of the Listing Rules, in keeping with the 
Company’s objective to adhere to the highest standards of corporate 
governance the Remuneration Committee has decided to seek the 
approval of Shareholders for the PSP , which as I have said will be the only 
long-term incentive for your Executive Directors, at the AGM in May 2012. 
We will also be seeking your approval of this report at the AGM, at which  
I will be available together with the rest of your Board to answer your 
questions on the Group’s executive remuneration policy and the 
Remuneration Committee’s activities. 
On behalf of the Committee I welcome any feedback you may have and 
look forward to receiving your support. 65

Annual Report 
2011
 
 This report sets out the policy and relevant disclosures  
in relation to Directors’ remuneration. This report will be  
subject to an advisory vote at the AGM on 22 May 2012.  
The report has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
 and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008  
(the “Regulations”). The report further meets the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules, and the principles and 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
We have provided information on the remuneration policy for  
Genel Energy plc for the period since the Company’s Standard 
Listing on 21 November 2011. It is the Committee’s intention that 
this policy, designed to support our business strategy, will continue 
to apply going forward into 2012 and beyond. In addition, and as 
required by the Regulations, the report sets out information  
with regard to the remuneration of Directors during the period  
from Vallares PLC’s establishment up to the Completion of the 
Acquisition on 21 November 2011, under legacy arrangements.  
Furthermore, the report has been divided into two sections  
for audited and unaudited information. The first section,  
which is not required to be audited, sets out the role of the 
Remuneration Committee and our remuneration policy for 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors going forward. The 
second section, which has been audited in accordance with  
the Regulations, contains details of the Directors’ emoluments 
during the period to 31 December 2011.  
Unaudited Information 
Remuneration Committee membership  
and Terms of Reference 
The Remuneration Committee was established by the  
Board with effect from 21 November 2011 and all of the current 
members, which are shown in the table below, were appointed  
at that time. All of the members of the Committee are 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Name  Role 
Jim Leng  Chairman 
Sir Graham Hearne   Member  
Mark Parris  Member 
The Committee has taken part in several meetings  
to develop the remuneration arrangements for Executive 
Directors and approved the framework and individual 
remuneration components since the completion of  
the Acquisition.  
The Committee has adopted clearly defined Terms of Reference 
which are available on our website (www.genelenergy.com).  
Under its Terms of Reference, the Committee’s main 
responsibility is to determine the remuneration framework

all aspects of any share incentive plans.  
The Chairman of the Board and Executive Directors  
determine the fees and overall remuneration for the  
Non-Executive Directors.  
Advisors to the Committee

Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”), to provide advice on remuneration 
matters under consideration by the Committee. Deloitte is a 
member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and provides 
services in line with the code of conduct in relation to  
executive remuneration consulting in the UK.  
During the period, Deloitte also provided minimal VAT related 
services to the Company.

Officer and the Chief Financial Officer to attend its  
meetings. Their input excluded any matters relating to  
their own remuneration.

Directors’  
Remuneration 
Report continued 
 Remuneration policy and principles 
The remuneration policy is designed to reflect the strategic 
objectives of the Company and reward the executive team for 
the delivery of shareholder value over an extended period of 
time. In addition, the remuneration policy has been designed to 
be clear and readily understood by executives and shareholders 
and transparent in all its aspects.  
Within these guiding principles, during the year, the 
Remuneration Committee worked to develop an executive 
remuneration framework which:  
• Supports the business strategy, its delivery, and enables the 
Company to drive value creation;  
• Follows the highest standards of UK corporate governance;  
• Provides total remuneration levels that are positioned 
competitively when compared to wider market practice in  
UK companies of a similar size;  
• Sets base salaries at a level that is appropriate for the 
Company given its nature, operations and the industry in 
which it operates; and 
• Provides an all-inclusive simple cash allowance in lieu of all 
benefits including pension.  
• Delivers an appropriate balance between fixed and  
variable remuneration with a significant weighting towards 
performance-related elements to reward the delivery of 
strong performance and value creation. The performance 
measures used under the incentive plans will be regularly 
reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate and do not 
encourage excessive risk taking.  
• Ensures that the interests of Executive Directors are  
aligned with those of long-term shareholders through the 
requirement to hold vested shares under the PSP for three 
years following vesting.  
The Committee is mindful of its responsibility to consider pay 
and conditions elsewhere in the Group when setting levels of  
pay for Executive Directors. As such, the Committee has 
reviewed the remuneration framework in place for employees 
below the Board, in both the UK and Turkey, and is satisfied  
that this framework is appropriate, competitive and in line with 
the Company’s strategic goals. The Committee will continue  
to consider pay and conditions for employees throughout  
the Group going forward and bear this in mind in its decision 
making process for Executive Director remuneration.

 Balance between fixed and variable pay 
The chart below illustrates the balance between fixed and 
variable components of the remuneration package for Executive 
Directors at both “target” and “maximum” performance: 
 
*  Fixed remuneration includes salary and benefits allowance. Variable remuneration 
includes annual bonus and the PSP.  
 
• Target performance is based on an annual bonus at target 
levels and an assumption that 30% of the maximum PSP 
award will vest. 
• Maximum performance is based on a maximum annual bonus 
of 150% of base salary and an assumption that the PSP will 
vest in full. 
Base salary 
As a general policy, the salaries of the Executive Directors are 
set at a level that is appropriate against market practice at other 
UK listed companies of a similar size as well as other relevant  
UK Oil & Gas companies. In setting salaries, the Committee also 
takes into account the individual’s skills, level of experience  
and criticality to the business, and the complexity of the role.  
Following a benchmarking exercise undertaken during the  
year, the Remuneration Committee has decided that with effect 
from 21 November 2011 the Executive Directors’ salaries are  
as follows: 
Name  Position
2012 base 
salary
Tony Hayward  CEO £650,000
Julian Metherell  CFO £450,000
Going forward, the Committee will review salaries on an annual 
basis, with the first review taking place in January 2013.  
Benefits – cash supplement 
In line with the Committee’s aim to provide a simple, transparent 
package, Executive Directors receive an additional payment of  
25% of salary in lieu of all benefits, including pension, private 
health insurance, life assurance and company car provision. 
Directors do not receive pension contributions from the Company.  
The level of the cash supplement with effect from  
21 November 2011 is as follows: 
Name Position
2012 cash 
supplement
Tony Hayward  CEO £162,500
Julian Metherell  CFO £112,500
This supplement will not be taken into account when determining 
annual bonus or long-term incentive quantum.  
Short term incentives – annual bonus 
The annual bonus is designed to reward Executive Directors for 
the delivery of strong performance against stated performance 
objectives during the year.  
The target bonus for both Executive Directors for 2012 is  
100% of base salary, with a maximum opportunity of 150%  
of base salary.  
The bonus will be determined by the Remuneration Committee, 
taking into account targets set at the beginning of the year.  
For 2012, the performance of each Executive Director will be 
measured against four key areas as shown in the following chart: 
 
The Remuneration Committee will keep the performance 
conditions that will apply in future years and their relative 
weighting under review.  
Any bonus awarded by the Committee will be paid wholly  
in cash following the approval of the audited accounts. 
The effective commencement date of the annual bonus plan  
is 1 January 2012. No bonuses will be payable in respect of the 
period to 31 December 2011.

Report continued 
 Long-term incentives 
During the year, the Committee put in place three long-term 
share plans designed to enable the Company to link reward for 
its key people to the delivery of long-term value creation for  
its shareholders.  
Two of these plans, the Share Option Plan and the Restricted 
Share Plan, will only be used to reward and incentivise key 
executives below Board level and will not be made available to 
Executive Directors. Subject to receiving shareholder approval 
at the forthcoming AGM, the third of these share plans, the 
Performance Share Plan, will be the long-term incentive plan 
under which Executive Directors will receive awards.  
More detail on each of these plans is provided below.  
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)  
Under the PSP, conditional awards will be granted and shares are 
only earned if the relevant performance conditions are satisfied.  
It is intended that initial awards to the Executive Directors in 
respect of 2012 will be granted in the form of nil-cost options  
as soon as practicable following the approval of the PSP by 
shareholders. Initial awards will be based on a face value of 150%  
of base salary for the CEO and 140% of base salary for the CFO. 
The rules of the PSP provide for a maximum award level in any 
financial year of 200% of base salary, although in exceptional 
circumstances awards of up to 300% of salary may be made.  
Shares are only earned if the performance conditions are met and 
the individual remains in employment for the duration of the three 
year performance period. Any vested shares will then be subject  
to a further three year retention period by the Executive Director.  
The Committee has decided that, for the initial 2012 PSP awards,  
it will measure the performance of the Company against that of its 
sectoral peers using a relative TSR measure to ensure that the PSP 
will only pay out if the Company outperforms the median of these 
peers. The Committee considers that relative TSR is the most 
appropriate measure to create maximum alignment with 
shareholders and encourage long-term value creation.  
The Committee has selected a comparator group that consists  
of companies that are comparable to Genel Energy in terms of 
business mix, size and scope, geographical spread and share  
price volatility.  
For the initial award of shares to be made in 2012, this peer group 
comprises the following constituents of the FTSE 350 Oil and Gas 
Producers Index: 
Afren Essar Energy Royal Dutch Shell 
BG Group Exillon Energy  Salamander Energy 
BP Heritage Oil SOCO International 
Cairn Energy Ophir Energy  Tullow Oil 
EnQuest  Premier Oil  
Awards will vest according to the following schedule: 
TSR ranking of the Company 
Proportion of 
award vesting
Below median 0%
Median 30%
Between median and upper quartile Straight line basis
Upper quartile 100%
Awards may be reduced or cancelled prior to vesting when  
the Committee deems such action is appropriate including: 
• A material misstatement of audited results 
• A material failure of risk management 
• A material breach of applicable health and safety regulations 
• Serious reputational damage to the Group as a result of the 
participant’s misconduct or otherwise. 
Performance graph 
The following graph shows the Company’s TSR since trading of 
Genel Energy plc’s shares began on the London Stock Exchange on 
21 November 2011 against the FTSE 350 Oil & Gas Producers Index. 
The Committee believes that the FTSE 350 Oil & Gas Producers 
Index is the most appropriate Index as its constituents comprise  
the peer group for performance measurement under the PSP and 
Genel Energy is expected to become a constituent of the Index 
upon obtaining a premium listing. 
Other discretionary share plans  
Share Option Plan (“SOP”)  
The SOP will be used to grant discretionary awards of market 
value options to below board employees. It is not intended that 
options will be granted under the SOP to Executive Directors.  
Initial awards were granted to executive committee  
members, other members of senior management and certain  
key employees in December 2011. These awards vest after  
three years subject to continued employment.  
Any awards vesting under the SOP to executive committee 
members will be subject to a further retention period  
following vesting.

Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
 
 Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”)  
The RSP is an additional share plan under which one-off awards of free shares can be made to employees below Board level. 
Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in this plan.  
Awards granted will usually vest progressively over a three year period, subject to continued employment.  
Initial one-off awards were granted in December 2011 to key below Board employees following the Completion of the Acquisition. 
Going forward, the RSP will be used primarily, although not exclusively, to make awards to individuals joining the group, having 
foregone benefits or other incentives with a previous employer.  
Service contracts 
Executive Directors have 12 month rolling service agreements. Any termination payment in lieu of notice is capped at a sum equal to  
(i) 12 months’ basic salary, (ii) the Executive Director’s annual benefit allowance, and (iii) subject to performance conditions being met,  
pro-rated annual bonus up to the date of termination. The Executive Director may, in such circumstances, have a duty to mitigate, and 
shall use reasonable endeavours to secure alternative employment as soon as reasonably practicable. Any entitlement which an Executive 
has or may have under any share related incentive scheme shall be determined in accordance with the rules of such scheme. The service 
contract of an Executive Director may also be terminated immediately and with no liability to make payment in certain circumstances, 
such as the Executive Director bringing the Group into disrepute or committing a fundamental breach of his employment obligations.  
Executive Directors may accept only one position as a non-executive director (but not as chairman) of another publicly listed company that is 
not a competitor of the Company, subject to consultation with the Chairman of the Company and the subsequent prior approval of the Board.  
In line with this policy, Tony Hayward serves as the senior independent non-executive director of Glencore International plc for 
which he receives and retains fees of £158,800 per annum, and Julian Metherell is a non-executive director of GASLOG LNG 
Shipping for which he receives and retains fees of $140,000 per annum.

 Non-Executive Directors’ Share Matching Awards  
The Chairman and the Independent Non-Executive Directors serving prior to the Vallares PLC IPO (together, “Participating  
Non-Executive Directors”) subscribed for ordinary shares at the placing price of £10 per share as part of the IPO. They all elected  
to use a combination of their own funds and all of their director fees from Vallares PLC in respect of the first two years of 
appointment to pay the subscription price of these shares.  
On subscription for these shares, each Participating Non-Executive Director became eligible to subscribe for three Matching Shares for 
every ordinary share acquired at that time, subject to vesting conditions, up to a maximum of 60,000 shares (90,000 shares in the case  
of the Chairman). The subscription price which the Participating Non-Executive Directors must pay for each Matching Share following 
vesting is the nominal value of each share (£0.10 per share). The Matching Shares will vest in two tranches. 
Following the completion of the Acquisition in November 2011, each Participating Non-Executive Director became entitled to 
exercise his right to subscribe for one-third of his Matching Shares. Subsequently, each participating Non-Executive Director 
exercised his right to subscribe for these shares on 2 April 2012. The remaining two-thirds of these Matching Shares will become 
exercisable from the first anniversary of each Participating Non-Executive Director appointment. 
The interests of the Participating Non-Executive Directors in Share Matching Awards are set out below.

In view of the fact that the Participating Non-Executive Directors elected to use all of their fee in respect of the first two years  
of appointment to subscribe for ordinary shares at the placing price, they will therefore not be eligible to receive a basic fee until 
the second anniversary of their appointment.  
Non-Executive Directors will still be eligible to receive additional Committee chairmanship fees, where applicable, in cash. The 
Chairman of the Board will receive in cash the difference between the current fee of £225,000 per annum and the previous fee  
of £150,000 per annum. Should their directorships terminate within 21 months of their appointment, they will be required to repay 
any fees advanced which exceed the aggregate fees they were entitled to for the period of their appointment.  
Directors’ interests in shares 
Details of directors’ interests in shares, including the Founder Shares and Founder Securities acquired by Tony Hayward, Julian Metherell 
and Nathaniel Rothschild by reason of their status as Founders of the Company, are provided on pages 72 and 73.

 Founder Shares and Founder Securities 
Founder Shares 
Prior to the Standard Listing of Genel Energy plc, the Founders (including Tony Hayward, Julian Metherell and Nathaniel Rothschild) 
were issued B Shares in the Company’s subsidiary, Vallares Holding Company Limited, known as Founder Shares. These Founder 
Shares were put in place to reward the Founders for their initial capital commitment to the Company and for the completion of a 
suitable acquisition through exchange of such Founder Shares, within 6 months of completion of an acquisition, for 6.67% of the 
fully diluted Ordinary Shares of the Company. Alternatively, the Company had the option of purchasing the Founder Shares for an 
equivalent amount of cash. The investment by the Founders was risk capital and the Founders stood to suffer a loss of up to £20 
million if a successful acquisition had not been executed. These Founder Shares have been treated as equity-settled share-based 
payments and are deemed to have vested immediately on the grant date as no performance conditions were attached to them. 
Following Completion of the Acquisition in November 2011, all of the Founder Shares were exchanged for Ordinary Shares in  
Genel Energy plc on 20 January 2012.  
Founder Securities 
In addition to the Founder Shares, prior to Placing Admission, the Founders were also issued C shares in Vallares Holding Company 
Limited, known as Founder Securities.  
These Founder Securities were put in place to reward the Founders for growing the Company following an acquisition (so as  
to maximise value for holders of Ordinary Shares) by entitling the Founders to a share of the upside in the Company’s value once 
certain performance conditions have been satisfied. The performance conditions are summarised below. 
If within four years of Completion of the Acquisition the closing price per Ordinary Share reaches for the period of any 20 trading days  
out of 30 successive days the higher of: 
• a compound rate of return from Completion of the Acquisition of 8.50% on the share from the Admission value of £10 and from 
date of the Acquisition; or 
• an increase of 25% of the issue price from the Admission value of £10, adjusted for any matters which have an impact on the 
capital structure of the Company,  
the Founders have the right to exchange their Founder Securities for Ordinary Shares in the Company to a value of 15% of  
the increase in value from the Placing Admission value of £10. The Company has the option to settle by issuing shares or the 
equivalent in cash.  
The Founder Securities were deemed to have vested immediately as no performance conditions exist in relation to their vesting. 
However, there are performance conditions which need to be met prior to exchanging the Founder Securities for Ordinary Shares. 
The Interests of the Founders in the Founder Shares and the Founder Securities as at 31 December 2011 are set out  
in the table below:

1. Following the year end, Nathaniel Rothschild’s interests in Founder Shares reduced to 7,866,108 and his interests in Founder Securities reduced to 5,313,825. Both changes 
were effective on 5 January 2012. Subsequently, all the Founder Shares held by Tony Hayward, Julian Metherell and Nathaniel Rothschild were exchanged for Ordinary Shares 
in Genel Energy plc. As part of this exchange, the Company issued 18,713,154 Ordinary Shares equivalent to a combined total of 6.67% of the fully diluted Ordinary Share  
capital of the Company (assuming vesting and issue of shares under all outstanding options) to Vallares Capital GP Limited on 20 January 2012. No other changes to directors’ 
interests in Founder Shares and Founder Securities took place between 31 December 2011 and 2 April 2012.  
2. In addition, the Sellers (i.e. Genel Holding, Focus Investments and PRM) held 3,000,000 Founder Securities as of 31 December 2011, representing 30% of the issued Founder 
Securities. If the market price of the Ordinary Shares exceeds £20 per share for 20 trading days out of any 30 successive trading days, the aggregate interests of the Sellers in 
the Founder Securities will be increased from 30% to 40% and the interests of the other persons interested in Founder Securities will be reduced accordingly. 
3. The Founders have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of any Ordinary Shares or Founder Securities held by them directly or indirectly, for a 
period of 365 days after the completion of the Acquisition. These restrictions are subject to exceptions for, among others, transfers to Vallares Capital LP, limited partners of 
Vallares Capital LP, any of the Founders, any person who becomes an Active Partner or an Active Member (each as defined in the IPO Prospectus), a family member or family 
trust of any such persons, or upon the enforcement of security over such shares described in the IPO Prospectus.  74

Rights Attaching to the Suspended Voting  
Ordinary Shares 
Except as set out below, the Suspended Voting Ordinary  
Shares rank pari passu with the Voting Ordinary Shares  
(and any other suspended voting ordinary shares issued on 
substantially equivalent terms to the Suspended Voting  
Ordinary Shares) in all respects and no action may be taken  
by the Company in relation to, or offer made by the Company  
to the holders of, the Voting Ordinary Shares (or any other 
suspended voting ordinary shares issued on substantially 
equivalent terms to the Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares) 
unless the same action is taken in respect of, or the same  
offer is made to the holders of, the Suspended Voting  
Ordinary Shares. 
(a) Voting at General Meetings 
A holder of Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares shall be entitled 
to receive notice of, and to attend and speak at, any general 
meeting of the Company, but shall not be entitled to vote in 
respect of any Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares held, except 
on any resolution: 
(i) proposed by any person other than a Seller or any of its 
Affiliates or any person acting in concert with a Seller or  
any of its Affiliates, to wind up the Company or to present  
a petition to wind up the Company, other than for the 
purposes of a reconstruction or amalgamation  
whilst solvent; 
(ii) proposed by any person other than a Seller or any of its 
Affiliates or any person acting in concert with a Seller or any 
of its Affiliates, to appoint an administrator or to present a 
petition for the appointment of an administrator in relation 
to the Company, or to approve any arrangement with the 
Company’s creditors; 
(iii) proposed by the Board for the purposes of, or in connection 
with, any scheme of arrangement of the Company under  
the Jersey Companies Law (or its equivalent in any other 
jurisdiction) under which a body corporate (“Newco”) will 
acquire the Company and the holdings of the members of 
Newco following the scheme becoming effective will be 
substantially the same as the holdings of the members of 
the Company immediately before the scheme becoming 
effective; or 
(iv) proposed by any person other than a Seller or any of its 
Affiliates or any person acting in concert with a Seller or  
any of its Affiliates, in accordance with the Articles of 
Association, to vary, modify or abrogate any of the class 
rights attaching to the Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares,  
in which case each holder of Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares 
on a show of hands shall have one vote, and on a poll shall be 
entitled to vote on the resolution on the basis of one vote for 
each Suspended Voting Ordinary Share held. For the purposes  
of any resolution of a type referred to in paragraphs (i) to (iii) 
above, the Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares shall be treated 
for all purposes as being of the same class as the Voting 
Ordinary Shares (and any other suspended voting ordinary 
shares issued on substantially equivalent terms to the 
Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares) and no separate meeting  
or resolution of the holders of the Suspended Voting Ordinary 
Shares shall be required to be convened or passed. 
The rights attaching to the Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares 
shall not be, and shall not be deemed to be, varied or abrogated 
in any way by the creation, allotment or issue of any Voting 
Ordinary Shares and the rights attaching to the Voting Ordinary 
Shares shall not be, and shall not be deemed to be, varied or 
abrogated in any way by the creation, allotment or issue of  
any Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares. 
(b) Conversion 
Upon a transfer of Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares by any 
person to a person who is not a Seller or an Affiliate of any  76
Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
Other statutory and regulatory  
information continued 
 
Seller, such Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares shall  
convert into Voting Ordinary Shares (on a one-for-one basis) 
automatically upon, and contemporaneously with, registration 
by the Company (or its Registrars) of the transfer in the register 
of members of the Company. 
Upon: 
(i) a transfer of Voting Ordinary Shares to a person who is not 
a Seller or an Affiliate of any Seller; or  
(ii) any issue of further shares by the Company or conversion of 
Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares as referred to below, as 
a result of which the Sellers’ Voting Shareholding is reduced 
below the Maximum Voting Percentage,  
such number of Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares as, immediately 
following conversion, will result in the Sellers’ Voting Shareholding 
being equal to the Maximum Voting Percentage, shall convert into 
Voting Ordinary Shares (on a one-for-one basis) automatically 
upon, and contemporaneously with, registration by the Company 
(or its Registrars) of the transfer in the register of members of  
the Company or the issue of such further Shares or conversion  
of such Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares. In any such case, a 
proportionate number of each holder’s holding of Suspended 
Voting Ordinary Shares at the time of such transfer or issue or 
immediately following such conversion (other than any holder 
holding such Shares as an escrow agent pursuant to the terms of 
an agreement to which the Company and the Sellers, among others, 
are party, unless such person is the only holder of Suspended 
Voting Ordinary Shares) shall be so converted (in each case 
rounded up or down to the nearest whole number as determined  
by any Director in his absolute discretion). 
(c) Conversion at the instance of a Seller  
(or any Affiliate) 
At any time, a Seller (or any of its Affiliates) shall be entitled 
(but shall not be bound) to require the Company to convert 
Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares held by such Seller (or such 
Affiliate) into Voting Ordinary Shares, on a one-for-one basis,  
so long as such conversion does not result in the Sellers’ Voting 
Shareholding being more than the Maximum Voting Percentage. 
(d) Conversion following a pre-emptive offer 
If the Company makes an offer of Suspended Voting Ordinary 
Shares in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of 
Association, it shall be entitled to convert into Voting Ordinary 
Shares, on a one for-one basis, any Suspended Voting Ordinary 
Shares issued to persons other than the Sellers or any of their 
respective Affiliates in connection with such offer. 
(e) General 
The Company shall use best endeavours to procure that the Voting 
Ordinary Shares arising on conversion of the Suspended Voting 
Ordinary Shares are admitted to the Official List and to trading on 
the London Stock Exchange’s market for listed securities. 
No admission to listing or admission to trading shall be sought 
for the Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares whilst they remain 
Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares. 
Employee share schemes 
Details of the Company’s employee share schemes are set  
out at pages 68 and 69 of this Annual Report. 
Articles of Association of the Company 
Under the Jersey Companies Law, the capacity of a  
Jersey company is not limited by anything contained in its 
memorandum or Articles of Association. Accordingly, the 
memorandum of association of a Jersey company does not 
contain an objects clause. The Articles of Association of the 
Company, incorporating all of the amendments proposed to be 
adopted by shareholder resolution at the forthcoming AGM, are 
available for inspection at the registered office of the Company 
during business hours on any day (except Saturday, Sunday and 
public holidays) until the date of the forthcoming AGM. For 
details of the material proposed amendments to the Articles  
of Association, please see the Notice of AGM. 
Certain provisions have been incorporated into the Articles  
of Association to enshrine rights that are not conferred by  
the Jersey Companies Law, but which the Company believes 
shareholders would expect to see in a company listed on the 
London Stock Exchange. 
Provisions in the Articles of Association also require 
shareholders to make disclosures pursuant to Chapter 5 of the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules, and require the Directors to 
comply with Chapter 3 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
and themselves to require any persons discharging managerial 
responsibilities (within the meaning ascribed in the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules) in relation to the Company who  
are not Directors to do so, and to use reasonable endeavours  
to procure that their own and such persons’ connected  
persons do so. 
The Articles of Association contain (among other things) 
provisions to the following effect. 
(a) Voting Rights 
Subject to disenfranchisement in the event of non-payment  
of any sum due and payable in respect of a share or as provided 
in (d) below and subject to any special terms as to voting on 
which any shares may be issued (no such shares currently  
being in issue), on a show of hands every member present in 
person (or, being a corporation, present by a duly authorised 
representative) or by proxy shall have one vote and on a poll 
every member present in person or by proxy shall have one  
vote for each share of which he is the holder. 
Except in the case of the Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares,  
the Company’s major Shareholders do not have different  
Voting Rights.  77
Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
(b) Transfer of shares 
The Ordinary Shares are in registered form and are capable  
of being held in uncertificated form. 
A member may transfer all or any of his uncertificated shares  
in CREST. The Board may, in its absolute discretion, refuse to 
register any transfer of an uncertificated share where permitted 
to do so by applicable law, including the Jersey Companies Law 
and the Jersey CREST Order. 
All transfers of certificated shares must be effected by a 
transfer in writing in any usual form or any other form approved 
by the Directors. The instrument of transfer shall be executed by 
or on behalf of the transferor and (except in the case of fully 
paid shares) by or on behalf of the transferee. 
The Directors may, in their absolute discretion, refuse to 
register any instrument of transfer of a certificated share:  
(i) which is not fully paid up (but, in the case of a class of shares 
which has been admitted to the Official List, such discretion may 
not be exercised in such a way as to prevent dealings in those 
shares from taking place on an open and proper basis); or (ii)  
on which the Company has a lien. 
If the Directors refuse to register a transfer of a share they shall,  
as soon as practicable and in any event within two months after  
the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, give to the 
transferor and the transferee notice of the refusal. The Directors 
must also provide the transferee with such further information about 
the reasons for the refusal as the transferee may reasonably request. 
Under the Articles of Association, if the Board becomes aware  
that any shares are owned directly or beneficially by a person in 
circumstances which would or might result in: (a) the Company 
incurring a liability to taxation or suffering any pecuniary, fiscal, 
administrative or regulatory or similar disadvantages in connection 
with the Company being, or being required to register as, an 
‘‘investment company” under the US Investment Company Act; (b) 
the Company losing any offering-related exemptions under the US 
Investment Company Act; or (c) the assets of the Company being 
deemed to be assets of a Plan Investor (in each case, a “Prohibited 
Person”), the Board may give notice to such person requiring such 
person either: (i) to provide the Board within 30 days of receipt of 
such notice with sufficient documentary evidence to satisfy the 
Board that such person is not a Prohibited Person; or (ii) to sell or 
transfer his shares to a person who is not a Prohibited Person 
within 30 days and within such 30 days to provide the Board with 
satisfactory evidence of such sale or transfer. Where condition (i)  
or (ii) is not satisfied within 30 days after the serving of the notice, 
the Board is entitled to arrange for the sale of the relevant shares 
on behalf of the registered holder at the best price reasonably 
obtainable at the relevant time. If the Company cannot effect  
a sale of the relevant shares within five business days of its first 
attempt to do so, the registered holder will be deemed to have 
forfeited his shares. 
If the ownership of shares by an investor will or may result in  
the Company’s assets being deemed to constitute “plan assets” 
under the Plan Asset Regulations, the shares of such investor 
will be deemed to be held in trust by the investor for such 
charitable purposes as the investor may determine (provided 
that the trust beneficiaries may not be Prohibited Persons), and 
the investor shall not have any beneficial interest in the shares. 
(c) Dividends 
Subject to the Jersey Companies Law, the Company in general 
meeting may, by Ordinary Resolution, declare dividends in 
accordance with the respective rights of the members and  
may fix the time for payment of such dividend, provided that no 
dividend shall be payable in excess of the amount recommended 
by the Directors and no dividend shall be declared in excess  
of amounts standing to the credit of the Company’s profit  
and loss account from time to time. 
Subject to the Jersey Companies Law, the Directors may  
pay such interim dividends as appear to them to be justified  
by the financial position of the Company and may also pay  
any dividends payable at a fixed rate at intervals settled by the 
Directors as appear to be justified by the financial position of the 
Company. No dividend or other moneys payable in respect of  
a share shall bear interest as against the Company. 
Any dividend unclaimed for a period of 12 years after having 
become due for payment shall be forfeited and cease to remain 
owing by the Company unless otherwise provided by the rights 
attached to the share.  
(d) Distribution of assets on a winding-up 
Subject to any particular rights or limitations for the time  
being attached to any shares, if the Company is wound up, the 
assets available for distribution among Shareholders shall be 
distributed to the Shareholders pro rata to the number of shares 
held by each member at the time of the commencement of the 
winding-up. If any share is not fully paid up, that share shall only 
carry the right to receive a distribution calculated on the basis 
of the proportion that the amount paid up on that share bears  
to the issue price of that share.  
(e) Changes in share capital 
(i) Subject to the Jersey Companies Law and without prejudice 
 to any rights attached to any existing shares, any share  
may be issued with or have attached to it such preferred, 
deferred or other special rights or restrictions as the Company 
may by Special Resolution determine, or in the absence of  
such determination as the Directors may determine. Without 
prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the Directors may 
authorise the issue of Ordinary Shares for which allotment 
authority has been given, with limited, suspended or no Voting 
Rights. Subject to Jersey Companies Law, the Company may 
issue shares which are, or at the option of the Company or  
the holder are liable, to be redeemed.  78

(ii) The Company may, by altering its memorandum of 
association by Special Resolution, increase its share capital, 
consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into 
shares of larger amount, subdivide its shares or any of  
them into shares of smaller amount or cancel or reduce the 
nominal value of any shares which have not been taken or 
agreed to be taken by any person and diminish the amount 
of its share capital by the amounts so cancelled or the 
amount of the reduction. 
(iii) Whenever the share capital of the Company is divided into 
different classes of shares, the special rights attached to  
any class of shares may, unless otherwise provided by their 
terms of issue, be varied or abrogated with the consent in 
writing of the holders of two thirds in nominal value of the 
issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a Special 
Resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders  
of shares of that class. The quorum at any such separate 
meeting shall be two persons holding or representing at 
least one third in nominal amount of the issued shares of 
that class, or if the meeting is adjourned, any holder or 
holders of the issued shares of that class who is or are 
present in person or by proxy shall be a quorum.   
(f) Directors’ interests 
(i) A Director who is in any way, directly or indirectly, 
interested in a transaction or arrangement with the 
Company shall, at a meeting of the Directors, declare in 
accordance with Article 75 of the Jersey Companies Law  
the nature of his interest. 
(ii) Provided that he has declared his interest in accordance 
with paragraph (i) above, a Director may be a party to or 
otherwise interested in any transaction or arrangement  
with the Company or in which the Company is otherwise 
interested and may be a director or other officer, or 
employed by, or a party to any transaction or arrangement 
with, or otherwise interested in any body corporate 
promoted by the Company or in which the Company is 
otherwise interested. No Director so interested shall be 
accountable to the Company, for any benefit which he 
derives from any such office or employment or from any 
such transaction or arrangement or from any interest in  
any such body corporate and no such transaction or 
arrangement shall be liable to be avoided on the ground  
of any such interest or benefit. 
(iii) A Director may hold any other office or place of profit  
under the Company (other than the office of auditor) in 
conjunction with his office as Director and may act in a 
professional capacity to the Company on such terms as  
to tenure of office, remuneration and otherwise at the 
Directors’ discretion. 
(g) Appointment of Directors 
Unless otherwise determined by Ordinary Resolution, the 
number of Directors shall be not less than two, but shall  
not be subject to any maximum number. Directors may be  
appointed by Ordinary Resolution or by the Board.  
(h) Retirement of Directors 
A Director shall be capable of being appointed or reappointed  
as a Director, and shall not be required to retire, regardless  
of his having attained any particular age. All Directors then  
in office shall retire at each Annual General Meeting of the 
Company but shall be eligible for re-election.  
(i) Borrowing powers 
The Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company to 
borrow money and to mortgage or charge all or any part of its 
undertaking, property and assets and uncalled capital and to 
issue debentures and other securities for any debt, liability  
or obligation of the Company or of any third-party.  
(j) Shareholders’ meetings 
The Board shall convene an Annual General Meeting of the 
Company within such time as may be required by Article 87 of 
the Jersey Companies Law. Thereafter general meetings (which 
are Annual General Meetings) shall be held at least once in each 
subsequent calendar year within seven months of the end of 
each financial year of the Company. The Board may call general 
meetings whenever it thinks fit or on the requisition of members 
pursuant to the provisions of the Jersey Companies Law and  
the Articles of Association. 
An Annual General Meeting and general meetings shall be  
called by at least 14 clear days’ notice. Subject to any other 
restrictions, every notice of meeting shall be given to all the 
members (other than any who, under the provisions of the 
Articles of Association, are at the date of the notice not  
entitled to receive such notices from the Company) and  
to the Directors and Auditors. 
Every notice of meeting shall specify the place, the day and  
the time of the meeting and the general nature of the business 
to be transacted and, in the case of an Annual General Meeting, 
shall specify the meeting as such.  
All general meetings shall be held in such place outside the 
United Kingdom as may be determined by the Board. It is the 
Board’s current intention that general meetings will be held  
in Jersey. The requisite quorum for general meetings of the 
Company shall be two qualifying persons.  
(k) Authority to allot securities and disapplication  
of pre-emption rights 
The Company may, subject to the provisions contained in  
the Articles of Association relating to the disapplication of  
the pre-emption rights from time to time pass an Ordinary 
Resolution authorising the Directors to exercise all the powers  79
Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
of the Company to allot relevant securities up to the nominal 
amount specified in the Ordinary Resolution. The Ordinary 
Resolution may provide that a proportion of the amount so 
authorised is to be used only for the allotment of equity 
securities in connection with rights issues. The authority, if  
not previously revoked, shall expire on the day specified in the 
resolution, not being more than five years after the date on 
which the resolution is passed. 
For these purposes, all shares in the Company (other than 
subscriber shares, or shares allotted pursuant to an employee 
share scheme) are “relevant securities”, as are all rights  
to subscribe for, or to convert any security into, shares in  
the Company.  
“Equity securities” to be paid up in cash must be offered to 
existing Shareholders pro rata to their holdings of Ordinary 
Share capital of the Company except that, on the passing of a 
Special Resolution, the Directors shall have power to allot equity 
securities for cash without regard to that restriction. Equity 
securities to be paid up otherwise than in cash are not subject  
to any such restriction. Notwithstanding the general restriction 
on allotments of equity securities for cash, the Company has,  
by written Shareholder resolution passed on 16 June 2011, 
authorised the Directors to make allotments otherwise than  
on a pre-emptive basis in the circumstances described above. 
For these purposes, all shares in the Company are “equity 
securities”, as are all rights to subscribe for, or to convert any 
security into, shares in the company, save that the following  
are not “equity securities”: (a) a subscriber share or bonus 
share; (b) a share which, as respects dividends and capital, 
carries a right to participate only up to a specified amount  
in a distribution; and (c) a share which is held by a person who 
acquired it in pursuance of an employee share scheme or, in the 
case of a share which has not been allotted, is to be allotted in 
pursuance of such a scheme or, in the case of a share held by 
the Company as a treasury share, is to be transferred in 
pursuance of such scheme.  
(l) Website communication with shareholders 
The Articles of Association enable the Company to use its 
website as a means of sending or supplying documents or 
information to members. Before communicating with a member 
by means of its website, the Company must have asked the 
member, individually, to agree (generally or specifically) that  
the Company may send or supply documents or information to 
him by means of a website. A member shall be deemed to have 
agreed that the Company may send or supply a document or 
information to him by means of a website if no response 
indicating a refusal of the request is received within 28 days  
(or such longer period as the Directors may specify).  
When communicating with members by means of website 
communications, the Company must notify the intended 
recipient (by post or other permitted means) of the presence  
of a document or information on the website, the address of  
the website and place that it appears and how to access the 
document on the website.

Agreements with substantial shareholders 
Merger Agreement 
On 7 September 2011, the Company, Genel Holding, Focus 
Investments and PRM entered into the Merger Agreement 
pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase, and the 
Sellers agreed to sell, the entire issued ordinary share capital  
of Genel Energy International Limited in consideration for the 
issue of 130,632,522 Ordinary Shares (the “Consideration 
Shares”). The Merger Agreement was amended by a deed of 
amendment entered into on 29 October 2011. 
Due to the size of the interest the Sellers have in the  
Company following Completion, the Sellers agreed that part of 
the consideration they received under the Merger Agreement 
would be in the form of Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares in 
order to ensure that the Sellers’ aggregate holding of Voting  80
Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
Other statutory and regulatory  
information continued 
 
Ordinary Shares does not exceed the Maximum Voting 
Percentage. The Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares will 
automatically convert into Voting Ordinary Shares in the  
event of further equity issues by the Company, provided that, 
following conversion, the Sellers’ holding of Voting Ordinary 
Shares does not exceed the Maximum Voting Percentage. 
In connection with the Acquisition, Focus Investments agreed that 
for a period of 12 months following Completion it shall not dispose 
of any of the Ordinary Shares issued to it, and Genel Holding and 
PRM each agreed that they shall not dispose of any of the Ordinary 
Shares issued to them for a period of 24 months following 
Completion. These lock-up undertakings shall not apply to: 
(a) an acceptance of a general offer for the ordinary share 
capital of the Company made in accordance with the City 
Code; or (ii) the provision of an irrevocable undertaking to 
accept such an offer; or (iii) a sale of Ordinary Shares to an 
offeror or potential offeror during an offer period (within 
the meaning of the City Code); 
a disposal of Ordinary Shares pursuant to a compromise  
or arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act (or  
any analogous provision) providing for the acquisition by 
any person (or group of persons acting in concert as such 
expression is defined in the City Code) of 50% or more  
of the ordinary share capital of the Company; 
(c) in the case of Focus Investments only, a pledge being given 
over the Ordinary Shares owned by Focus Investments to  
a financial institution as security against the borrowing  
of funds from such financial institution; 
(d) in the case of each of Genel Holding and PRM, a pledge 
being given over up to 5,878,464 and 2,708,032 of  
the Ordinary Shares held by each party respectively to  
a financial institution as security against that party 
borrowing funds from such financial institution; 
(e) a disposal of Ordinary Shares to fund any payment or part 
payment of (i) tax directly arising as a result of any of the 
documents relating to the Acquisition or (ii) a claim under 
the Merger Agreement; 
(f) a disposal required by law; and/or 
(g) a transfer to an affiliate. 
Further, the lock-up undertakings set out above will not apply, 
after 21 November 2012 to the disposal by: 
 Genel Holding of up to 11,079,611 Ordinary Shares 
(representing 30% of Mehmet Sepil’s indirect interest in the 
maximum number of Consideration Shares attributed to 
Genel Holding); 
 Genel Holding of up to 2,257,722 Ordinary Shares 
(representing the indirect interest of all Shareholders in  
Genel Holding (other than Mehmet Sepil) in the maximum 
number of Consideration Shares attributed to Genel Holding); 
 PRM of up to 306,986 Ordinary Shares (representing 30% of 
Mehmet Sepil’s indirect interest in the maximum number of 
Consideration Shares attributed to PRM); and/or 
 PRM of up to 17,030,128 Ordinary Shares (representing  
Citrus Energy International Limited, UB Group FZE and Murat 
Yazici’s indirect interest in the maximum number of 
Consideration Shares attributed to PRM). 
Notwithstanding any other restriction or obligation under the 
Merger Agreement, PRM is permitted to distribute all Ordinary 
Shares owned by it to its shareholders in proportion to the 
shares in PRM held by such shareholders. Such distribution  
shall be subject to the relevant PRM shareholders agreeing  
to be bound by the terms of the Merger Agreement. 
Relationship Agreement 
On 7 September 2011, the Company, Genel Holding and Focus 
Investments entered into a relationship agreement which will 
regulate the ongoing relationship between Genel Holding, Focus 
Investments and the Company (the “Relationship Agreement”). 
The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to 
ensure that the Company is capable at all times of carrying  
on its business independently of Genel Holding and Focus 
Investments (and their respective Associates) and that all 
transactions and relationships between the Company, Genel 
Holding and Focus Investments are at arm’s length and on a 
normal commercial basis. For the purposes of the Relationship 
Agreement, the term “Associate” includes, in the case of Genel 
Holding, PRM and Mehmet Sepil and, in the case of Focus 
Investments, Mehmet Emin Karamehmet. 
The Relationship Agreement will terminate upon the earlier  
of (i) the Company ceasing to have any of its Ordinary Shares  
listed on the Official List and admitted to trading on the London  
Stock Exchange’s main market for listed securities, and (ii)  
Genel Holding and Focus Investments together with their 
respective Associates ceasing between them to be entitled  
to exercise, or control the exercise of, in aggregate 10% or  
more of the Voting Rights.

been agreed that, among other things: 
(a) for so long as Genel Holding and Focus Investments and 
their respective Associates are, between them, entitled to 
exercise or control the exercise of, in aggregate, 10% or 
more of the Voting Rights, each of Genel Holding and Focus 
Investments will, and will procure so far as it is reasonably 
able to do so that each of its Associates will: 
(i) conduct all transactions and relationships with any 
member of the Group, and ensure that all arrangements 
and agreements between either of them or any of their  81
Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
Associates and the Company or any other member of 
the Group are entered into, on arm’s length terms and 
on a normal commercial basis; 
(ii) not take any action which precludes or inhibits any 
member of the Group from carrying on its business 
independently of each of Genel Holding and Focus 
Investments and their respective Associates; 
(iii) not exercise any of its Voting Rights to procure any 
amendment to the Articles of Association which would 
be inconsistent with or breach any provision of the 
Relationship Agreement; 
(iv) if and for so long as paragraph 11.1.7R(3) of the Listing 
Rules applies to the Company, abstain from voting on 
any resolution required by paragraph 11.1.7R(3) of the

(as defined in paragraph 11.1.5R of the Listing Rules) 
involving Genel Holding or Focus Investments or any  
of their Associates as the related party; 
(v) comply with all provisions of the Listing Rules, the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules, the requirements of 
the London Stock Exchange and the FSMA that apply to 
it in connection with the Company; 
(vi) not cause or authorise to be done anything which  
would prejudice either the Company’s status as a listed 
company or its suitability for listing, or listing on the 
Premium Listing segment of the Official List; and 
(vii) exercise all of its Voting Rights in a manner consistent 
with the intention that at all times at least half of the 
Directors (excluding the chairman) are independent non-
executives and that certain committees of the Board 
shall comply with the Corporate Governance Code; 
(b) provided that Focus Investments and its Associates are 
entitled to exercise or control the exercise of 10% or more 
of the Voting Rights, Focus Investments shall be entitled to 
nominate for appointment to the Board one Director by 
giving notice to the Company; 
(c) provided that Genel Holding and its Associates are entitled 
to exercise or control the exercise of 10% or more of the 
Voting Rights, Genel Holding shall be entitled to nominate 
for appointment to the Board one Director by giving notice 
to the Company; 
(d) for as long as Genel Holding and Focus Investments and 
their respective Associates are between them entitled to 
exercise or control the exercise of 10% or more of the 
Voting Rights, but provided neither Genel Holding nor Focus 
Investments (in each case, together with its Associates) is 
entitled to exercise or control the exercise of 10% or more 
of the Voting Rights, Genel Holding and Focus Investments 
will, acting jointly, be entitled to nominate for appointment 
to the Board one Director by giving notice to the Company; 
(e) provided that Genel Holding and its Associates are between 
them entitled to exercise or to control the exercise of, in 
aggregate, 10% or more of the Voting Rights, Mehmet Sepil 
will have the title of President; 
(f) for so long as: 
(i) Genel Holding, Focus Investments and their respective 
Associates are between them entitled to exercise or to 
control the exercise of, in aggregate, 20% or more of 
the Voting Rights; and 
(ii) the Voting Ordinary Shares are admitted to the 
Standard Listing segment of the Official List, 
if the Group is proposing (with Board approval) to enter  
into any transaction for the acquisition or disposal of assets 
where the aggregate consideration to be paid or received  
by the Group in respect of such transaction would exceed 
US$1.5 billion (or its equivalent in any other currency at the 
prevailing exchange rates), unless Genel Holding and Focus 
Investments otherwise give their prior written consent, the 
Board will convene a general meeting of shareholders in 
order to obtain prior approval for the proposed transaction 
from the Company’s shareholders and ensure that any 
agreement effecting the proposed transaction is conditional 
on that approval being obtained; and 
(g) for so long as Genel Holding or Focus Investments together 
with their respective Associates are between them entitled 
to exercise or to control the exercise of, in aggregate,  
10% or more of the Voting Rights, subject to compliance  
by the Company with its legal and regulatory obligations,  
the Company shall procure that Genel Holding and Focus 
Investments are provided with financial and other 
information as is necessary or reasonably required by  
them for the purposes of their accounting or financial 
control requirements or to comply with their legal or  
tax obligations as a shareholder of the Company. 
The rights described at (b)–(g) above will terminate and cease  
to be of any effect: 
(i) in the case of Genel Holding, in the event that Genel 
Holding (or any Affiliate (as defined in the Merger 
Agreement) of Genel Holding that holds any Ordinary 
Shares) ceases to be controlled by Mehmet Sepil; or 
(ii) in the case of Focus Investments, in the event that 
Focus Investments (or any Affiliate (as defined in the 
Merger Agreement) of Focus Investments that holds  
any Ordinary Shares) ceases to be controlled by  
Mehmet Emin Karamehmet.  82

In addition, the rights of Genel Holding under the Relationship 
Agreement (subject to certain exceptions) shall terminate and 
cease to be of any effect in the event that Mehmet Sepil  
ceases to beneficially own (directly or indirectly through other 
entities controlled by Mehmet Sepil) Ordinary Shares carrying,  
in aggregate, 10% or more of the Voting Rights.

Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities 
 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Financial Statements  
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.  
The Directors prepare financial statements for each financial year. 
The Directors are required by the IAS Regulation to prepare the 
Group financial statements under International Financial reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. The Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period. 
In preparing the Financial Statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors: 
 properly select and apply accounting policies; 
 present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with  
the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance; and  
 make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as  
a going concern. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any  
time the financial position of the Company. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in Jersey or the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
 the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true  
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole; and 
 the management report, which is incorporated into the 
Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal

Independent Auditors’ Report 
 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of  
Genel Energy plc for the period ended 31 December 2011 which 
comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement  
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement  
and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that  
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by  
the European Union. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 83, the Directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility  
is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards  
for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the Financial Statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or  
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and  
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;  
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the financial statements: 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2011 and of the Group’s loss and cash flows  
for the period then ended;  
 have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union; and 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. 
Opinion on other matters 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report  
for the financial period for which financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit.

 Note 
Summary of significant 
accounting policies 1 
Basis of preparation 
Genel Energy plc, formerly called Vallares PLC, was incorporated 
on 1 April 2011 under the Companies (Jersey) Law as a Special 
Purpose Acquisition Company. These financial statements cover 
the period from the date of incorporation to 31 December 2011 
and therefore there are no comparatives. 
On 17 June 2011, the Company listed through Initial Public 
Offering on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, 
raising a net $2.0 billion. The stated purpose of the Company  
was to make acquisitions in the resources sector and to enhance 
shareholder value through the application of the Company 
management’s extensive experience in that sector.  
On 21 November 2011 the Company completed the acquisition of 
Genel Energy International Limited Group (“GEIL“ refer to Note 
23) and the Company was renamed Genel Energy plc.  
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  
as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS“). The significant 
accounting policies are set out below and have been consistently 
applied throughout the period. 
The consolidated financial statements consolidate the Company 
and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group“) and 
proportionately consolidate the Group’s interest in jointly 
controlled entities. The parent company financial statements 
have not been presented as there is no requirement to do so 
under Jersey Companies Law. 
Items included in the financial information of each of the  
Group‘s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (“the 
functional currency“).  
Following Genel Energy Plc becoming the parent company of 
Genel Energy International Limited (“GEIL“) on 21 November 
2011, the Directors assessed the functional currency of the 
Company to be US dollars. This reflects the fact that the 
majority of the Genel Energy’s business is influenced by pricing 
in international commodity markets, with a dollar economic 
environment. The previous functional currency of the Company 
was Sterling. In accordance with IAS 21, the change in functional 
currency has been accounted for prospectively from the date of 
change. On the date of the change of functional currency all 
assets, liabilities, issued capital and other components of equity 
and income statement items were translated into dollars at the 
exchange rate on that date. The Company also changed its 
presentation currency to US dollars.  
The consolidated financial statements are presented in to the 
nearest million dollars ($m) rounded to one decimal place, 
except where otherwise indicated.  
For explanation of the key judgements and estimates made by 
management in applying the Group’s accounting policies, refer 
to significant accounting estimates and judgement on pages  
94 and 95. 
Going concern 
The Directors have, at the time of approving the consolidated 
financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Thus, the Group continues to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated 
financial statements.  
Consolidation  
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the  
power to govern the financial and operating policies generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the 
voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered 
when assessing whether the group controls another entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated 
from the date that control ceases. 
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to  
account for business combinations. The consideration 
transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values 
of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity 
interests issued by the group. Acquisition-related costs are 
expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group 
recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either  
at fair value or at the non-controlling interest‘s proportionate 
share of the acquiree‘s net assets. 
Transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions 
between group companies are eliminated.  
Jointly controlled entities 
Jointly-controlled entities are those entities where the sharing 
of control is established by contractual agreement and decisions 
about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of 
the parties sharing control. 
The Group reports its interests in jointly-controlled entities  
using the proportionate consolidation method of accounting. 
The Group’s proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses of jointly-controlled entities are included within 
the equivalent items in the consolidated financial information  
on a line-by-line basis.  90

Summary of significant 
accounting policies

Jointly controlled operations 
Jointly-controlled operations are joint arrangements whereby 
the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have 
rights to the gross assets and liabilities of the arrangement  
and where no separate legal entity exists for the purpose jointly 
controlled operation. Control is established through contractual 
agreement and decisions about the relevant activities require 
the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The  
Group reports its interests in jointly controlled operations by 
recognising its share in assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
of the jointly controlled operation on a line-by-line basis. The 
Group’s proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, income  
and expenses of jointly controlled operations are included within 
the equivalent items in the consolidated financial information  
on a line-by-line basis. 
The majority of the Group’s exploration, development and 
production activities are conducted jointly with others under 
Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which are contractual 
arrangements that establish shared control.  
Non-controlling interest  
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated 
subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity 
therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of  
those interests at the date of the original business combination 
(see below) and the non-controlling share of changes in equity 
since the date of the combination. Losses applicable to the  
non-controlling interest in excess of the non-controlling 
interest’s share in the subsidiary’s equity are allocated  
against the interests of the Group except to the extent that  
the non-controlling interest has a binding obligation and is  
able to make an additional investment to cover the losses. 
Segmental reporting  
IFRS 8 requires the group to disclose information about its 
operating segments and the geographic areas in which it 
operates. It requires identification of business segments on  
the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed by  
the entity’s chief operating decision maker in order to allocate 
resources to the segment and assess its performance. The 
Group has one reportable business segment which is its oil  
and gas exploration and production business in Kurdistan.  
Foreign currency 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the  
functional currency of the relevant entity using the exchange 
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation 
where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and 
losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and 
from the translation at period-end exchange rates of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in the income statement, except when deferred  
in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges 
and qualifying net investment hedges. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income 
statement within finance income or finance costs.  
Financial assets 
Classification 
The Company assesses the classification of its financial assets 
on initial recognition as either: at fair value through profit and 
loss; loans and receivables; or available for sale. 
Recognition and measurement 
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised 
at fair value on the trade-date – the date on which the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans and receivables  
are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. 
Offsetting financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount 
reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable 
right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the  
liability simultaneously. 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for crude  
oil sales, sales of gas or services performed in the ordinary 
course of business. If collection is expected in one year or less 
(or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they 
are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as 
non-current assets. 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair  
value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with 
banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less and includes the Group’s 
share of cash held in joint operating ventures.  91
Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
 
Interest-bearing borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of 
transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried 
at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of 
transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the 
income statement over the period of the borrowings using the 
effective interest method. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised 
as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable 
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, 
the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent 
there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of  
the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a  
pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the  
period of the facility to which it relates. 
Borrowings are presented as long or short term based on the 
maturity of the respective borrowings in accordance with the 
loan or other agreement. Borrowings with maturities of less  
than twelve months are classified as short term. Amounts are 
classified as long term where maturity is greater than twelve 
months. Where no objective evidence of maturity exists,  
related amounts are classified as short term. 
Intangible assets  
Exploration assets 
Exploration assets are explained under “Oil and gas assets“  
in property, plant and equipment below. 
Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets (predominately software) that are 
acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses. 
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets 
from the date they are available for use, unless such lives are 
indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and 
goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each 
balance sheet date.  
Property, plant and equipment 
Property plant and equipment comprises the Group’s tangible  
oil and gas assets together with leasehold improvements,  
motor vehicles and other assets and are carried at cost, less any 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost includes purchase price and construction costs together 
with borrowing costs where applicable for qualifying assets. 
Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are 
available for their intended use. 
Oil and gas assets 
Costs incurred prior to obtaining legal rights to explore are 
expensed immediately to the income statement. 
Exploration, appraisal and development expenditure is 
accounted for under the “successful efforts“ method. Under  
the successful efforts method only costs that relate directly to 
the discovery and development of specific oil and gas reserves 
are capitalised. Exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised 
within intangible assets.  
All lease and licence acquisition costs, geological and 
geophysical costs and other direct costs of exploration, 
evaluation and development are capitalised as intangible  
assets or property plant and equipment according to their 
nature. Intangible assets comprise costs relating to the 
exploration and evaluation of properties which the directors 
consider to be unevaluated until reserves are appraised as 
commercially viable, at which time, following an impairment 
review, they are transferred to property plant and equipment 
and reclassified as development assets. Where properties are 
appraised to have no commercial value, the associated costs  
are expensed as an impairment loss in the period in which the 
determination is made. 
Development expenditure on producing assets is accounted  
for in accordance with IAS 16, “Property, plant and equipment“.  
Assets are depreciated once they are available for use and are 
depleted on a field by field basis using the unit of production 
method. The depreciation is calculated according to the 
Company’s share of production compared to its entitlement to 
commercial proved and probable reserves under the terms of 
the relevant PSC. The calculation of the “unit of production“ 
depreciation takes account of estimated future development 
costs and is based on current period-end unescalated price 
levels. Changes in reserve quantities and estimates of future 
development expenditure are reflected prospectively. The 
contractors’ entitlement to annual production is determined 
based on the provisions of the PSCs and is subject to periodic 
review by the KRG. 
In order to determine the depletion, depreciation and 
amortisation charge for the period, the Group estimates its  
net share of production based on interpretation of the PSC 
terms. The interpretation of the PSC terms is subjective and 
management’s interpretation may differ from that ultimately 
determined by the KRG. Production volumes used in calculating 
the depletion, depreciation and amortisation charge therefore 
represents management’s best estimate at the date of the 
financial statements and may be subject to change on audit  
by the KRG or its nominated auditor.  92

Changes in depletion, depreciation and amortisation related to 
the determination of actual production entitlement by the KRG 
therefore represent changes in estimates and are accounted  
for on a prospective basis. 
Farm-in/farm-out  
Farm-out transactions relate to the relinquishment of an interest in 
oil and gas assets in return for services rendered by a third party or 
where a third party agrees to pay a portion of the Group’s share of 
the development costs (“cost-carry“). Farm-in transactions relate  
to the acquisition by the group of an interest in oil and gas assets in 
return for services rendered or cost-carry provided by the group. 
Farm-in/farm out transactions undertaken in the development or 
production phase of an oil and gas asset are accounted for as an 
acquisition or disposal of oil and gas assets. The consideration given 
is measured as the fair value of the services rendered or cost-carry 
provided and any gain or loss arising on the farm-in/farm-out is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. A profit is 
recognised for any consideration received in the form of cash to  
the extent that the cash receipt exceeds the carrying value of the 
associated asset. 
Farm-in/farm-out transactions undertaken in the exploration 
phase of an oil and gas asset are accounted for on a no gain/ 
no loss basis at inception due to inherent uncertainties in the 
exploration phase and associated difficulties in determining  
fair values reliably prior to the determination of commercially 
recoverable proved reserves. 
Exploration and evaluation assets are recognised in respect  
of cost-carries where the Company is entitled to recover  
the carried costs for its own account through the PSC 
reimbursement mechanism. The recognition of income arising 
from the recognition of exploration and evaluation assets in this 
way is deferred until the asset reaches the production phase. 
Where cost-carries are related to the forgiveness of other 
obligations, such as a royalty granted by the third party as  
part of the farm-in arrangement, the associated income is 
recognised in a manner consistent with the related obligation. 
Other assets  
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost, less 
estimated residual value, over the estimated useful lives of the 
assets using the straight-line method: 
Motor vehicles 5 years 
Computer equipment 3 years 
Other equipment  3-5 years 
The estimated useful lives of property plant and equipment  
and their residual values are reviewed on an annual basis  
and, if necessary, changes in useful lives are accounted for 
prospectively. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or 
retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between 
the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is 
recognised in the income statement for the relevant period. 
Subsequent costs 
The cost of replacing part of an item of property and equipment 
is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable 
that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will 
flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. The net 
book value of the replaced part is expensed. The costs of the 
day-to-day servicing and maintenance of property, plant and 
equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. 
Leases 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any 
incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
Inventories 
Crude oil inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. 
Crude oil underlifts and overlifts arise on differences in 
quantities between the group’s entitlement to production  
and the actual production either sold or held as inventory by  
the group. Underlifts are recognised where actual production 
either sold or held as inventory is lower than the company’s 
entitlement. Overlift is recognised where the company has sold 
or held inventory greater than its entitlement at a period end. 
Underlifts and overlifts relative to actual entitlement to  
crude oil production in a period are measured at market value 
and recorded as a receivable and payable, respectively. The 
movement within an accounting period is adjusted in the  
income statement, such that the profit is recognised on  
a contractual entitlement basis. 
Impairment  
Property, plant and equipment 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets are 
reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is 
any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists then 
the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is 
the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset. Key assumptions used 
in the discounted cash flows used to assess the fair value of  93
Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
 
property, plant and equipment are oil price, reserves and 
resources, operating expenditure, government deductions  
from revenue. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped 
together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash 
inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the 
cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash 
generating unit“). 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset 
or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Financial assets 
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A 
financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence 
indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect  
on the estimate of future cash flows of that asset. 
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured  
at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its 
carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future 
cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
All impairment losses are recognised as an expense in the 
income statement. 
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related 
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss  
was recognised.  
Employee benefits 
Short-term benefits 
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an 
undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is 
provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be 
paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this 
amount as a result of past service provided by the employee  
and the obligation can be estimated reliably. 
Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans. The economic cost of awarding shares  
and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in 
the income statement equivalent to the fair value of the benefit 
awarded. The fair value is determined by reference to option 
pricing models, principally Monte Carlo and adjusted Black-
Scholes models. The charge is recognised in the income 
statement over the vesting period of the award. At each balance 
sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of 
options that are expected to become exercisable. Any revision  
to the original estimates is reflected in the income statement 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity immediately to the 
extent it relates to past service and the remainder over the rest 
of the vesting period. The proceeds received net of any directly 
attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital 
(nominal value) and share premium when the options  
are exercised. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are 
measured at management’s best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and 
are discounted to present value where the effect is material. 
Decommissioning 
Provision is made for the cost of decommissioning assets at the 
time when the obligation to decommission arises. Such provision 
represents the estimated discounted liability for costs which are 
expected to be incurred in removing production facilities and 
site restoration at the end of the producing life of each field.  
A corresponding item of property plant and equipment  
is also created at an amount equal to the provision. This is 
subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the 
production facilities. Any change in the present value of the 
estimated expenditure attributable to changes in the estimates 
of the cash flow or the current estimate of the discount rate 
used are reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the 
property plant and equipment. The unwinding of the discount  
is recognised as interest payable in the income statement. 
Balance sheet classification 
Current assets and short-term liabilities include items due less 
than a year from the balance sheet date, and items related to 
the operating cycle, if longer. The current portion of long-term 
debt is included under current liabilities. Investments in shares 
held for trading are classified as current assets, while strategic 
investments are classified as non-current assets. Other assets 
are classified as non-current assets. 
Revenue 
Sales of crude oil are recognised when the significant risks  
and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer and  
the associated revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue  
from other services is recognised when the service has been 
performed. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, value 
added tax (“VAT“) and other sales tax or duty.  
Where income tax arising from the Group’s activities under 
production sharing contracts is settled by a third party at no 
cost and on behalf of the Group and where the Group would 
otherwise be liable for such income tax, the associated sales  
are shown gross including the notional tax and a corresponding 
income tax charge is presented in the income statement.  94

Summary of significant 
accounting policies  
continued 1 
Export sales – Kurdistan 
The significant risks and rewards of ownership are deemed  
to have passed on delivery however, because the payment 
mechanism for crude export sales is developing, the Group does 
not consider that export revenue can be reliably measured at 
the time of delivery and, consequently, recognises revenue at 
the point of cash receipt. 
Local sales – Kurdistan 
The significant risks and rewards of ownership are deemed to 
have passed on delivery of crude oil to the customer at the point 
of loading and revenue is recognised accordingly to the extent 
that the receipt of cash is assessed as sufficiently probable and 
the amount of revenue can be reliably measured. 
Finance income and finance costs 
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested 
and foreign currency gains. Interest income is recognised as  
it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
Finance expense comprises interest expense on borrowings, and 
foreign currency losses. Borrowing costs directly attributable to 
the acquisition of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that 
asset are capitalized over the respective assets. 
Borrowing costs, including the accretion of any discount on 
initial recognition of borrowings, incurred for the construction  
of any qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of  
time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its 
intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are expensed. 
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
Taxation 
Under the terms of the PSCs, under which oil sales are made, 
any tax due is paid directly from the Government’s take of 
revenues. This would be accounted for as a gross up of revenue 
and a corresponding taxation expense in the income statement. 
No gross up of revenue and presentation of taxation expense 
has been accounted for in the period because, as a consequence 
of the uncertainty over the payment mechanism for oil sales in 
Kurdistan, it has not been possible to measure the quantum of 
taxation that has been paid on behalf of the Company by the 
KRG. The Company believes that all taxation due has been  
paid on its behalf by the KRG and no tax payment is expected  
to be required. 
Related parties 
Parties are related if one party has the ability, directly or 
indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant 
influence over the party in making financial or operational 
decisions. Parties are also related if they are subject to  
common control. 
Transactions between related parties are transfers of  
resources, services or obligations, regardless of whether  
a price is charged and are disclosed separately within the  
notes to the consolidated financial information. 
Accounting estimates and judgements 
Certain critical accounting judgements in applying the Group’s 
accounting policies are described below. 
Estimation of oil and gas reserves 
Oil and gas reserves are key elements in the Group’s investment 
decision-making process. They are also an important element in 
determining depletion, depreciation and amortisation, the timing 
of decommissioning activity and in testing for impairment of 
tangible and intangible oil and gas assets. Changes in 2P oil and 
gas reserves will have a corresponding effect on the depletion, 
depreciation and amortisation charge in the statement of 
comprehensive income and on the discounted value of any 
decommissioning provision. Changes in oil and gas reserve 
estimates will affect the assessed valuation of capitalised  
oil and gas assets, which may result in impairment. 
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of 
crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering  
data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable  
in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic 
and operating conditions, that is, prices and costs as of the date 
and estimate is made. 
Probable reserves are those additional reserves which analysis 
of geosciences and engineering data indicate are less likely  
to be recovered than proved reserves, but more certain to  
be recovered that possible reserves. Estimates of oil and gas 
reserves are inherently imprecise, require the application of 
judgement and are subject to future revision. Accordingly, 
financial and accounting measures (such as depreciation and 
amortisation charges and provision for decommissioning) that 
are based on proved and probable reserves are also subject  
to change.  
Proved reserves are estimated by reference to available 
reservoir and well information. All proved reserves estimates 
are subject to revision, either upward or downward, based  
on new information such as from development drilling and 
production activities, or from changes in economic factors, 
including product prices, contract terms or development plans. 
In general, changes in the technical maturity of hydrocarbon 
reserves resulting from new information becoming available  95
Genel Energy plc 
Annual Report 
2011
 
from development and production activities have tended to  
be the most significant cause of annual revisions.  
In general, estimates of reserves for undeveloped or partially 
developed fields are subject to greater uncertainty over  
their future life than estimates of reserves for fields that are 
substantially developed and being depleted. As a field goes into 
production, the amount of proved reserves will be subject to 
future revision once additional information becomes available 
through, for example, the drilling of additional wells or  
the observation of long-term reservoir performance under 
producing conditions. As those fields are further developed,  
new information may lead to revisions.  
Changes to the Group’s estimates of proved and probable 
reserves also affect the amount of depreciation and 
amortisation recorded in the Group’s financial statements for 
property, plant and equipment related to oil and gas production 
activities. A reduction in proved and probable reserves will 
increase depreciation and amortisation charges (assuming 
constant production) and reduce income.  
Future development costs used in depletion  
of oil and gas properties 
Certain classes of property, plant and equipment related  
to oil and gas exploration and production activities are 
depreciated using a unit-of-production method over 2P  
reserves. Since 2P reserves assume future development cost to 
access undeveloped proved and probable reserves, the future 
development costs are included with the net book value of oil 
and gas property, plant and equipment used in calculating the 
unit of production depreciation rate on a field-by-field basis. 
The Group’s estimation of future development costs is based  
on comparable data of similar companies in the region, future 
prices for metals and Group’s plans to increase the efficiency  
of the drilling process. However, actual drilling costs may be 
different from those estimated by the Group due to changes  
in market conditions, business and operating environment. 
Changes in estimates of reserve quantities and/or estimates  
of future development expenditure are reflected prospectively 
in the depreciation, depletion and amortisation calculation. 
Revenue recognition 
The payment mechanism for export sales is developing and,  
in practice, does not follow the contractual provisions of the 
PSCs. The Iraqi Government is responsible for the marketing  
of all export oil from Iraq and determines the basis on which 
associated revenues will be allocated to the KRG for distribution 
to contractors. As such, there is uncertainty related to both  
the amount of export revenue and the timing of receipt of that 
revenue. In addition, the tax provisions of the PSCs are subject 
to interpretation and the associated tax filing mechanism is  
not established, giving rise to further uncertainty. 
As such, export sales are only recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income on the receipt of proceeds and no gross 
up is made in respect of the revenue and taxes related to the 
Kurdistan PSCs. 
Revenue for domestic sales is recognised on delivery. 
Decommissioning costs 
Provision for decommissioning represents the present value of 
decommissioning costs relating to the Kurdistan oil and gas interests, 
which are expected to be incurred at the end of field life, currently 
estimated to be in the period 2031 – 2039. These provisions have 
been created based on the Group’s internal estimates. Assumptions, 
based on the current economic environment, have been made which 
management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate 
the future liability. Those estimates are reviewed regularly to take 
into account any material changes to the assumptions. However, 
actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future 
market prices for the necessary decommissioning works  
required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time. 
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend  
on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.  
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are 
inherently uncertain.  
Business combinations 
The recognition of business combinations requires the excess  
of the purchase price of acquisitions over the net book value of 
assets acquired to be allocated to the assets and liabilities of the 
acquired entity. The Group makes judgements and estimates in 
relation to the fair value allocation of the purchase price. 
The fair value exercise is performed at the date of acquisition. 
As a result of the nature of fair value assessments in the oil  
and gas industry, the purchase price allocation exercise and 
acquisition-date fair value determinations require subjective 
judgements based on a wide range of complex variables at  
a point in time. Management uses all available information  
to make the fair value determinations.  
In determining fair value for the acquisition, the Company has 
utilised valuation methodologies including discounted cash flow 
analysis. The assumptions made in performing these valuations 
include assumptions as to discount rates, foreign exchange 
rates, commodity prices, the timing of development, capital 
costs, and future operating costs. Any significant change in key 
assumptions may cause the acquisition accounting to be revised. 
New standards 
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and 
interpretations will be effective for annual periods beginning 
after 1 January 2012. None of these standards have been  
early adopted. The new standards are not expected to have  
a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements  
of the Group.

Segmental  
information 2 
The Group has one reportable business segment which is its oil and gas exploration and production business in Kurdistan. Capital 
expenditure decisions for the segment are considered in the context of the cash flows expected to be made from the production  
and sale of crude oil. 
Activities such as administration and finance income, are not considered part of the business segment and form part of the 
reconciliation to reported numbers.

Taxation 8 
All corporation tax due has been paid on behalf of the Company by the KRG from the KRG’s own share of revenues and there is no 
tax payment required or expected to be made by the Company. The tax paid by the KRG in accordance with the terms of the PSCs 
would usually be presented as a gross up of revenue and a corresponding taxation expense in the income statement and no cash  
out flow for the Company. In the Company’s results for the period ended 31 December 2011, no presentation of taxation expense  
with an equivalent gross up for revenue has been accounted for in the period because it has not been possible to measure reliably 
the amount of taxation paid on behalf of the Company because of uncertainties over how the amount of taxation should be 
calculated. This is an accounting presentational issue and there is no taxation to be paid. 
Because of the uncertainty in calculating a tax charge and in assessing how certain capital assets should be treated under the tax 
laws of the Kurdistan Region, it has not been possible to assess whether or how much deferred tax liability should be recognised  
in relation to the business combination that took place in the year and consequently no deferred tax liability has been recognised. 
As the tax regime evolves there are a number of possible outcomes, one of which is that at a later date it becomes necessary to 
recognise a deferred tax liability in relation to the assets acquired through the business combination. The recognition of a deferred 
tax liability is an accounting entry that would have no impact on cash or cash flows.

Exploration and evaluation assets are comprised of the Company’s PSC interests in exploration assets in Kurdistan. Exploration  
and evaluation assets are not amortised as they are not available for use but are assessed for impairment indicators under IFRS  
6. Any impairment loss is recognised within exploration expenses in the income statement. Once assets have been appraised as 
commercially viable they are transferred into property, plant and equipment as oil and gas assets. 
The net book value of $0.1 million of other assets is principally comprised of capitalised software development costs.

Non-current provisions cover expected decommissioning and abandonment costs resulting from the net ownership interests in 
petroleum and natural gas assets, including well sites and gathering systems. The fair value of a liability for a decommissioning  
and abandonment provision are recognised in the period in which it is incurred.  
The cash flows relating to the decommissioning and abandonment provisions are expected to occur between 2031 and 2039.  
The provision is the discounted present value of the cost, using existing technology at current prices of decommissioning of blocks 
in Iraq. The discount factor used in the calculation is 4.0%.  104

Note 
Financial risk management 18 Fair values of financial instruments 
Trade and other receivables 
There were no trade and other receivables past due at the end of the period. All financial assets are short-term in nature or are 
repayable on demand and, as such, the fair value of financial assets approximates to their carrying amount. 
Trade and other payables 
All financial liabilities are short-term in nature or are repayable on demand and, as such, there is no difference between contractual 
cash flows related to the financial liabilities and their carrying amount. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand. Where it  
is not repayable on demand, then the fair value is estimated at the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market  
rate of interest at the balance sheet date. 
Interest-bearing borrowings 
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of 
interest at the balance sheet date.  
Financial risk factors 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis, except for credit risk relating to trade and other receivable balances. Credit risk  
arises from cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and other assets. For banks and financial institutions, only 
independently-rated parties with a minimum rating of “AA-“ are accepted.  
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum credit exposure to credit risk  
at 31 December was:

Trade and other receivables  12.2
Cash and cash equivalents 1,912.9
 
 1,925.1
There are no trade and other receivables overdue at the period end and no provision for doubtful debt has been made. No interest  
is charged on receivables. The carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.  
Cash is deposited in government gilts, treasury bills or term deposits with banks that are assessed as appropriate based on, among 
other things, sovereign risk, CDS pricing and credit rating. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group is committed to ensuring it has sufficient liquidity to meet its payables as they fall due. At 31 December 2011 the Group 
had cash and cash equivalents of $1,912.9 million. The position of cash and cash equivalent balances can be seen in Note 14. 
Currency risk 
As substantially all of the Group’s transactions are measured and denominated in US dollars the exposure to currency risk is not 
material and therefore no sensitivity analysis has been presented. 
Interest rate risk  
The Group had no borrowings as at 31 December 2011 and therefore is not exposed to fluctuations in interest rates.  105
Genel Energy plc

Capital management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it remains sufficiently funded to support its business strategy and maximise 
shareholder value. The Group’s funding needs are met through a combination of cash raised by IPO this period, cash generated from 
operations and equity. The Group monitors its cash position on an on-going basis. Capital includes share capital, other reserves and 
accumulated losses. 
 
Note 
Operating leases 19 The Company leases drilling rig and temporary production facilities under operating leases. Drill rigs are leased on a day-rate basis 
for the purpose of drilling and exploration or development wells. The aggregate payments under drilling contracts are determined 
by the number of days required to drill each well. During the period ended 31 December 2011, $0.2 million was expensed to the 
income statement in respect of operating leases.

On 1 April 2011, two Ordinary Shares of £0.10 each were subscribed for at par value. On 28 June 2011, a written resolution of the sole 
member of the Company authorised the issue of 133,090,000 Ordinary £0.10 Shares at a price of £10 per share. On 28 June 2011, 
pursuant to the terms of a Repurchase Option, the Company repurchased 2,457,480 Ordinary Shares of £0.10 each in the Company 
at a price of £10 per Ordinary Share.  
Following the repurchase and the related cancellation of the Ordinary Shares, the Company‘s issued Ordinary Share capital 
consisted of 130,632,522 Ordinary Shares. There are no shares held in treasury, therefore the total number of shares with voting 
rights in the Company was, as at 31 December 2011, 186,617,888 Ordinary Shares of £0.10. Each share holds one voting right.  
On 21 November the company issued 130,632,522 shares in consideration for the acquisition of Genel Energy International Limited.  
There have been no changes to the authorised share capital since it was determined to be 10,000,000,000 Ordinary Shares of  
£0.10 per share.

Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model. The model takes into account assumptions regarding expected 
volatility, expected dividends and expected time to exercise. 
In the absence of sufficient historical volatility for the Company, expected volatility was estimated by analysing the historical 
volatility of FTSE-listed oil and gas producers over the three years prior to the date of grant. The expected dividend assumption was 
set at 0%, to reflect a prudent approach. The risk-free interest rate incorporated into the model is based on the term structure of 
UK Government zero coupon bonds.  
The inputs into the Black-Scholes pricing model for RSP and SOP options granted on 19 December 2011 were as follows: 
RSP SOP
Share price  788p 788p
Exercise price  n/a 787.58p
Expected volatility  n/a 46%
Expected life  1/2/3 years 5 years
Expected dividends  0% 0%
Risk-free return  n/a 1.0%
Fair value on measurement date  788p 322p
In 2011, the Company recognised expenses of $25,000 in relation to the RSP and $22,000 in relation to the SOP. 
Founder Shares  
Prior to Placing Admission, the Founders (being Nathaniel Rothschild, Tony Hayward, Julian Metherell and Tom Daniel) were  
issued B ordinary shares in the Vallares Holding Company Limited (since renamed Genel Energy Holding Company Limited, the 
“Subsidiary“) (“B shares“ or “Founder Shares“). These Founder Shares reward the Founders for their initial capital commitment to 
the Company and for completion of an acquisition through exchange of such Founder Shares, upon completion of an acquisition, for 
up to 6.67% of the fully-diluted Ordinary Shares of the Company. These Founder Shares have been treated as equity settled share-
based payments and are deemed to have vested immediately on grant date as no performance conditions are attached to them. 
The Company has determined that the fair value of these share based payments is equal to the consideration received (£15 million) 
by the Company. Accordingly no share-based payment expense has been recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.

Founder Securities 
In addition to the Founder Shares, prior to Admission the Founders were also issued C Ordinary Shares in the Subsidiary  
(“C Shares“ or “Founder Securities“). These Founder Securities encourage the Founders to grow the Company following an 
acquisition and to maximise value for holders of Ordinary Shares by entitling the Founders to a share of the upside in the  
Company’s value once certain performance conditions have been satisfied. The performance conditions are summarised below: 
If within four years, post-acquisition, the closing share prices reaches the higher of: 
 A compound rate of return of 8.5% on the share from the Admission value of £10 and from date of acquisition; or  
 An increase of 25% of the issue price from the Admission value of £10, adjusted for any matters which have an impact on  
the capital structure of the Company.  
The Founders have the right to exchange their Founder Securities for Ordinary Shares in the Company to a value of 15% of the 
increase in value from the Placing Admission value of £10. The Company has the option to settle by issuing shares or the equivalent 
in cash. The Founder Securities are deemed to have vested immediately as no performance conditions exist in relation to their 
vesting, however there are performance conditions which need to be met prior to exchanging the Founder Securities for Ordinary 
Shares. 
The Company has determined that the fair value of these share based payments is equal to the consideration received (£5 million). 
Accordingly no share-based payment expense has been recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Business combinations 23 On 21 November 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Genel Energy International Limited (“GEIL“), an oil  
and gas exploration and production company based in Turkey with operations in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The consideration for 
the acquisition was new Ordinary Shares of the Company. The total amount of Consideration Shares issued was 50% (pre-dilution 
from the founder shares and founder securities) of the enlarged share capital of the Company. To the extent that the number of 
Consideration Shares issued equalled or exceeded 30% of the enlarged issued share capital of the Company, the excess was issued 
in the form of suspended-voting Ordinary Shares. 
Genel Energy plc has been identified as the accounting acquirer (since the majority of the voting rights in the combined entity reside 
with the pre-transaction shareholders on the company) and has accounted for the transaction using acquisition accounting. Under 
acquisition accounting the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the acquisition of GEIL have been consolidated into 
the financial statements of Genel Energy plc at their fair value at the acquisition date. The results of operations of GEIL have been 
included from the date of acquisition.  
In the period 21 November to 31 December 2011, the new subsidiaries contributed $24.0 million to revenue and $2.6 million  
to the consolidated net profit for the period. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2011, the acquired subsidiaries would have 
contributed revenue of $119.8 million and net profit $30.6 million. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the 
fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition occurred on 1 April 2011. 
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities.

The fair value consideration was primarily satisfied through the issue of 130,632,522 ordinary shares and suspended voting  
ordinary shares in Genel Energy plc at a share price of 912 pence per share, being the market value of shares on 21 November 2011. 
The above values are provisional and will be finalised in the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2012. There was 
no goodwill arising on the transaction. As there is no clear mechanism to calculate taxes under the PSC, it has not been possible to 
assess whether a deferred tax liability should be recognised on acquisition and therefore no deferred taxes have been provided.

The Directors have identified the shareholders, key management personnel and the Board members, together with the families and 
companies controlled by or affiliated with each of them; and associates, investments and joint ventures as related parties of the 
Group under IAS24. 
During the period, the Group entered into an agreement with Vallares Advisers LP Limited (the “Adviser“) to provide advice on the 
implementation of the Group strategy and the management of its daily operations and business. The Group outsourced to the 
Adviser, a related entity, all of its operating functions, including identifying and assessing acquisition opportunities, designing the 
strategy to acquire the target, due diligence, and providing personnel and support staff to carry out those roles. During the period, 
the Group paid to the Adviser a total of $19.8 million including a termination payment in accordance with the advisory agreements. 
Termination of the Adviser arrangement took effect following completion of the Acquisition. 
During the period, the Group issued Founder Shares and Founder Securities to incentivise the Founders to achieve the Company’s 
objectives. The Founder Shares reward such members for their initial capital commitment to the Company and for completing the 
Acquisition, through exchange of the Founder Shares for Ordinary Shares on favourable terms following the Acquisition. The 
Founder Securities encourage the Vallares Team to grow the Company following the Acquisition and to maximise value for holders 
of Ordinary Shares by entitling the Vallares Team to a share of the upside in the Company’s value once the Performance Condition 
is satisfied. Further detail is provided in Note 21. 
Following the Acquisition, the Company repaid loans owed by GEIL to Focus Investments ($110.9m) and GEAS ($5.6m).

Business overview
Corporate governance
Group financial statements
Other information Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report that despite 2010 being a year of further economic and market uncertainty, 
the Company delivered good revenue growth in certain Strategic Business Units, although this 
was masked by order slippages on significant US defence and security programmes in others. 
Cobham was able to generate underlying earnings growth from flat Group revenue helped by 
early progress on its operational improvement programme that will enhance customer service. 
Corporate development
In my first year, I have visited many of the Group’s businesses and have been impressed by the 
deep market insight and dedication of Cobham’s employees. It is clear to me that the financial 
results that the Group has been delivering over many years is due to the strategy of long term, 
focused investment in technology and a culture of innovation, enabling the Company to develop 
differentiated products and services in its chosen markets. 
The next stage of the Group’s strategy roll out was announced with the interim results, including 
the launch of the Excellence in Delivery programme to improve efficiency and operational 
performance for our customers. The programme will help ensure that the business is not just 
known for technology and agility, but also has a sector-leading reputation for performance. 
The early results are encouraging.
During 2010 Cobham’s technology and its contribution to exports was acknowledged with one 
of our businesses being granted a Queen’s Awards for Enterprise in the Innovation category and 
another, a Queen’s Awards for International Trade. In the Innovation category, Cobham’s wireless 
digital audio and video link technology was recognised as a key contributor to numerous critical 
applications, including disaster relief and counter terrorism. 
In addition to generating distinctive technology internally, Cobham also strengthens its positions 
through acquisition, where this permits the Company to build scale in its markets. In 2010 and 
early 2011, three transactions were completed for a total of US$1 75m that strengthen the Group’s 
presence in the growing homeland security market. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 4.372p, which will be paid on 3 June, representing an 
increase of just over 10% on the prior year. The full year dividend of 6.00p is covered 3.3 times. The 
Board has also decided to return capital to shareholders through a share buy-back of up to £150m.
The Board 
I succeeded David Turner as Chairman at the 6 May 2010 Annual General Meeting (AGM), having 
been appointed to the Board on 1 February 2010 as Chairman designate. David left the Board at 
the conclusion of the AGM to take up the position of Chairman at the Commonwealth Bank of 
Australia, and we wish him well. 
On 1 December 2010, Michael Wareing joined the Board as a Non-executive director. Michael 
was formerly Chief Executive of KPMG International and prior to that Chief Executive of KPMG’s 
Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Michael’s deep business experience and financial insight 
will be a valuable addition to the Board. He will become chairman of Cobham’s Audit Committee, 
when its current chairman, Peter Hooley, retires from the Board of directors in May 2011.
Outlook
There continue to be challenges and uncertainties in some of our markets. As a consequence 
the rate of growth in our Technology Divisions remains at the level experienced during 2010. 
The business has been configured with a prudent view of top line growth for the current year 
and we have already accelerated integration plans to deliver £21m of cost savings in 2011. 
Cobham continues to have strong long-term positions in attractive markets with superior growth 
and is focusing its technology investment and acquisition strategy in areas of customer priority. 
This approach, together with customer and cost benefits from the operational improvement plan, 
gives the Board confidence that Cobham will continue to make progress over the medium term.

This is my first year 
as Chairman of Cobham 
and I am pleased to report 
that despite 2010 being a 
challenging year in our markets, 
the business delivered 5% 
underlying earnings growth. 
Business overview 4 Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Chief Executive’s review
Overview of the year
We have delivered earnings growth in challenging markets. Good revenue growth in certain 
Strategic Business Units was masked by order slippages on significant defence and security 
programmes and some continuing softness in certain commercial markets. We have made 
encouraging progress on our operational improvement programme, Excellence in Delivery, and 
achieved cost savings which have contributed to 5% earnings growth from flat Group revenue.
The Group order book had increased at the year end to £2.5bn (2009: £2.4bn) with the increase 
attributable to the Technology Divisions. In all three Technology Divisions there has been 
improved order intake, with an aggregate 7% increase in orders received at constant translation 
exchange rates.
The Group has been selected on a number of important new multi-year programmes and platforms 
and has also won further work on existing platforms, which will result in incremental orders being 
placed over many years. These include the CH-53K helicopter, the Aegis surveillance and fire control 
radar system, the F-35 fighter aircraft and the US Missile Defence Agency Support Services 
(MiDAESS) umbrella contract. In addition, Cobham has continued to win positions in faster growing 
geographies, with the Chinese C919 commercial aircraft, the Indian Air Force Hawk advanced jet 
trainer, the indigenous Korean Utility Helicopter and significant programmes in the Middle East.
Despite good underlying progress in many of their markets, the overall growth in both Defence 
Systems and Avionics and Surveillance was impacted by delays in certain significant US defence 
and security awards, with continued softness in some of Avionics and Surveillance’s commercial 
markets. Group revenue was up 1% in the year with the Mission Systems Division delivering strong 
organic growth, driven by revenue from next generation air refuelling pods. The Aviation Services 
Division delivered strong organic growth largely from its Australian operations.
The Group’s trading margin increased 0.4% points to 18.3% driven by the Technology Divisions, 
where the margin increased 0.5% points to 19.0%. The improved margin was driven by cost 
efficiencies from Excellence in Delivery, efficiencies from facilities previously integrated during 
2009 and 2010 and ongoing procurement savings, but was partially offset by weaker trading 
volumes in some businesses. A few PV (private venture or company funded research and 
development – R&D) programmes were temporarily slowed where customer launches and 
demand from products were down in some subdued markets.
Strategy update
The Group’s strategy is to build and maintain leading market positions in selected high growth, high 
technology markets. Cobham’s chosen markets overlap significantly with the priorities set out in the 
US Government’s Quadrennial Defence Review and with the UK Government’s Strategic Defence 
and Security Review, both of which were published in 2010. These documents attribute particular 
importance to C4ISR capabilities, where Cobham has built good positions as part of its strategy.
The Group’s strategy will be underpinned by delivery of three strategic objectives; technology 
investment, operational excellence and portfolio optimisation.
Technology investment
Investment in technology is pivotal to developing and bringing to market products that are 
in high demand and at the leading edge of technology. During 2010 important and long term 
opportunities have been in development or have been brought to market which will generate 
revenue for the Group over a sustained period:
•  Fifth generation air refuelling pods have now been certified, along with the Airbus Military A330 
Multi Role Transport Tanker, for the Royal Australian Air Force. These pods are likely to be in 
service for the next 40 to 50 years and will generate recurring revenue for the Group. In early 
2011, Cobham’s air refuelling systems were also selected on the important new KC-46A tanker 
for the US Air Force;
•  Selection by Northrop Grumman to provide an aerial refuelling system, integration and expertise 
to support the autonomous air refuelling of the KQ-X Global Hawk programme to 2012;
•  Successful demonstration to the US Army of a 100 user radio system for the Wireless Network 
after Next (WNaN) programme;

Highlights
• Order intake in Technology Divisions 
up 7% at constant translation exchange 
and important awards on long term 
programmes
• Over £10m of efficiencies, including savings 
from the on track Excellence in Delivery 
programme
• Three acquisitions totalling US$1 75m 
completed in homeland security markets 
in 2010 and early 2011
We have long term 
positions in attractive 
markets with superior growth 
and we are focusing our 
technology investment and 
acquisition strategy in areas 
of customer priority.

Business overview
Corporate governance
Group financial statements
Other information Chief Executive’s review continued
•  Launch of the Wireless Sensor Network Node (or Nugget), a fully portable and networked 
unattended ground sensor for covert surveillance and asset protection applications; and
•  Launch of Cobham’s lightest, smallest and lowest cost SwiftBroadband solution, the unique 
SB200, for a new market of smaller aircraft. This enables satellite connectivity for data networks, 
internet, email and telephony.
Operational excellence
Cobham’s operational improvement and efficiency programme, Excellence in Delivery, involves 
rolling out a standard operating framework across 14 principal sites, integrating smaller production 
facilities, establishing standard processes in a standard Enterprise Planning Resource system and 
setting up shared service centres. Excellence in Delivery will bring a number of benefits including 
improved productivity, shortened manufacturing lead times, improved quality and reduced 
working capital. It will also simplify the business, improve focus on the customer and enhance 
internal communication and collaboration.
The locations of the principal sites, which are expected to cover 80% of manufacturing profit by 
the end of the programme, have been communicated and work is already underway to implement 
the Group’s standard operating framework in six of the sites. The Group has accelerated its 
integration plans for 2011, including the closure of three facilities, which will be integrated into 
existing sites, and the integration of a further six facilities into two new sites. The first of the 
integrations has been completed.
By the end of 2013, the Group expects benefits from Excellence in Delivery at a run-rate of  
£65m per annum, at a total cost of £131m. Progress on the programme together with other  
cost measures has delivered efficiency savings of over £10m in 2010. The Excellence in Delivery 
efficiency savings were primarily achieved through headcount reductions and facility overhead 
savings. In line with previous guidance, the Group expects to deliver further cost savings from 
Excellence in Delivery of £21m in 201 1.
Portfolio optimisation
The Group’s strategy is to acquire businesses that deliver technologies or capabilities that will  
help it build scale in its chosen markets, accelerate organic growth and reinforce the value added 
content of its products. In addition, the Group plans to exit certain businesses and product lines 
representing up to 15% of its technology revenue that have sub-scale positions or which do not 
otherwise fit the Group’s strategy. The Group has strict financial criteria and a disciplined approach 
to investments and disposals. Progress in 2010 was as follows:
•  Completion of the previously announced acquisition of RVision Inc. on 30 December 2010 for  
up to US$48m in cash; and
•  The divestment in September 2010 of Satori SAS, trading as Cobham Maintenance Repair and 
Overhaul, for €7 .9m. 
This progress has continued since the year end:
•  In January 2011, the acquisition of Telerob GmbH, a manufacturer of advanced bomb disposal 
robots based in Germany for homeland security applications, for €78m in cash and loan notes 
was completed; 
•  The acquisition of Corp Ten International was completed in February 2011 for up to US$24m in 
cash. The company develops software which allows multiple tracking devices to be managed 
within a single system; and
•  In February 2011, the divestment of the Engineering Consultancy Group for £13.5m. To date the 
Group has realised proceeds of £29m from the sale of Satori, the Engineering Consultancy 
business and the sale of part of the Wimborne, UK site.
The Group’s strategy is to finance bolt-in acquisitions from free cash flow generated after dividend 
payments and larger transactions from existing debt capacity.

Our markets
Cobham’s chosen technologies and markets 
include specialist defence and security 
communications and intelligence gathering, 
C4ISR, surveillance for homeland security  
and defence applications and satellite 
communication (SATCOM) for both commercial 
and defence and security applications.
The Group continues to focus its portfolio on 
the defence, security and commercial markets 
with some three quarters of revenue from 
defence and security. The term ‘Commercial’, 
covers civil and general aviation, plus maritime 
markets such as SATCOM for oil rigs and 
shipping. Cobham understands these three 
primary markets, can manage risk across them 
and knows how to ‘add value’ in line with 
customer needs.
Cobham makes sales on five continents and 
derives almost 40% of its business from markets 
outside the USA, where it has already made 
significant investments in countries such as 
India. The lead-time for making sales in faster 
growing international markets is difficult to 
predict but the potential is considerable.
Across these markets, the environment 
remains uncertain, particularly as governments 
contemplate their longer-term strategy in what 
is a difficult macro economic environment. 
This has visibly resulted in a cycle of  
re-examination of spending priorities, so 
Cobham has built up a view of the global 
defence, security and commercial markets  
and estimated that at a macro level, growth 
over the next five years will be between 2–7%.  
The overall market is very large, and the Group 
has a relatively small share of it, so there is room 
for growth in market share as the business 
continues to differentiate itself technically. 
The Group has estimated overall market 
growth through analysis of the outlook  
for each of the major market segments  
the Company considers that it operates in.  
The analysis has included a review of market 
positions, past performance, expected growth  
in each segment and the drivers of growth, 
using input from a number of internal and third 
party sources. Cobham’s chosen markets 
overlap significantly with the priorities set out 
in the US Government’s Quadrennial Defence  
Review and with the UK Government’s 
Strategic Defence and Security Review,  
both of which were published in 2010.
There is less visibility in the current market 
environment than usual but the analysis 
undertaken has led the Group to conclude  
that it can grow faster than the overall market 
over the medium term. This is because, overall, 
the Group believes that it remains well 
positioned in faster growing markets, making 
PV investments and acquisitions to establish 
and improve positions on existing and new 
programmes, with improved routes to market.
The Group’s strategy is to build and maintain leading market 
positions in selected higher growth, high technology markets.

Key performance indicators
Technology Divisions’ organic 
revenue growth
Organic defence and security revenue in the 
Technology Divisions declined modestly by 
1.6% (2009: +7%) after four years of strong 
growth, as a good underlying performance  
in 2010 was masked by order slippage on 
specific US defence and security programmes,  
such as MiDAESS and the L-band relocation 
programme. Organic revenue from commercial 
businesses was broadly flat at -1% (2009: -16%) 
with revenue following end customer 
production, as markets progressively stabilised 
during the year after declining through 2009.
Underlying EPS growth
Underlying EPS grew 5% to 19.7p (2009: 18.8p) 
primarily due to the improvement in the 
Group’s underlying trading margin, favourable 
currency translation exchange rates and the 
anticipated lower underlying tax charge. 
Underlying EPS at constant currency 
translation rates grew by 4%.
Operating cash conversion
Operating cash flow in the year, which is stated 
after capital expenditure but before tax and 
interest payments, was £271m (2009: £293m). 
Cash flow was affected by a temporary build 
up in working capital at the year end, which  
is expected to reverse in 2011, relating to the 
timing of shipments. This was partly offset  
by lower net capital expenditure of £57m  
(2009: £77m). Operating cash conversion  
was 79% (2009: 89%) of trading profit, before 
the Group’s share of post-tax results of  
joint ventures.
PV investment
A few new PV programmes were temporarily 
slowed where customer launches and demand 
for new products were down in some subdued 
markets, so total PV investment in the year  
was lower at £74m (2009: £88m), being 4.5%  
(2009: 5.3%) of the Technology Divisions’ 
revenue. However, with the addition of 
increased customer funded R&D, total 
technology investment remained broadly 
consistent with the prior year at 8%. 
Staff safety
The number of accidents and lost work days 
resulting in more than three days’ absence 
reduced by over 15%, with all business units 
working towards achieving at least Foundation 
level of the Cobham S|H|E Management 
Standards by the end of 2011. The importance 
of safety has been further emphasised with the 
CEO covering safety as a standard agenda  
item during weekly calls with his Group 
Executive (GE), monthly circulation of safety 
reports to the GE and inclusion of safety 
matters in the Group wide Team Brief issued  
on a monthly basis.
Voluntary staff turnover
There has been an increase in voluntary staff 
turnover from 5.5% to 8.0%, however, the overall 
level of turnover remains within the <10% 
target. Cobham employs many talented people 
with very portable skills in competitive markets, 
so movements of this nature are to be 
expected. The rate of staff turnover within the 
Analytic Solutions Strategic Business Unit (SBU) 
increased, but remained within expected levels. 
The SBU employs some 1,000 people providing 
consultancy services to the US intelligence 
community and the US Missile Defense Agency.

Technology in action
Everyday, around the world the men and women who serve our 
society and protect our way of life rely on Cobham products, often 
without even knowing it. Some of these connections are visible. 
1.  An airliner at a commercial airport can be 
carrying 20 Cobham antennas, along with 
oxygen systems, radios, navigation aids and 
computer servers to record and process 
data. If a suspicious package is found in 
one of these parked aircraft, Cobham 
equipment will be pivotal. Cabin crew will 
alert emergency services, tapping into the 
communication systems Cobham designed 
for the airport terminal. 
2.  Emergency services will swing into action 
and airport security might deploy Cobham 
wireless security systems, with the control 
room security team watching and listening 
for anything amiss using covert cameras 
and sensors.
3.  Cobham’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal or 
EOD command post from Telerob will be 
scrambled into action, driving to within a 
safe distance of the aircraft. It will be fitted 
with an impressive array of antennas, lights 
and cameras, with the camera perhaps 
supplied from a recent acquisition, RVision. 
4.  From a special platform on the vehicle, a 
small UAV will deploy to provide an aerial 
surveillance picture, monitored from inside 
the vehicle. The UAV can be fitted with 
Cobham video and control links plus 
sensors, as can the unmanned ground 
vehicle or robot, which will leave the back 
of the vehicle, track toward the aircraft 
and climb the aircraft stairs. It will send live 
pictures back to the command post, which 
can rebroadcast them to a control room 
in the airport, as well as individuals who 
are carrying handheld terminals originally 
developed by Cobham for soldier systems.
5.  With a highly dexterous manipulator arm, 
the UGV will change tools to first remove 
bags blocking its way, and then carefully 
open overhead compartments. 
6.  If a suspect package is found, the robot will 
again change its tools to gently swab the 
package, before retracing its steps to the 
command vehicle and placing the sample 
into a special compartment in the side of 
the vehicle for analysis to check if chemical 
weapons are involved. Based on the analysis, 
the robot will return to the package to deal 
with it accordingly. No human will be put 
in harm’s way throughout this process.

But in many cases, Cobham’s technology is unseen, providing 
a critical enabling capability that helps our customers meet 
their most demanding missions, civil or military.
  More than ever before, the modern military 
unit depends on information. And so often, 
without knowing it, they depend on Cobham.
  Every day, personnel of more than 18 
armed forces rely on Cobham technologies 
to gather, receive, interpret and transmit 
vital operational data between sensors, 
platforms and people.
1.  Before a convoy leaves the safety of its 
compound, Cobham technology is at work. 
Global Hawk, Predator and Scan Eagle 
unmanned systems gather intelligence 
and communicate through Cobham-built 
command and control uplinks, antennas 
and microwave assemblies, surveying the 
convoy’s intended route to detect enemy 
forces or other dangers.
2.  At brigade and battalion headquarters, this 
intelligence is received, reviewed and shared 
across the network via another variety of 
Cobham antennas that allow continuous 
line of sight communication with ground 
units operating in forward areas.
  Should an Improvised Explosive Device 
be spotted, airborne US Navy Prowler and 
Growler aircraft will jam the signals used 
to detonate it, partly through the Cobham 
transmitters at the heart of their electronic 
warfare suites.
3.  Meanwhile bomb disposal units can move 
in to defuse or harmlessly explode the 
device. They will use Cobham’s digital radio 
video data links to send robots into harm’s 
way rather than humans. And once the 
routes are clear, the supply convoys roll 
forward, communicating with each other 
and their base through Cobham’s secure, 
flexible intercom systems and radios.
4.  But the mobile convoys take no chances 
– there may be other Improvised Explosive 
Devices out there – and they employ 
electronic countermeasures using Cobham 
antennas and components to transmit their 
jamming waveforms. 
5.  And to keep them capable of working amid 
high heat and humid conditions, many 
soldiers use Microclimate cooling vests to 
survive the oven-like heat of their armored 
vehicles on typically hot and sunny days. 
These vests are also worn by the helicopter 
crews that provide additional support to the 
men and women on the ground.
6.  Should soldiers need to dismount from 
their vehicles, they can maintain total 
connection with what is happening 
around them through Cobham’s handheld 
Integrated Digital Soldier System, providing 
communications, navigation and even video 
from remote sources.

T otal revenue was down principally due to organic revenue which 
declined 7% due to continued softness in some of the Division’s 
commercial markets, particularly those relating to general aviation and 
business jets. The Division also experienced delays in the award of certain 
US surveillance programmes, such as the ‘L ’ Band relocation programme.

Results 
Orders
Orders received by the Technology Divisions 
increased by 7% at constant translation 
exchange rates to £1,642.5m (2009: £1,526.8m), 
with each of the Technology Divisions 
increasing its order intake in the period. 
The technology book to bill ratio was 1.01 
times (2009: 0.92 times). Group order intake 
at £1,798.9m (2009: £1,749.7m) was up on the 
prior year, despite a decrease in orders received 
in Aviation Services, where order intake is 
characterised by multi-year contracts.
At the year end, the Group’s order book 
was £2.5bn (2009: £2.4bn), comprising 
the Technology Divisions with £1.4bn 
(2009: £1.3bn) and Aviation Services 
£1.1bn (2009: £1.1bn).
Revenue
Group revenue increased to £1,902.6m 
(2009: £1,880.4m) primarily due to the impact 
of organic growth in the Aviation Services 
Division and favourable Australian dollar/£ 
translation exchange rates, with the average 
Australian dollar/£ exchange rate being 
AUD$1.68/£ (2009: AUD$1.99/£).
Organic revenue in the Technology Divisions 
declined 1.6% (2009: +0.6%), partly offset by 
a modest favourable impact from currency 
translation, with the average US dollar/£ 
exchange rate in the year at US$1.55/£ 
(2009: US$1.56/£). Organic growth in 
Aviation Services was 7 .2% (2009: down 3.2%).
Organic defence and security revenue in the 
Technology Divisions declined modestly by 
1.6% (2009: +7%) after four years of strong 
growth, as a good underlying performance 
in 2010 was masked by order slippage on 
specific US defence and security programmes, 
such as MiDAESS and the L-band relocation 
programme. Organic revenue from commercial 
businesses was broadly flat at -1% (2009: -16%) 
with revenue following end customer 
production, as markets progressively stabilised 
during the year after declining through 2009. 
The Technology Divisions have delivered an 
organic revenue compound average growth 
rate (CAGR) of 5.5% over the last five years as 
shown on page 21.
Technology investment
Investment in technology is pivotal to 
developing and bringing to market products 
that are in high demand and at the leading 
edge of technology. A few new PV 
programmes were temporarily slowed where 
customer launches and demand for new 
products were down in some subdued 
markets, so total PV investment in the year was 
lower at £73.8m (2009: £88.3m), being 4.5% 
(2009: 5.3%) of the Technology Divisions’ 
revenue. However, with the addition of 
increased customer funded R&D, total 
technology investment remained broadly 
consistent with the prior year at 8%.
Trading profit
Group trading profit increased to £348.4m 
(2009: £337 .0m), as the Group’s trading margin 
increased to 18.3% (2009: 1 7 .9%), principally due 
to the Technology Divisions, where the margin 
increased to 19.0% (2009: 18.5%). 
The improved trading margin was the result 
of a number of initiatives which all played 
an important role in the evolution of the 
margin. These included Excellence in Delivery, 
overhead savings from facilities that were 
integrated during 2009 and 2010 and 
procurement savings from an ongoing exercise 
to consolidate the Group supplier base. Lower 
volumes in some businesses, partly offset the 
favourable margin impacts and also reduced 
demand for a few new products, resulting in 
lower PV investment.
Net finance expense
Net finance expense was £42.3m (2009: £41.7m). 
Net interest expense on cash and debt holdings 
was higher at £40.6m (2009: £36.9m) due to an 
increase in the average cost of debt as longer 
term debt replaced a bridging facility in 2009. As 
anticipated, the net finance charge from pension 
schemes was £1.7m (2009: £4.8m). This non-cash 
item is expected to be a credit of £0.7m in 201 1.
Profit before tax
Underlying profit before tax in the year 
increased 3.7% to £306.1m (2009: £295.3m).
Economic profit
Economic profit is considered to be an 
important measure for the Group as a whole 
and for each of its Divisions, as it demonstrates 
that returns exceed the full cost of investing 
in assets. Cobham achieved economic profit 
of £185. 1m in the year (2009: £185.9m).
Economic profit is defined as trading profit 
less an asset charge which reflects the Group’s 
pre-tax weighted average cost of capital and 
which is applied to the capital invested in the 
business. This investment includes acquired 
goodwill, other tangible and intangible fixed 
assets and working capital.

Underlying Earnings per Share 2005–2010 Technology Divisions’ organic revenue growth 2005–2010
Taxation
On an underlying basis, the effective tax rate 
decreased to 26.5% (2009: 27 .8%, H1 2010: 
26.5%). The underlying tax rate is calculated by 
dividing the Group’s underlying tax charge of 
£79.5m (2009: £80.4m) by its underlying profit 
before tax, excluding the share of post-tax 
results of joint ventures, of £300.1m (2009: 
£289.2m). As previously set out, the tax rate 
benefits from consortium relief relating to 
Cobham’s investment in AirTanker Limited  
and R&D tax credits.
Earnings per share (EPS)
Underlying EPS grew 4.7% to 19.68p (2009: 
18.80p) primarily due to the improvement  
in the Group’s underlying trading margin, 
favourable currency translation exchange  
rates and the anticipated lower underlying  
tax charge. EPS at constant currency  
translation rates grew by 3.8%.
Basic EPS decreased to 13.27p (2009: 16.26p). 
This was in part due to a number of factors 
including the absence of the large 2009 
non-cash gains on the unrealised mark-to-
market of currency instruments, being a 
post-tax loss of £2.0m (2009: gain £30.9m).  
In addition, there was a previously announced 
£18.7m post-tax one-off settlement of a 
commercial dispute and higher post-tax 
restructuring charges of £9.4m (2009: £5.0m), 
which are stated net of the profit on sale of 
part of the Wimborne, UK site. These items 
were partly offset by lower post-tax and 
non-cash amortisation of intangible assets 
arising on acquisition of £40.5m (2009: £50.4m).
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 
4.372p (2009: 3.97p). Together with an interim 
dividend of 1.628p (2009: 1.48p), which was paid 
on 12 November 2010, this will result in a total 
dividend of 6.00p per share, an increase of  
10% on the comparable period. The full year 
dividend is 3.3 times covered by underlying EPS, 
with dividend payments in the year covered 
3.4 times by free cash flow generated.
The shares will be traded ex-dividend on  
4 May 2011. The dividend is payable on  
3 June 2011 to all shareholders on the register 
at 6 May 2011, subject to shareholder approval.
The fixed cumulative preferential dividend 
payment on the 6% second cumulative 
preference shares of £1 each has been 
approved by the Board at the rate of 6p per 
share (2009: 6p). The dividend in respect of the 
year ended 31 December 2010 will be paid on  
3 June 2011 to all shareholders on the register 
at 6 May 2011.

Net debt at 31 December 2010
Cash flow and net debt
Operating cash flow in the year, which is stated 
after capital expenditure but before tax and 
interest payments, was £271.4m (2009: £293.2m). 
Cash flow was affected by a temporary build  
up in working capital at the year end, which  
is expected to reverse in 201 1, relating to the 
timing of shipments. This was partly offset by 
lower net capital expenditure of £57 . 1m (2009: 
£77 .3m). Operating cash conversion was 79% 
(2009: 89%) of trading profit, before the Group’s 
share of post-tax results of joint ventures.
After lower tax and net interest payments  
and the receipt of dividends from joint 
ventures, the Group generated free cash  
flow of £218.6m (2009: £221.4m). From free 
cash flow, the Group:
•  Invested a net £5.9m (2009: £32.2m) on 
acquisitions and disposals and other costs, 
related to business combinations, relating to: 
 – £15.2m for the acquisition of RVision; and
 – £22.2m for deferred and contingent 
consideration on acquisitions and disposals 
completed in prior years and other business 
combination costs
 These payments were partly offset by:
 – the September disposal of Satori SAS  
which realised proceeds of £6.4m;
 – the first instalment of contingent 
consideration received in December from 
the 2009 sale of M/A-COM Technology 
Solutions of £5.7m; and 
 – senior loan note repayments of £19.4m 
from the same transaction;
•  Made payments of £29m (2009: nil), net of 
insurance recoveries received, relating to the 
product damages award which was previously 
announced in September;
•  Made payments of £13.4m (2009: nil) relating 
to Excellence in Delivery; and
•  Made £64.6m (2009: £58.3m) of dividend 
payments.
Treasury
The Group’s treasury activities are managed 
centrally by the Group Treasury function,  
which reports to the Chief Financial Officer. 
The Treasury function operates within written 
policies and delegation levels that have been 
approved by the Board. It is the Group’s policy 
that trading in financial instruments is used 
only for risk management purposes.
Debt and financing
At the year end, the balance of free cash flow 
was used to reduce net debt, comprising short 
term cash balances and fixed term borrowings, 
after funding and exchange movements, to 
£326.1m (2009: £412.6m). The net cash inflow  
in the year was partly offset by movements  
in exchange rates included above of £26.5m,  
as it is the Group’s policy to hold a significant 
proportion of its borrowings in foreign 
currency, principally US dollars, as a natural 
hedge against assets and earnings 
denominated in those currencies.
The Group’s year end gearing position had 
fallen to approximately 0.8 times net debt/
EBITDA with net interest well covered at  
nine times (2009: 9 times).
Included within net debt are sterling cash 
deposits, as well as US dollar denominated 
borrowings, which are held for the reasons 
described in the section on foreign exchange 
on page 24. At 31 December 2010 the Group 
held total cash and short term bank deposits, 
all with an original maturity of three months or 
less of £473.0m (31 December 2009: £366.4m).
The Group’s principal borrowings include:
•  A £300m multi-currency credit agreement 
that expires in July 2012. Interest is payable  
at the applicable LIBOR rate of the drawn 
currencies plus margin, of which £275.4m 
(2009: £266.0m) had been drawn down  
under this agreement at the year end;
•  US$1 70m of senior notes maturing in 
October 2012 with a 5.58% coupon;
•  US$350m of senior notes maturing in 
tranches in 2014, 2016 and 2019 with an 
average coupon of 6.67%; and
•  US$105m of senior notes maturing in 2018, 
with an interest rate at the applicable LIBOR 
rate plus margin.
Further details on the Group’s borrowings  
are given in note 24 to the Group financial 
statements.

Foreign exchange
The Group has identified volatility in foreign 
exchange rates as one of its principal risks  
(see contract risk – page 27) with the Group’s 
aim being to reduce, or eliminate wherever 
practical, transaction foreign exchange risk, of 
which the pound sterling/US dollar exchange 
rate is the most important. Primarily this is 
because many global aerospace and defence 
contracts are denominated in US dollars. 
Additionally, translation exposure arises on the 
earnings of operating companies largely based 
in the USA, partly offset by dollar denominated 
interest costs.
The average and closing US$/£ exchange rates 
in the year are as follows:
US$/£ 2010 2009
Average rate 1.55 1.56
Year end rate 1.57 1.61
All significant foreign exchange hedging 
transactions are approved by the Chief 
Financial Officer under delegated authority 
from the Board. In addition to the Group’s 
currency denominated borrowings, a number 
of financial instruments are used to manage 
transactional foreign exchange exposure,  
such as forward rate contracts. The Group has 
a policy of hedging at least 80% of estimated 
transactional exposure for the next 12 months, 
a proportion of exposure between 12 and 36 
months and firm exposures on longer term 
contracts. Details of the most significant of 
these instruments are described in notes 26 
and 28 of the Notes to the Group financial 
statements. Some 90% of the anticipated 
exposure to the US dollar in the Group’s UK 
subsidiaries is hedged for 2011 at an average 
rate of US$1.56.
Interest rates
The Group has various long and short term 
borrowings at both fixed and floating rates  
of interest. The Group continually monitors  
its exposure to movements in interest rates  
to bring greater stability and certainty to 
borrowing costs, with the policy being to 
assess the proportion of borrowings that are 
fixed or floating in the context of prevailing 
market conditions. Throughout 2010, the 
Group’s exposure to floating rates of interest 
on its borrowings was predominantly 
converted to fixed rate interest exposure 
through the use of interest rate swaps.
Note 28 of the Group financial statements on 
page 91 gives more details on the financial risks 
facing the Group.
Retirement obligations
The Group operates a number of defined benefit 
pension schemes, the most significant being the 
Cobham Pension Plan. At 31 December 2010, the 
Group’s net balance sheet deficit before deferred 
tax relating to its defined benefit schemes had 
decreased since the previous year end to £82.0m 
(31 December 2009: £1 15.2m). The biggest 
elements of this decrease were:
•  The net actuarial gain due to an increase in  
the value of assets of £24. 1m, partly offset by 
changes to liabilities. The largest movement  
in liabilities was a change in the discount rate 
used, which is driven by AA-rated investment 
grade corporate bond yields; and
•  Employer contributions made in excess of 
the service cost (net employer funding).

The Group’s defined benefit pension schemes

with alternative defined contribution schemes 
offered in all cases. Cobham remains committed 
to the support of the pension schemes within 
the Group and continues to work with the 
trustees of those schemes to ensure that net 
liability issues are managed appropriately.
Further details on the Group’s retirement 
benefit schemes, including the principal 
assumptions used for the actuarial valuation  
of defined benefit schemes, the amounts 
recognised in operating profit and the changes 
in the value of defined benefit schemes during 
the year, is given in note 9 to the Group 
financial statements.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with 
factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the 
Business Review on pages 12 to 19 and the 
Principal Risks on page 26. In addition, notes  
24 to 28 of the Notes to the Group financial 
statements include the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital, 
financial risk management, details of financial 
instruments and hedging activities and its 
exposure to credit, liquidity and other risks.
The Group has considerable financial  
resources together with long term contracts 
with a number of customers across different 
geographic areas. As a consequence, the 
Directors believe that the Group is well placed 
to manage its business risks successfully, 
despite the current economic outlook.
Accordingly, after making enquiries, the 
Directors have formed a judgement at the time 
of approving the financial statements that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group as a whole have 
adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Group and 
parent company financial statements.

Principal risks
The Group’s management of risk is set out  
on page 39. The Group’s approach to risk 
management is to identify key risks early and 
remove or minimise the likelihood and effect 
of them before they occur. 
The management of risk is linked into the 
Group’s strategy, the environment in which it 
operates, the Group’s appetite for risk and the 
delivery of the Group’s business objectives.  
The underlying principles are continuously 
monitored, associated action plans reviewed, 
appropriate contingencies are provisioned  
and this information is reported through 
established management control procedures. 
The process for monitoring and controlling risk 
is illustrated in the diagram below and the most 
significant risks and uncertainties which could

How we monitor and control risk
Cobham has progressively 
enhanced the compliance 
organisation across  
all disciplines. 
Business overview 26 Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Principal risks
Risk Description Impact/Sensitivity Mitigation/Comment
Shortage of 
appropriate skills
The success of the Group’s 
investment in technology 
strategic objective and the 
ability to build and maintain 
scale positions in our chosen 
markets are dependent on our 
ability to attract, retain and 
recruit the best talent.
Without the appropriate 
quality and quantity of skills 
throughout the organisation  
it would be increasingly 
difficult to execute the 
strategy and grow.
•  Rigorous talent management plans and reviews  
with an effective appraisal system
•  Provide competitive compensation packages  
that incentivise desired behaviours
•  Ensure that work for employees is challenging  
and rewarding
•  Increase participants on Group wide, coordinated 
development and training programmes
Contract risk The Group has fixed price 
design and development 
contracts which inherently 
carry higher risk than fixed 
price production contracts, 
including exchange and 
inflation risk.
A failure to anticipate and 
resolve technical problems, 
estimate and control costs 
and offset inflationary 
pressures can result in 
schedule and cost overruns. 
Failure to mitigate risk by 
accepting more contract risk 
than is warranted.
•  Thorough review of contract terms and conditions 
before signing to ensure contract provisions are fully 
understood and fairly allocate risks between parties
•  Rigorous application of the Group’s Life Cycle 
Management process to all bids, contracts and 
development projects throughout the business
•  Consistently apply meaningful metrics to support  
the review of contracts across the Group, with 
effective training
•  Maintain efficient and effective customer 
communications
•  Review and manage (including hedging) inflation  
and exchange rate risks
Change in the 
priorities or 
procurement 
practices in the  
US or other 
defence markets
Some three quarters of the 
Group’s revenue is derived 
from global defence and 
security contracts with the 
USA, accounting for some 53% 
of the total. The level and type 
of spending is dependent on  
a complex mix of strategic 
defence and security 
imperatives, economic and 
security factors.
The termination of one or 
more of the contracts for  
the Group’s programmes by 
governments, the failure of  
the relevant agencies to 
obtain expected funding 
appropriations for the Group’s 
programmes or a fundamental 
shift in how the customer 
procures products and 
services could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s 
future results.
•  Continue to ensure that the Group is capable of 
supplying the technologies, products and services  
that are core to the US defence market needs
•  Ensure that the Group is always delivering value  
for money with focus on on-time delivery, quality  
and customer service
•  Balance the Group’s portfolio by increasing the level  
of business in higher growth, emerging markets such  
as India, the Middle East and Asia
Failure to comply 
with laws, 
regulations and 
restrictions
The Group must comply  
with numerous domestic and 
international laws, regulations 
and restrictions. The Group 
operates in a highly regulated 
environment and is subject  
to the laws, regulations and 
restrictions of many 
jurisdictions, including those  
of the US, the UK and other 
countries. Amongst other 
things, these include import-
export controls, government 
contracting rules and anti-
bribery provisions. 
Sanctions for failure by the 
Group, or its sales agents, or 
others acting on its behalf  
to comply with these laws, 
regulations and restrictions 
could include fines, penalties, 
suspension or debarment  
of the Group from future 
government contracts for a 
period of time. Such sanctions 
could have an impact on the 
Group financial position and 
future operations.
•  Cobham has progressively enhanced the compliance 
organisation across all disciplines including  
contracting regulations
•  Enhancement includes numerous policies and 
procedures which are regularly reviewed, including 
procedures related to procurement and the use of 
sales and marketing representatives, whistle blowing 
and investigation
•  Training occurs on a variety of compliance related 
subjects across the Group
•  Cobham has reviewed the adequacy of procedures  
in the light of the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK

Business overview
Corporate governance
Group financial statements
Other information Corporate responsibility and sustainability
In order to execute Cobham’s strategy 
effectively, an understanding of the Group’s 
strategic position is needed in relation to its 
operating environment and the expectations of 
its key stakeholders. A stakeholder identification 
and initial material mapping exercise was 
completed in the second half of 2010 
indicating, as expected, a number of priority 
issues for improvement. The issues fall broadly 
within Cobham’s existing key focus areas:
•  Stakeholder Engagement – linking key 
stakeholder issues with shareholder value 
through corporate strategy and operational 
performance; 
•  Staff and Talent – attracting, retaining and 
developing the leadership and functional 
skills necessary for the workplace in an 
increasingly competitive talent environment; 
•  Safety, Health and Environment (S|H|E) 
– pursuing a ‘zero harm’ strategy to provide 
safer, healthier and environmentally friendlier 
operations, activities, products and services 
that will serve to attract and retain talent, 
raise productivity, improve efficiency and 
maintain community licence to operate; and
•  Business Ethics and Compliance – embedding 
a strong business ethics culture to minimise 
liability, manage risk and protect reputation  
in a highly regulated and global marketplace.
 
Business Ethics
The Group pursues and will reward the highest 
standards of ethical behaviour in all aspects of 
its business, considering ethical behaviour to 
be an asset to be valued, optimised and realised. 
Cobham’s Business Ethics programme is 
managed by a Business Ethics and Compliance 
Committee (BE&CC) staffed by senior Cobham 
executives. The Group’s approach focuses on use 
of global ethics helpline and a Code of Business 
Conduct (Code). The Code sets out the required 
behaviour in matters of personal integrity, 
stakeholder relationships and procedures for 
dealing with possible breaches. The Code has 
been translated into French, German, Danish, 
Finnish, Swedish and Latin American Spanish.  
It is published, in English, on the Cobham website. 
Each year Cobham requires all new employees  
to take ethical awareness training. All 
employees who received that training  
in prior years are required to complete  
an annual re-certification course.
As noted previously Cobham has been 
successful in training its workforce. To put that 
in context, those employees who took the 
training in 2008 and 2009 represented 99.8% 
and 99.5% respectively of the target workforce 
(3,100 and 7 ,500 people approximately).
In 2009, 99.3% of the target workforce 
completed the re-certification. As at the date 
of this report, the 2010 training courses and 
recertifications are being completed, with  
the outstanding actions being followed-up  
to provide a similarly high level of completion.
In that re-certification, employees 
acknowledge and confirm that they have read 
the Code, understand its provisions and follow 
it in their business activities. These certificates 
require an additional acknowledgement that 
employees have a responsibility to bring 
violations of the Code to the attention of their 
supervisors or report them via the helpline. 
They also require a confirmation that the 
employee has not violated the Code and that 
they have no knowledge of any unreported 
ethics violations.
The ethical training programme will continue 
to be developed such that business ethics 
issues are communicated and training provided 
at every level in Cobham. 
The Group has appointed Business Unit Ethics 
and Compliance Officers (BECOs) for each 
Cobham business unit whose principal 
responsibilities include implementing the ethics 
awareness training programme and providing  
a sounding board for employees’ concerns.  
The BECOs are further supported by Divisional 
Ethics Officers and the BE&CC that oversee  
the ethics programme and any issues raised 
through the helpline. Status with helpline cases 
is reported monthly to the Group Executive 
and a semi-annual report on the process is 
presented to the audit committee. 
The number of accidents and lost work days has reduced and 
voluntary staff turnover remains below the Group’s target level. 
Both measures are Key Performance Indicators for Cobham.
Highlights
• Key stakeholders and issues mapped  
at Group level
• More than 30% of senior appointments 
derived from the internal talent  
management programme
• Self-assessment performance baseline 
completed by all units against S|H|E 
Management Standards
• Number of accidents and lost work 
days reduced
• 90% of ethical awareness training completed

Other information Corporate responsibility and sustainability continued
Cobham has adopted and implemented  
two industry standards on ethical conduct.  
The first is the Aerospace and Defence 
Industries Association of Europe’s (ASD) 
Common Industry Standards for European 
Aerospace and Defence. The second is ASD’s 
and The Aerospace Industries Association of 
America’s (AIA) Global Principles of Business 
Ethics for the Aerospace and Defence Industry.
The Global helpline system facilitates a Group 
wide confidential case tracking system 
enabling us to track cases in a variety of ways 
and to report on a regular basis, the results of 
investigations and any disciplinary action taken, 
to the Group Executive and Board. The helpline 
is well publicised with posters advertising it at 
every site in local languages where relevant.  
A modest number of contacts to the helpline 
were made in 2009 and 2010 a number of 
which were human resources matters. 
Disciplinary action has been taken where 
required and in some cases proactive training 
delivered to individuals and leadership teams 
has been delivered as a result of the contact. 
The Group seeks to capitalise on lessons 
learned and monitors for emerging trends  
or issues at particular units.
2011 objectives 
During 2011, we plan to undertake the 
following:
•  Develop a repeatable stakeholder 
engagement process as part of our standard 
operating framework;
•  Continued focus on ethical awareness 
training and review of contacts with the 
global ethics helpline;
•  Increase the number of units at Foundation 
Level of the Cobham S|H|E Management 
Standards to 100%;
•  Introduce leading S|H|E indicators to further 
reduce accident rates and improve resource 
efficiency;
•  Undertake a greenhouse gas (GHG) assurance 
readiness programme; and
•  Conduct additional work in the areas of 
diversity, equality, community engagement 
and supply chain management.
Data verification
Cobham collects data annually on all key  
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability 
(CR&S) KPIs from its wholly-owned operational 
subsidiaries. This excludes Cobham’s joint 
ventures, for which we do not have operational 
control, and any business units that have been 
closed or divested during the course of the year. 
100% of Cobham’s operations by turnover have 
been reviewed internally to identify omissions 
and significant variations (i.e. 10%) from the 
preceding year. Cobham has commissioned an 
external assurance provider to undertake an 
assessment of its data verification of carbon/
GHG data with a view towards obtaining an 
assurance statement on its 2011 data. 
Cobham has adopted  
and implemented two 
industry standards on  
ethical conduct. 
Business overview 30 Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 DID YOU KNOW? 
Sir Alan Cobham Award
The Sir Alan Cobham Award programme is a Group wide recognition programme, highlighting those who go above 
and beyond their day job, through a peer nomination process. Each nomination is assessed by merit, to the highest 
level, against a list of criteria which establishes the contribution each nominee makes to the continued success 
of Cobham. The first winners of the Sir Alan Cobham Award scheme were recognised in the year, with 500 
receiving Gold, Silver and Bronze. Four of the Gold nominations were subsequently deemed to merit top level 
Platinum awards and received their prizes from Cobham CEO Andy Stevens. Awards were presented to 139 
nominations across five categories – Technical Innovation, Employee Engagement, Customer Satisfaction, 
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability and Team Work. All winners received certificates, with Silver, Gold 
and Platinum winners also being given Award plaques and prizes ranging from paid leave to £10,000 cash.
Deepwater Horizon oil spill
Cobham technology played a key part in the effort to track 
the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico by 
enabling real-time transmission of live full motion video 
from surveillance aircraft to observers on the ground. 
Aircraft deployed by Sierra Nevada Corporation and 
equipped with Cobham’s FM and COFDM (Coded 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) video 
products flew over the Gulf to monitor the marine oil 
spill – the largest in the history of the petroleum industry. 
Typically used for border security and defence applications, 
the aircraft’s role was to use a range of imagery and 
mapping capabilities to explore the spill and its overall size.

recommends	that	all	directors	of	FTSE	350	companies	seek	re-election	
by	shareholders	on	an	annual	basis,	all	directors	currently	in	office	will

The	Company	is	not	aware	of	any	arrangements	between	shareholders	
that	may	result	in	restrictions	on	the	transfer	of	securities	or

Significant arrangements – change of control
The	Company	is	party	to	the	following	significant	agreements	which	
contain	provisions	which	take	effect,	alter	or	terminate	upon	a	change		
of	control	of	the	Company:
•		 The	Company	has	entered	into	a	number	of	credit	agreements	with	
banks,	and	has	issued	senior	notes	under	private	placements.	The	total	
amount	owing	under	such	agreements	at	the	year	end	date	is	shown		
in	note	24	to	the	Group	financial	statements.	All	agreements	contain	
clauses	such	that,	in	the	event	of	a	change	of	control,	the	Company	
must	repay	all	such	borrowings	together	with	accrued	interest,	fees		
and	other	sums	owing	as	required	by	the	individual	agreements;
•		 Under	the	FB	Heliservices	(FBH)	shareholders	agreement	entered	into		
in	November	2004,	change	of	control	of	either	the	Company	or	its	
subsidiary	holding	shares	in	FBH,	without	the	prior	written	consent		
of	that	other	FBH	shareholder,	entitles	the	other	FBH	shareholder	to	
purchase	all	of	the	Cobham	Group’s	shareholding	in	FBH;
•		 Under	the	Sentinel	contract,	entered	into	in	March	2006,	the	Company	
must	seek	approval	for	any	material	change	in	the	shareholding	of	the	
Company.	There	is	an	ancillary	Lease	Agreement	under	which	a	change	
of	control	may	result	in	the	termination	of	the	lease	if	such	event	is	
likely	to	have	a	material	adverse	effect	on	the	Company’s	ability	to	
perform	its	obligations	under	the	lease;	and
•		 Under	the	FSTA	shareholders	agreement	entered	into	in	June	2008,		
a	change	of	control	of	the	Company	may	result	in	a	required	sale	of		
the	Company’s	shares	in	FSTA	to	the	other	shareholders.
Further	information	relating	to	change	of	control	appears	in	the	
Directors’	remuneration	report	on	pages	43	and	44	under	the	headings

People
At	the	end	of	2010,	Cobham	employed	11,375	people	(including	
contractors)	on	five	continents	with	major	population	centres	in	the	UK,	
France,	North	America	and	Australia.	
Across	Cobham,	implementation	of	organisational	structures	designed	
to	support	the	Group’s	declared	strategy	of	building	its	capabilities	across	
all	functions	continued	with	an	emphasis	on	collaboration	to	better

personal	and	professional	development.	
Cobham	is	committed	to	equal	opportunities	for	all	of	its	employees.

religion	or	disability.	Cobham	continues	to	monitor	and	improve	its	
policies	and	practices	to	reflect	the	requirements	of	age	discrimination	
legislation.	With	regard	to	employees	who	become	disabled,	the	policy		
is	to	take	all	reasonable	steps,	including	retraining,	to	ensure	that	they	
can	remain	in	employment	wherever	practicable.	The	importance	of	
employee	development	and	training	is	recognised	and	Group	businesses	
are	required	to	encourage	employees	to	take	advantage	of	available	and	
relevant	training	programmes	and	opportunities	for	advancement.
The	Group	encourages	employee	participation	and	consultation	at	all	
levels	and	also	the	sharing	of	relevant	business	information.	Such	an	
approach	facilitates	the	development	of	new	ideas	and	practices	that	
add	value	to	the	business,	promotes	team	member	commitment	and	
helps	to	focus	Company	and	employee	expectations.	In-house	
newsletters,	intranet,	extranet	and	internet	communications,	Company	
announcements,	team	meetings	and	suggestion	schemes	all	play	a	part	
in	this	process.	UK	employees	are	given	the	opportunity	to	become	
shareholders	in	the	Company	through	the	Cobham	Savings	Related	
Share	Option	Scheme	and	the	Cobham	Share	Incentive	Plan.	Under	the	
former,	employees	can	acquire	shares	through	the	exercise	of	options	
granted	at	a	20%	discount	to	market	value	with	savings	made	over	three,	
five	or	seven	years.	Under	the	latter,	shares	may	be	purchased	out	of	
pre-tax	income.

Information	in	relation	to	the	Group’s	commitment	to	Corporate	
responsibility	and	sustainability	(including	additional	information		
in	relation	to	employment	matters)	is	set	out	on	pages	28	to	31.

have	been	met.	It	is	the	policy	of	the	Company	that	all	invoices	are	paid	
within	30	days	following	the	end	of	the	month	in	which	the	invoices	are	
approved.	The	total	amount	of	the	Company’s	trade	creditors	falling	due

Corporate governance
This	part	of	the	Annual	Report,	together	with	the	Directors’	
remuneration	report	set	out	on	pages	41	to	48,	describes	how	the	
Company	has	both	applied	the	principles	contained	in	the	revised	
Combined	Code	on	Corporate	Governance	amended	in	June	2008	(the	
Code)	and	complied	with	the	provisions	contained	in	section	1	of	the	
Code.	The	Code	is	available	at	frc.org.uk/corporate/combinedcode.cfm.
In	May	2010,	the	FRC	published	a	new	code,	the	UK	Corporate	
Governance	Code	(the	Governance	Code)	which	will	replace	the	Code	
for	financial	years	beginning	on	or	after	29	June	2010.	The	FRC	has	stated	
that	changes	have	been	made	to	help	company	boards	to	become	more	
effective	and	more	accountable	to	shareholders.	Where	possible,	the	
Company	has	already	adopted	principles	from	the	Governance	Code.
Statement of compliance with the provisions of the 
Combined Code
The	Ordinary	Shares	are	listed	on	the	London	Stock	Exchange.		
In	accordance	with	the	Listing	Rules	of	the	UK	Listing	Authority,	the	
Company	confirms	that	throughout	the	year	ended	31	December	2010	
and	at	the	date	of	this	Annual	Report,	it	was	compliant	with	the	
provisions	of	the	Code.	
Share capital
Details	of	the	share	capital	of	the	Company	are	given	in	the	Directors’	
report	on	page	34.	
Board composition
The	Board	comprises	a	Non-executive	Chairman	(John	Devaney),		
a	Chief	Executive	Officer	(Andy	Stevens),	a	Chief	Financial	Officer	
(Warren	Tucker)	and	six	other	Non-executive	Directors	of	whom		
Marcus	Beresford	is	the	Senior	Independent	Director.	All	Non-executive	
Directors	are	considered	to	be	independent	and	the	Chairman	was	
considered	to	be	independent	on	appointment.	
Biographies	of	the	Directors,	giving	details	of	their	experience	and	other	
significant	commitments,	are	set	out	on	pages	32	to	33	and,	in	relation		
to	all	Directors	offering	themselves	for	re-election	at	the	AGM,	in	the	
accompanying	shareholder	circular.	The	wide	ranging	experience	and	
backgrounds	of	the	Non-executive	Directors	enable	them	to	debate		
and	constructively	challenge	management	in	relation	to	both		
the	development	of	strategy	and	the	performance	of	the	Group.		
The	attendance	of	Directors	at	Board	and	principal	Board	committee	
meetings	as	members	of	such	committees	during	the	year	is	set	out

Non-executive	Directors	are	appointed	for	specified	terms	of	three	years	
which	can	be	extended	by	agreement	provided	that	the	individual’s	
performance	continues	to	be	effective.	All	Non-executives	have	
confirmed	they	will	have	sufficient	time	to	meet	what	is	expected	of	
them	and	copies	of	their	appointment	letters	are	available	on	request	to	
the	Company	Secretary	and	will	be	available	for	inspection	at	the	AGM.	
Under	the	Articles,	Directors	are	subject	to	re-election	by	shareholders	
at	the	first	AGM	after	their	appointment	by	the	Board	and	are	subject		
to	re-appointment	if	they	have	held	office	for	three	years	or	more		
since	their	previous	appointment	by	shareholders	and,	in	the	case	of	
Non-executive	Directors,	if	they	have	held	office	for	nine	years	or	more	
since	first	being	appointed	by	shareholders.	However,	in	accordance		
with	the	UK	Corporate	Governance	Code,	which	recommends	that		
all	directors	of	FTSE	350	companies	seek	re-election	by	shareholders		
on	an	annual	basis,	all	directors	currently	in	office	will	retire	and	seek	
re-election	at	the	AGM.	In	addition,	Michael	Wareing,	who	was	
appointed	by	the	Board	on	1	December	2010,	is	seeking	election	by	
shareholders	at	the	2011	AGM	for	the	first	time.	The	Board	has	set	out		
in	the	circular	a	resolution	to	re-elect	Mr	Wareing	as	a	Non-executive	
Director	and	explains	why	it	believes	he	should	be	re-elected.	The	
Chairman	confirms	to	shareholders	when	proposing	re-election	or	
re-appointment	that	following	formal	performance	evaluation,	the	
individual’s	performance	continues	to	be	effective	and	that	the	
individual	continues	to	demonstrate	commitment	to	the	role.		
Non-executive	Directors	are	subject	to	Companies	Act	provisions	
relating	to	the	removal	of	a	Director.
The	Chairman	is,	among	other	things,	responsible	for	chairing	Board	
meetings	and	leading	the	Board.	The	Chief	Executive	Officer’s	
responsibilities	include	operational	performance,	Corporate	social	
responsibility	and	the	development	and	implementation	of	the	Group’s	
strategy.	He	focuses	also	on	long	term	growth	and	development	of	the	
Group,	its	people	and	customer	relationships.	The	Board’s	policy	is	that	
the	roles	of	Chairman	and	Chief	Executive	Officer	should	be	performed	
by	different	people.	The	division	of	responsibilities	between	the	
Chairman’s	role	and	that	of	the	Chief	Executive	Officer	is	documented	
and	clearly	understood.
The	Senior	Independent	Director’s	responsibilities	include	the	provision	
of	an	additional	channel	of	communication	between	the	Chairman	and	
the	Non-executive	Directors.	He	also	provides	another	point	of	contact	 Corporate governance 38 Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010
Corporate governance continued
for	shareholders	if	they	have	concerns	which	communication	through	
the	normal	channels	of	Chairman,	Chief	Executive	Officer	or	Chief	
Financial	Officer	has	failed	to	resolve,	or	where	these	contacts	
are inappropriate.
The	Directors	have	the	benefit	of	a	Directors’	and	officers’	liability	
insurance	policy	and	the	Company	has	entered	into	qualifying	third	party	
indemnity	arrangements	with	them,	as	permitted	by	the	Companies	Act	
2006.	The	Directors	are	permitted	to	take	independent	legal	advice	at	
the	Company’s	expense	within	set	limits	in	furtherance	of	their	duties.
The Board and its proceedings
Board	meetings,	scheduled	in	accordance	with	the	annual	timetable,		
take	place	seven	times	a	year	and	otherwise	as	required.	There	is	contact	
between	meetings	to	progress	the	Group’s	business	as	required.	Meetings	
were	held	at	the	head	office	in	Wimborne,	at	the	Company’s	London	
office	and	at	an	operational	location	in	the	US.	In	addition,	the	Senior	
Independent	Director	held	a	meeting	with	the	Non-executives	in	the	
absence	of	the	Chairman	to	appraise	the	Chairman’s	performance	and	his	
performance	was	evaluated.	In	addition,	the	Chairman	has	held	meetings	
with	the	Non-executives	in	the	absence	of	the	Executive	Directors.	
The	Board’s	role	is	to	lead	the	Group	with	a	view	to	the	creation	of	
strong,	sustainable	financial	performance	and	long	term	shareholder	
value.	In	doing	so,	it	reviews	and	agrees	Group	strategy,	ensures	that	the	
necessary	resources	are	in	place,	monitors	management	performance,	
and	supervises	the	conduct	of	the	Group’s	activities	within	a	framework	
of	prudent	and	effective	internal	controls.	During	the	year,	the	Board	and	
senior	management	participated	in	a	two	day	meeting	devoted	to	the	
consideration	and	development	of	the	Group’s	strategy.	
The	Board	has	adopted	a	schedule	of	matters	reserved	for	its	specific	
approval.	The	schedule	provides	the	framework	for	those	decisions	
which	can	be	made	by	the	Board	and	those	which	can	be	delegated	
either	to	committees	or	otherwise.	Among	the	key	matters	on	which		
the	Board	alone	may	make	decisions	are	the	Group’s	business	strategy,	
its	five	year	plan,	its	consolidated	budget,	Group	policies,	dividends,	
acquisitions	and	disposals,	and	all	appointments	to	and	removals	from	
the	Board.	Authority	is	delegated	to	management	on	a	structured	basis	
in	accordance	with	the	provisions	of	the	Corporate	Framework	ensuring	
that	proper	management	oversight	exists	at	the	appropriate	level.	Matters	
delegated	in	this	way	include,	within	defined	parameters,	the	approval		
of	bids	and	contracts,	capital	expenditures	and	financing	arrangements.	
The	Board	has	adopted	procedures	relating	to	the	conduct	of	its	business,	
including	the	timely	provision	of	information,	and	the	Company	Secretary	
is	responsible	for	ensuring	that	these	are	observed	and	for	advising		
the	Board	on	corporate	governance	matters.	The	Company	Secretary		
is	appointed,	and	can	only	be	removed,	by	the Board.
If	a	Director	were	to	have	a	concern	which	cannot	be	resolved	this		
would	be	recorded	in	the	board	minutes.	On	resignation,	Non-executive	
Directors	are	invited	to	provide	a	written	statement	to	the	Chairman	for	
circulation	to	the	Board	if	they	have	concerns.	No	such	statements	were	
made	during	2010.
All	potential	situational	and	transactional	conflicts	of	interest	are	
disclosed,	noted	and	authorised.	Procedures	are	in	place	and	operating	
effectively	to	keep	such	disclosures	up	to	date.
Board committees
The	Board	is	supported	in	its	work	by	a	number	of	committees.	
Information	relating	to	the	nomination	and	audit	committees	appears	
below	and	the	activities	of	the	remuneration	committee	are	described		
in	the	Directors’	remuneration	report	on	pages	41	to	48.	The	Company	
Secretary	acts	as	secretary	to	all	Board	committees.	Committee	
chairmen	provide	oral	reports	on	the	work	undertaken	by	their	
committees	at	the	following	Board	meeting.	
Other	Board	committees	include	the	executive	directors	committee.		
The	Executive	Directors	are	members	of	this	committee	under	the	
chairmanship	of	the	Chief	Executive	Officer.	The	purpose	is	to	assist	the	
Chief	Executive	Officer	in	the	performance	of	his	duties	and	its	terms	of	
reference	include	establishing	and	implementing	internal	policies,	systems	
and	controls	to	ensure	that	potential	inside	information	is	communicated	
to	it,	considered,	verified	and	released	to	the	market	where	required,		
the	discharge	of	obligations	arising	under	the	Company’s	share	plans,		
the	determination	of	the	remuneration	of	the	Non-executive	Directors	
and	the	approval	of	banking	facilities.	This	committee	met	on	13	
occasions	during	the	year	and,	in	addition,	as required	to	respond	to	
business	needs	and	market	conditions.
All	Board	committees	are	provided	with	sufficient	resources	to	
undertake	their	duties.
Nomination committee
John	Devaney	is	the	Chairman	of	this	committee.	The	other	members	
are	Peter	Hooley,	Marcus	Beresford,	John	Patterson,	Mark	Ronald,		
Mike	Hagee	and	Michael	Wareing.	John	Devaney	joined	the	committee	
in	February	2010	and	Michael	Wareing	joined	in	December	2010.		
All	current	members	of	the	committee	are	independent.	Details	of		
their	qualifications	and	experience	are	set	out	on	pages	32	to	33.		
During	the	year	the	committee	met	on	four	occasions.
The	committee’s	terms	of	reference,	which	were	reviewed	during		
the	year,	are	available	on	the	Company’s	website	or	on	application		
to	the	Company	Secretary.	The	committee’s	main	duties	are	to	review	the	
structure,	size	and	composition	of	the	Board	and	to	consider	succession	
planning	for	Directors	and	other	senior	executives.	The	committee	dealt	with	
these	matters	during	the	year	and,	in	addition,	made	recommendations	
regarding	the	re-election	and	re-appointment	of	certain	Directors	at	the	
2010	AGM,	and	was	engaged	in	searching,	with	the	assistance	of	external	
search	consultants,	for	Michael	Wareing.	The	committee	is	cognisant	of	
the	need	for	diversity	when	considering	the	composition	of	the	Board.
The	nomination	committee	evaluates	the	balance	of	skills,	knowledge	
and	experience	of	the	Board.
The	significant	commitments	of	the	Chairman	and	other	Non-executive	
Directors	were	disclosed	to	the	Board	before	appointment	and	any	
changes	are	reported	to	the	Board	as	they	arise.	Changes	during	the	year	
are	noted	in	the	personal	biographies	on	pages	32	and	33.
Directors’ professional development
On	appointment,	Directors	undertake	a	structured	induction	programme	
in	the	course	of	which	they	receive	information	about	the	operations	
and	activities	of	the	Group,	the	role	of	the	Board	and	the	matters	
reserved	for	its	decision,	the	Company’s	corporate	governance	practices	
and	procedures	and	their	duties,	responsibilities	and	obligations	as	
Directors	of	a	listed	public	limited	company.	This	is	supplemented	by	 39 www.cobham.com Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010

Training	for	Directors	is	available	as	required	and	is	provided	mainly		
by	means	of	external	courses	or	in-house	presentations.	In	addition,	
Directors’	knowledge	of	the	legal	and	regulatory	environment	is	updated	
through	the	provision	of	information	by	the	Group’s	advisors	and	by	
means	of	regular	briefings	from	the	Company	Secretary.	As	part	of	the	
Executive	Director	development	programme	and	with	the	agreement		
of	the	Board,	Warren	Tucker	was	appointed	Non-executive	Director	of	
Reckitt	Benckiser	Group	plc	on	24	February	2010.
Performance evaluation
The	Board	conducts	an	evaluation	of	its	activities	on	an	annual	basis.	
During	2010,	the	Board	undertook	an	internal	evaluation.	The	evaluation	
included	the	review	of	actions	taken	in	response	to	the	2009	external	
evaluation	and	discussions	with	each	member	of	the	Board	as	to	its	
effectiveness	with	the	Chairman.	The	Board	considered	the	output	and	
has	approved	an	action	plan	to	address	issues	arising.
Succession planning
Succession	planning	takes	place	at	Board	and	senior	management	level	
on	a	regular	basis	to	ensure	that	the	Group	is	managed	by	executives	
with	the	necessary	skills,	experience	and	knowledge.	The	Board	has	a	
role	to	play	in	overseeing	the	development	of	management	resources		
in	the	Group.	Specifically,	the	Board	wants	to	see	depth	and	quality	in	
management	and	robust	processes	are	in	place	to	help	the	Board	in	
this task.	
Succession	planning	for	Non-executive	Directors	is	based	on	maintaining	
a	depth	of	knowledge	and	experience	on	the	Board.	The	nomination	
committee	actively	manages	Non-executive	Director	succession	having	
regard	to	anticipated	retirement	dates	for	existing	Directors	and	initiates	
focused	searches	for	Non-executive	Directors	as	positions	are	required.	
Financial reporting
In	the	Directors’	view,	the	Annual	Report	and	Accounts	for	2010,	
together	with	the	interim	management	statements,	the	interim	report	
and	other	reports	made	during	the	year,	present	a	balanced	and	
understandable	assessment	of	the	Group’s	position	and	prospects.	
The	Directors	have	adopted	the	going	concern	basis	in	preparing	the	
Annual	Report	and	Accounts	as	stated	in	the	Financial	review	on	pages	
20	to	25.
Internal control and risk management
The	Group	operates	under	a	system	of	internal	controls	which	has	been	
developed	and	refined	over	time	to	meet	its	needs	and	the	risks	and	
opportunities	to	which	it	is	exposed.	This	includes	a	strategic	planning	
process	involving	the	preparation	of	a	five	year	plan,	a	comprehensive	
budgeting	system	with	an	annual	budget	which	is	approved	by	the	
Board,	the	regular	revision	of	forecasts	for	the	year,	the	monitoring	of	
financial	performance	and	the	appropriate	delegation	of	authorities	to	
operational	management.	Delegations	and	other	operational	controls	
are	contained	in	the	Corporate	Framework	and	the	Group	Finance	
Manual.	Specifically	with	regard	to	the	financial	reporting	process	and	
the	preparation	of	the	Group	financial	statements,	the	system	includes	
an	annual	and	semi-annual	representation	letter	from	all	business	units.	
Included	in	those	letters	are	written	acknowledgements	that	financial	
reporting	is	based	upon	reliable	data	and	that	the	results	are	properly	
stated	in	accordance	with	Group	policies.	The	review	and	monitoring		
of	the	effectiveness	of	the	internal	controls	including,	but	not	limited	to,	
financial	controls	and	the	Group’s	risk	management	systems	is	delegated	
to	the	audit	committee.
Risk	management	is	an	integral	part	of	the	system	of	internal	control.	
Divisional	Presidents	are	required	to	ensure	that	appropriate	processes,	
including	the	maintenance	of	divisional	risk	registers,	exist	to	identify		
and	manage	risks	and	to	regularly	carry	out	formal	risk	assessments.		
The	executive	risk	committee	established	in	2009	undertakes	a	top	level	
review	of	significant	risks	and	the	Chief	Executive	Officer	reports	
regularly	to	the	Board	on	their	mitigation.	
The	latest	principal	risks	are	highlighted	on	pages	26	to	27 .
The	Board	is	responsible	for	the	Group’s	system	of	internal	control,	the	
aim	of	which	is	to	manage	risks	that	are	significant	to	the	fulfilment	of	
the	Group’s	business	objectives	and	to	contribute	to	the	safeguarding		
of	shareholders’	investment	and	the	Company’s	assets.	The	audit	
committee	is	responsible	for	monitoring	and	reviewing	the	effectiveness	
of	the	system.	However,	such	a	system	is	designed	to	manage	rather	
than	eliminate	the	risk	of	failure	to	achieve	business	objectives,	and	can	
only	provide	reasonable	and	not	absolute	assurance	against	material	
misstatement	or	loss.
The	Board	confirms	that	there	is	an	ongoing	process	for	identifying,	
evaluating	and	managing	the	significant	risks	faced	by	the	Group.		
This	process,	which	has	been	in	place	for	the	year	under	review	and	up		
to	the	date	of	approval	of	the	Annual	Report	and	financial	statements,		
is	reviewed	in	accordance	with	the	guidance	for	Directors	on	internal	
control	issued	by	the	Financial	Reporting	Council.	
The	audit	committee	monitors	the	adequacy	of	internal	financial	
controls	and	compliance	with	Group	standards	through	a	combination	
of	a	self-assessment	process	involving	all	subsidiaries	supplemented	by	
regular	financial	assurance	reviews	and	visits.	The	Board	receives	reports	
on	a	regular	basis	from	the	executive	and	audit	committees	in	relation		
to	the	effectiveness	of	the	Group’s	system	of	internal	control	and	has,	
accordingly,	reviewed	the	effectiveness	of	the	Group’s	system	of	internal	
control	in	respect	of	2010.	The	review	covered	all	material	controls,	
including	financial,	operational	and	compliance	controls	and	risk	
management	systems.
Audit committee 
The	Chairman	of	the	committee	is	Peter	Hooley.	He	is	an	independent	
Director.	The	Board	is	satisfied,	since	he	was	a	Finance	Director	of	a	
FTSE100	company	until	mid-2006,	has	been	Chairman	of	the	audit	
committee	for	nine	years	and	is	a	chartered	accountant,	that	he	has	
‘recent	and	relevant	financial	experience’	as	required	by	the	Code.
The	other	members	of	the	committee,	all	of	whom	are	independent	
Directors,	are	Marcus	Beresford,	Mike	Hagee,	John	Patterson	and		
Michael	Wareing.	Details	of	their	experience	are	set	out	on	pages	32		
to	33.	During	the	year,	the	committee	met	on	four	occasions.	
Michael	Wareing	was	appointed	as	Chairman	elect	of	the	audit	
committee	in	December	2010	and	will	assume	its	chairmanship	at		
the	retirement	of	Peter	Hooley	at	the	AGM	in	May	2011.	Michael	Wareing	 	
is	also	considered	to	have	recent	and	relevant	financial	experience	
gained	in	his	executive	role	at	KPMG. Corporate governance 40 Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010
Corporate governance continued
The	committee’s	terms	of	reference,	which	were	reviewed	during		
the	year,	are	available	on	the	Company’s	website	or	on	application	to		
the	Company	Secretary.	The	committee’s	main	duties	are	to	monitor		
the	integrity	of	the	Company’s	financial	statements	and	any	formal	
announcements	relating	to	its	financial	performance,	to	consider		
the	effectiveness	of	the	Group’s	internal	financial	control	systems,		
to	monitor	and	review	the	effectiveness	of	the	Group’s	internal		
audit	activities,	to	make	recommendations	as	to	the	appointment,	
remuneration	and	terms	of	engagement	of	the	external	auditors,	to	
monitor	and	review	the	external	auditors’	independence	and	objectivity	
and	the	effectiveness	of	the	audit	process	and	to	review	arrangements	
by	which	the	Group’s	employees	may	confidentially	raise	concerns	about	
possible	improprieties.	In	relation	to	the	latter,	it	is	the	committee’s	
objective	to	ensure	that	arrangements	are	in	place	for	the	proportionate	
and	independent	investigation	of	such	matters	and	for	appropriate	
follow	up	action	to	be	taken.
Meetings	of	the	committee	are	normally	attended	by	invitation	for	part	
by	the	Chief	Financial	Officer,	senior	employees	with	responsibilities	in	
relation	to	finance,	accounting	and	financial	control,	financial	assurance	
and	the	external	auditors.	In	addition,	the	committee	holds	meetings	
with	the	external	auditors	and	the	Head	of	Financial	Assurance	in	the	
absence	of	executive	management.	Invitations	to	non-members	are		
at	the	discretion	of	the	committee.
During	the	year,	the	committee	considered	reports	from	the	external	
auditors	and	the	Head	of	Financial	Assurance	as	well	as	reports	on	risk	
management	and	internal	controls.	Reports	were	also	considered	on	a	
number	of	matters	including	the	pension	scheme,	treasury	and	funding	
plans,	taxation,	disaster	recovery	planning	and	corporate	governance	
issues.	The	Group	has	an	anti-bribery,	anti-corruption	policy	and	
arrangements	for	handling	whistle-blowing	and	the	committee	regularly	
receives	and	considers	reports	on	calls	made	to	the	helpline.	In	2010,	
both	the	committee	and	the	Board	reviewed	the	Group’s	procedures		
in	the	light	of	the	Bribery	Act	2010	in	the	UK.
	
The	committee	believes	that	the	current	arrangements	comprising		
a	rotational	programme	of	internal	financial	control	reviews	by	the	
financial	assurance	function,	business	reviews	carried	out	by	the		
Chief	Executive	Officer	and	Chief	Financial	Officer	and	a	process		
of	self-assessment	of	internal	financial	controls	by	all	subsidiaries	
provides	appropriate	internal	audit	coverage	of	the	Group’s	activities.	
Where	weaknesses	have	been	identified,	plans	for	remedying	them		
are	developed	and	progress	monitored.
The	committee	and	the	external	auditors	have	safeguards	to	avoid	the	
possible	compromise	of	the	auditors’	objectivity	and	independence.	
These	include	the	adoption	by	the	committee	of	a	policy	regarding		
the	supply	of	audit	and	non-audit	services	and	of	a	policy	on	the	
employment	of	external	audit	staff.	Non-audit	services,	as	defined	from	
time	to	time	in	the	policy,	can	be	provided	subject	to	pre-approval	by		
the	committee	where	the	cost	of	any	individual	engagement	exceeds		
a	pre-defined	limit.	The	committee	has	received	reports	from	the	
external	auditors	confirming	their	independence	and	objectivity.
The	external	auditors	operate,	in	relation	to	the	senior	engagement	
auditor,	a	rotation	policy	after	five	years	and	the	current	audit	partner	
was	appointed	in	early	2009.	The	committee	has	reviewed	the	
effectiveness	of	the	external	auditors	and	has	recommended	that	a	
resolution	is	proposed	at	the	AGM	to	re-appoint	the	external	auditors	
and	to	allow	the	Board	to	set	their	remuneration.	The	committee	is	
satisfied	that	the	external	auditors	remain	independent.
Fees	paid	to	the	external	auditors	during	the	year	are	set	out	in	note	2		
to	the	Group	financial	statements.
Shareholder relations
The	Board	is	accountable	to	shareholders	for	the	performance	and	
activities	of	the	Group	and	engages	in	regular	dialogue	with	them.	
During	the	year	the	Chairman,	Chief	Executive	Officer	and	Chief	Financial	
Officer	held	regular	meetings	with	shareholders	to	discuss	information	
made	public	by	the	Group.	
In	November	2010,	a	presentation	on	the	Group	for	shareholders	took	
place	in	London.	This	presentation	was	made	available	for	viewing	as	a	
webcast	on	the	investor	relations	section	of	the	Company’s	website	at	
www.cobhaminvestors.com.	There	were	opportunities	during	the	
year	for	fund	managers	and	others	to	see	Cobham	products	and		
to	learn	about	them	through	access	to	and	dialogue	with	operational	
management.	Presentations	were	given	on	the	day	of	the	
announcement	of	the	preliminary	and	interim	results.	Copies	of	the	
associated	presentation	materials,	together	with	webcasts,	can	also		
be	accessed	at	www.cobhaminvestors.com.	Presentations	are	
conducted	in	accordance	with	the	FSA’s	Disclosure	Rules	on	the	
dissemination	of	inside	information	to	ensure	the	protection	of	such	
information	that	has	not	already	been	made	available	generally	to	the	
Company’s	shareholders.
The	Board	is	kept	informed	of	investors’	views	through	the	receipt	of	
regular	reports	from	the	Company’s	brokers	and	updates	from	the	
Chairman,	Chief	Executive	Officer	and	Chief	Financial	Officer.	Any	
significant	correspondence	with	shareholders	is	also	made	available.
Communication	with	shareholders	takes	place	via	RNS	announcements,	
the	Company’s	website,	the	Annual	Report,	the	interim	management	
statements	and	at	the	AGM.	The	AGM	is	attended	by	all	Directors		
and	shareholders	have	the	opportunity	to	hear	a	statement	as	to	
progress	made	during	the	year,	to	question	the	Board	on	its	stewardship	
of	the	Company	and	to	meet	Directors	informally.	The	results	of	the	
votes	on	the	resolutions	proposed	at	the	AGM	are	published	on	the

Remuneration committee
The	committee’s	main	duties	are	to	make	recommendations	to	the	
Board	on	the	Group’s	policies	on	Executive	Directors’	remuneration	and		
to	determine,	on	the	Board’s	behalf,	the	specific	remuneration	packages	
of	the	Chairman,	Executive	Directors	and	the	Group	Executive.		
The	committee’s	terms	of	reference	are	available	on	the	Company’s	
website	or	on	application	to	the	Company	Secretary.	
The	committee	consists	exclusively	of	independent	Non-executive	
Directors	and	its	members	are	John	Patterson	(Chairman),	Marcus	
Beresford,	John	Devaney,	Mike	Hagee,	Peter	Hooley	and	Mark	Ronald.	
John	Devaney	joined	the	committee	in	February	2010.	Committee	
meetings,	scheduled	in	accordance	with	the	annual	timetable,	take	place	
at	least	three	times	a	year	and	otherwise	as	required.	The	Chief	Executive	
Officer	and	Executive	Vice	President	Human	Resources	are	invited	to	
attend	meetings	of	the	committee,	other	than	when	their	own	
remuneration	is	being	discussed.
The	committee	received	advice	during	the	year	from	Deloitte	LLP	on	
remuneration	strategy,	incentive	design	and	market	data.	Additional	
advice	was	received	from	the	Executive	Vice	President	Human	Resources	
and	the	Company	Secretary.	Deloitte	LLP	do	not	provide	other	services	
to	the	Group	or	have	any	other	connection	with	the	Group.	Deloitte	LLP	
were	appointed	in	November	2009	and	their	performance	considered	by	
the	committee	as	part	of	their	performance	evaluation.
Remuneration policy
The	Board’s	policy	is	to	recruit,	motivate	and	retain	executives	of	high	
calibre	by	rewarding	them	for	superior	performance	with	competitive	
remuneration	packages.	In	particular,	the	executive	pay	policy	for	the	
current	and	subsequent	financial	years	is	designed	to	retain	those	
executives	with	the	skills	and	experience	necessary	to	enable	the	Group	
to	achieve	its	objectives	and	satisfy	shareholder	expectations.	
Paying	for	performance	is	the	guiding	principle	of	the	Company’s	Total	
Compensation	Strategy.	Compensation	decisions	are	closely	linked	to	
the	Company’s	performance	management	system.
The	philosophy	is	to	deliver	total	compensation	comparable	to	the	
upper	quartile	of	aerospace	and	defence	peer	competitors	if	sustained	
upper	quartile	performance	is	achieved.	For	solid	performance,	actual	
total	compensation	delivered	is	targeted	in	line	with	the	market.	
The	main	elements	of	the	2010	remuneration	package	focus	on	supporting	different	objectives,	as	illustrated	in	the	following	table	which	also	shows

Corporate governance 42 Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010
The	Company’s	short-term	incentives	are	paid,	and	long-term	incentives	
vest,	only	if	stretching	performance	targets	are	achieved	and	the	
committee	is	satisfied	that	executive	management	has	acted	in	a	
responsible	and	diligent	manner.	The	remuneration	committee	considers	
corporate	performance	on	governance	issues	when	setting	the	
remuneration	targets	of	Executive	Directors	and	the	Group	Executive.	
The	remuneration	committee	has	considered	whether	the	incentive	
structures	may	raise	risks	by	inadvertently	motivating	irresponsible	
behaviour	and	is	of	the	view	that	this	is	not	the	case.
The	remuneration	committee	has	introduced	clawback	provisions	to		
the	incentive	programmes	which	will	apply	to	the	2011	annual	incentive	
and	long	term	incentive	awards,	giving	them	discretion	to	reduce	awards	
in	line	with	best	practice.
Around	half	of	each	Executive	Director’s	remuneration	is	variable		
and	is	linked	to	corporate	performance.	The	following	chart	illustrates	
the	proportions	of	the	Executive	Directors’	remuneration	packages	
comprising	fixed	(i.e.	salary	and	pension)	and	variable	elements	of	pay,	
assuming	target	annual	bonus	and	expected	values	of	long-term	
incentives	are	achieved.
Executive Director pay mix, 2010
Dilution
The	Company’s	share	schemes	can	be	funded	through	a	combination		
of	shares	purchased	in	the	market	and	new	issue	shares,	as	appropriate.	
In November	2010,	the	Company	requested	that	the	trustees	of	the	
Employee	Benefit	Trust	settle	all	existing	and	future	obligations	under	
the	Company’s	long-term	incentive	arrangements	and	Savings	Related	
Share	Option	Scheme	plans	using	market	purchased	shares.	No	further	
allotment	of	new	shares	to	satisfy	option	exercises	is	contemplated	in	
the	near	future.
Funding	of	awards	through	new	issue	shares	is	subject	to	an	overall	
dilution	limit	of	10%	of	issued	share	capital	in	any	ten	year	period.	Of	this,	
5%	may	be	used	in	connection	with	the	Company’s	discretionary	share	
schemes.	As	of	31	December	2010,	27 .9m	(2.42%)	and	15.0m	(1.30%)	
shares	have	been	issued	pursuant	to	awards	made	in	the	previous	ten	
years	in	connection	with	all	share	schemes	and	discretionary	schemes	
respectively.	Awards	that	are	made,	but	then	lapse	or	are	forfeited,	are	
excluded	from	the	calculations.
Base salary
Executive	Directors’	salaries	have	historically	been	reviewed	annually	
with	changes	taking	effect	from	1	January.	Salaries	are	benchmarked		
by	the	committee’s	advisors	against	comparable	roles	in	(i)	global	listed	
aerospace	and	defence	companies	and	(ii)	UK	based	companies	with		
a	similar	market	capitalisation	to	the	Company.	When	reviewing	salaries	
the	committee	also	assesses	the	individual	responsibilities,	experience,	
performance	and	achievement	of	personal	objectives.	
Andy	Stevens	was	appointed	to	the	position	of	Chief	Executive	Officer	
on	1	January	2010	on	an	annual	salary	of	£600,000.	His	salary	was	
positioned	below	the	market	median	with	the	intention	to	increase	
towards	the	median	subject	to	performance	over	time.	Warren	Tucker,	
the	Chief	Financial	Officer,	received	a	salary	of	£428,400	in	2010.	For	
2011,	the	annual	review	date	has	been	moved	to	1	March	in	order	to	
enable	all	aspects	of	compensation	to	be	planned	for	at	the	same	time.	
However,	given	the	wider	economic	environment,	no	salary	increases	
will	be	proposed	for	the	Executive	Directors,	the	Group	Executive	and	
certain	of	their	direct	reports	for	2011.	Other	employees	may	be	entitled	
to	a	salary	increase	dependent	on	the	performance	of	their	business	
unit,	personal	contribution	and	retention	risk.
Annual incentive
The	Company	operates	an	annual	cash	incentive	scheme	for	its	
Executive	Directors.	Annual	incentives	were	awarded	by	the	committee	
in	respect	of	2010	having	regard	to	the	performance	of	the	Group	and	
personal	performance	objectives	for	the	year.	The	maximum	annual	
bonus	opportunity	for	Executive	Directors	is	100%	of	base	salary,	of	
which	84%	is	determined	by	financial	performance	and	16%	by	personal	
objectives.	The	on-target	bonus	for	Executive	Directors	is	50%	of	salary.	
Financial	performance	is	measured	through	underlying	EPS	growth	and	
cash	generation.	Personal	objectives	for	the	Chief	Executive	Officer	are	
set	and	assessed	by	the	Chairman,	and	by	the	Chief	Executive	Officer	for	
the	Chief	Financial	Officer	and	Group	Executive.	The	committee	reviews	
and	approves	annual	incentive	awards	for	the	Executive	Directors	and	
the	Group	Executive.	The	2010	annual	incentive	awards	for	the	Executive	
Directors	were	33.5%	and	32%	of	base	salary	for	the	Chief	Executive	
Officer	and	Chief	Financial	Officer	respectively.	The	financially	driven	
performance	of	the	Executive	Directors’	annual	incentive	in	2010,	which	
equated	to	20%	of	annual	base	salary,	was	earned	as	a	result	of	achieving	
actual	Group	cash	generation	of	£218.6m	(measured	at	constant	
currency	exchange	rates	which	exceeded	the	maximum	performance	
level	of	£216.0m).	The	underlying	EPS	growth	threshold	of	5%	(actual	
result	was	3.8%,	measured	at	constant	currency	exchange	rates)	was	not	
met.	The	balance	of	the	Executive	Directors	2010	annual	incentive	was	
linked	to	the	achievement	of	personal	objectives	such	as	the	strategic	
review	and	the	Excellence	in	Delivery	programme.	
Consistent	with	prior	years,	performance	in	the	2011	annual	incentive	
scheme	for	the	Executive	Directors	will	continue	to	be	measured	
through	underlying	EPS	growth,	cash	generation	and	personal	
performance.	The	maximum	annual	bonus	opportunity	will	remain	
unchanged	at	100%	of	salary	and	the	target	will	remain	unchanged		
at	50%	of	salary.

Other	information
Long-term incentives
Executive	Directors,	senior	executives	and	certain	other	staff	are	eligible	
to	participate	in	the	Company’s	long-term	incentive	arrangements.		
In	2010,	these	included	the	Performance	Share	Plan	(PSP),	the	Executive	
Share	Option	Scheme	(ESOS)	and,	in	the	case	of	the	Group	Executive,	
the	Bonus	Co-investment	Plan	(BCP).	The	performance	measures		
against	which	PSP ,	ESOS	and	BCP	awards	vest	include	relative	TSR,		
real	underlying	EPS	growth	and	real	Economic	Profit	growth.	Together	
these	performance	measures	help	ensure	the	interests	of	executives	are	
aligned	with	those	of	shareholders	(through	TSR)	whilst	also	reinforcing	
capital	efficiency	(through	Economic	Profit)	and	bottom-line	growth		
for	shareholders	(through	underlying	EPS).	
An	exercise	was	carried	out	by	the	Chairman	of	the	remuneration	
committee	in	early	2011	to	consult	major	shareholders	and	
representative	bodies	following	which	the	structure	of	remuneration	
packages	have	been	simplified	going	forward.	Grants	of	options	to	
UK-based	employees	(including	Executive	Directors)	under	the	ESOS		
will	be	discontinued	and	replaced	with	a	further	grant	under	the	PSP .		
The	additional	grant	will	have	the	same	fair	value,	calculated	using	Black	
Scholes	methodology,	as	the	ESOS	grant	it	replaces,	thereby	ensuring	
that	there	is	no	increase	in	the	overall	expected	value	of	remuneration.	
The	increased	PSP	awards	will	continue	to	be	made	within	the	maximum	
limit	of	150%	of	salary.
In	addition,	the	EPS	and	Economic	Profit	targets	attached	to	vesting	of	
future	awards	under	the	PSP	and	BCP	respectively	have	been	amended	so	
that	they	are	determined	by	absolute	rather	than	real	growth.	Given	the	
global	nature	of	the	Company’s	business	where	the	majority	of	its	revenue	
is	derived	from	outside	the	UK,	linking	performance	targets	to	UK	RPI	is	
no	longer	applicable	as	Cobham	prices	do	not	increase	with	any	price	index	
in	any	of	its	markets.	The	Committee	believes	that	the	proposed	targets	
are	stretching	and	challenging	in	the	current	economic	environment.
Bonus Co-investment Plan
The	Executive	Directors	and	other	members	of	the	Group	Executive	
were	invited	by	the	committee	to	defer	up	to	50%	of	their	net	earned	
annual	bonus	in	2009	(paid	in	Spring	2010)	into	Ordinary	Shares	in	return	
for	an	opportunity	to	earn	a	matching	award	of	shares	against	the	gross	
bonus	invested.	Threshold	performance	results	in	invested	shares	being	
matched	so	that	a	2:1	match	is	awarded	for	maximum	levels	of	
performance.	Matching	awards	vest	after	three	years	subject	to	
stretching	three	year	Economic	Profit	growth	targets.	Economic	Profit	
targets	are	considered	to	be	commercially	sensitive	and	therefore	are	
not	disclosed	at	the	start	of	the	cycle.	The	first	award	made	in	2008	
becomes	eligible	for	matching	in	2011	and	full	details	of	performance	
targets	will	be	included	in	next	year’s	remuneration	report.	In	the	event	
of	a	change	of	control,	vesting	of	BCP	matching	awards	is	not	automatic	
and	would	depend	on	the	extent	to	which	the	performance	conditions	
had	been	met	at	the	time	and	the	period	elapsed	since	the	date	of	grant.
For	the	2011	BCP	awards,	UK	RPI	will	be	removed	from	the	performance	
conditions.
Performance Share Plan
Under	the	PSP ,	approved	by	shareholders	in	2007 ,	conditional	share	
awards	of	up	to	150%	of	base	salary	may	be	granted	annually	to	eligible	
executives.	The	individual	limit	of	150%	of	salary	can	be	exceeded	in	
exceptional	circumstances	involving	the	recruitment	or	retention	of		
a	senior	employee	by	approval	of	the	committee.	During	2010,	awards	
were	made	to	20	senior	executives,	including	the	Executive	Directors.	
The	awards,	equal	to	100%	of	the	salary,	made	to	the	Executive	Directors	
are	disclosed	on	page	47 .	
In	2010	the	committee	agreed	to	amend	the	rules	of	the	PSP	to	make	
awards	more	tax	efficient	for	UK	participants	by	offering	awards	in	the	
form	of	nil	cost	options	rather	than	conditional	shares.	The	first	such	
awards	were	made	in	March	2010.	There	is	no	additional	cost	to	the	
Company	in	providing	nil	cost	options.	
The	PSP	award	in	2007	vested	at	74%	on	26	March	2010.	The	June	2007	
award	under	the	PSP	was	permitted	to	vest	on	26	March	2010	along		
with	all	other	PSP	awards	made	in	2007	to	enable	the	holders	of	the	
award	to	receive	their	vested	awards	prior	to	the	increase	in	the	rate		
of	UK	income	tax.	The	rules	allowed	for	the	committee	to	exercise	its	
discretion	in	this	regard	and	there	was	no	other	advantage	to	the	holders	
as	the	performance	conditions	were	determined	as	at	31	December	2009.	
The	resultant	shares	could	not	be	sold	until	the	original	vesting	date	and	
this	was	observed	by	all	participants.	
Vesting	of	PSP	awards	is	based	50%	on	the	Company’s	three	year		
TSR	relative	to	a	comparator	group	of	aerospace	and	defence	sector	
peers	and	50%	on	the	Company’s	three	year	real	underlying	EPS	growth.	
Companies	in	the	TSR	comparator	group	for	awards	granted	in	2010	were:
BAE	Systems	 ITT	Industries	 Raytheon
Boeing	 L-3	Communications	 Rockwell	Collins
EADS	 Lockheed	Martin	 Rolls-Royce
Flir	Systems	 Meggitt	 Smiths	Group
Goodrich	 Northrop	Grumman	 VT	Group*
IMI		 QinetiQ
*	VT	Group	was	acquired	by	Babcock	on	9	July	2010.	In	line	with	the	previous	treatment		
of	EDO,	VT	Group	have	been	dropped	from	the	comparator	group	for	the	entire	
performance	period.
TSR-based	awards	in	2010	vest	only	if	Cobham’s	TSR	over	the	three	year	
performance	period	is	at	least	median,	at	which	point	16.7%	of	the	shares	
subject	to	this	part	of	the	award	vest	and	the	TSR-based	award	vests	in	
full	if	the	Company’s	TSR	outperforms	the	median	by	10%	per	annum.	
Awards	vest	on	a	straight	line	sliding	scale	for	performance	between	
these	levels;	no	awards	vest	if	TSR	performance	is	below	median.		
The	level	of	outperformance	required	to	trigger	maximum	vesting	is	
equivalent	to	conventional	upper	quartile	relative	TSR	performance.
16.7%	of	the	underlying	EPS-based	awards	in	2010	vest	for	compound	
growth	in	underlying	EPS	of	RPI+4%	over	the	three	year	performance	
period.	EPS	based	awards	vest	in	full	if	underlying	EPS	grows	by	at	least	
RPI+13%	per	annum.	Awards	vest	on	a	straight	line	sliding	scale	for	
performance	between	these	levels;	no	awards	vest	if	underlying	EPS	
grows	by	less	than	RPI+4%	per	annum.	 0

For	the	2011	PSP	awards,	having	removed	UK	RPI	from	the	performance	
conditions,	the	threshold	will	remain	at	3%	growth	per	annum,	with	the	
full	award	vesting	at	the	maximum	of	11%	growth	per	annum.	Awards	
continue	to	vest	on	a	straight	line	sliding	scale	for	performance	between	
these	levels.	The	TSR	metric	remains	unchanged.
To	the	extent	that	the	performance	targets	are	not	met	over	the	three	
year	performance	period,	awards	will	lapse,	i.e.	there	is	no	re-testing	of	
the	performance	conditions.	In	the	event	of	a	change	of	control,	vesting	
of	PSP	awards	is	not	automatic	and	would	depend	on	the	extent	to	
which	the	performance	conditions	had	been	met	at	the	time	and	the	
period	elapsed	since	the	date	of	grant.	
Executive Share Option Scheme
The	ESOS	was	approved	by	shareholders	at	the	2004	AGM	and	amended	
at	the	2007	AGM.	It	includes	an	‘Approved’	plan,	which	has	been	
approved	by	HM	Revenue	and	Customs	(HMRC),	and	an	‘Unapproved’	
plan	which	is	not	designed	for	HMRC	approval.	Options	to	acquire	
Ordinary	Shares	may	be	awarded	to	participants	up	to	a	maximum	
annual	value	of	200%	of	base	salary	(300%	for	US-based	participants).	
To	date,	annual	grants	awarded	to	Executive	Directors	have	been	in	the	
region	of	100%	of	salary.	The	actual	percentage	of	salary	varies	year	on	
year	since	the	number	of	shares	placed	under	option	remains	broadly	
unchanged.	This	approach	ensures	that	participants	do	not	benefit	from	
receiving	large	grants	of	options	should	there	be	a	fall	in	share	price.	
In	March	2010,	the	Executive	Directors	were	granted	option	awards	over	
approximately	120%	of	salary	reflecting	the	higher	share	price	at	the	time	
of	grant.	The	vesting	of	options	granted	in	2010	is	conditional	upon	the	
growth	in	the	Company’s	underlying	EPS	exceeding	inflation	by	at	least	
3%	per	annum	over	a	three	year	period.	Options	vest	in	full	for	underlying	
EPS	growth	of	RPI+10%	per	annum.	25%	vest	for	underlying	EPS	growth	
of	RPI+3%	per	annum.	Options	vest	on	a	straight	line	sliding	scale	for	
performance	between	these	levels;	no	options	vest	if	underlying	EPS	
growth	is	less	than	RPI+3%	per	annum.	To	the	extent	that	the	
performance	targets	are	not	met	at	the	end	of	the	three	year	period,	
options	will	lapse,	i.e.	there	is	no	re-testing	of	performance	targets.		
The	vesting	of	options	granted	to	US-based	participants	(other	than	
senior	executives	whose	awards	are	subject	to	performance)	is	
conditional	only	on	continued	employment	and	vest	in	25%	increments	
on	each	anniversary	of	grant	over	four	years.	Such	phased	vesting	is	in	
line	with	common	US	practice.
Going	forward	it	is	not	intended	to	grant	ESOS	to	UK	employees	and	
instead	the	fair	value	previously	offered	under	the	ESOS	is	to	be	provided	
in	nil	cost	options	under	the	PSP	using	the	Black	Scholes	methodology.	
ESOS	awards	will	continue	to	be	made	to	overseas	employees.
For	the	2011	ESOS	awards,	which	will	not	be	made	to	UK	employees,		
having	removed	UK	RPI	from	the	performance	conditions,	the	threshold		
will	remain	at	3%	growth	per	annum,	with	the	full	award	vesting	at		
the	maximum	of	11%	growth	per	annum.	Awards	continue	to	vest		
on	a	straight	line	sliding	scale	for	performance	between	these	levels.
In	the	event	of	a	change	of	control,	vesting	of	ESOS	awards	is	not	
automatic	and	would	depend	on	the	extent	to	which	the	committee	
determines	the	performance	conditions	had	been	met	at	the	time.		
Any	vested	awards	not	exercised	within	one	month	of	the	change		
of	control	would	lapse.	
The	ESOS	awards	made	in	2007	vested	at	100%	on	26	March	2010	based	
on	an	annualised	real	EPS	growth	over	one	3	year	vesting	period	of	16%.
Other share schemes 
The	Cobham	Savings	Related	Share	Option	Scheme	is	an	HMRC	
approved	scheme	open	to	all	UK	employees.	The	maximum	that	can		
be	saved	each	month	is	£250	and	savings	plus	interest	may	be	used		
to	acquire	shares	by	exercising	the	related	option.	Options	have	been	
granted	at	a	20%	discount	to	market	value.	The	Executive	Directors	are	
permitted	to	participate	in	the	scheme	and	details	of	their	participation	
are	included	in	Table	3b	on	page	47 .
The	Company	also	operates	another	HMRC	approved	all-employee	share	
scheme,	the	Cobham	Share	Incentive	Plan.	This	scheme	operates	within	
specific	tax	legislation	and	enables	participants	to	buy	Ordinary	Shares	
out	of	pre-tax	income.	The	Executive	Directors	are	permitted	to	
participate	in	the	scheme	and	details	of	their	participation	are	included	
in	Table	3a	on	page	47 .

Directors’ pensions 
Executive	Directors	participate	in	the	Cobham	Executives	Pension	Plan	
(the	Pension	Plan).	The	Pension	Plan	provides	benefits	on	final	pay	
principles	against	a	normal	pension	age	of	60	subject	to	actuarial	
reduction	for	earlier	retirement.	Pension	accrues	at	1/30th	of	
pensionable	earnings,	i.e.	base	salary	(capped	as	appropriate),	for		
each	year	of	service	and	participants	contribute	at	a	rate	of	7%-15%		
of	pensionable	earnings.	Contributions	to	the	Pension	Plan	are	paid	
through	a	salary	sacrifice	arrangement.
All	pensions	in	payment	relating	to	post-April	1997	rights	are	increased		
in	line	with	the	retail	prices	index	(RPI),	subject	to	a	minimum	of	3%	per	
annum	and	a	maximum	of	5%	per	annum,	with	the	balance	of	pension	
being	increased	at	3%	per	annum.	On	death	in	service,	a	lump	sum	of	
four	times	pensionable	earnings	is	payable	together	with	a	spouse’s

pension	of	two-thirds	of	the	member’s	prospective	pension.	On	death	
after	retirement,	a	spouse’s	pension	is	paid	at	the	rate	of	two-thirds	of	
the	member’s	pre-commutation	pension.	Similar	spouses’	pensions	are	
payable	on	the	death	of	a	deferred	pensioner	prior	to	retirement.
The	pension	benefits	of	Directors	who	are	members	of	the	Pension	Plan	
were	restricted	by	the	HMRC	earnings	cap	until	5	April	2006	and	
thereafter	by	a	scheme	specific	salary	cap.	Contributions	in	respect	of	
such	members	were	paid	into	funded	unapproved	retirement	benefit	
schemes	(FURBS)	until	5	April	2006.	No	further	contributions	have	been	
or	will	be	made	to	FURBS	after	6	April	2006.	Cash	payments	in	lieu	of	
contributions	to	FURBS	made	to	Directors	are	set	out	in	notes	to	Table	1	
on	page	46.	
The	policy	in	respect	of	newly	appointed	Directors	is	that	payments	by	
the	Company	to	a	defined	contribution	top-up	arrangement	or	in	the	
form	of	non-pensionable	cash	allowances	should	normally	be	2%	of	
annual	basic	salary	per	month.
Details	of	Directors’	pension	benefits	as	required	by	the	Regulations	are	
set	out	in	Table	2	on	page	46.
Service contracts
The	Board’s	policy	on	notice	periods	for	new	Executive	Directors	is	that	
these	should	not	normally	exceed	one	year.	It	recognises,	however,	that	
it	may	be	necessary	in	the	case	of	new	executive	appointments	to	offer	
a	longer	initial	notice	period	which	would	subsequently	reduce	to	one	
year.	Andy	Stevens’	service	contract,	which	was	revised	on	6	August	
2009	effective	from	1	January	2010,	is	terminable	on	one	year’s	notice		
by	either	party.	Warren	Tucker’s	service	contract	dated	1	January	2004		
is	terminable	on	one	year’s	notice	by,	and	six	months’	notice	to,		
the	Company.

Mr	Cook,	the	former	Chief	Executive,	under	which	Mr	Cook’s	services	
were	provided	to	the	Company	during	2010,	as	required	by	the	Chief	
Executive	Officer,	came	to	an	end	in	2010.
The	Company	may	elect	to	terminate	Directors’	service	contracts	by	
making	payments	in	lieu	of	notice.	Such	payments	are	calculated	by	
reference	to	the	base	salary	otherwise	payable	during	the	notice	period.

also	be	payable.	In	the	case	of	Warren	Tucker,	any	payment	in	lieu		
of	notice	shall	include	a	sum	equal	to	the	value	of	his	annual	benefits.		
The	Company	recognises	and	endorses	the	obligation	of	departing	
Directors	to	mitigate	their	own	losses.
Personal shareholding
Non-executive	Directors	are	required	to	acquire,	within	six	months	of	
election	to	the	Board,	and	hold	a	shareholding	of	5,000	Ordinary	Shares.
Ownership	guidelines	require	the	Executive	Directors	to	maintain	
Ordinary	Shares	to	the	value	of	at	least	one	year’s	salary	and	to	retain	a	
minimum	of	50%	of	net	vested	PSP	and	BCP	matching	shares,	and	shares	
equal	to	50%	of	the	net	gains	resulting	from	the	exercise	of	ESOS	options	
until	the	relevant	shareholding	level	is	met.	
The	personal	shareholding	guidelines	for	both	Non-executive	Directors	
and	Executive	Directors	have	been	achieved.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The	following	statement	sets	out	the	responsibilities	of	the	Directors	in	
relation	to	the	financial	statements	of	both	the	Group	and	the	Company.	
The	reports	of	the	independent	auditors	for	the	Group	and	the	Company	
set	out	their	responsibilities	in	relation	to	those	financial	statements.
Company	law	requires	the	Directors	to	prepare	financial	statements		
for	each	financial	year.	Under	that	law	the	Directors	have	prepared	the	
Group	financial	statements	in	accordance	with	International	Financial	
Reporting	Standards	(IFRS)	as	adopted	by	the	European	Union,	and	the	
parent	company	financial	statements	and	the	Directors’	remuneration	
report	in	accordance	with	applicable	law	and	United	Kingdom	
Accounting	Standards	(United	Kingdom	Generally	Accepted	Accounting	
Practice).	Under	company	law	the	Directors	must	not	approve	the	
financial	statements	unless	they	are	satisfied	that	they	give	a	true		
and	fair	view	of	the	state	of	affairs	of	the	Group	and	the	Company		
and	of	the	profit	or	loss	of	the	Group	and	the	Company	for	that	period.
In	preparing	those	financial	statements,	the	Directors	are	required	to:
•	Select	suitable	accounting	policies	and	then	apply	them	consistently;
•		 Make	judgements	and	accounting	estimates	that	are	reasonable		
and	prudent;
•		 State	that	the	Group	financial	statements	comply	with	IFRS	as		
adopted	by	the	European	Union,	and	with	regard	to	the	parent	
company	financial	statements	that	applicable	UK	Accounting	
Standards	have	been	followed,	subject	to	any	material	departures	
disclosed	and	explained	in	the	Group	and	Company	financial	
statements	respectively;	and
•		 Prepare	the	Group	and	parent	company	financial	statements		
on	the	going	concern	basis	unless	it	is	inappropriate	to	presume		
that	the	Group	and	the	Company	will	continue	in	business.	
The	Directors	confirm	that	they	have	complied	with	the	above	
requirements	in	preparing	the	financial	statements.
The	Directors	are	responsible	for	keeping	adequate	accounting	records	
that	are	sufficient	to	show	and	explain	the	Company’s	transactions	and	
disclose	with	reasonable	accuracy	at	any	time	the	financial	position	of	
the	Company	and	the	Group	and	to	enable	them	to	ensure	that	the	
Group	financial	statements	comply	with	the	Companies	Act	2006	and	
Article	4	of	the	IAS	Regulation	and	the	parent	company	financial	
statements	and	the	Directors’	remuneration	report	comply	with	the	
Companies	Act	2006.	They	are	also	responsible	for	safeguarding	the	
assets	of	the	Company	and	the	Group	and	hence	for	taking	reasonable	
steps	for	the	prevention	and	detection	of	fraud	and	other	irregularities.
The	Directors	are	required	to	prepare	financial	statements	and	to	
provide	the	auditors	with	every	opportunity	to	take	whatever	steps	and	
undertake	whatever	inspections	the	auditors	consider	to	be	appropriate	
for	the	purpose	of	enabling	them	to	give	their	audit	report.
The	Directors	are	responsible	for	the	maintenance	and	integrity	of	the	
Annual	Report	on	www.cobham.com	in	accordance	with	the	UK	
legislation	governing	the	preparation	and	dissemination	of	financial	
statements.	Access	to	the	website	is	available	from	outside	the	UK,	
where	comparable	legislation	may	be	different.
The	Directors	consider	that	they	have	pursued	the	actions	necessary		
to	meet	their	responsibilities	as	set	out	in	this	statement.
Directors’ declaration in relation to relevant audit information
Having	made	enquiries	of	fellow	Directors,	each	of	the	Directors	
confirms	that:
•		 To	the	best	of	his	knowledge	and	belief,	there	is	no	relevant	audit	
information	of	which	the	Company’s	auditors	are	unaware;	and
•		 He	has	taken	all	steps	that	a	Director	might	reasonably	be	expected		
to	have	taken	in	order	to	make	himself	aware	of	relevant	audit	
information	and	to	establish	that	the	Company’s	auditors	are	aware		
of	that	information.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The	Directors	confirm	to	the	best	of	their	knowledge	and	belief	that:

Independent auditors’ report  
to the members of Cobham plc
We	have	audited	the	Group	financial	statements	of	Cobham	plc	for	the	
year	ended	31	December	2010	which	comprise	the	consolidated	income	
statement,	the	consolidated	statement	of	comprehensive	income,	the	
consolidated	balance	sheet,	the	consolidated	statement	of	changes	in	
equity,	the	consolidated	cash	flow	statement,	the	accounting	policies	
and	the	related	notes.	The	financial	reporting	framework	that	has	been	
applied	in	their	preparation	is	applicable	law	and	International	Financial	
Reporting	Standards	(IFRSs)	as	adopted	by	the	European	Union.	
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
As	explained	more	fully	in	the	Statement	of	Directors’	responsibilities	set	
out	on	page	49,	the	Directors	are	responsible	for	the	preparation	of	the	
group	financial	statements	and	for	being	satisfied	that	they	give	a	true	
and	fair	view.	Our	responsibility	is	to	audit	and	express	an	opinion	on		
the	Group	financial	statements	in	accordance	with	applicable	law	and	
International	Standards	on	Auditing	(UK	and	Ireland).	Those	standards	
require	us	to	comply	with	the	Auditing	Practices	Board’s	Ethical	
Standards	for	Auditors.	
This	report,	including	the	opinions,	has	been	prepared	for	and	only	for	
the	Company’s	members	as	a	body	in	accordance	with	Chapter	3	of		
Part	16	of	the	Companies	Act	2006	and	for	no	other	purpose.	We	do	
not,	in	giving	these	opinions,	accept	or	assume	responsibility	for	any	
other	purpose	or	to	any	other	person	to	whom	this	report	is	shown		
or	into	whose	hands	it	may	come	save	where	expressly	agreed	by	our	
prior	consent	in	writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An	audit	involves	obtaining	evidence	about	the	amounts	and	disclosures	
in	the	financial	statements	sufficient	to	give	reasonable	assurance	that	
the	financial	statements	are	free	from	material	misstatement,	whether	
caused	by	fraud	or	error.	This	includes	an	assessment	of:	whether	the	
accounting	policies	are	appropriate	to	the	group’s	circumstances	and	
have	been	consistently	applied	and	adequately	disclosed;	the	
reasonableness	of	significant	accounting	estimates	made	by	the	
Directors;	and	the	overall	presentation	of	the	financial	statements.
Opinion on financial statements 
In	our	opinion	the	Group	financial	statements:	
•	 	 give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	state	of	the	Group’s	affairs	as	at	
31 December	2010	and	of	its	profit	and	cash	flows	for	the	year		
then	ended;	
•	 	 have	been	properly	prepared	in	accordance	with	IFRSs	as	adopted		
by	the	European	Union;	and	
•	 	 have	been	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	requirements	of	the	
Companies	Act	2006	and	Article	4	of	the	lAS	Regulation.	
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006 
In	our	opinion:
•	 	 the	information	given	in	the	Directors’	report	for	the	financial	year	for	
which	the	Group	financial	statements	are	prepared	is	consistent	with	
the	Group	financial	statements;	and
•	 	 the	information	given	in	the	Corporate	governance	statement		
set	out	on	pages	37	to	40	with	respect	to	internal	control	and	risk	
management	systems	and	about	share	capital	structures	is	consistent	
with	the	financial	statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We	have	nothing	to	report	in	respect	of	the	following:	
Under	the	Companies	Act	2006	we	are	required	to	report	to	you	if,		
in	our	opinion:	
•	 	 certain	disclosures	of	Directors’	remuneration	specified	by	law		
are	not	made;	or	
•	 	 we	have	not	received	all	the	information	and	explanations	we		
require	for	our	audit;	or	
•	 	 a	Corporate	governance	statement	has	not	been	prepared	by	the	
parent	Company.
Under	the	Listing	Rules	we	are	required	to	review:	
•	 	 the	Directors’	statement,	set	out	on	page	49,	in	relation	to	going	
concern;	
•	 	 the	part	of	the	Corporate	governance	statement	relating	to	the	
company’s	compliance	with	the	nine	provisions	of	the	June	2008	
Combined	Code	specified	for	our	review;	and
•	 	 certain	elements	of	the	report	to	shareholders	by	the	Board	on	
Directors’	remuneration.

We	have	reported	separately	on	the	parent	company	financial	
statements	of	Cobham	plc	for	the	year	ended	31	December	2010

Accounting policies
The	following	standards,	amendments	to	standards	and	interpretations	
which	have	been	endorsed	by	the	EU	have	also	been	adopted	with	
effect	from	1	January	2010	or	as	stated	below.	No	changes	to	previously	
published	accounting	policies	or	other	adjustments	were	required	on	
their	adoption.
•	 Amendment	to	IAS	39	Financial	Instruments:	Recognition	and

The	principal	accounting	policies,	which	have	been	consistently	applied	
other	than	as	noted	above,	are	as	set	out	below.	
Basis of consolidation
The	Group	financial	statements	include	the	financial	statements	of	the	
parent	company	and	of	all	its	subsidiaries	made	up	to	the	end	of	the	
financial	period.	
Subsidiaries	are	all	entities	over	which	the	Company	has	control,	which	is	
defined	as	the	power	to	govern	the	financial	and	operating	policies	so	as	
to	obtain	benefits	from	its	activities.	Subsidiaries	are	fully	consolidated	
from	the	date	on	which	control	is	transferred	to	the	Company	until	the	
date	that	control	ceases.	
Joint	ventures	are	entities	where	control	is	shared	with	one	or	more	third	
parties.	They	are	not	consolidated	but	are	accounted	for	using	the	equity	
method.	The	Group	financial	statements	include	the	Group’s	share	of	the	
post	acquisition	change	in	net	assets	and	the	profit	or	loss	of	the	jointly	
controlled	entity	from	the	date	that	joint	control	commences	until	the	
date	this	ceases.	
All	intra-group	transactions,	balances,	income	and	expenses	are	
eliminated	on	consolidation.	
Business combinations
Businesses	acquired	are	accounted	for	using	the	acquisition	method		
of	accounting	with	effect	from	the	date	control	passes.	The	cost	of	an	
acquisition	is	measured	as	the	fair	value	of	the	consideration	transferred.	
This	is	the	fair	values	of	the	assets	transferred,	the	liabilities	incurred	and	
the	equity	interests	issued	by	the	Group.	Acquisition-related	costs	are	
expensed	as	incurred.	Identifiable	assets	acquired	and	liabilities	and	
contingent	liabilities	assumed	in	a	business	combination	are	measured	
initially	at	their	fair	values	at	the	acquisition	date.	The	excess	of	the	
consideration	transferred	over	the	fair	value	of	the	Group’s	share	of		
the	identifiable	net	assets	acquired	is	recorded	as	goodwill.
General information
These	financial	statements	are	the	consolidated	financial	statements		
of	Cobham	plc	(the	Company),	a	public	company	limited	by	shares,	
registered	and	domiciled	in	the	United	Kingdom	and	its	subsidiaries		
(the	Group).	The	address	of	the	registered	office	is	Brook	Road,	
Wimborne,	Dorset,	England	BH21	2BJ.
Basis of preparation
These	consolidated	financial	statements	have	been	prepared	in	
accordance	with	International	Financial	Reporting	Standards	(IFRS)		
as	adopted	by	the	EU,	International	Financial	Reporting	Interpretation	
Council	(IFRIC)	interpretations	and	those	parts	of	the	Companies	Act	
2006	applicable	to	companies	reporting	under	IFRS.	
These	financial	statements	have	been	prepared	on	a	going	concern	basis	
under	the	historical	cost	convention,	as	modified	by	the	revaluation	of	
derivative	contracts	which	are	held	at	fair	value.
The	preparation	of	financial	statements	in	conformity	with	generally	
accepted	accounting	principles	requires	the	use	of	estimates	and	
assumptions	that	affect	the	reported	amounts	of	assets	and	liabilities		
at	the	date	of	the	financial	statements	and	the	reported	amounts	of	
revenues	and	expenses	during	the	reporting	period.	Although	these	
estimates	are	based	on	management’s	best	knowledge	of	the	amount,	
event	or	actions,	actual	results	ultimately	may	differ	from	those	estimates.
Standards,	amendments	to	standards	and	interpretations,	endorsed		
by	the	EU,	which	have	been	adopted	from	1	January	2010	and	which	
impact	on	the	financial	statements	are	as	follows:	
•	 Revisions	to	IFRS	3,	Business	Combinations	and	IAS	27 ,	Consolidated	
and	Separate	Financial	Statements	issued	in	January	2008.	These	
include	consequential	amendments	to	IAS	28	and	IAS	31.	Under	IFRS 3	
(Revised),	for	business	combinations	completed	on	or	after	1 January	
2010,	all	payments	to	purchase	a	business	are	recorded	at	fair	value		
at	the	acquisition	date,	with	contingent	payments	classified	as	debt	
and	subsequently	re-measured	through	the	income	statement.		
Also,	all	acquisition	related	costs	are	expensed.	The	revisions	also	
change	the	accounting	for	non-controlling	(minority)	interests	and	
changes	therein.	On	adopting	IFRS	3	(Revised)	an	immaterial	amount	
of	acquisition	costs	held	on	the	balance	sheet	relating	to	acquisition	
activity	were	written	off.	
•	 Within	IFRS	Annual	Improvements	2009	there	was	a	revision	to	IFRS	8	
which	amended	the	requirement	to	present	total	assets	and	liabilities	
by	segment.	Following	this	amendment	segment	disclosure	of	assets	
and	liabilities	are	only	required	when	they	are	reviewed	in	total	by	the	
Chief	Operating	Decision	Maker	(CODM).	Whilst	the	CODM	(the	Board)	
reviews	certain	asset	and	liability	categories,	a	review	of	total	assets	
and	liabilities	is	not	performed.	However,	segmental	asset	disclosures	
have	been	provided	consistent	with	prior	years. Group financial statements 52 Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010
Accounting policies continued
Contingent	consideration	(not	in	the	form	of	equity	instruments)	in	relation	
to	businesses	acquired	on	or	after	1	January	2010	is	accounted	for	as	a	
financial	liability.	Adjustments	to	this	contingent	consideration	is	accounted	
for	as	a	gain	or	loss	recognised	through	profit	or	loss.	For	businesses	
acquired	prior	to	1	January	2010,	contingent	consideration	is	accounted	
for	as	a	provision	and,	under	the	transitional	arrangements	within	IFRS	3	
(revised),	acquisition	cost	is	adjusted	to	reflect	changes	to	the	fair	value	
of	contingent	consideration.	Prior	to	the	adoption	of	IFRS	3	(revised)	
acquisition	costs	were	treated	as	part	of	the	cost	of	the	acquisition.
Businesses	disposed	of	are	accounted	for	up	until	control	passes	at		
the	point	of	their	disposal.	The	results	of	businesses	disposed	of	are	
disclosed	as	arising	from	discontinued	operations	where	they	meet		
the	criteria	to	be	treated	as	such.
Any	changes	to	the	Group’s	ownership	interests	which	do	not	result	in	
loss	of	control	are	accounted	for	as	equity	transactions.	Where	control		
is	lost,	any	remaining	interest	in	the	entity	is	re-measured	to	fair	value,	
and	a	gain	or	loss	is	recognised	in	the	income	statement.	The	Group	also	
treats	transactions	with	non-controlling	interests	as	transactions	with	
equity	owners	of	the	Group.
Underlying measures
In	addition	to	the	information	required	by	IFRS	and	to	assist	with	the	
understanding	of	earnings	trends,	the	Group	has	included	within	its	
published	statements	trading	profit	and	underlying	earnings	results.
Trading	profit	and	underlying	earnings	have	been	defined	as	operating	
profit	from	continuing	operations	excluding	the	impacts	of	certain	
transaction	related	costs	and	business	restructuring	costs	as	detailed	
below.	Also	excluded	are	the	marking	to	market	of	currency	instruments	
not	realised	in	the	period,	impairments	of	intangible	assets	and	items	
deemed	by	the	Directors	to	be	of	an	exceptional	nature	such	as	the	
settlement	of	a	long-standing	commercial	dispute.	
Transaction	related	costs	excluded	from	trading	profit	and	underlying	
earnings	include	the	amortisation	of	intangible	assets	recognised	on	
acquisition,	the	writing	off	of	the	pre-acquisition	profit	element	of	
inventory	written	up	on	acquisition	and	costs	charged	post	acquisition	
related	to	acquired	share	options.	Transaction	related	costs	also	include	
other	direct	costs	associated	with	business	combinations	and	direct	
costs	arising	from	any	terminated	acquisitions	or	disposals.
Business	restructuring	costs	comprise	exceptional	profits	or	losses	arising	
on	disposals	actually	completed,	as	well	as	exceptional	costs	or	profits	
associated	with	the	restructuring	of	the	Group’s	business	and	site	
integrations.	This	includes	costs	associated	with	the	Excellence	in	
Delivery	programme.
All	underlying	measures	include	the	revenue	and	operational	results		
of	both	continuing	and	discontinued	businesses	until	the	point	of	sale		
of	the	operation.	
Net	debt	is	defined	as	the	net	of	cash	and	cash	equivalents	less	
borrowings	at	the	balance	sheet	date.
Revenue recognition
Revenue	is	measured	at	the	fair	value	of	the	right	to	consideration,		
net	of	returns,	rebates	and	other	similar	allowances.
Revenue	from	the	sale	of	goods	not	under	a	long	term	contract	is	
recognised	when	the	significant	risks	and	rewards	of	ownership	and	
effective	control	of	the	goods	have	been	passed	to	the	customer,	
recovery	of	the	consideration	is	probable,	and	the	amount	of	revenue	
and	costs	can	be	measured	reliably.	In	the	case	of	contracts	with	a	long	
duration,	including	contracts	with	a	funded	development	phase,	revenue	
is	recognised	based	upon	the	fair	value	of	work	performed	to	date	
assessed	with	reference	to	completed	contract	milestones	which	have	
been	accepted	by	the	customer.	
Long	term	contract	accounting	as	described	in	IAS	11	Construction	
contracts	is	rarely	applicable	to	the	longer	term	contracts	for	sales	of	
goods	entered	into	by	Group	companies.	Where	long	term	contract	
accounting	is	applicable,	revenue	is	recognised	on	a	percentage		
of	completion	basis	whereby	a	portion	of	the	contract	revenue		
is	recognised	based	on	contract	costs	incurred	to	date	compared		
with	total	estimated	costs	at	completion.	
	
Revenue	for	services	is	recognised	as	the	services	are	rendered		
with	reference	to	the	proportion	of	the	service	delivered	to	date.		
For	‘cost-plus’	contracts	(typically	with	government	departments		
and	agencies),	revenue	is	recognised	to	the	extent	of	reimbursable		
costs	incurred,	plus	a	proportionate	amount	of	the	estimated	fee	earned.		
For	contracts	where	revenue	is	determined	on	a	unit	activity	basis,	
revenue	is	recognised	on	the	basis	of	activity	undertaken	in	the	period.	
Revenue	excludes	inter-company	sales,	value	added	tax	and	other		
sales	taxes.	
Operating segments
The	chief	operating	decision	making	body	for	the	Group	has	been	
identified	as	the	Board.	It	reviews	the	Group’s	internal	reporting	in	order	
to	assess	performance	and	allocate	resources,	which	is	based	on	the	
Group’s	operating	Divisions	and	has	been	used	to	determine	operating	
segments.	These	segments	are	described	further	in	note	1.	Details	of	the	
composition	and	purpose	of	the	Board	can	be	found	on	pages	37–38.
The	Board	assesses	the	performance	of	operating	Divisions	based	on	
revenue,	trading	profit	as	defined	above	and	operating	cash	generation.	
Interest	income	and	expenditure,	and	taxation	are	not	segmented	and	
are	reviewed	by	the	Board	on	a	Group	basis.	
The	Board	does	not	review	any	information	on	segment	assets	and	
liabilities.	Segment	assets	as	disclosed	in	note	1	have	been	defined	to	
include	intangible	assets,	property,	plant	and	equipment,	investment	
properties,	inventory	and	trade	and	other	receivables.	They	do	not	
include	tax	receivables,	cash	and	bank	balances	and	derivative	financial	
assets.	This	definition	of	segment	assets	is	consistent	with	disclosures	
given	in	previous	years	in	accordance	with	IAS	14.	
The	Group	accounting	policies	are	applied	consistently	across	all	
Divisions	and	activities.	Trading	between	Group	companies	is	contracted	
and	priced	at	arm’s	length	commercial	terms.	
Pensions
The	Group	operates	a	number	of	defined	benefit	and	defined	
contribution	schemes.	
For	defined	benefit	schemes	the	amounts	charged	to	operating	profit	
are	the	current	service	costs.	Gains	and	losses	on	settlements	and	 53 www.cobham.com Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010

(OCI)	or	directly	in	equity,	in	which	case	the	deferred	tax	is	also	dealt	
with	in	OCI	or	in	equity	respectively.	
Tax	assets	and	liabilities	are	offset	when	there	is	a	legally	enforceable	
right	to	offset	current	tax	assets	against	current	tax	liabilities	and	when	
the	deferred	taxes	relate	to	the	same	fiscal	authority.
Dividends
Dividends	are	recognised	as	a	liability	in	the	period	in	which	they	are		
fully	authorised.	
Share-based payments
For	grants	made	under	the	Group’s	equity	settled	share-based	payment	
schemes,	amounts	which	reflect	the	fair	value	of	options	awarded	as	at	
the	time	of	grant	are	charged	to	the	income	statement	over	the	relevant	
vesting	periods.
The	costs	of	awards	made	under	cash	settled	share-based	payment	
schemes	are	measured	initially	at	the	grant	date	and	expensed	over		
the	vesting	period.	The	liability	is	remeasured	at	each	balance	sheet		
date	up	to	and	including	the	settlement	date	with	changes	in	fair	value	
recognised	through	the	income	statement.
The	valuation	methodology	for	all	schemes	is	based	on	the	Black-
Scholes	model,	modified	where	required	to	allow	for	the	impact		
of	market	related	performance	criteria	and	taking	into	account	all	
non-vesting	conditions.
Where	the	terms	of	share-based	payment	schemes	have	been	modified		
as	a	result	of	acquisition,	the	costs	of	awards	have	been	allocated	between	
acquisition	cost	and	post-combination	expense	based	on	the	proportion	of	
the	vesting	period	completed	prior	to	the	acquisition	and	the	respective	
fair	values	of	the	original	and	replacement	awards	at	that	date.	
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill	represents	the	excess	of	the	cost	of	acquisition	over	the	Group’s	
interest	in	the	fair	value	of	the	identifiable	assets	and	liabilities	of	a	
subsidiary	at	the	date	of	acquisition.	Goodwill	acquired	is	allocated	at	
acquisition	to	the	cash	generating	units	that	are	expected	to	benefit	from	
that	business	combination.	Cash	generating	units	are	typically	business	units	
which	are	separately	managed,	for	which	financial	results	are	individually	
reported	and	which	generate	cash	flows	that	are	largely	independent.
Goodwill	arising	on	overseas	acquisitions	since	the	date	of	transition	to	
IFRS	is	treated	as	a	foreign	currency	asset	and	revalued	at	the	balance	
sheet	date.	Foreign	exchange	differences	arising	are	taken	through	other	
comprehensive	income	to	the	translation	reserve	and	reclassified	to	the	
income	statement	when	the	related	subsidiary	is	sold.	
Goodwill	arising	on	acquisitions	of	businesses,	subsidiaries	and	joint	
ventures	is	capitalised	and	reviewed	for	impairment	at	least	annually.		
Any	impairment	is	recognised	immediately	in	the	income	statement		
and	cannot	be	subsequently	reversed.
On	disposal	of	a	subsidiary	or	joint	venture,	the	attributable	amount	of	
goodwill	is	included	in	the	determination	of	the	profit	or	loss	on	disposal.
curtailments	arising	on	a	business	disposal	are	included	in	profit	on	
disposal.	Past	service	costs	are	recognised	immediately	in	the	income	
statement	if	the	benefits	have	vested.	If	the	benefits	have	not	vested,	
the	costs	are	recognised	over	the	period	until	vesting	occurs.	The	
expected	return	on	assets	and	interest	cost	are	shown	within	finance	
income	and	expense.	Actuarial	gains	and	losses	are	recognised	
immediately	in	the	statement	of	comprehensive	income.
Defined	benefit	schemes	are	funded,	with	the	assets	of	the	scheme	held	
separately	from	those	of	the	Group,	in	separate	trustee	administered	
funds.	Pension	scheme	assets	are	measured	at	fair	value	and	liabilities		
are	measured	on	an	actuarial	basis	using	the	projected	unit	method	and	
discounted	at	a	rate	equivalent	to	the	current	rate	of	return	on	a	high	
quality	corporate	bond	of	equivalent	currency	and	term	to	the	scheme	
liabilities.	The	actuarial	valuations	are	obtained	at	least	triennially	and	are	
updated	at	each	balance	sheet	date.	The	resulting	defined	benefit	asset	
or	liability	is	presented	separately	on	the	face	of	the	balance	sheet.
For	defined	contribution	schemes	the	amounts	charged	to	the	income	
statement	in	respect	of	pension	costs	and	other	post-retirement	
benefits	are	the	contributions	payable	in	the	year.	Differences	between	
contributions	payable	in	the	year	and	contributions	actually	paid	are	
recorded	as	either	accruals	or	prepayments	in	the	balance	sheet.
Taxation including deferred taxation
The	tax	expense	relates	to	the	sum	of	current	tax	and	deferred	tax.	
Current	tax	is	based	on	taxable	profit	for	the	year,	which	differs	from	
profit	before	taxation	as	reported	in	the	income	statement.	Taxable	profit	
excludes	items	of	income	and	expense	that	are	taxable	or	deductible	in	
other	years	and	also	excludes	items	that	are	never	taxable	or	deductible.	
The	Group’s	liability	for	current	tax	is	calculated	using	rates	that	have	
been	enacted	or	substantively	enacted	at	the	balance	sheet	date.	
Deferred	tax	is	accounted	for	using	the	balance	sheet	liability	method		
in	respect	of	temporary	differences	arising	between	the	tax	bases		
of	assets	and	liabilities	and	their	carrying	values	in	the	consolidated	
financial	statements.	
Temporary	differences	arise	primarily	from	the	recognition	of	deficits		
on	the	Group’s	defined	benefit	pension	schemes,	accelerated	tax	
depreciation	and	acquisition	accounting.	Deferred	tax	liabilities	are	
recognised	for	taxable	temporary	differences	and	deferred	tax	assets		
are	recognised	to	the	extent	that	it	is	probable	that	taxable	profits	will	be	
available	against	which	deductible	temporary	differences	can	be	utilised.	
The	carrying	amount	of	deferred	tax	assets	is	reviewed	at	each	balance	
sheet	date	and	reduced	to	the	extent	that	it	is	no	longer	probable	that	
sufficient	taxable	profits	will	be	available	to	allow	all	or	part	of	the	assets	
to	be	recovered.	
Deferred	tax	is	provided	on	temporary	differences	arising	on	
investments	in	subsidiaries,	except	where	the	timing	of	the	reversal	of	
the	temporary	difference	is	controlled	by	the	Group	and	it	is	probable	
that	the	temporary	difference	will	not	reverse	in	the	foreseeable	future.
Deferred	tax	is	calculated	at	the	tax	rates	and	laws	that	have	been	
enacted	or	substantively	enacted	by	the	balance	sheet	date	and	that	are	
expected	to	apply	to	the	period	when	the	asset	is	realised	or	the	liability	
is	settled.	Tax	is	charged	or	credited	to	the	income	statement	except

Research and development
Research	expenditure	not	chargeable	to	customers	is	written	off		
as	incurred.	Development	costs	not	chargeable	to	customers	are		
written	off	as	incurred	until	it	can	be	demonstrated	that	the	conditions		
for	capitalisation	as	described	in	IAS	38,	Intangible	Assets,	are	met.		
At	that	point	further	costs	are	capitalised	as	an	intangible	asset	until		
the	intangible	asset	is	readily	available	for	use	and	it	is	then	amortised		
on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	asset’s	estimated	useful	life.	
Other intangible assets
Intangible	assets	other	than	goodwill	which	are	acquired	by	the	Group		
are	stated	at	cost	less	accumulated	amortisation	and	impairment		
losses.	These	include	customer	relationships,	technology	and	software,	
trademarks,	licences	and	patents.	The	only	internally	generated	
intangible	assets	are	development	costs	which	are	capitalised	as	
described	above,	and	internally	developed	software	where	asset	
recognition	criteria	are	met.	
All	other	intangible	assets	are	amortised	over	the	asset’s	estimated	useful	
life	on	a	straight-line	basis	as	follows:
Customer	relationships 2	to	15	years	
Technology	and	software 2	to	10	years
Development	costs 2	to	10	years
Other	intangible	assets 6	months	to	10	years
Useful	lives	are	assessed	for	each	asset	on	an	individual	basis	taking	into	
account	the	specific	characteristics	of	the	asset.	
Property, plant and equipment
Freehold	land	is	not	depreciated,	but	is	reviewed	for	impairment		
at	least	annually.	
Freehold	and	leasehold	buildings,	plant	and	equipment	are	held		
at	historic	cost	less	accumulated	depreciation	and	any	recognised	
impairment	losses.	
All	property,	plant	and	equipment	other	than	land	is	depreciated	on	a	
straight-line	basis	to	the	estimated	residual	values	over	the	estimated	
useful	lives.	These	lives	are	as	follows:
Freehold	buildings
(including	investment properties)
50	years
Leasehold	properties The	period	of	the	lease
Plant	and	equipment 3	to	15	years
Estimated	residual	values	and	the	estimated	useful	lives	are	reviewed	
annually	and	adjusted	where	necessary.	
Assets	held	under	finance	leases	are	depreciated	over	their	expected	
useful	lives	on	the	same	basis	as	owned	assets	or,	where	shorter,	the	
term	of	the	relevant	lease.	
The	gain	or	loss	arising	on	the	disposal	or	retirement	of	an	asset	is	
determined	as	the	difference	between	the	sales	proceeds	and	the	
carrying	amount	of	the	asset	and	is	recognised	in	the	income	statement.	
Investment properties
Investment	properties,	which	are	properties	held	to	earn	rentals	and/or	
for	capital	appreciation,	are	stated	at	cost	at	the	balance	sheet	date.	
They	are	depreciated	on	a	straight-line	basis	to	their	estimated	residual	
value	over	their	estimated	useful	lives.	
Rental	income	is	recognised	as	revenue	on	a	straight-line	basis.
Aircraft overhaul expenditure
Major	overhaul	expenditure	on	owned	aircraft	is	capitalised	when	
incurred	and	the	resultant	property,	plant	and	equipment	is	depreciated	
over	its	useful	economic	life.	Major	overhaul	costs	that	are	contractually	
required	on	aircraft	held	under	operating	leases	are	provided	for	over	the	
period	between	the	scheduled	maintenance	events.	
Inventories
Inventories	are	stated	at	the	lower	of	cost	and	net	realisable	value.		
Cost	comprises	direct	materials	and,	where	applicable,	direct	labour	
costs	and	those	overheads	that	have	been	incurred	in	bringing	the	
inventories	to	their	present	location	and	condition.	Cost	is	calculated	
using	the	first-in,	first-out	method.	Net	realisable	value	represents	the	
estimated	selling	price	less	all	estimated	costs	of	completion	and	costs	
to	be	incurred	in	marketing,	selling	and	distribution.	
Financial instruments
Financial	assets	and	financial	liabilities	are	recognised	on	the	Group’s	
balance	sheet	when	the	Group	becomes	a	party	to	the	contractual	
provisions	of	the	instrument.	Financial	assets	are	recognised	at	trade	date.	
Financial assets and liabilities
Financial	assets	are	categorised	on	initial	recognition	as	assets	held	at	fair	
value	through	profit	or	loss,	or	loans	and	receivables	dependent	upon	
the	purpose	for	which	the	assets	were	acquired	and	as	follows:
•	 Assets	held	at	fair	value	through	profit	or	loss	are	those	categorised		
as	held	for	trading	under	IAS	39	and	are	classified	as	current	assets		
or	non-current	assets	dependent	upon	maturity.
•	 Loans	and	receivables	are	non-derivative	financial	assets	with	fixed		
or	determinable	payments	which	are	not	quoted	in	an	active	market.	
These	are	classified	as	current	or	non-current	assets	dependent	upon	
maturity	and	included	within	trade	and	other	receivables.
None	of	the	Group’s	material	financial	assets	fall	into	the	held	to	maturity	
or	available	for	sale	categories	which	are	defined	as	follows:	
•	 Held	to	maturity	investments	are	non-derivative	financial	assets	with	
fixed	maturity	dates	which	the	Group	intends	to	hold	to	maturity.
•	 Available	for	sale	financial	assets	are	those	non-derivative	financial	
assets	either	designated	by	management	as	available	for	sale	or	not	
falling	into	any	of	the	above	categories.	
Financial	liabilities	are	categorised	on	initial	recognition	as	liabilities		
held	at	fair	value	through	profit	or	loss,	or	other	liabilities	held	at	cost.	
Liabilities	held	at	fair	value	through	profit	or	loss	are	those	categorised	as

Preference	share	capital	is	classified	as	a	liability	if	it	is	redeemable	on		
a	specific	date	or	at	the	option	of	the	preference	shareholders	or	if

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
As	explained	in	note	28,	the	Group’s	activities	expose	it	primarily	to		
the	financial	risks	of	changes	in	foreign	currency	exchange	rates	and	
interest	rates.	The	Group	uses	foreign	exchange	contracts	and	interest	
rate	swap	contracts	to	reduce	these	exposures	and	does	not	use	
derivative	financial	instruments	for	speculative	purposes.	The	Group		
has	documented	its	risk	management	objectives	and	strategy	for	
undertaking	various	hedge	transactions,	and	utilises	hedge	accounting	
principles	in	relation	to	interest	rate	swaps.	These	are	designated	as	cash	
flow	hedges	which	mitigate	the	Group’s	exposure	to	changes	in	interest	
rates	arising	on	floating	rate	debt.	From	time	to	time,	the	Group	may	also	
use	interest	rate	swaps	to	manage	its	exposure	to	changes	in	the	fair	
value	of	fixed	rate	borrowings,	however	there	are	no	such	contracts	
outstanding	at	the	present	time.	Foreign	exchange	contracts	entered	
into	to	mitigate	foreign	exchange	impacts	of	trading	in	non-functional	
currencies	are	not	accounted	for	using	hedge	accounting.
Derivatives	such	as	foreign	exchange	contracts	and	interest	rate	swap	
contracts	are	initially	recognised	at	fair	value	on	the	date	the	contract		
is	entered	into	and	are	subsequently	re-measured	at	their	fair	value.		
The	method	of	recognising	the	resulting	gain	or	loss	depends	on	
whether	the	derivative	is	designated	as	a	hedging	instrument	and,		
if	so,	the	nature	of	the	item	being	hedged.
Where	hedge	accounting	is	applied,	the	relationship	between	hedging	
instruments	and	hedged	items	is	documented	at	the	inception	of	the	
transaction.	The	Group	also	documents	its	assessment,	both	at	hedge	
inception	and	on	an	ongoing	basis,	of	whether	the	derivatives	used	in	
hedging	transactions	are	highly	effective	in	offsetting	changes	in	cash	
flows	(or	fair	values	if	appropriate)	of	hedged	items.
For	derivatives	that	are	designated	and	qualify	as	cash	flow	hedges,		
the	effective	portion	of	changes	in	fair	value	is	recognised	in	other	
comprehensive	income	through	the	hedging	reserve.	The	gain	or	loss	
relating	to	the	ineffective	portion	is	recognised	immediately	in	the	
income	statement.	Amounts	accumulated	in	equity	are	reclassified	to	
finance	income	and	expense	in	the	income	statement	in	the	periods	
when	the	hedged	item	affects	profit	or	loss.
When	a	cash	flow	hedging	instrument	expires	or	is	sold,	or	when	a	hedge	
no	longer	meets	the	criteria	for	hedge	accounting,	any	cumulative	gain	
or	loss	existing	in	the	hedging	reserve	in	equity	at	that	time	remains	in	
equity	and	is	recognised	when	the	forecast	transaction	is	ultimately	
recognised	in	the	income	statement.	If	a	hedged	transaction	is	no	longer	
expected	to	occur,	the	net	cumulative	gain	or	loss	recognised	in	the	
hedging	reserve	in	equity	is	immediately	transferred	to	the	income	
statement	for	the	period.
The	fair	value	of	a	hedging	derivative	is	classified	as	a	current	asset	or	
liability	except	when	the	remaining	maturity	of	the	hedged	item	is	more	
than	12	months.	
Derivatives	are	categorised	as	held	for	trading	unless	they	are	designated	
as	hedges.	
When	a	financial	asset	or	liability	is	recognised	initially,	it	is	measured	at	
its	fair	value.	In	the	case	of	a	financial	asset	or	financial	liability	not	at	fair	
value	through	profit	or	loss,	fair	value	is	adjusted	for	transaction	costs	
that	are	directly	attributable	to	the	acquisition	or	issue	of	the	financial	
asset	or	financial	liability.	Financial	assets	and	liabilities	at	fair	value	
through	profit	or	loss	are	subsequently	carried	at	fair	value.	Loans	and	
receivables	are	carried	at	amortised	cost	using	the	effective	interest	
method.	Financial	liabilities	not	at	fair	value	through	profit	or	loss	are	
stated	at	amortised	cost.	
Trade and other receivables
Trade	and	other	receivables	are	stated	at	their	amortised	cost,	reduced	
by	appropriate	allowances	for	estimated	irrecoverable	amounts.	
Allowances	for	irrecoverable	amounts	are	made	when	there	is	evidence	
that	the	Group	may	not	be	able	to	collect	the	amount	due.	All	trade	
receivables	which	are	more	than	six	months	overdue	are	provided	for	
based	on	estimated	irrecoverable	amounts	determined	by	reference		
to	past	default	experience.	Amounts	which	are	less	than	six	months	
overdue	are	provided	where	recovery	of	the	balance	due	is	considered	
to	be	doubtful.	The	impairment	recorded	is	the	difference	between	the	
carrying	value	of	the	receivables	and	the	present	value	of	the	estimated	
future	cashflows.	Any	impairment	required	is	recorded	in	the	income	
statement	in	administrative	expenses.	The	balance	may	be	written	off		
in	full	generally	where	receivables	are	in	excess	of	12	months	old.	At	that	
time	any	amounts	previously	provided	for	impairment	are	released.	
Trade payables
Trade	payables	do	not	carry	any	interest	and	are	stated	at	their		
nominal	value.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing	bank	loans	and	overdrafts	are	recorded	at	the	amount	
of	proceeds	received,	net	of	direct	issue	costs.	Borrowing	costs,	net	of	
amounts	capitalised,	including	premiums	payable	on	settlement	or	
redemption	and	direct	issue	costs,	are	charged	to	the	income	statement	
and	are	added	to	the	carrying	amount	of	the	instrument	to	the	extent	
that	they	are	not	settled	in	the	period	in	which	they	arise.	Borrowing	
costs	that	are	directly	attributable	to	relevant	property,	plant	and	
equipment	are	capitalised	as	part	of	the	cost	of	that	asset.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash	and	cash	equivalents	comprise	cash	balances	and	bank	deposits	
with	an	original	maturity	of	three	months	or	less.	Bank	overdrafts	that	
are	repayable	on	demand	and	form	an	integral	part	of	the	Group’s	cash	
management	are	included	as	a	component	of	cash	and	cash	equivalents	
for	the	purpose	of	the	consolidated	cash	flow	statement.	
Share capital
Ordinary	share	capital	is	classified	as	equity.	Financial	liabilities	and	equity	
instruments	are	classified	according	to	the	substance	of	the	contractual	
arrangements	entered	into.	An	equity	instrument	is	any	contract	that	
evidences	a	residual	interest	in	the	assets	of	the	Group	after	deducting	
all	of	its	liabilities.	 Group financial statements 56 Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010
Provisions	for	onerous	contracts	are	recognised	when	the	expected	
benefits	to	be	derived	by	the	Group	from	a	contract	are	lower	than		
the	unavoidable	cost	of	meeting	its	obligations	under	the	contract.	
As	noted	above,	provisions	for	contingent	consideration	relating	to	
acquisitions	completed	before	1	January	2010	were	recognised	when		
it	was	considered	probable	that	the	conditions	attaching	to	potential	
payment	would	be	met.
Aircraft	maintenance	provisions	are	established	in	respect	of	significant	
periodic	maintenance	costs,	where	maintenance	activity	is	required	on	
leased	operational	aircraft	or	engines	on	a	cycle	greater	than	12	months.	
Costs	are	charged	to	the	income	statement	on	the	basis	of	utilisation	of	
the	aircraft.	Maintenance	carried	out	on	a	cycle	of	12	months	or	less	is	
charged	to	the	income	statement	as	incurred.
When	aircraft	are	leased,	it	is	customary	for	the	contract	to	contain	
specific	conditions	regarding	the	configuration	of	the	aircraft	on	its	
return	to	the	lessor	at	the	end	of	the	lease.	The	estimated	cost	
associated	with	fulfilling	these	requirements	is	charged	to	the	income	
statement	on	an	aircraft	utilisation	basis.	
Provisions	for	claims	made	against	the	Group	and	commitments	made	
under	performance	guarantees	are	recognised	at	the	Directors’	best	
estimates	of	the	expenditure	required	to	settle	the	Group’s	liabilities.	
Provisions	are	discounted	at	an	appropriate	risk-free	rate	when	the	
impact	is	material.
Impairment losses
The	carrying	amounts	of	the	Group’s	assets	are	reviewed	at	least	
annually	to	determine	whether	there	is	any	indication	of	impairment.		
If	any	such	indication	exists,	the	asset’s	recoverable	amount	is	estimated.	
The	recoverable	amount	is	the	higher	of	fair	value	less	costs	to	sell	and	
value	in	use.	In	assessing	value	in	use,	the	estimated	future	cash	flows		
are	discounted	to	their	present	value	using	a	pre-tax	discount	rate	that	
reflects	current	market	assessments	of	the	time	value	of	money	and		
the	risks	specific	to	the	asset	for	which	the	estimates	of	future	cash		
flows	have	not	been	adjusted.
An	impairment	loss	is	recognised	where	the	carrying	amount	of	an		
asset	is	higher	than	its	recoverable	amount.	An	intangible	asset	with		
an	indefinite	useful	life	is	tested	for	impairment	annually	and	whenever	
there	is	an	indication	that	the	asset	may	be	impaired.	Any	impairment	
losses	are	recognised	in	the	income	statement.	
An	impairment	loss	(other	than	arising	on	goodwill)	is	reversed	only		
after	a	change	in	the	estimates	used	to	assess	recoverable	amount	and	
only	to	the	extent	that	the	asset’s	carrying	amount	does	not	exceed	the	
carrying	amount	that	would	have	been	determined,	net	of	depreciation	
or	amortisation,	if	no	impairment	loss	had	been	recognised.	Any	reversal	
is	recognised	in	the	income	statement.
Where	hedge	accounting	is	not	applied,	movements	in	fair	values	are	
included	in	the	income	statement	as	part	of	operating	profit.	The	fair	
value	of	such	derivatives	is	classified	as	a	current	or	non-current	asset		
or	liability	dependent	upon	the	maturity	of	the	derivative	contracts.	
Foreign currencies
The	presentation	currency	of	the	Group	is	sterling.	Most	Group	
companies,	including	the	parent	company,	use	their	local	currency	as	
their	functional	currency.	Transactions	in	currencies	other	than	the	
functional	currency	are	translated	at	the	exchange	rate	ruling	at	the		
date	of	the	transaction.	Monetary	assets	and	liabilities	denominated	in	
non-functional	currencies	are	retranslated	at	the	exchange	rate	ruling		
at	the	balance	sheet	date	and	any	exchange	differences	arising	are		
taken	to	the	income	statement.	
As	noted	above,	in	order	to	manage	its	exposure	to	certain	foreign	
exchange	risks	the	Group	enters	into	forward	contracts,	which	are	
accounted	for	as	derivative	financial	instruments.
For	consolidation	purposes	the	assets	and	liabilities	of	overseas	
subsidiary	undertakings	and	joint	ventures	are	translated	at	the	closing	
exchange	rates.	Income	statements	of	such	undertakings	are	
consolidated	at	the	average	rates	of	exchange	as	an	approximation		
for	actual	rates	during	the	year.	Exchange	differences	arising	on	these	
translations	are	accounted	for	in	other	comprehensive	income	and		
the	translation	reserve.
Leasing
Leases	are	classified	as	finance	leases	whenever	the	terms	of	the	lease	
transfer	substantially	all	the	risks	and	rewards	of	ownership	to	the	lessee.	
All	other	leases	are	classified	as	operating	leases.	
Assets	held	under	finance	leases	are	recognised	as	assets	of	the	Group		
at	their	fair	value	or,	if	lower,	at	the	present	value	of	the	minimum		
lease	payments,	each	determined	at	the	inception	of	the	lease.	The	
corresponding	liability	to	the	lessor	is	included	in	the	balance	sheet	as		
a	finance	lease	obligation.	Lease	payments	are	apportioned	between	
finance	charges	and	reduction	of	the	lease	obligation	so	as	to	achieve		
a	constant	rate	of	interest	on	the	remaining	balance	of	the	liability.	
Finance	charges	are	charged	directly	to	the	income	statement.
Rentals	payable	under	operating	leases	are	charged	to	the	income	
statement	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	term	of	the	relevant	lease.
Benefits	received	and	receivable	as	an	incentive	to	enter	into	an		
operating	lease	are	also	spread	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	lease	term.
Provisions
A	provision	is	required	when	the	Group	has	a	present	legal	or	
constructive	obligation	as	a	result	of	a	past	event	and	it	is	probable	that	
settlement	will	be	required	of	an	amount	that	can	be	reliably	estimated.
Provisions	for	warranty	costs	are	recognised	at	the	date	of	sale	of	the	
relevant	products,	at	the	Directors’	best	estimate	of	the	expenditure	
required	to	settle	the	Group’s	liability.

Retirement benefits
The	Group	financial	statements	include	costs	and	liabilities	in	relation	to	
retirement	benefit	obligations.	A	number	of	assumptions	are	made	in	
assessing	the	costs	and	present	value	of	the	pension	assets	and	liabilities	
which	include	the	long-term	rate	of	increase	of	salary	costs,	discount	
rate,	inflation,	the	expected	return	on	plan	assets	and	mortality	rates.	
The	Group	uses	published	indices	and	independent	actuarial	advice	to

Provisions and contingent liabilities
The	consolidated	financial	statements	include	appropriate	provisions		
for	the	estimated	outcome	of	commercial	disputes.	No	such	provision		
is	included	for	contingent	liabilities.	Due	to	the	significant	uncertainty	
associated	with	the	future	level	of	such	claims	and	contingencies	and	of	
the	costs	arising	out	of	any	related	litigation,	there	can	be	no	guarantee	
that	the	assumptions	used	to	estimate	the	provision	will	result	in	an	
accurate	prediction	of	the	actual	costs	that	may	be	incurred	and,	as	a	
result,	the	provision	may	be	subject	to	revisions	from	time	to	time	if	new	
information	becomes	available	as	a	result	of	future	events.	The	Directors

historical	experience	and	other	factors,	including	expectations	of	future	
events	that	are	believed	to	be	reasonable	under	the	circumstances.		
The	current	economic	conditions	have	been	considered	when	
evaluating	accounting	estimates	and	judgements,	including	the	
application	of	the	going	concern	basis	of	preparation.
Management judgement and estimation uncertainty
In	the	process	of	applying	the	Group’s	accounting	policies	management	
has	made	a	number	of	judgements,	estimates	and	assumptions.	The	
resulting	accounting	estimates	will,	by	definition,	seldom	equal	the	related	
actual	results.	The	key	assumptions	concerning	the	future	and	other	key	
sources	of	estimation	uncertainty	at	the	balance	sheet	date,	that	have	a	
significant	risk	of	causing	a	material	adjustment	to	the	carrying	amounts	
of	assets	and	liabilities	in	the	next	financial	year,	are	as	follows:
Intangible assets recognised on acquisition
On	completion	of	a	business	combination,	the	cost	is	allocated	by	
recognising	the	identifiable	assets,	liabilities	and	contingent	liabilities	
acquired	at	fair	value.	Intangible	assets	are	recognised	where	they	are	
separable	or	arise	from	contractual	or	legal	rights,	and	have	a	fair	value	
that	can	be	measured	reliably.	For	the	Group	these	intangible	assets	
usually	comprise	contractual	arrangements,	customer	relationships	and	
technology	based	assets,	but	can	also	include	acquired	patents,	software	
rights	and	licences	and	development	costs.
In	establishing	the	fair	value	for	intangible	assets	recognised	on	
acquisition	and	their	estimated	useful	lives,	the	Group	takes	account	of	
the	individual	circumstances	of	the	entity	acquired.	This	includes	trading	
data,	such	as	the	value	and	duration	of	contracts	acquired,	the	strength,	
duration	and	degree	of	exclusivity	of	relationships	with	customers,	as	
well	as	valuation	estimates,	such	as	the	estimation	of	likely	external	
royalty	rates	that	could	be	associated	with	technology	and	branding	
assets	and	attributable	future	cash	flows.	
Impairment of goodwill
The	Group	determines	whether	goodwill	is	impaired	at	least	once	a	year.	
This	requires	estimation	of	the	value	in	use	of	the	cash	generating	units	
to	which	the	goodwill	is	allocated.	Estimating	the	value	in	use	requires	
the	Group	to	make	an	estimate	of	the	expected	future	cash	flows	from	
the	cash	generating	units	and	also	to	choose	a	suitable	discount	rate	in	
order	to	calculate	the	present	value	of	those	cash	flows.	Further	details	
are	given	in	note	13.
Taxation
The	Group	is	subject	to	taxes	in	numerous	jurisdictions.	Significant	
judgement	is	required	in	determining	the	worldwide	provision	for	tax.	
There	are	many	transactions	and	calculations	for	which	the	ultimate	tax	
determination	is	uncertain	during	the	ordinary	course	of	business.		
The	Group	recognises	liabilities	for	anticipated	tax	audit	issues	based		
on	estimates	of	whether	additional	taxes	will	be	due.	Where	the	final		
tax	outcome	of	these	matters	is	different	from	the	amounts	that	were	
initially	recorded,	such	differences	will	impact	the	current	tax	provision,	
deferred	tax	provisions	and	income	statement	in	the	period	in	which	
such	determination	is	made. Group financial statements 58 Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010

The	total	expense	recognised	in	the	income	statement	of	£30.8m	(2009:	£27 .7m)	represents	contributions	payable	to	these	schemes	by	the	Group		
at	rates	specified	in	the	rules	of	the	schemes.
£3.7m	(2009:	£11.9m)	was	outstanding	in	respect	of	defined	contribution	schemes	but	not	due	for	payment	at	31	December	2010.
Defined benefit schemes
The	Group	operates	a	number	of	defined	benefit	schemes,	the	most	significant	being	the	Cobham	Pension	Plan	(CPP),	which	is	a	funded	defined	
benefit	scheme. 	The	assets	of	all	of	these	schemes	are	held	separately	from	those	of	the	Group	in	funds	under	the	control	of	trustees. 	All	defined	
benefit	schemes	have	been	closed	to	new	members	since	2003.
Special	contributions	of	£7 .9m	were	paid	in	2010	(2009:	£5.5m)	to	the	CPP	as	agreed	in	connection	with	the	disposal	of	the	Fluid	and	Air	group	which	
completed	in	2005.	There	were	no	significant	contributions	outstanding	at	the	end	of	2010	or	2009	for	the	defined	benefit	schemes.	
Actuarial	valuations	of	the	present	value	of	the	defined	benefit	obligations	for	the	CPP	are	carried	out	on	a	triennial	basis	by	qualified	independent	
actuaries,	the	most	recent	valuation	was	as	at	1	April	2009.	The	actuarial	valuations	were	updated	by	qualified	independent	actuaries	for	accounting	
purposes	to	31	December	2010.	Actuarial	valuations	of	other	schemes	have	been	carried	out	at	regular	intervals	as	required	by	the	applicable		
country	regulations. 69 www.cobham.com Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010

Pensions	increase	unless	overridden	by	specific	scheme	rules 3.59% n/a 3.63% n/a
The	mortality	assumptions	used	for	the	CPP	are	based	upon	actual	recent	mortality	experience	of	members	within	the	scheme	and	also	allow	for	
future	mortality	improvements.	The	mortality	assumption	used	in	2010	and	2009	is	denoted	by	actuaries	as	“PA92	year	of	birth	projections	long	
cohort”.	In	practical	terms	this	is	demonstrated	in	the	table	below:

Male 1980 2045 25.4	years
At	31	December	2010	it	has	been	assumed	that	members	will	commute	on	average	20%	(2009:	20%)	of	their	pension	for	cash	at	retirement.		
This	implies	a	full	take-up	of	the	permitted	25%	(2009:	25%)	commutation	by	approximately	80%	(2009:	80%)	of	eligible	members	on	retirement.
The	sensitivity	of	scheme	liabilities	to	changes	in	certain	key	assumptions	is	provided	below:
•	 Increasing	the	discount	rate	by	0.1%	would	decrease	scheme	liabilities	by	£10.2m.
•	 Increasing	the	inflation	rate	by	0.1%	would	increase	scheme	liabilities	by	£7 .0m.
•	 If	each	scheme	member	was	expected	to	live	for	an	additional	year	then	scheme	liabilities	would	increase	by	£10.4m.

Details	of	the	schemes	which	give	rise	to	these	charges	are	as	follows:
Equity settled share-based payment schemes
The	Group	operates	a	number	of	incentive	schemes	for	certain	senior	executives	as	follows:	
•	 The	Cobham	Performance	Share	Plan	(PSP).
•	 The	Cobham	Executive	Share	Option	Scheme	(ESOS).
•	 The	Cobham	Bonus	Co-investment	Plan	(BCP).
The	PSP	scheme	allows	for	annual	grants	of	conditional	shares	which	vest	50%	based	on	the	Group’s	three	year	Total	Shareholder	Return	relative	to	
that	of	a	sector	comparator	group	and	50%	based	on	the	growth	of	the	Group’s	underlying	EPS	over	the	same	period.	
Under	the	ESOS,	options	are	granted	at	a	price	not	less	than	the	market	value	of	the	Group’s	Ordinary	Shares	on,	or	shortly	before,	the	date	the	
options	are	granted.	Exercise	is	conditional	upon	the	Group’s	underlying	EPS	growth	over	a	three	year	period.	The	scheme	also	includes	a	‘time-only’	
section	which	is	offered	to	participants	based	in	the	USA.	This	allows	for	options	to	be	granted	with	25%	vesting	on	each	annual	anniversary	
conditional	only	on	continued	employment	within	the	Group.	
The	BCP	scheme	allows	participants	to	defer	up	to	50%	of	their	net	earned	annual	performance	bonus	into	Cobham	shares	in	return	for	an	
opportunity	to	earn	up	to	a	2:1	matching	award	of	shares	against	the	gross	bonus	invested,	based	on	three-year	Economic	Profit	growth	targets.	
A	number	of	awards	were	made	under	the	Cobham	Long-Term	Incentive	Plan	(LTIP)	up	to	2006	and	the	final	award	under	this	scheme	vested	during	
2009.	These	awards	were	made	at	nil	cost,	vesting	over	a	three	year	performance	period	based	on	the	Group’s	Total	Shareholder	Return	relative	to

require	the	Group	to	pay	the	intrinsic	value	of	the	award	to	the	employee	at	the	date	of	exercise.	These	awards	vested	during	2009	and	no	further	
awards	have	been	made	under	these	schemes.	The	expense	for	the	year	for	the	SAR	and	phantom	LTIP	rights	is	based	on	the	fair	value	of	the	
outstanding	liability	at	the	balance	sheet	date	of	£0.1m	at	31	December	2010	(2009:	£0.4m),	together	with	any	additional	amounts	arising	at	the

SARs	were	granted	at	a	price	not	less	than	the	market	value	of	the	Group’s	Ordinary	Shares	on,	or	shortly	before,	the	date	the	rights	were	granted.		
As	with	the	ESOS	awards,	exercise	is	conditional	upon	the	Group’s	underlying	EPS	growth	over	a	three	year	period	and	is	possible	between	three

The	goodwill	arising	on	business	combinations	in	the	current	and	prior	year	relates	to	the	business	combinations	of	RVision,	Inc	and	Argotek,	Inc		
as	described	in	note	31.
During	2009	the	contingent	consideration	in	respect	of	the	purchase	of	Patriot	Antenna	Systems	was	reassessed,	resulting	in	the	generation	of	
negative	goodwill	which	was	written	back	to	the	income	statement	in	accordance	with	IFRS	3,	Business	Combinations.	Additionally	during	2009,		
the	carrying	value	of	intangible	assets	which	arose	on	the	acquisition	of	Patriot	Antenna	Systems	was	reassessed	and	additional	amortisation	of	
£2.6m	was	charged	to	the	income	statement.	This	is	included	within	the	amortisation	charge	for	the	year	as	shown	in	note	12.
The	Group	has	no	indefinite	life	intangible	assets	other	than	goodwill.	Goodwill	is	allocated	to	approximately	50	cash	generating	units	(CGUs).		
The	Group	tests	goodwill	impairment	for	each	CGU	annually	or	more	frequently	if	there	are	indications	that	goodwill	might	be	impaired.
The	recoverable	amounts	of	the	CGUs	are	determined	from	value	in	use	calculations	unless	specific	conditions	at	a	CGU	dictate	otherwise.	For	both	the	
current	and	comparative	years	there	have	been	no	such	exceptions.	The	key	assumptions	for	the	value	in	use	calculations	are	those	regarding	the	discount	
rates,	growth	rates	and	operating	cash	projections	during	the	period	for	which	management	have	detailed	plans.	Management	estimate	discount	rates	
using	pre-tax	rates	that	reflect	current	market	assessments	of	the	Group’s	time	value	of	money	and	the	risks	specific	to	the	CGU	being	measured.	
The	Group	annually	prepares	cash	flow	forecasts	for	the	following	five	years	at	strategic	business	unit	level	and	this	is	approved	by	management	for	
the	coming	year.	The	growth	rate	assumed	after	this	five	year	period	is	based	on	long-term	GDP	projections	of	the	primary	market	for	the	CGU.	The	
long-term	projections	used	are	in	the	range	2.5%	to	3.0%.	The	growth	rates	assume	that	demand	for	our	products	in	the	USA	and	in	the	UK	remains	
broadly	in	line	with	the	underlying	economic	environment	in	the	long	term	future.	Taking	into	account	our	expectation	of	future	market	conditions	
we	believe	that	the	evolution	of	selling	prices	and	direct	costs	will	reflect	past	practices.	Where	CGUs	are	at	business	unit	level	five	year	forecasts	are	
not	available	and	therefore	the	long-term	growth	projections	are	applied	to	the	following	year’s	cash	flow	forecast.
The	pre-tax	rate	used	to	discount	the	forecast	cash	flows	is	10.1%	(2009:	10.6%)	having	considered	the	country	and	currency	risks	in	the	principal	
territories	in	which	the	Group	operates.	
Following	detailed	review,	no	impairment	losses	have	been	recognised	in	the	period.
The	goodwill	allocated	to	each	of	Cobham	Analytic	Solutions,	M/A-COM	and	Cobham	Sensor	Electronics	in	Lansdale	are	considered	to	be	individually	
significant	as	they	represent	more	than	10%	of	the	Group’s	total	goodwill	carrying	value.	After	translation	using	year-end	foreign	exchange	rates,	
these	CGUs	have	£134.5m,	£93.8m	and	£75.9m	of	goodwill	respectively,	representing	40.8%	of	the	total	balance.	Within	the	remaining	£441.2m	there	
are	no	other	amounts	considered	individually	significant.	Cobham	Analytic	Solutions,	M/A-COM	and	Cobham	Sensor	Electronics	in	Lansdale	are	all	within	
the	Cobham	Defence	Systems	Division	and	they	all	operate	primarily	in	the	US	defence	market.	 79 www.cobham.com Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010

Other	information
The	recoverable	amounts	associated	with	these	goodwill	balances	have	been	determined	on	a	value	in	use	basis.	A	value	in	use	test	requires	
comparison	of	asset	carrying	values	with	pre-tax	cash	flows.	Key	assumptions	and	sensitivities	are	as	follows:
•	 The	five	year	plans	for	Cobham	Analytic	Solutions	and	one	year	plans	for	M/A-COM	and	Cobham	Sensor	Electronics	in	Lansdale	have	been	
extrapolated	in	perpetuity	using	a	long-term	US	GDP	growth	rate	of	3.0%	and	discounted	using	the	Group’s	discount	rate.	A	key	assumption	in	
deriving	the	growth	rate	is	that	market	demand	in	the	products	and	services	provided	by	Cobham	Analytic	Solutions,	M/A-COM	and	Cobham	
Sensor	Electronics	in	Lansdale	grow	broadly	in	line	with	the	underlying	economic	environment	for	the	foreseeable	future.	The	growth	rate	would	
need	to	decrease	to	-3.1%,	0.6%	and	2.3%	for	Cobham	Analytic	Solutions,	M/A-COM	and	Cobham	Sensor	Electronics	in	Lansdale	respectively	in	
order	for	the	carrying	value	to	be	impaired.	
•	 Sensitivity	analysis	has	determined	that	the	discount	rate	of	10.1%	is	an	influential	assumption	on	the	outcome	of	the	recoverable	amount	
calculation.	The	recoverable	amounts	of	Cobham	Analytic	Solutions,	M/A-COM	and	Cobham	Sensor	Electronics	in	Lansdale	exceed	the	total	
carrying	value	of	assets	for	the	CGU	by	US$220.6m,	US$82.1m	and	US$19.4m	respectively;	the	discount	rate	would	need	to	increase	to	14.1%,		
12.5%	and	10.8%	for	Cobham	Analytic	Solutions,	M/A-COM	and	Cobham	Sensor	Electronics	in	Lansdale	respectively	in	order	for	the	carrying		
value	to	be	impaired.	
•	 Sensitivity	analysis	has	also	been	performed	on	the	operating	cash	flow	projections.	Cash	flows	can	be	impacted	by	changes	to	sales	projections,	
sales	prices	and	direct	costs.	In	order	for	the	carrying	value	of	goodwill	for	Cobham	Analytic	Solutions,	M/A-COM	and	Cobham	Sensor	Electronics	
in	Lansdale	to	be	impaired	the	expected	cash	flows	for	every	year	would	need	to	reduce	by	37%,	25%	and	8%	respectively.	
The	Directors	have	not	identified	any	other	likely	changes	in	other	significant	assumptions	that	would	cause	the	carrying	value	of	recognised	goodwill	
to	exceed	its	recoverable	amount. Group financial statements 80 Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010

•	 45%	of	the	voting	share	capital	in	Aviation	Défense	Service	SA,	a	company	incorporated	in	France.
•	 50%	of	the	voting	share	capital	in	FB	Heliservices	Limited,	a	company	incorporated	in	England.
•	 50%	of	the	voting	share	capital	in	FBS	Limited,	a	company	incorporated	in	England.
•	 50%	of	the	voting	share	capital	in	FB	Leasing	Limited,	a	company	incorporated	in	England.
Notwithstanding	the	fact	that	the	holding	is	45%,	the	governance	structure	for	Aviation	Défense	Service	SA	is	such	that	the	group	has	joint	control	
with	its	partner	and	therefore	the	investment	is	treated	as	a	joint	venture.
Within	the	Cobham	Defence	Systems	Division,	the	Group	has	a	50%	interest	in	Northrop	Grumman	Cobham	Intercoms	LLC,	a	company	incorporated

Contingent	consideration	included	in	provisions	above	has	been	provided	in	relation	to	business	combinations	completed	prior	to	1	January	2010.	
These	were	all	settled	in	2010.	Contingent	consideration	relating	to	business	combinations	completed	after	1	January	2010	is	included	as	a	financial	
liability	and	shown	in	note	21.	
Provisions	for	contingent	consideration	were	made	where	it	is	considered	probable	that	the	conditions	applicable	to	the	payment	of	contingent	
consideration	would	be	met.	The	amount	provided	is	therefore	the	amount	considered	likely	to	be	payable.	Arrangements	of	this	nature	varied,	but	
typically	extended	for	up	to	five	years	and	were	discounted	where	payable	after	two	years.	The	provision	at	31	December	2009	was	not	discounted	
although	the	unwinding	of	discounts	in	the	year	to	31	December	2009	resulted	in	a	finance	charge	of	£0.1m.	Any	reassessments	of	these	provisions	
are	accounted	for	as	adjustments	to	goodwill.
Under	current	IFRS	standards	addition	to,	or	release	of,	contingent	consideration	provisions	in	periods	after	the	completion	of	the	related	transaction	
were	regarded	as	purchase	price	adjustments	and	are	accounted	for	as	adjustments	to	goodwill	(see	note	13).
Warranty claims
The	warranty	provision	represents	management’s	best	estimate	of	the	Group’s	liability	under	warranties	granted	on	products	sold,	based	on	past	
experience	and	industry	averages	for	defective	products.	It	is	anticipated	that	most	of	these	costs	will	be	incurred	in	the	next	financial	year.
Contract loss provisions
Contract	loss	provisions	represent	management’s	best	estimate	of	the	amount	by	which	the	expected	benefits	from	certain	specific	contracts	are	
lower	than	the	unavoidable	cost	of	meeting	its	obligations	under	those	contracts.	The	timeframe	within	which	such	provisions	will	unwind	varies	by	
contract,	but	is	generally	within	one	year.	
Aircraft maintenance provisions
Aircraft	maintenance	provisions	are	established	in	respect	of	significant	periodic	maintenance	costs,	where	maintenance	activity	is	required	on	leased	
operational	aircraft	or	engines	on	a	cycle	greater	than	12	months,	and	where	specific	conditions	exist	regarding	the	state	of	a	leased	aircraft	on	its	
return	to	the	lessor	at	the	end	of	the	lease.	Costs	are	charged	to	the	income	statement	on	the	basis	of	utilisation	of	the	aircraft	and	are	credited	to	
the	provision.	The	provision	is	then	utilised	by	absorbing	the	actual	costs	incurred	in	carrying	out	the	maintenance	activity	or	on	incurring	the	
expenditure	required	to	return	the	aircraft	to	the	state	of	maintenance	required	before	return	of	the	aircraft	to	the	lessor. Group financial statements 86 Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010
Notes to the Group financial statements continued
Provisions on business disposals
These	provisions	include	amounts	provided	in	respect	of	the	divestment	of	MTS	in	2009	and	warranties	given	on	the	disposals	of	the	
Countermeasures	operations	and	the	Fluid	and	Air	group	in	2005.	All	amounts	have	been	determined	based	on	management’s	current	estimates		
of	likely	outcomes.	Due	to	uncertainties	surrounding	the	timing	of	settlement	of	these	items,	they	have	been	disclosed	as	due	within	one	year.
Other provisions
Other	provisions	include	amounts	provided	in	respect	of	announced	business	restructuring	and	legal	claims.	All	amounts	have	been	determined	
based	on	management’s	current	estimates	of	likely	outcomes	and	most	are	expected	to	be	settled	within	one	year.

certain	circumstances. 	No	deferred	tax	asset	has	been	recognised	in	respect	of	this	amount	because	of	the	unpredictability	of	future	qualifying	
profit	streams. 	These	losses	can	be	carried	forward	indefinitely.

discounted	cash	flows,	based	on	assumptions	that	are	supported	by	observable	market	prices	or	rates.
As	at	31	December	2010,	the	fair	value	of	the	fixed	rate	senior	notes	is	£394.7m	(2009:	£377 .7m).	The	Directors	consider	that	the	carrying	amounts

28. Financial instruments and risk management
The	Group’s	multi-national	operations	and	debt	financing	expose	it	to	a	variety	of	financial	risks	which	include	the	effects	of	changes	in	foreign	
currency	exchange	rates,	credit	risk,	liquidity	risk	and	interest	rates.	The	Group	has	in	place	a	risk	management	programme	that	seeks	to	limit	the	
adverse	effects	on	the	financial	performance	of	the	Group	by	using	foreign	currency	financial	instruments,	debt,	and	other	instruments,	including	
interest	rate	swaps.
Financial instruments
The	Group	finances	its	operations	primarily	through	a	mixture	of	retained	profits	and	borrowings.	The	Group	does	not	use	complex	derivative	
financial	instruments.	Where	it	does	use	derivative	financial	instruments	these	are	put	in	place	to	manage	the	currency	financing	risks	and	interest	
rate	risks	arising	from	normal	operations.	It	is,	and	has	been	throughout	the	period	under	review,	the	Group’s	policy	that	no	trading	in	financial	
instruments	shall	be	undertaken.
Foreign	currency	risk	and	interest	rate	risk	are	the	most	significant	exposures	for	the	Group	for	which	financial	instruments	are	employed	as	mitigation.	
The	Group	is	exposed	to	other	risks	such	as	liquidity	risk	and	credit	risk.	The	Board	reviews	and	agrees	policies	for	managing	each	of	these	risks	and	
they	are	summarised	below.	The	policies	have	remained	unchanged	throughout	the	year.
Foreign currency risk 
The	Group,	which	is	based	in	the	UK	and	reports	in	sterling,	has	significant	investment	in	overseas	operations	in	the	USA,	with	further	investments	in	
other	European	countries,	Australia	and	Canada.	As	a	result,	the	Group’s	balance	sheet	can	be	affected	by	movements	in	these	countries’	exchange	
rates.	The	Group’s	policy	is	to	reduce,	or	eliminate	where	practicable,	both	structural	and	transactional	foreign	exchange	risk.	All	currency	exposures	
are	reviewed	regularly	and	all	significant	foreign	exchange	transactions	are	approved	by	Cobham	plc	management.	
The	carrying	amounts	of	the	Group’s	total	foreign	currency	denominated	monetary	assets	and	monetary	liabilities,	translated	at	the	relevant	
year-end	exchange	rate,	are	as	follows:
2010 2009
£m US$ € AUS$ US$ € AUS$
Monetary	assets 268.8 86.7 85.3 316.3 76.8 58.8
Monetary	liabilities (882.9) (37.8) (109.5) (872.1) (47.6) (98.8)
Foreign	currency	borrowings	are	used	to	mitigate	the	impact	of	foreign	currency	exchange	rates	on	the	Group’s	overseas	net	assets.	The	Group	
typically	borrows	US	dollars	to	fund	acquisitions	in	the	USA	and	uses	intercompany	debt	to	create	a	natural	economic	hedge.	The	following	borrowings	
(included	in	monetary	liabilities	in	the	table	above)	and	foreign	exchange	contracts	match	exposures	arising	from	currency	denominated	net	assets:
£m 2010 2009
US	dollar	borrowings 526.9 699.7
US	dollar	foreign	exchange	contracts 161.0 172.8
On	consolidation,	the	net	assets	of	overseas	subsidiaries	(which	includes	monetary	assets	and	liabilities	shown	in	the	tables	above)	are	translated	at

The	Group	is	exposed	to	foreign	currency	risk	in	the	income	statement	where	individual	subsidiaries	hold	non-functional	currency	monetary	assets	
and	liabilities	and	when	an	operating	unit	makes	sales	and	purchases	in	currencies	other	than	its	own	functional	currency.	The	Group	undertakes	a	
formal	process	to	actively	manage	and	mitigate	this	exposure	through	a	combination	of	matching	non-functional	currency	revenues	and	costs,	
matching	non-functional	currency	monetary	assets	and	liabilities	and	through	the	use	of	forward	contracts.
The	sterling/US	dollar	exchange	rate	is	the	most	important	as	far	as	the	Group	is	concerned,	particularly	given	the	level	of	US	dollars	which	non	US	
based	subsidiaries	expect	to	receive	from	their	normal	business	activities,	and	the	proportion	of	the	Group	based	in	the	USA.	In	addition	to	the	longer	
term	borrowing	structure,	a	number	of	financial	instruments	are	used	to	manage	the	foreign	exchange	position,	such	as	forward	contracts.	It	is	the	
Group’s	current	belief	that	the	net	dollar	receipts	by	its	subsidiaries	will	exceed	the	level	of	the	outstanding	commitment.

The	following	table	details	the	Group’s	sensitivity	to	a	weakening	in	sterling	against	the	respective	foreign	currencies.	The	sensitivities	below	represent	
management’s	assessment	of	the	possible	changes	in	foreign	exchange	rates,	based	on	experience	over	the	previous	five	years.	The	sensitivity	
analysis	of	the	Group’s	exposure	to	foreign	currency	risk	at	the	reporting	date	has	been	determined	based	on	the	assumption	that	the	change	is	
effective	throughout	the	financial	year.	The	analysis	assumes	that	all	other	variables,	including	interest	rates,	remain	constant	and	includes	the	effect	
of	derivative	financial	instruments.	A	positive	number	indicates	an	increase	in	profit	after	taxation	and	total	equity.

Interest rate risk
The	Group	has	various	long	and	short	term	borrowings,	principally	in	US	dollars	and	Australian	dollars	at	both	fixed	and	floating	rates	of	interest.		
The	Group	continually	monitors	its	exposure	to	movements	in	interest	rates	in	order	to	bring	greater	stability	and	certainty	with	respect	to	borrowing	
costs.	Group	policy	is	to	assess	borrowings	with	regard	to	fixed	or	variable	rates	of	interest	depending	on	prevailing	market	conditions	and	to	use	
interest	rate	swaps	to	manage	the	interest	rate	risk.	
All	floating	rate	borrowings	have	regular	repricing	dates.	Interest	rate	swaps	which	mitigate	the	exposure	arising	on	floating	rate	debt	are	all	
designated	as	cash	flow	hedges	and	are	as	follows:

Liquidity risk
The	Group	has	a	positive	cash	flow	from	operating	activities	and	where	practicable	the	funds	generated	by	operating	companies	are	managed		
on	a	regional	basis.	For	short	term	working	capital	purposes	in	the	UK,	most	operating	companies	utilise	local	bank	facilities	within	an	overall	Group	
arrangement.	In	the	US	a	central	treasury	function	is	maintained	which	all	US	subsidiaries	use.	These	practices	allow	a	balance	to	be	maintained	
between	continuity	of	funding,	security	and	flexibility.	
As	regards	liquidity,	the	Group’s	policy	throughout	the	year	has	been	to	maintain	a	mix	of	short,	medium	and	long-term	borrowings	with	their	lenders.	
Short	term	flexibility	is	achieved	by	overdraft	facilities	and	the	use	of	the	Group’s	revolving	credit	facility	which	expires	in	July	2012.	The	table	below	
summarises	the	remaining	contractual	maturity	for	the	Group’s	financial	liabilities.	The	amounts	shown	are	the	contractual	undiscounted	cash	flows

In	addition,	and	to	provide	flexibility	in	the	management	of	the	Group’s	liquidity,	it	is	the	Group’s	policy	to	maintain	undrawn	committed	borrowing	
facilities	in	various	currencies.	The	following	facilities,	which	are	at	floating	rates,	were	available	at	31	December:

Credit risk
The	Group	has	no	significant	concentrations	of	credit	risk.	The	Group’s	principal	financial	assets	are	bank	balances,	cash	and	trade	and	other	receivables.
The	credit	risk	on	liquid	funds	and	derivative	financial	instruments	is	minimal	because	the	counterparties	are	banks	with	satisfactory	credit	ratings	
assigned	by	international	credit	rating	agencies.	The	Group	further	limits	risk	in	this	area	by	setting	a	maximum	level	for	deposits	or	overdrafts	with	
any	one	counterparty.	These	facilities	are	reviewed	periodically	and	also	if	there	is	an	indication	that	the	credit	rating	of	any	of	the	Group’s	core	banks	
has	fallen	below	a	Moody’s	Aa3	rating.	
Concentrations	of	credit	risk	with	respect	to	trade	receivables	are	limited	due	to	the	Group’s	customer	base	being	large	and	unrelated.	Customers	are	
typically	large	global	companies	or	government	agencies	with	long-term	trading	relationships.	The	Group	also	has	in	place	procedures	that	require	
appropriate	credit	checks	on	potential	customers	before	sales	are	made.	Existing	customer	accounts	are	also	monitored	on	an	ongoing	basis	and	
appropriate	action	is	taken	where	necessary	to	minimise	any	credit	risk.	The	Directors	therefore	believe	there	is	no	further	credit	risk	provision	
required	in	excess	of	normal	provision	for	impaired	receivables.	
Group	management	monitor	the	ageing	of	receivables	which	are	more	than	one	month	overdue	and	debtor	days	on	a	regular	basis.	At	31	December	2010,	
6.1%	(2009:	6.2%)	of	gross	trade	receivables	were	overdue	by	one	month	or	more.	
The	maximum	exposure	to	credit	risk	at	31	December	2010	is	the	fair	value	of	each	class	of	receivable	as	disclosed	in	note	18.	Letters	of	credit	are	the	
only	collateral	held	as	security	against	trade	receivables.	These	are	obtained	in	a	limited	number	of	cases	in	accordance	with	good	business	practice	
and	secure	less	than	£1.0m	of	receivables.	
The	Group	has	pledged	assets	only	in	respect	of	finance	leases	and	bank	accounts	as	disclosed	in	notes	14	and	19.	No	assets	have	been	pledged		
in	respect	of	any	of	the	Group’s	primary	borrowing	facilities	or	other	financial	liabilities.	
In	the	UK	and	the	USA,	the	Group	has	master	netting	arrangements	in	respect	of	bank	balances.	In	the	normal	course	of	business	these	bank	
accounts	are	settled	on	a	net	basis	within	each	currency	and	as	such	are	presented	net	in	the	financial	statements.	In	the	event	of	an	automatic	
enforcement	event	the	bank	balances	are	automatically	set	off	against	each	other	to	achieve	a	net	position. Group financial statements 94 Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010
Notes to the Group financial statements continued
Capital risk management
Group	policy	is	to	maintain	a	strong	capital	base,	defined	as	total	shareholders’	equity,	excluding	non-controlling	interests,	totalling	£1,075.8m	at	
31 December	2010	(2009:	£948.0m),	so	as	to	maintain	investor,	creditor	and	market	confidence	and	to	sustain	future	development	of	the	business.	
Within	this	overall	policy,	the	Group	seeks	to	maintain	an	optimum	capital	structure	by	a	mixture	of	debt	and	retained	earnings.	Funding	needs	are	
reviewed	periodically	and	also	each	time	a	significant	acquisition	is	made.	A	number	of	factors	are	considered	which	include	the	net	debt/EBITDA	
ratio,	future	funding	needs	(usually	potential	acquisitions)	and	proposed	dividend	levels.	Group	banking	arrangements	are	also	considered,	these	
include	financial	covenants	which	are	based	on	adjusted	IFRS	results.	This	policy	has	been	reviewed	by	the	Board	on	a	regular	basis	during	the	year	
and,	given	the	current	economic	climate,	continues	to	be	considered	appropriate.	There	have	been	no	breaches	of	the	terms	of	the	Group	banking	
arrangements	or	defaults	during	the	current	or	comparative	periods.
During	the	year,	additional	funding	has	been	secured	through	private	placements.	Such	agreements	are	one	of	the	Group’s	primary	sources	of	
funding	and	typically	the	Group	borrows	US	dollars	to	fund	acquisitions	in	the	USA.	As	noted	above,	the	Group	maintains	a	mixture	of	fixed	and	
floating	interest	rate	arrangements	and,	within	overall	net	debt,	will	hold	deposits	in	sterling	and	borrowings	in	overseas	currencies	such	as	US	dollars,	
euros	and	Australian	dollars	funding	overseas	operations.

33. Contingent liabilities and commitments
At	31	December	2010,	the	Company	and	the	Group	had	contingent	liabilities	in	respect	of	bank	and	contractual	performance	guarantees	and	other	
matters	arising	in	the	ordinary	course	of	business.	Where	it	is	expected	that	a	material	liability	will	arise	in	respect	of	these	matters,	appropriate	
provision	is	made	within	the	Group	consolidated	financial	statements.	As	the	conditions	of	these	guarantees	are	currently	being	met,	no	obligating	
event	is	foreseeable	and	therefore	no	provision	has	been	made	at	the	year	end.
The	Company	has	also	committed,	in	connection	with	the	Future	Strategic	Tanker	Aircraft	project,	to	invest	£6.0m	in	the	equity	share	capital	of	three	
companies	and	to	provide	additional	funding	of	£18.1m	in	the	form	of	redeemable	loan	notes	by	March	2013	at	the	latest.	In	addition,	a	number	of	
performance	guarantees	and	letters	of	credit	have	been	provided	to	secure	the	funding	of	this	project.	No	provision	(2009:	£3.0m)	has	been	provided	
in	connection	with	these	guarantees	as	at	31	December	2010.
The	Company	and	various	of	its	subsidiaries	are,	from	time	to	time,	parties	to	various	legal	proceedings	and	claims	and	management	do	not	
anticipate	that	the	outcome	of	these,	either	individually	or	in	aggregate,	will	have	a	material	adverse	effect	upon	the	Group’s	financial	position.
The	nature	of	much	of	the	contracting	work	done	by	the	group	means	that	there	are	reasonably	frequent	contractual	issues,	variations	and	
renegotiations	that	arise	in	the	ordinary	course	of	business.	The	group	has	recently	identified	and	is	reviewing	the	circumstances	surrounding		
one,	more	significant,	contractual	breach	dating	back	some	years.	The	contract	was	in	respect	of	goods	provided	into	a	geographic	market	which	
represents	only	a	small	amount	of	revenue	for	the	group.	The	outcome	cannot	be	estimated	at	this	stage	and	resolution	may	take	some	time.

Consideration	comprises	US$11.5m	with	additional	cash	consideration	of	up	to	US$12.5m	contingent	upon	future	performance.

Independent auditors’ report 
to the members of Cobham plc
We	have	audited	the	parent	company	financial	statements	of	Cobham	
plc	for	the	year	ended	31	December	2010	which	comprise	the	parent	
company	balance	sheet,	the	reconciliation	of	movements	in	shareholders’	
funds,	the	accounting	policies	and	the	related	notes.	The	financial	
reporting	framework	that	has	been	applied	in	their	preparation	is	
applicable	law	and	United	Kingdom	Accounting	Standards	(United	
Kingdom	Generally	Accepted	Accounting	Practice).
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
As	explained	more	fully	in	the	statement	of	Directors’	responsibilities	set	
out	on	page	49,	the	Directors	are	responsible	for	the	preparation	of	the	
parent	company	financial	statements	and	for	being	satisfied	that	they	
give	a	true	and	fair	view.	Our	responsibility	is	to	audit	and	express	an	
opinion	on	the	parent	company	financial	statements	in	accordance	with	
applicable	law	and	International	Standards	on	Auditing	(UK	and	Ireland).	
Those	standards	require	us	to	comply	with	the	Auditing	Practices	Board’s	
Ethical	Standards	for	Auditors.	
This	report,	including	the	opinions,	has	been	prepared	for	and	only	for	
the	Company’s	members	as	a	body	in	accordance	with	Chapter	3	of		
Part	16	of	the	Companies	Act	2006	and	for	no	other	purpose.	We	do	
not,	in	giving	these	opinions,	accept	or	assume	responsibility	for	any	
other	purpose	or	to	any	other	person	to	whom	this	report	is	shown	or	
into	whose	hands	it	may	come	save	where	expressly	agreed	by	our	prior	
consent	in	writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An	audit	involves	obtaining	evidence	about	the	amounts	and	disclosures	
in	the	financial	statements	sufficient	to	give	reasonable	assurance	that	
the	financial	statements	are	free	from	material	misstatement,	whether	
caused	by	fraud	or	error.	This	includes	an	assessment	of:	whether		
the	accounting	policies	are	appropriate	to	the	parent	company’s	
circumstances	and	have	been	consistently	applied	and	adequately	
disclosed;	the	reasonableness	of	significant	accounting	estimates	made	
by	the	Directors;	and	the	overall	presentation	of	the	financial	statements.
Opinion on financial statements 
In	our	opinion	the	parent	company	financial	statements:	
•	 	 give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	state	of	the	Company’s	affairs	as	at	
31 December	2010;
•	 	 have	been	properly	prepared	in	accordance	with	United	Kingdom	
Generally	Accepted	Accounting	Practice;	and	
•	 	 have	been	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	requirements	of	the	
Companies	Act	2006.	
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006	
In	our	opinion:	
•	 	 the	part	of	the	Directors’	remuneration	report	to	be	audited	has	been	
properly	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	Companies	Act	2006;	and	
•	 	 the	information	given	in	the	Directors’	Report	for	the	financial	year		
for	which	the	parent	company	financial	statements	are	prepared		
is	consistent	with	the	parent	company	financial	statements.	
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We	have	nothing	to	report	in	respect	of	the	following	matters	where	the	
Companies	Act	2006	requires	us	to	report	to	you	if,	in	our	opinion:	
•	 	 adequate	accounting	records	have	not	been	kept	by	the	Company,	or	
returns	adequate	for	our	audit	have	not	been	received	from	branches	
not	visited	by	us;	or	
•	 	 the	parent	company	financial	statements	and	the	part	of	the	
Directors’	remuneration	report	to	be	audited	are	not	in	agreement	
with	the	accounting	records	and	returns;	or	
•	 	 certain	disclosures	of	Directors’	remuneration	specified	by	law	are		
not	made;	or	
•	 	 we	have	not	received	all	the	information	and	explanations	we	require	
for	our	audit.	
Other matter 
We	have	reported	separately	on	the	Group	financial	statements	of	
Cobham	plc	for	the	year	ended	31	December	2010.

Other	information
Parent company accounting policies
Accounting convention
These	financial	statements	have	been	prepared	under	the	historical	cost	
convention,	as	modified	by	the	revaluation	of	derivative	contracts	which	
are	held	at	fair	value,	in	accordance	with	the	Companies	Act	2006	and	
applicable	accounting	standards	(UK	GAAP).	
The	principal	accounting	policies,	which	have	been	consistently	applied,	
are	as	set	out	below.
Dividends 
Dividends	payable	are	recognised	as	a	liability	in	the	period	in	which		
they	are	fully	authorised.	Dividend	income	is	recognised	when	the	
shareholder’s	right	to	receive	payment	has	been	established.
Pensions
The	Company	operates	and	contributes	to	a	multi-employer	defined	
benefit	pension	scheme.	Contributions	and	pension	costs	are	
apportioned	across	the	scheme	as	a	whole	and	assessed	in	accordance	
with	the	advice	of	qualified	actuaries.	The	scheme	is	closed	to	new	
members	and	has	a	high	proportion	of	deferred	and	pensioner	members	
from	businesses	that	no	longer	participate	in	the	scheme.	The	Company	
is	therefore	not	able	to	identify	its	share	of	underlying	assets	and	
liabilities	of	the	scheme	on	a	reasonable	and	consistent	basis	and	in	
accordance	with	the	multi-employer	exemption	contained	in	FRS	1 7 ,	
Retirement	Benefits,	the	scheme	has	been	accounted	for	as	if	it	was	a	
defined	contribution	scheme.	The	charge	to	the	profit	and	loss	account	
therefore	reflects	payments	for	the	year.	
Contributions	to	defined	contribution	schemes	are	charged	to	the	profit	
and	loss	account	in	the	period	the	contributions	are	payable.	
The	Company	also	makes	contributions	for	certain	employees	to	
individual	personal	pension	and	stakeholder	schemes.	Contributions	are	
charged	to	the	profit	and	loss	account	in	the	year	to	which	they	relate.
Deferred taxation
Deferred	tax	is	recognised	in	respect	of	all	timing	differences	that	have	
originated	but	not	reversed	at	the	balance	sheet	date,	where	transactions	
or	events	that	result	in	an	obligation	to	pay	more	tax	in	the	future	or	a	
right	to	pay	less	tax	in	the	future	have	occurred	at	the	balance	sheet	date.
A	net	deferred	tax	asset	is	recognised	as	recoverable	when,	on	the	basis	
of	all	available	evidence,	it	can	be	regarded	as	more	likely	than	not	that	
there	will	be	suitable	taxable	profits	from	which	the	future	reversal	of	
underlying	timing	differences	can	be	deducted.
Deferred	tax	is	measured	at	the	tax	rates	that	are	expected	to	apply	in	the	
periods	in	which	the	timing	differences	are	expected	to	reverse,	based	
on	tax	rates	and	laws	that	have	been	enacted	or	substantively	enacted	
by	the	balance	sheet	date.	Deferred	tax	has	not	been	discounted.
Intangible assets
Intangible	assets,	comprising	software,	are	stated	at	cost	less	
accumulated	amortisation	and	impairment	losses.	They	are	amortised	
on	a	straight-line	basis	over	their	estimated	useful	lives	which	range	from	
three	to	five	years.
Tangible fixed assets
Plant	and	machinery	fixed	assets	are	initially	recognised	at	cost	and	
depreciated	on	a	straight-line	basis	to	their	estimated	residual	values	
over	their	estimated	useful	lives	which	range	from	three	to	six	years.	
Investments in group and other undertakings
Investments	in	subsidiary	undertakings	are	stated	at	cost	less	any	
provision	for	impairment	in	value	and	include	the	fair	value	at	the		
date	of	grant	of	share	options	awarded	to	employees	of	subsidiary	
undertakings,	net	of	amounts	recovered	as	management	charges.
Other	investments	are	stated	at	cost	less	any	provision	for	impairment		
in	value.
Operating leases
Operating	lease	payments	for	assets	leased	from	third	parties	are	
charged	to	the	profit	and	loss	account	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	
term	of	the	lease.
Provisions
A	provision	is	recognised	when	the	Company	has	a	present	legal	or	
constructive	obligation	as	a	result	of	a	past	event	and	it	is	probable	that	
settlement	will	be	required	of	an	amount	that	can	be	reliably	estimated.
Share capital
Ordinary	share	capital	is	classified	as	equity.	Financial	liabilities	and	equity	
instruments	are	classified	according	to	the	substance	of	the	contractual	
agreements	entered	into.	An	equity	instrument	is	any	contract	that	
evidences	a	residual	interest	in	the	assets	of	the	Company	after	
deducting	all	of	its	liabilities.
Preference	share	capital	is	classified	as	a	liability	if	it	is	redeemable	on		
a	specific	date	or	at	the	option	of	the	preference	shareholders	or	if	
dividend	payments	are	not	discretionary.	Dividends	on	preference	share	
capital	classified	as	liabilities	are	recognised	in	the	profit	and	loss	account	
as	interest	expense.	
	
Foreign currencies
The	functional	currency	of	the	Company	is	sterling.	Transactions	in	
currencies	other	than	the	local	currency	are	translated	at	the	exchange	
rate	ruling	at	the	date	of	the	transaction.	Monetary	assets	and	liabilities	
denominated	in	non-functional	currencies	are	retranslated	at	the	
exchange	rate	ruling	at	the	balance	sheet	date.	
All	exchange	differences	arising	are	taken	to	the	profit	and	loss	account.	
In	order	to	manage	the	Group’s	exposure	to	certain	foreign	exchange	
risks,	the	Company	enters	into	forward	contracts	and	options	which		
are	accounted	for	as	derivative	financial	instruments.	
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
Derivatives	are	initially	recognised	at	fair	value	on	the	date	a	derivative	
contract	is	entered	into	and	are	subsequently	re-measured	at	their	fair	
value.	The	method	of	recognising	the	resulting	gain	or	loss	depends	on	
whether	the	derivative	is	designated	as	a	hedging	instrument,	and	if	so,	
the	nature	of	the	item	being	hedged. Group financial statements 102 Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010
Parent company accounting policies continued
The	Company’s	activities	expose	it	primarily	to	the	financial	risks		
of	changes	in	foreign	currency	exchange	rates	and	interest	rates.		
The	Company	uses	foreign	exchange	contracts	and	interest	rate		
swap	contracts	to	reduce	these	exposures.	The	Company	does		
not	use	derivative	financial	instruments	for	speculative	purposes.
The	Company	documents	at	the	inception	of	an	interest	rate	swap	
transaction	the	relationship	between	hedging	instruments	and	hedged	
items,	as	well	as	its	risk	management	objectives	and	strategy	for	
undertaking	various	hedge	transactions.	The	Company	also	documents	
its	assessment,	both	at	hedge	inception	and	on	an	ongoing	basis,	of	
whether	the	derivatives	used	in	hedging	transactions	are	highly	effective	
in	offsetting	changes	in	fair	values	or	cash	flows	of	hedged	items.
Hedge	accounting	is	not	used	to	account	for	foreign	exchange	
derivatives	entered	into	to	mitigate	foreign	exchange	impacts	of	trading	
in	non-local	currencies	and	movements	in	fair	values	are	reported	in	the	
profit	and	loss	account.	
Cash flow hedges
The	effective	portion	of	changes	in	fair	values	of	derivatives	that	are	
designated	and	qualify	as	cash	flow	hedges	are	recognised	in	reserves.	
The	gain	or	loss	relating	to	the	ineffective	portion	is	recognised	
immediately	in	the	profit	and	loss	account.	Amounts	accumulated		
in	reserves	are	recycled	to	the	profit	and	loss	account	in	the	periods	
when	the	hedged	item	affects	profit	or	loss.
When	a	hedging	instrument	expires	or	is	sold,	or	when	a	hedge	no	
longer	meets	the	criteria	for	hedge	accounting,	any	cumulative	gain	or	
loss	existing	in	reserves	at	that	time	remains	in	equity	and	is	recognised	
when	the	forecast	transaction	is	ultimately	recognised	in	the	profit	and	
loss	account.	If	a	hedged	transaction	is	no	longer	expected	to	occur,		
the	net	cumulative	gain	or	loss	recognised	in	reserves	is	immediately	
transferred	to	the	profit	and	loss	account	for	the	period.
Other financial instruments
Amounts	receivable	from	and	owed	to	subsidiaries	are	recognised	at	
their	nominal	value,	receivables	are	reduced	by	appropriate	allowances	
for	estimated	irrecoverable	amounts.	
Interest-bearing	bank	loans	and	overdrafts	are	recorded	at	the	proceeds	
received,	net	of	direct	issue	costs.	Finance	charges	are	accounted	for		
on	an	accruals	basis	in	the	profit	and	loss	account	using	the	effective	
interest	rate	method	and	are	added	to	the	carrying	amount	of	the	
instrument	to	the	extent	that	they	are	not	settled	in	the	period	in		
which	they	arise.
Share-based payments
For	grants	made	to	employees	of	Cobham	plc	under	the	Group’s	
share-based	payment	schemes,	amounts	which	reflect	the	fair	value		
of	options	awarded	as	at	the	time	of	grant	are	charged	to	the	profit		
and	loss	account	over	the	vesting	period.	The	fair	value	of	options	
awarded	to	employees	of	subsidiary	undertakings,	net	of	amounts	
recovered	as	management	charges,	is	recognised	as	a	capital	
contribution	and	recorded	in	investments.
The	valuation	of	the	options	utilises	a	methodology	based	on	the	
Black-Scholes	model,	modified	where	required	to	allow	for	the	impact		
of	market	related	performance	criteria	and	taking	into	account	all	
non-vesting	conditions. 103 www.cobham.com Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010

The	following	dividends	on	Ordinary	Shares	were	authorised	and	paid	during	the	year:
£m 2010 2009
Final	dividend	of	3.971p	per	share	for	2009	(2008:	3.61p) 45.8 41.3	
Interim	dividend	of	1.628p	per	share	for	2010	(2009:	1.48p) 18.8 16.9

In	addition	to	the	above,	the	Directors	are	proposing	a	final	dividend	in	respect	of	the	financial	year	ended	31	December	2010	of	4.372	pence	per	
share	which	will	absorb	an	estimated	£50.5m	of	shareholders’	funds.	This	dividend	is	subject	to	approval	by	shareholders	at	the	Annual	General	
Meeting	and	has	not	been	included	as	a	liability	in	these	financial	statements.	If	authorised,	it	will	be	paid	on	3	June	2011	to	shareholders	who	are		
on	the	register	of	members	as	at	6	May	2011.	The	total	dividend	in	respect	of	the	financial	year	ended	31	December	2010	will	therefore	be	6.0	pence	
per	share	(2009:	5.45	pence).	The	total	amount	paid	in	respect	of	2010	will	be	£69.3m	(2009:	£62.7m).
2. Directors’ emoluments and pension costs
Disclosures	in	respect	of	Directors’	emoluments	can	be	found	in	the	Directors’	remuneration	report	on	pages	41	to	48	to	the	Group	financial	statements.
Defined benefit pension schemes
The	Company	operates	and	participates	in	the	Cobham	Pension	Plan	(CPP)	and	the	Cobham	Executive	Pension	Plan	(CEPP).	The	pension	schemes		
are	of	the	defined	benefit	type	and	assets	are	held	in	separate	trustee	administered	funds.	The	funds	are	valued	every	three	years	by	a	professionally	
qualified	independent	actuary	and	the	rates	of	contribution	payable	are	determined	by	the	actuary.	The	latest	effective	dates	of	the	actuarial	
assessment	of	the	CPP	and	CEPP	were	1	April	2009	and	1	April	2010	respectively.	The	assessments	were	updated	to	31	December	2010	at	which		
date	the	total	net	liabilities	of	the	schemes	were	assessed	to	be	£35.8m.	The	Directors	of	the	companies	involved	in	the	Group	schemes	will	continue		
to	monitor	the	pension	deficits	and	take	advice	from	independent	actuaries	as	appropriate.	
The	schemes	have	been	accounted	for	as	if	they	were	defined	contribution	schemes	and	the	charge	to	the	profit	and	loss	account	therefore	reflects	
payments	for	the	year.
Contributions	to	the	Group	schemes	for	2010	amounted	to	£0.3m	(2009:	£0.4m)	of	normal	funding	and	a	special	contribution	of	£7 .9m	(2009:	£5.5m).	
No	contributions	were	outstanding	at	the	end	of	2010	or	2009.
Defined contribution pension schemes
The	Company	also	operates	and	participates	in	the	Cobham	plc	money	purchase	pension	arrangements.	The	assets	of	the	schemes	are	held	
separately	from	those	of	the	Company	in	independently	administered	funds.	The	pension	costs	charged	represents	contributions	payable	by		
the	Company	to	the	funds	and	amounted	to	£0.6m	(2009:	£0.5m).	No	contributions	were	outstanding	at	the	end	of	2010	or	2009.
3. Share-based payments

•	 The	Cobham	Executive	Share	Option	Scheme	(ESOS).

The	Company	recognised	total	expenses	of	£3.8m	(2009:	£4.0m)	related	to	equity	settled	share-based	payment	transactions	during	the	year	
(including	national	insurance).	As	shown	in	note	4,	investments	in	Group	undertakings	have	been	adjusted	to	reflect	the	value	of	options	granted		
to	employees	of	the	Company’s	subsidiaries,	less	amounts	recharged	to	date.	
Further	details	of	these	schemes	can	be	found	in	the	Directors’	remuneration	report	on	pages	43	to	44	and	in	the	Group	financial	statements

The	impact	of	foreign	exchange	to	the	profit	for	the	financial	year	is	a	£0.4m	loss	(2009:	£0.5m	gain).
Reserves	are	wholly	attributable	to	equity	interests.
1 72,978	(2009:	373,706)	Ordinary	Shares	were	purchased	during	the	year	in	connection	with	the	Cobham	Bonus	Co-investment	Plan	and	are	held		
in	treasury.	Distributable	reserves	have	been	reduced	by	£0.6m	(2009:	£0.7m),	being	the	consideration	paid	for	these	shares.
The	profit	and	loss	account	also	includes	the	purchase	of	Ordinary	Shares	by	the	Cobham	Employee	Benefit	Trust	in	connection	with	the	Cobham	
Bonus	Co-investment	Plan,	the	Cobham	Executive	Share	Option	Scheme	and	the	Cobham	Savings	Related	Share	Option	Scheme,	and	the	allocation	
of	the	shares	upon	the	exercise	of	options.	Unallocated	shares	are	held	as	treasury	shares.	The	consideration	paid	for	shares	during	the	year		
was	£4.1m	(2009:	nil)	and	£0.1m	(2009:	nil)	was	received	as	a	result	of	the	allocation	of	these	shares	to	employees	upon	the	exercise	of	options.		
At	31 December	2010,	the	trust	held	1,959,353	(2009:	nil)	Ordinary	Shares	with	a	market	value	of	£4.0m	(2009:	nil).
As	a	result	of	the	purchase	of	treasury	shares,	the	profit	and	loss	account	of	£377 .1m	(2009:	£351.8m)	includes	£5.3m	(2009:	£0.7m)	not	available	for	
distribution	as	a	dividend.	
The	special	reserve	was	created	in	1996,	with	the	sanction	of	the	High	Court,	against	which	goodwill	arising	on	subsequent	acquisitions	may	be	charged.
The	share	options	reserve	relates	to	provisions	made	in	accordance	with	FRS	20	for	shares	allocated	to	the	Company’s	employees	under	the	Group’s	
share	option	schemes.	Where	share	options	which	gave	rise	to	charges	under	FRS	20	have	been	exercised,	the	appropriate	proportion	of	the	share	
options	reserve	is	transferred	to	the	profit	and	loss	account	in	equity.	
15. Contingent liabilities and commitments
The	Company	has	contingent	liabilities	in	respect	of	bank	and	contractual	performance	guarantees	and	other	matters	arising	in	the	ordinary	course	
of	business	entered	into,	for,	or	on	behalf	of,	certain	Group	undertakings.	
As	the	conditions	of	the	above	guarantees	are	currently	being	met,	no	obligating	event	is	foreseeable	and	therefore	no	contingent	liability	provision	
has	been	made	at	the	year	end.
In	2008,	Cobham	plc	committed,	in	connection	with	the	Future	Strategic	Tanker	Aircraft	project,	to	invest	£6.0m	in	the	equity	share	capital	of	three	
companies	and	to	provide	additional	funding	of	£18.1m	in	the	form	of	redeemable	loan	notes	by	March	2013	at	the	latest.	In	addition,	a	number	of	
performance	guarantees	and	letters	of	credit	have	been	provided	to	secure	the	funding	of	this	project.	As	at	31	December	2010	no	provision	was	
made	(2009:	£3.0m)	in	connection	with	these	guarantees.
The	Company	had	no	capital	commitments	at	31	December	2010	(2009:	£nil). Group financial statements 112 Cobham plc |	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2010

Definitions
The	 following	 definitions	 apply	 throughout	 the	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts.
To	 assist	 with	 the	 understanding	 of	 earnings	 trends,	 the	 Group	 has	 included	
within	 its	 published	 statements	 trading	 profit	 and	 underlying	 earnings	 results.	
Trading	 profit	 and	 underlying	 earnings	 have	 been	 defined	 as	 operating	 profit	
from	 continuing	 operations	 excluding	 the	 impacts	 of	 certain	 transaction	 related	
costs	 and	 business	 restructuring	 costs	 as	 detailed	 below.	 Also	 excluded	 are	 	
the	 marking	 to	 market	 of	 currency	 instruments	 not	 realised	 in	 the	 period,	
impairments	 of	 intangible	 assets	 and	 items	 deemed	 by	 the	 Directors	 to	 be	 of	 an	
exceptional	 nature	 such	 as	 the	 settlement	 of	 a	 long-standing	 commercial	 dispute.	
Transaction	 related	 costs	 excluded	 from	 trading	 profit	 and	 underlying	 earnings	
include	 the	 amortisation	 of	 intangible	 assets	 recognised	 on	 acquisition,	 the	 writing	
off	 of	 the	 pre-acquisition	 profit	 element	 of	 inventory	 written	 up	 on	 acquisition	
and	 costs	 charged	 post	 acquisition	 related	 to	 acquired	 share	 options.	 Transaction	
related	 costs	 also	 include	 other	 direct	 costs	 associated	 with	 business	 combinations	
and	 direct	 costs	 arising	 from	 any	 terminated	 acquisitions	 or	 disposals.	
Business	 restructuring	 costs	 comprise	 exceptional	 profits	 or	 losses	 arising	 on	
disposals	 actually	 completed,	 as	 well	 as	 exceptional	 costs	 or	 profits	 associated	
with	 the	 restructuring	 of	 the	 Group’s	 business	 and	 site	 integrations.	 This	 includes	
costs	 associated	 with	 the	 Excellence	 in	 Delivery	 programme.
All	 underlying	 measures	 include	 the	 revenue	 and	 operational	 results	 of	 both	
continuing	 and	 discontinued	 businesses	 until	 the	 point	 of	 sale	 of	 the	 operation.	
Net	 debt	 is	 defined	 as	 the	 net	 of	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 less	 borrowings	 at	 the

cash	 flows	 from	 the	 purchase	 or	 disposal	 of	 tangible	 fixed	 assets.	 Operating	 cash	
conversion	 is	 defined	 as	 operating	 cash	 flow	 as	 a	 percentage	 of	 trading	 profit,	
excluding	 profit	 from	 joint	 ventures.	 Free	 cash	 flow	 is	 operating	 cash	 flow	 after	
net	 interest	 and	 taxation.
Cobham’s	 Technology	 Divisions	 comprise	 Cobham	 Avionics	 and	 Surveillance,	
Cobham	 Defence	 Systems	 and	 Cobham	 Mission	 Systems.
Organic	 revenue	 growth	 is	 defined	 as	 revenue	 growth	 stated	 at	 constant	 translation	
exchange,	 excluding	 the	 incremental	 effect	 of	 acquisitions	 and	 disposals. Cobham’s products and services have been at the heart of

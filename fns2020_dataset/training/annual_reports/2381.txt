C11868_BP_ARA_2004_Cvrspine.qxd  20/2/05  7:44 AM  Page 2 In mapping the future of BP , we began with a
business purpose – a strategy, a set of assets and
market positions that gave us scope, scale and
potential as a leader in our industry. Today, this
model describes us well – but not completely. 
Now our strategy is being driven further, by a belief
that everything we do can – and should – be done
better. Our people put this principle of operational
excellence to work every day throughout BP . 
You can see it in the ways we aim to use resources
efficiently to deliver sustainable production;
confidently act first in a complex marketplace; 
focus on the most meaningful markets; fulfil our
customers’ needs; learn from our best practices; 
and lead by example. All to perform reliably and
responsibly on behalf of our shareholders worldwide. 
At BP , this is how we’re making the right choices. 2
These tables and charts show the highlights of BP’s achievements
in 2004. They reflect more than our financial performance. Our
strong profitability has allowed us to increase the dividend year on
year, and we are continuing to invest in the future. Environmental
and safety performance remains a key focus. We continue to
make significant financial commitments in the communities in
which we operate.
In this Report, BP presents pro forma results in addition to
its reported results, to enable shareholders to evaluate better
our performance against that of our competitors. The pro forma
result is replacement cost profit excluding acquisition amortization
as defined in footnote 
b
to the reconciliation table (below). 
Both the pro forma result and replacement cost profit include
exceptional items and non-operating items as defined in 
footnote 
a
to the reconciliation table (below). The pro forma 
result has been derived from our UK GAAP accounting
information but is not in itself a recognized UK or US GAAP
measure. BP will discontinue pro forma reporting at the time it
adopts International Financial Reporting Standards with effect
from the first quarter of 2005. References within BP Annual
Report and Accounts 2004 to ‘result’ are to pro forma results.
References to ‘capital employed’, ‘operating capital employed’
and ‘net debt plus equity’ are to these measures on a pro forma
basis that excludes the fixed asset revaluation adjustment and
goodwill consequent upon the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO)
and Burmah Castrol acquisitions in 2000. ‘Return’, ‘return on
average capital employed’ and the ‘net debt ratio’ (net debt/net
debt plus equity) refer to ratios calculated using these measures.
The financial information for 2003 has been restated to reflect
(a) the transfer of natural gas liquids (NGLs) operations from
the Exploration and Production segment to Gas, Power and
Renewables on 1 January 2004; (b) the adoption by the group
of Financial Reporting Standard No. 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’
(FRS 17) with effect from 1 January 2004; and (c) the adoption
by the group of Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract No. 38
‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’ with effect from 1 January 2004.

Chairman’s letter
Dear Shareholder  BP has delivered another excellent set of
results for the year. Sustained high oil and gas prices, coupled
with advances in operational performance, have resulted in 
a strong cash flow, accelerating our returns to shareholders 
in the near term through significant share repurchases.
Returning cash in excess of our investment requirements to
our shareholders – both through buybacks and our continued
pursuit of a progressive dividend policy – is fundamental to 
our strategy. 
Exchange-rate issues – especially the relative weakness 
of the dollar in the past year – have been felt by those who
receive their dividends in sterling. Over the longer term,
fluctuating exchange rates generally benefit shareholders 
on each side of the Atlantic at different times. For instance, 
in the five-year period from 1996 to 2001, the sterling dividend
rose by 58%. The rationale for declaring our dividend in US
dollars remains sound, since our principal businesses all trade
in that currency. While headline increases in sterling and dollar
dividends show a differential, the key element to note is that
both are growing.
2004 has seen a rapid acceleration of our buyback programme,
with $7.5 billion worth of shares bought back and cancelled
during the year. While this has been welcomed by larger 
and institutional investors, the benefit for all shareholders
committed to long-term investment in BP will be felt through
the ultimate capital appreciation of their shares. The board
keeps its strategy in this area under review to ensure the
balance between dividend and buybacks remains appropriate
for our owners as a whole.
Against this background, our confidence in the future 
of the business enables us to make a step change in the 
fourth-quarter dividend, which I am pleased to confirm 
as 8.50 cents per share. This makes the annual payment 
29.45 cents per share or 16.099 pence per share, an increase
in dollar terms over last year of 13% and an increase of 4% 
in sterling terms. 
2004 saw heightened regulatory attention on our industry, 
not least in the area of the reporting of hydrocarbon reserves.
Reserves reporting is an important measure of our
performance as it demonstrates the extent to which we are
replacing the hydrocarbons we are producing – a particular
strength of BP in recent years. As a UK company, our reserves
are estimated in accordance with UK accounting practice.
These reserves are stated each year in our Annual Report. 
For US regulatory purposes we report reserves estimates 
in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. During the course of the year, the board and 
its audit committee have exercised considerable scrutiny 
in this area. In this year’s Annual Report, we have included, 
for the first time, US SEC-based estimates in addition to our 
UK reserves bookings. 
Our business is global and complex, and we are fortunate 
to have a first-rate executive team to address these challenges.
During the year, the executive management team, so ably 
led by John Browne, has sustained its formidable track record.
They have our full confidence and support. I would like to thank
John and his team for their exemplary efforts on your behalf 
in 2004. Our thanks are also due to all 102,900 BP employees BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
5
around the world for their unremitting effort and the value they
have created for our shareholders. 
Within a company with such a strong executive management
team, it is important that the role of the board is understood. As
a board, we are conscious that we oversee the activities of the
business in the interests of all our owners. The recent debate
on corporate governance has focused on the mechanisms of
board process and reporting – ensuring appropriate checks 
and balances are in place. Against this background, too many
company directors have complained that they want to ‘move
away from corporate governance’ and ‘get back to running 
our businesses’. 
Correctly, I think, our board recognizes that the primary
business of the board is corporate governance. Governing 
BP is not a matter to be driven solely by compliance concerns,
but by the business purpose of the company you entrust us 
to govern on your behalf. Our role as a board therefore focuses
on ensuring your interests are promoted and that our business
maximizes long-term value for you, our owners. 
Ensuring that our business remains nimble and competitive,
able to leverage the manifold talents of our managers, is key 
to the pursuit of that goal. To discharge the trust you place in
us as a board, we test the strategic direction of the company’s
business. We also monitor the operations of the business in
pursuit of that strategy to ensure both that BP’s activities live
out the values we set and also, critically, that shareholder value
lies at the heart of all we do. 
2004 saw a continuation of our very significant capital
investment programme that is key to the long-term future 
of our business. As a board, we continue to scrutinize the
strategic direction of the company, especially as our activities
take us to more challenging geographic locations, to ensure
that it continues to provide the prospect of the best long-term
returns for our shareholders.
In the course of the year, significant work has been
undertaken by the chairman’s committee and the nomination
committee, both of which I chair, as issues of executive and
non-executive succession planning and performance come 
into ever-greater focus. Likewise the remuneration committee,
led by Sir Robin Nicholson and his designated successor 
Dr DeAnne Julius, has been heavily engaged in the development
of new incentive plans for our executive directors. 
The board performance report on pages 110-115 expands
upon the way in which the board and its committees discharge
their mandate of governance. 
Last year, I commented on board succession and
development planning for the coming years. At the forthcoming
AGM, two of our senior non-executive directors, Sir Robin
Nicholson and Charles (Chuck) Knight, will step down.
Robin has served on the BP board since 1987 and has
been an excellent chairman of our remuneration committee.
He has had a substantial impact on the board and the company
over the past 17 years and been a major contributor to all
our board debates; we shall miss his wisdom and insight.
On a personal note, I shall miss his sage counsel and technical
insight, but am delighted that he has agreed to continue to
chair the group’s technology advisory committee in the
short term.
Chuck Knight also joined the board in 1987. His perspective
on corporate practices in the United States and experience 
as a senior chief executive operating within the US market
have proved invaluable, not least as BP has evolved in that
marketplace over the past two decades. I will miss his unique
contributions to the board’s discussions. 
I would like to thank both Robin and Chuck on your behalf 
for all their years of distinguished service.
The endorsement of the strength of our executive team 
by the invitation extended to Dick Olver to take on the
chairmanship of BAE Systems plc was, of course, tinged 
with sadness at having to bid farewell to a first-rate colleague,
who had served the company so well over the past 31 years.
We wish Dick well for the future and thank him for his years 
of dedicated service to BP .
Three new appointments have been made to the board 
in the last year. Iain Conn has been appointed an executive
director. Iain has had a substantial career within BP and is
responsible for strategic resources. Sir Tom McKillop, chief
executive of AstraZeneca PLC, joined the board in July 2004 
and Douglas Flint, chief financial officer of HSBC Holdings plc,
joined in January 2005. Each brings his own particular skills 
and experience to complement those of his fellow directors 
in the coming years. 
The world in which BP operates is ever more complex 
and challenging. The coming year will see the continued
development of our business strategy. I believe your board is
well resourced to address shareholders’ interests during this
period. I look forward to reporting on their successful advance
in the years ahead. We have an exciting future together. 
Thank you for all your continued support and interest in 
this company.

Group chief executive’s review
Dear Shareholder 2004 was a great year for BP . In terms of
overall performance, it was the best since the recent series 
of mergers and acquisitions. 
High demand for energy and higher oil prices certainly
contributed to our performance and led to our record financial
results. But our success in 2004 was based on more than
these external factors. 
We showed that we had the capability to deliver our strategy
and to translate our scope and scale into competitive advantage.
We demonstrated that we had the human talent to increase
production, make new discoveries, gain new customers,
enhance safety and grow our reputation. Our global workforce
worked as a seamless team and I thank every one of them. 
As you read this Annual Report and follow our efforts to 
create value, it may be helpful to understand how we achieve
excellent performance. 
Our purpose and strategy We begin with our purpose as a
group – to provide better goods and services in the form 
of light, heat, power and mobility to increasing numbers of
people. To succeed, we do this in a way that is profitable,
sustainable and consistent. This is reflected in value generated
for shareholders. 
To deliver profitable performance, we provide high-quality
products in a competitive way – maximizing revenues and
minimizing costs. 
To deliver sustainable performance, we also provide these
products in a sustainable way – attracting the best people,
accessing large-scale oil and gas resources, building markets 
in which we enjoy customers’ trust while doing business in a
mutually advantageous way that brings benefits to everyone
concerned – customers, communities, governments, suppliers,
citizens – and so generates ‘repeat business’. 
To deliver consistent performance, we invest enough to
deliver long-term growth, while balancing this with returns 
to our shareholders. Too fast a growth rate is unsustainable,
while too slow a rate sacrifices competitive advantage. Our
analysis gives us confidence that an investment level of around
$14 billion is right for 2005 and 2006, taking into account the
present level of the dollar and recent sector-specific inflation. 
To achieve our purpose, we have a strategy. We make
choices about the assets and markets where we operate. 
Our business strategy remains unchanged. In Exploration
and Production, we seek out long-term assets – the largest,
low-cost, new hydrocarbon deposits – while managing the
decline of mature fields. In our customer-facing businesses, 
we look to attract more and more customers through improved
quality of products and service. Our challenge is to add new
sources of cash flow whose cash returns are at least as good
as existing ones. 
2004 in context  As I wrote last year, we started 2004 with
greater scale, common values and a clear strategy. But nothing
was a given. We were cautious about our ability to execute –
whether our people operating in 100 countries could effectively
translate our worldwide assets into world-class performance.
We were wary of global developments, including ongoing
conflict in Iraq, the threat of terrorism and public mistrust of
large companies. And we found ourselves in one of the more
volatile oil markets in history, driven by demand and anxiety
about supply. Against this backdrop, the team delivered 
record performance.
As the world’s energy market entered uncharted territory in
2004, the subject of the future of energy supply took centre
stage. Rising demand – which matched the rate of global
economic growth for the first time in 30 years – produced both
short-term anxiety about fuel prices and long-term concern
about supply. Had there been a fundamental shift in the oil
market? Were there enough reserves? What else could disrupt
supply? Were companies investing enough to meet demand?
In this uncertain climate, a little history can be reassuring.
Clearly, questions over security of supplies have driven oil
prices upwards. But, amid all the market disruptions of the past
few years, supply has never fallen short of demand. Increased
investment by the private sector has led to production gains 
of more than 15% a year during the last five years. Global
production in 2004 rose at the fourth-highest rate in history.
Choosing our goals We execute our strategy against the
context of the time. We make plans to achieve three targets:
• To underpin growth by a focus on performance, particularly
on cash returns, investing at a rate appropriate for long-term
growth. 
• To increase dividends. 
• To return to shareholders, by way of share buybacks, 
100% of free cash flow generated above what is needed 
for investment and dividends: this generally occurs, all 
other things being appropriate, when the price of oil 
exceeds $20 a barrel. 
These plans are executed by applying resources and
capabilities across the organization. 
In last year’s report, I wrote that organizational alignment 
and operational excellence would shape our future as a group
and that we had developed a new management framework 
to harness the energy and imagination of our people. In 2004,
we took further steps to embed these common values and
processes, clarifying individual accountability. In 2005, 
we will issue a new code of conduct to ensure that each
individual in BP continues to exhibit high and consistent
standards of ethical behaviour. 
We continue to innovate and apply leading-edge technology.
For example, our new Thunder Horse platform in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico breaks many records as the largest
floating facility and will operate in the deepest water, with the
harshest reservoir pressure and temperature regime.
We also continue to strengthen the development opportunities
that we offer to our people. For example, we have the Projects
Academy, in which we partner with the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology to help people gain best-in-class project
management skills. 
We measure the views of our staff through a People
Assurance Survey. In 2004, this showed a significant rise in  BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004

the overall employee satisfaction index, demonstrating 
an increasing sense of enthusiasm and teamwork among 
BP’s employees. 
Reaching new milestones In a year of great success, there
were notable operational highlights:
• Our safety record improved for the eighth year running,
although tragically we still suffered 11 fatalities among
contractors and employees. 
• Exploration and Production made new discoveries in 
Angola, Egypt, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Trinidad 
and Sakhalin Island in Russia and brought on stream
three new fields.
• Our production growth of more than 10% was in line
with our indicator of a 7% average for 2003-2008.
• Replacement of proved reserves (for subsidiaries and 
equity-accounted entities) at over 100% exceeded 
production for the 12th year running. TNK-BP contributed 
$1.5 billion, after interest and tax, to our result, paid to 
us $1.9 billion of dividends and increased oil production
volumes by 14%.
• In Refining and Marketing, refining margins reached their
highest levels since at least 1990. We continued to find 
ways to maximize our global refining capacity.
• Premium Ultimate fuels have been newly launched in 
six markets, attracting new customers to these higher-
performance, cleaner, higher-margin products.
• BP’s retail sales continued to outpace the sector. At our
convenience locations worldwide, sales per square metre
grew by an average of 3%.
• We entered into agreements to sell liquefied natural 
gas to the US, China, South Korea and Mexico, and 
produced growth in sales volumes. 
• Our solar business streamlined its operations, tightened 
its market focus and delivered its first profit.
• We initiated the separation of the Petrochemicals business
into two entities, while still achieving record sales 
volumes through increased plant use and reliability.
• Through disciplined portfolio management, we made 
$5 billion of divestments.
Through our activities, BP delivered a record result of
$16.2 billion in 2004. With cash inflow of $6 billion and cash
returns of 35%, our performance continued to allow for strong
investment in our long-term growth as well as to return value 
to investors in the form of higher dividends – 29.45 cents per
share in 2004, an increase of 13% year on year – and significant
share buybacks, amounting to $7.5 billion in the year. 
BP now has the assets, market positions and organizational
capability to continue to deliver its unchanged strategy. 
We are meeting our three targets, with disciplined
investments, increased dividends and excess free cash flow 
for significant share buybacks.
We have confidence in our ability to perform sustainably,
focusing mainly on conventional oil and gas resources,
seeking to add value to products and services in customer-
facing businesses. 
In my many meetings with BP people around the world, 
I am constantly struck by their commitment to deliver ever-
improved performance, but responsibly and with integrity. 
My role is to provide the framework that guides and
encourages them to make the right choices: today, 
tomorrow and for the long-term future of your company. 
As always, the best is yet to come.

The fact is, there is no formula for operational
excellence. There’s no patented system, established
path or single way to achieve it. For every company
that competes on a global basis, the journey to
operational excellence is unique. For BP , operational
excellence enables us reliably and responsibly to
deliver our strategy. From the assets we’ve built to
the returns we offer our investors – and the ideas we
turn into action along the way – individuals and teams
across BP are putting operational excellence into
practice, making it an organizational principle, not
simply an aspiration. Making the right choices
10
Resourcefulness on a new scale
Our resources business is about renewal. We operate
within the world’s largest supply-and-demand
relationship, a marketplace in which our long-term
success depends on the ability of our teams to replace
reserves at least as fast as they bring them to market.
So how have we done? As we describe later, in each
of the last 12 years, we’ve replaced more than100%
of our production and, at the same time, delivered
some of the lowest finding costs in our industry.
Developing our resources through operational
excellence is converting our scale into profitability.
Turning our technologies into discoveries. Bringing our
projects into production. Connecting our exceptional
people through best practices. And extending the
potential of the world’s energy resources. BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
11
Seeing into the future Discovery never ends. That’s a principle our people learned long ago. Even in the most mature oil
and gas fields, there is hidden potential – if you know where and how to look. Egypt is a great example. As global gas
demand and infrastructure have grown, we’ve rewritten our strategy there. As well as extending the productivity of
existing oil fields, BP teams are now applying new technology and capital to discover natural gas resources. In the Nile
Delta, leading-edge aeromagnetic and seismic technology is allowing our exploration team to ‘see’ beneath the sea 
floor, taking them through deeper water towards uncharted gas reservoirs. The team’s efforts in imaging, interpretation,
integrated planning, testing and drilling have turned their raw data into real potential, and in 2004 confirmed the presence
of a promising new gas field, called Raven. What’s the next boundary? The team’s newest wells will determine the Raven
field’s size. But they are already contributing towards BP’s development of a major liquefied natural gas (LNG) business
to help meet the world’s growing demand for cleaner energy. Making the right choices
12
A mature outlook Conventional oil business wisdom holds that, once a field has reached maturity, its descent into
unprofitability is almost inevitable. At BP , however, our people tend to see ‘mature’ fields differently. Since 2000, our
existing profit centres have been run with an efficiency that’s led to an average replacement rate of 72% for the proved
reserves they have produced over this period. These ‘mature’ operations, some of which date back to the 1960s, have
maintained their vitality. Today, their output is projected to decline at a modest 3% annually until 2008. What’s made this
possible? Discipline, creativity and the kind of operating efficiency that comes from decades of knowledge and innovative
team practices in the field. We aim to extend this life expectancy. In established fields from Alaska to the North Sea, our
teams are applying remote control and online field management, increasing well recovery rates, streamlining maintenance
and even tapping into new discoveries. All of which means they’re getting more from our existing hydrocarbon base
with greater reliability and predictable cost – producing our resources as efficiently as we discover them. BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
13
Producing in new dimensions How much? How long? What next? These are the biggest questions in the world of energy
today. Part of the answer is a broader set of skills in production – creativity, efficiency, speed – to bring discoveries
consistently and responsibly to market. In oil and gas fields worldwide, our people are helping to make us productive at
an unprecedented scale. We now find oil and deliver new production with an efficiency that’s on a par with the industry’s
best. The ideas, energy and organization of our teams have also led us into our most prolific era for operational start-ups.
Over the last two years, we have completed nine major projects. From now until December 2006, we have 10 more major
oil and gas project completions planned, including some of the world’s largest construction projects in some of the most
geologically challenging locations. Among them is the Gulf of Mexico, where our teams are redefining what is possible in
deepwater operations at four fields simultaneously under development, including the massive Holstein platform (above). Making the right choices
14
The best routes to market
In today’s energy marketplace, bringing resources to
the world involves far more than making deliveries. 
It takes a business model that consistently finds the
most efficient ways of getting there. After years 
of building assets in the natural gas marketplace, 
BP is now one of the world’s largest non-state gas
companies in terms of production and sales volumes.
In the world’s largest gas market, North America, we
sell the largest volumes of end-user and wholesale
gas, and are one of the largest marketers of natural
gas liquids. Globally, in liquefied natural gas we are
the second largest non-state supplier of gas into
liquefaction plants. But our real advantage goes
beyond our size and reach. It’s the way our people 
run our businesses – the commercial and operational
practices they use to open up markets for tomorrow
and maximize the value of our resources today. BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
15
Building a mobile pipeline The distance between a natural gas field and a market can be measured in miles. It can also 
be calculated in years. BP’s LNG strategy is bringing our gas closer to market. To capture a growing share of future
customers for cleaner natural gas, our LNG teams have built a flexible system to supply growing demand – a ‘mobile
pipeline’ to serve major regional markets and meet the needs of customers in the US, UK, Spain, Japan, South Korea
and China. These locations increasingly rely on gas imports for primary energy and electricity needs, but they are often
far from sources of natural gas. LNG bridges the gap: gas is lifted from underground, chilled to liquid, transported on
ships from one part of the world to another, and then warmed back into gas to fuel a power plant, factory or home. 
As well as managing long-term point-to-point contracts, we are able to use our own ships to direct LNG to markets
where demand is greatest and value highest – opening new markets and using the open seas to supply them. Making the right choices
16
Flowing with information In the marketplace for oil and gas, one of the most valuable commodities is intelligence – the
ability to understand and interpret market information. You’ll find our people at this intersection of supply and demand.
Their minute-by-minute knowledge of the direction of supply and demand on a global basis is a discipline that allows our
teams to find the most productive links between assets and across supply chains. To streamline manufacturing flows. 
And to serve our customers distinctively and with competitive advantage. We do this by making a significant investment 
in digital and communications technology. We align that investment with a host of ‘people’ capabilities – human strengths
in analysis, logistics, trading and risk management. Our people use real-time data, information systems, transaction
automation and their own trading wisdom to act on some of the best available market intelligence worldwide. All this
allows BP to connect the dots in ways that others might not see, giving our customers a better level of service. That’s
how we take decisions that help to make the most of our resources. BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
17
Fine-tuning refining In refining, what matters more – processes or people? Traditional industry benchmarks for operational
excellence in the refining business focus on uptime, the reliability of plant and equipment and the productivity of the
manufacturing process. But people in our refining operations find that their individual actions – large and small – can help
to set an even higher standard. Since 2002, our global refining workforce has started thinking of reliability in personal
terms. By adopting the mindset of a High Reliability Organization (HRO), decision-making happens at the level where the
knowledge and expertise reside. And this leads to faster, better decisions that drive consistent, high-quality operating
performance and commercial production. More than a management technique, HRO is a way of thinking that encourages
team members to speak out, find root causes of problems and take action early when they catch even the smallest
failures. HRO is the way refining thinks best – and the best way we know to perform reliably for our customers. Making the right choices
18
Getting closer to customers
Every day, in locations around the world, our people
serve about 13 million customers. To put this in
perspective, our businesses and brands – among them
BP , Castrol, ARCO, Aral, Ultimate, Connect and am/pm –
reach nearly as many customers as Wal-Mart, the world’s
largest retailer. But to be operationally excellent where
our products meet the marketplace, our customer
relationships have to be defined by quality as well as
quantity – the distinctiveness and competitiveness 
of what we offer and the operating processes that
underpin customer experiences. Our customer-facing
businesses are gaining advantage and improving
performance by carefully determining what customers
want. By being consistent and creative in meeting
those needs. By strengthening brands through
innovation. And by locating facilities where they can
most effectively and conveniently deliver our offers. BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
19
am/pm is the preferred
fuel station convenience
store brand on the
US West Coast.
ARCO has the largest
retail fuels market
share on the US
West Coast.
Castrol is one of the top-
selling passenger car
lubricants in the world.
The BP brand is 
strongly recognized
throughout the world.
Awareness of the brand
is growing through
improved business 
offers and targeted
communication efforts. 
Aral is the largest 
retail fuel marketer in
Germany. Its position 
has benefited from 
the rebadging of the 
BP network, largely
completed in 2004.
Building a better brand In the minds of our customers, what our products stand for is just as important as what we
make. This means that not only our investment in assets but also every decision we make in choosing routes to market
must be sustained by careful management of our brands. As the face of BP , our brands are more than just logos. They 
are business assets. In combination with the well-defined advantages of our products, they tell a compelling story to 
our customers – the kind that builds preferences and sustains relationships. Which is why our brands rely on operational
excellence. They include Ultimate, which is consistently ranked as the highest quality premium retail fuel by random
samples of motorists. In lubricants, our Castrol brand has used its technological advantage, rigorous segmentation and
customer loyalty to drive sales consistently ahead of market growth. Our updated and expanded retail locations are
accelerating operating performance, increasing customers and driving sales per square metre. Applying operational
excellence to the marketplace makes our brands more meaningful – and our businesses more valuable. Making the right choices
20
Driven by distinctiveness In striving for operational excellence, where you choose to compete is often as important as how
efficiently you do it. BP’s lubricants team has proved that effective strategic choices in market segmentation, customer
relationships and brand visibility can enhance the value of assets and accelerate growth. In global lubricants markets,
characterized by limited volume growth and increasing competitive pressure, BP stands out. Our marketing strength,
technological distinctiveness and premium position have led to above-market year-on-year sales growth in automotive
lubricants. What makes us different? While we sell lubricants, led by Castrol, in more than100 countries worldwide, 
our people think in terms of market segments – motorcycles, passenger cars, trucks and vehicle manufacturers – 
rather than marketplaces. This perspective allows them to capture customers for whom our technology, consumer insight
and brands add value and can generate higher returns for BP . In applying this strategy to new markets such as China,
where lubricants growth is dramatic and preferences form quickly, our teams are already capitalizing on the strength 
of our brands to build distribution channels, market share and customer loyalty. BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
21
Solving the solar equation We all know the appeal of solar power – sustainability, acceptability and independence. Yet its
potential as an energy source has often been overshadowed by its economics as a business. At least until now. Beginning
in 2003, our BP solar team refocused its activities to become the profit centre that it could be – better understanding
customers, operating at the right scale and reaching the best markets. We’re now running a profitable solar operation –
still small by BP standards, but one that grew its megawatt capacity sales of photovoltaic equipment by more than 30% 
in 2004. This performance is being driven by manufacturing consolidation, product innovation and, in particular, the team’s
focus on eight global sectors where well-defined customer needs, improved system performance and government
incentives converge. A good example is Germany, the world’s second largest solar market after Japan. Our large commercial
installation at Geiseltalsee (above) provides sustainable benefits on two fronts: the field generates four megawatts of
power, enough to supply 1 ,000 four-person households each year, and has reclaimed the site of a former oil depot. Making the right choices
22
The point of excellence
Our upstream and downstream activities reach not
only the marketplace but also investors, regulators,
government leaders and the public. Our abilities as 
an organization to sustain and improve our standing
among these groups are key to our definition of
operational excellence. These abilities support our
new scope and scale while retaining the diverse
heritage of our people and businesses. They help
equip BP with the skills, knowledge and reputation 
that enable us to conduct business in a chosen
country – and let us navigate an increasingly 
complex and unpredictable world with sensitivity.  BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
23
Our human potential In business in general, and within BP in particular, the relationship between employee and
performance is unbreakable. Simply put, our employees hold the knowledge, skills and energy that enable our
enterprise to thrive. At BP , operational excellence includes the ways in which we expand our employees’ range of
possibilities as they expand ours. A good example is our Projects Academy. In 2003, we began working with the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to change how our teams deliver major projects. Focusing on project
leadership, business knowledge and technical excellence, the MIT programme is bringing BP’s senior project 
leaders together with recognized leaders in engineering and project management. The first two Projects Academy
classes graduated in 2004. Their members are already applying new insights to manage the complexity of their
projects, understand team dynamics, clarify priorities and build a well-connected network of ideas. The Projects
Academy, Marketing Academy and other practical initiatives give BP the capacity to learn and share knowledge 
on an everyday, global basis, and to grow our most prized resource – our people. Financial and business operating review
24
Business environment
Trading conditions in 2004 were affected by tight supplies in 
oil markets and by strong world economic growth. 
Average crude oil prices in nominal terms in 2004 were the
highest for 20 years, driven by exceptionally strong global oil
demand growth and the physical disruption to US oil operations
caused by Hurricane Ivan. The Brent price averaged $38.27 per
barrel, an increase of more than $9 per barrel over the $28.83
per barrel average seen in 2003, and varied between $29.13
and $52.03 per barrel.
Natural gas prices in the US were also strong during 2004. The
Henry Hub First of the Month Index averaged $6.13 per million
British thermal units (mmBtu), up by more than $0.70 per mmBtu
compared with the 2003 average of $5.37 per mmBtu. Prices fell
slightly relative to oil prices as the levels of gas in storage rose
sharply. UK gas prices were also up strongly in 2004, averaging
24.39 pence per therm at the National Balancing Point compared
with a 2003 average of 20.28 pence per therm.
Refining margins averaged record highs in 2004, despite
weakening towards the end of the year. This reflected strong
oil demand growth and record refinery throughput levels. 
Retail margins weakened in 2004, as rising product prices and
price volatility made their impact in a competitive marketplace.
In Petrochemicals, generally improved market conditions led 
to a gradual increase in both volumes and margins through 
the year. Such gains were, however, partially offset by high 
and volatile energy and feedstock prices, together with adverse
foreign exchange impacts.
Results
BP’s result for the year was $16,208 million, compared with
$12,858 million in 2003. The result per share was 74.27 cents, an
increase of 28%. Replacement cost profit was $14,088 million
(2003 $10,466 million). Both the result and replacement cost
profit include exceptional and non-operating items.
The return on average capital employed was 20%, compared
with 18% in 2003. On a replacement cost basis, the 2004
return was 15% (2003 12%), and 17% (2003 12%) on a
historical cost basis.
Net exceptional gains of $815 million before tax principally relate
to gains from the sale of our interests in PetroChina and Sinopec
and the divestment of certain upstream interests, partly offset by
net losses on a number of business sales and facility closures.
Non-operating items in 2004 were a net charge of 
$2,120 million before tax and are shown on page 25. The
majority of the asset write-downs and impairments relate to 
the Petrochemicals segment, reflecting the portfolio separation
described on page 28.
Interest expense was $642 million, compared with 
$644 million in 2003. This primarily reflects lower interest rates
and debt buyback costs and an increase in capitalized interest,
offset by the inclusion of BP’s share of a full year’s interest
expense from TNK-BP in 2004.
Corporate tax expense was $8,282 million (2003 
$6,111 million), representing an effective tax rate of 34% 
on the pro forma result (2003 32%).
Historical cost profit was $15,731 million, including
exceptional net gains after tax of $1,076 million and stock
holding gains of $1,643 million. The corresponding figures for
2003 were $10,482 million profit, $708 million net gains and
$16 million gains respectively.
Capital expenditure and acquisitions amounted to 
$17,249 million, including $1,354 million for including TNK’s
interest in Slavneft within TNK-BP and $1,355 million for the
acquisition of Solvay’s interests in BP Solvay Polyethylene
Europe and BP Solvay Polyethylene North America. Excluding
acquisitions, capital expenditure was $14,408 million,
compared with $13,986 million in 2003.
Net cash inflow for the year was $6,038 million, compared
with an inflow of $1,405 million in 2003; higher operating cash

Replacement cost profit for the period includes the net profit or loss on the sale of fixed assets and businesses or termination of operations. It also includes non-
operating items identified by the group, primarily asset write-downs/impairment, environmental and other provisions and restructuring, integration and rationalization

Acquisition amortization refers to depreciation relating to the fixed asset revaluation adjustment and amortization of goodwill consequent upon the ARCO and Burmah
Castrol acquisitions. The results for 2003 and 2004 include accelerated depreciation of the revaluation adjustment in respect of the impairment of former ARCO assets
of $381 million and $214 million, respectively. BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004

flow and higher dividends from joint ventures were partly
offset by higher tax payments, lower disposal proceeds 
and higher acquisition spending. Net cash outflow for 
capital expenditure and acquisitions, net of disposals, was 
$11,954 million (2003 $9,672 million). During 2004, we made
incremental payments of $395 million into a number of the
group’s pension funds (2003 $2,533 million).
The group’s net debt, that is debt less cash and liquid
resources, was $21,607 million at the end of 2004, compared
with $20,193 million at the end of the previous year. The ratio 
of net debt to net debt plus equity was 24%, at the bottom of
the target range, compared with 26% a year ago. On a reported
basis, the percentage was 22% (2003 22%).
In addition to reported debt, BP uses conventional off
balance sheet sources of finance such as operating leases 
and borrowings in joint ventures and associates. The group 
has access to significant sources of liquidity in the form of
committed facilities and other arrangements.
Dividends and share repurchases
The total dividends announced for 2004 were $6,371 million,
against $5,753 million in 2003. Dividends per share for 2004
were 29.45 cents, an increase of 13% compared with 2003. 
In sterling terms, the dividend was 4% higher. This increase is 
a result of our strong cash flow and improvements in underlying
performance in line with strategy. In addition, our confidence 
in the future enabled us to make a step change in the fourth
quarterly dividend. The board sets the dividend based upon 
the prevailing circumstances of the group, future investment
patterns and the sustainability of the group, and the future
trading environment. The steady increases in the dollar dividend
in recent years reflect the board’s progressive dividend policy.
BP intends to continue the operation of the Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) for shareholders who wish to
receive their dividend in the form of shares rather than cash.
The BP Direct Access Plan for US and Canadian investors 
also includes a dividend reinvestment feature.
The group aims to demonstrate financial discipline by balancing
cash in and cash out over time. When trading conditions are
favourable, cash flow may be in excess of what is needed 
for operational requirements, including funding the capital
programme and any acquisitions and dividend payments. As
part of giving a return to shareholders, one of the steps we take
from time to time is to repurchase our own shares. During 2004,
a total of 827 million shares were repurchased and cancelled at 
a cost of $7,548 million. The repurchased shares had a nominal
value of $207 million and represented 3.7% of ordinary shares 
in issue at the end of 2003. Since the inception of the share
repurchase programme in 2000, 1,602 million shares have been
repurchased and cancelled at a cost of $13.5 billion. BP intends to
continue making share repurchases, subject to market conditions
and continuing authority at the April 2005 annual general meeting. 
During the year, shares to the value of $1.25 billion were
issued to Alfa Group and Access-Renova (AAR) as the first
instalment of the deferred consideration for our investment in
TNK-BP . Two more instalments of $1.25 billion are due in the
third quarters of 2005 and 2006.

Exploration and Production
Exploration and Production
The result for the year was a record $19,759 million,
representing an improvement of 22% over 2003, arising 
from increased production and higher oil and gas prices. 
Our production was 3,997 thousand barrels of oil equivalent
per day, an increase of more than 10% over 2003, primarily
from incremental production in TNK-BP and our new profit
centres. The increase was partly offset by a severe hurricane
season in the Gulf of Mexico, a blow-out at the non-BP-operated
Temsah platform in Egypt, the impact of divestments and
decline in our existing profit centres.
We sanctioned four new major projects (Azeri-Chirag-
Gunashli phase three in Azerbaijan, Rosa in Angola, Magnus
extension in the UK North Sea and viscous oil in Alaska) and
completed four major projects (In Salah in Algeria, Australia
North West Shelf Train 4, Kizomba A in Angola and Holstein in
the Gulf of Mexico). The increase in capital spending this year
primarily reflected continued high development activity as 
we progressed projects in the new profit centres. Despite
significant success across the supply chain to minimize the
impact, inflationary pressures on our raw materials and the
weaker dollar contributed to the increase.
Progress continued in our existing profit centres. Production
from the Cerro Dragon field in Argentina grew through further
infill drilling. In the North Sea, progress continued as expected
on the Rhum development. 
Each of our new profit centres progressed in line with our
expectations this year. 
In Trinidad, from where BP has prime access to US and
European liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets, we built on 
our integrated position. In July, Atlas Methanol, the world’s
largest methanol plant, came on line. Train 4 of Atlantic LNG
remains on track for start-up in the fourth quarter of 2005. 
It will be supplied in part by the Cannonball gas development,
which is Trinidad and Tobago’s first major in-country offshore
construction project.
In Azerbaijan, construction continued on the Central Azeri 
field, with topsides commissioning under way. First oil is
expected in the first half of 2005. We plan to transport this 
oil via the 1,760-kilometre Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline.
When complete, the pipeline will export crude oil from the
Caspian to world markets. In addition, construction continued on
the Shah Deniz gas field, and in-country assembly of the drilling
rig and platform is under way for a planned 2006 start-up.
In the Gulf of Mexico, the Holstein field started production 
in December, despite the effects of Hurricane Ivan. In 2004,
significant progress was made on Mad Dog, currently in the
final commissioning stages with first production expected in
early 2005, and on Thunder Horse, on track to begin production
by the end of 2005. This will be followed by Atlantis, with first
production expected in 2006.
In Angola, the Kizomba A field started production in August,
ahead of schedule, while Kizomba B remains on track for 
start-up in late 2005. All major contracts were awarded on 
the Greater Plutonio development and fabrication of the
Floating Production Storage and Offloading topsides began. 
In Algeria, the In Salah project started production in mid-
2004 and the In Amenas project remains on track for start-up 
in late 2005-early 2006.
Oil production from TNK-BP (excluding Slavneft) grew 
by about 14% over 2003. Our result for the year included
$2.4 billion from TNK-BP.We also received $1.9 billion of cash
dividends from the venture. 
We continually seek to enhance our portfolio through a
planned annual divestment programme. 
In 2004, this yielded $747 million of proceeds and covered
assets primarily in Indonesia, the US and Canada. We also
signed sales and purchase agreements for the Ormen 
Strategy
• Create new profit centres by accessing areas with the
potential for large oil and natural gas fields; exploring
successfully; and pursuing the best projects for development.
• Manage the performance of producing assets by investing 
in the best available opportunities and optimizing operating
efficiency.
• Sell assets that are no longer strategic to us and have
greater value to others.
Focus 
BP invests in a portfolio of large, lower-cost oil and natural 
gas fields chosen for their potentially strong return on capital
employed, and seeks to manage those assets safely with
maximum capital and operating efficiency. We continue to
develop new profit centres in which we have a distinctive
position: Trinidad, Angola, Azerbaijan, deepwater Gulf of
Mexico, Asia Pacific gas and Algeria. These new profit centres,
in addition to our growing operations in Russia, augment 
the production assets in our existing profit centres, providing
greater reach, investment choice and opportunity for growth.

Refining and Marketing
Lange field in Norway, which is planned to complete in 
early 2005.
New oil and gas discoveries were made in Egypt, Angola, 
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Trinidad and offshore Sakhalin
Island in Russia. Recoverable oil and gas from these finds is
estimated to be more than one billion barrels of oil equivalent.
On the basis of UK generally accepted accounting practice
(SORP), our proved reserves replacement ratio (RRR) was
106%, excluding equity-accounted entities. On the same basis,
including equity-accounted entities, the RRR was 110%. This
was the 12th consecutive year in which our RRR was greater
than 100%. We also prepare estimates of our proved reserves
on the basis of the rules and interpretation required by the 
US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On this basis,
our RRR was 78%, excluding equity-accounted entities, and
89%, including equity-accounted entities. The differences from
our SORP-based estimates arise mainly from the use of year-
end pricing, as required by the SEC. All our proved reserves
replacement ratios are based on discoveries, extensions,
revisions and improved recovery and exclude the effects of
acquisitions and disposals. BP has a robust internal process 
to control the quality of its reserve bookings, which forms 
part of a holistic and integrated system of internal control.
Details of that process and the applicable rules are described
on pages 87-88. 
Refining and Marketing
Strong refining margins, combined with robust operating
performance, led to a result of $5,603 million in 2004, a 
78% improvement from 2003. The relative weakening of 
the US dollar compared with the euro and sterling negatively
affected results. 
In our marketing businesses, strongly competitive sales
growth was maintained. This resulted both from our
investment to increase the quality of our portfolio and from 
our focus on operational excellence. Owing to increased crude
product and base oil prices, margins overall declined slightly
against those of 2003. We continued to strengthen our
competitive position in all our operations through improved 
site operating models and the development of distinctive 
offers for customers. 
Our investment in China deepened through two new joint
ventures with PetroChina and Sinopec. We continued to 
review our portfolio, resulting in the disposal of our refining,
retail and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) businesses in
Singapore, while further retail network asset disposals were
completed in 2004. From 1 January 2005, the Aromatics and
Acetyls businesses will join the segment and the Lavéra and
Grangemouth refineries will be included in the Olefins and
Derivatives business. 
A record performance for the refining business was
underpinned by strong product demand and good availability,
which averaged 95.4% in 2004. We concentrated on 
optimizing our assets and taking advantage of our global 
scale and presence. Focus on supply optimization, feedstock
selection and product value maximization helped us to 
capture high margins. BP’s Global Indicator Refining Margin
was $6.08 a barrel, up from $3.88 in 2003. Total global 
refining throughput was down by about 4% as a result 
of planned disposals. 
In our retail business, the number of sites carrying the 
BP helios expanded to 19,828 worldwide during 2004. We
launched Ultimate gasoline and diesel fuels in Australia,
Austria, France, Germany, Poland and Portugal. These enhanced
products deliver improved performance with fewer emissions
than standard fuel grades, and have received positive
responses from customers.
In our lubricants business, we focused on pursuing key
Strategy
• Focus on refining locations where scale, configuration and
operational excellence earn distinctive returns.
• Focus on retail fuel and convenience markets where supply
advantage and distinctive offer can capture market share.
• Leverage our brand and technology with a key focus on
automotive-related lubricants markets.
• Build strong strategic relationships in the business-to-
business sector.
• Enhance our existing strength in selected emerging 
markets, particularly China.
Focus 
Our marketing businesses, underpinned by world-class
manufacturing, generate customer value by providing quality
products and offers. Our retail, lubricants and business-to-
business sectors reach about 13 million customers a day. 
Our retail strategy provides differentiated fuel and convenience
offers to some of the most attractive global markets. Our
lubricants brands offer customers benefits through technology
and relationships. We have deep business-to-business customer
relationships and strategic partnerships. We seek to improve
the quality of our manufacturing portfolio and our products.

Petrochemicals
customer segments and markets where we believe we have 
a premium position. Our brands continued to experience
above-market volume growth, supported by new marketing
initiatives. Growth was particularly strong in Asia, with Castrol
BikeZone successfully launched in India and Vietnam. New
product launches took place across the world, including 
Castrol GTX Start Up in the US and Castrol GTX High Mileage
in Europe. 
2004 was also a good year for business-to-business fuels
marketing activity in both margin and volume, particularly in the
marine and aviation sectors. This was partially offset by margin
squeeze and price lag in the lubricants and LPG businesses,
although volume demand remained robust. We also successfully
launched the innovative new BP Gaslight composite LPG
cylinder and Castrol TLX Plus in marine lubricants.
Petrochemicals
Petrochemicals’ result was a loss of $900 million in 2004.
Record sales and production volumes, underpinned by 
strong demand and by increased utilization and reliability 
at manufacturing sites, were more than offset by higher
exceptional and non-operating charges. 
Focus on commercial and operational excellence, together
with generally improved market conditions, accelerated
performance. Margin expansion was achieved despite high 
and volatile prices for energy and feedstocks.
The segment continued to upgrade its portfolio, focusing on
areas with competitive advantage. As a consequence, several
businesses that did not meet our strategic and financial criteria
were sold, together with the announced closure of several
manufacturing units. Substantial progress was made in
constructing the SECCO chemicals complex near Shanghai 
(BP 50%) and expanding the Chocolate Bayou olefins operation
in Texas. Output from these investments is expected in 2005.
In 2004, we announced that, from 1 January 2005, the
Olefins and Derivatives (O&D) business would operate on 
a standalone basis within the BP group. We plan to divest the
O&D business, possibly starting with an Initial Public Offering
in the second half of 2005, subject to market conditions and
the receipt of necessary approvals. The O&D business markets
a wide range of petrochemicals, manufactured in more than 
20 locations worldwide. 
During 2004, several initiatives were announced, designed 
to strengthen the competitive standing of the O&D business.
The Grangemouth and Lavéra refineries will be incorporated
into O&D, so preserving the opportunity to enhance further 
the benefits of site integration with their neighbouring
petrochemicals operations. BP also agreed to acquire 
Solvay’s interests in the two BP Solvay high-density
polyethylene ventures for inclusion in O&D. Finally, Nova
Chemicals and O&D agreed in principle to combine their
respective styrene polymer interests in a joint venture, 
creating a major European polystyrene operation. Subject 
to regulatory approval, the joint venture is expected to 
start in mid-2005.
BP will retain the Aromatics and Acetyls (A&A) operations 
as an important part of its customer-facing activities. The A&A
businesses have among the largest global market shares and
advanced technologies in these high-growth sectors. BP aims
to grow the A&A businesses and several ongoing expansion
projects in Asia will start up in 2005. 
With the announced changes, the Petrochemicals segment
ceased to report separately as from 1 January 2005. The 
A&A operations will be included within the Refining and
Marketing segment; the O&D business will report within 
Other businesses and corporate. The new structure is 
designed to offer the greatest opportunity for further
improvement in overall performance and financial returns.
Strategy
• Separate the portfolio, enabling the individual parts to
develop strategic paths that deliver distinctive returns. We
plan to divest the Olefins and Derivatives business, possibly
starting with an Initial Public Offering in the second half of
2005, subject to market conditions and necessary approvals.
• Integrate the Aromatics and Acetyls businesses within the
Refining and Marketing segment, gaining operational and
organizational synergies. Maintain leading market shares and
technology in these high-growth businesses, with a strong
presence in Asia. 
• Focus the overall portfolio on areas with competitive
advantage and restructure other assets. 
Focus 
Our petrochemicals businesses have significant global market
positions, underpinned by leading proprietary technology and
strong manufacturing capabilities. Our activities focus on those
areas with a distinctive and significant competitive position.
Our products are ultimately used to service a wide range 
of consumer applications, increasingly in the fast-growing
markets of Asia Pacific and China in particular.

Gas, Power and Renewables
Gas, Power and Renewables
The result for the year was $943 million, an increase of 65%
over 2003 and underpinned by record sales volumes achieved
across all four principal business areas of LNG, NGLs, gas
marketing and solar. The NGLs business benefited from a firm
market environment by increasing sales by 14% and achieving
high levels of availability. Sales of natural gas increased by 
4%, while volumes of gas supplied into liquefaction plants 
rose by 11%. The solar business grew sales by 38% and
delivered a full-year operating profit for the first time. 
We took a number of important steps to access major
growth markets for the group’s equity gas. In Asia Pacific,
agreements for the supply of LNG from the proposed Tangguh
development in Indonesia (BP 37.16%) were signed with
POSCO and K Power for supply to South Korea and with
Sempra for supply to Mexico and US markets. Together 
with an earlier agreement to supply LNG to China, more 
than seven million tonnes a year of Tangguh LNG have been
secured. This was a significant factor in the decision to sanction
the development in early 2005. 
In the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions, significant
progress was also made in creating opportunities to supply
LNG to North American and European gas markets. In Egypt,
we signed agreements to supply gas to the Damietta LNG
plant and to purchase 1.45 billion cubic metres per year of 
LNG for supply to world markets. Agreements finalized with
NGT Transco will make BP and Sonatrach of Algeria the first
companies since the 1980s to import LNG into the UK market
from 2005. 
Plans for the development of new LNG import terminals on
the US East and Gulf coasts made good progress. These new
access points to market, together with existing capacity rights
at Cove Point in Maryland, US, Bilbao in Spain and Isle of Grain,
UK, should provide important opportunities to maximize the
value of the group’s gas supplies from Trinidad, Egypt 
and elsewhere. 
In the NGLs business, we maintained our position in North
America as one of the largest marketers and producers in
terms of production and sales volumes. There we had a very
strong year, benefiting from the high prices of NGLs seen
during 2004 and the wide differences between natural gas
feedstocks and liquids prices, which give higher earnings. 
In Egypt, a new NGLs extraction plant (BP 33.33%) began 
gas processing at Port Said.
Our gas marketing and trading business had a good year,
with an operating result ahead of 2003’s record performance.
In North America, we are the largest gas marketer in volumes
sold to end-use and wholesale markets and have a growing
power marketing and trading business. Our marketing and
trading scale and scope provide exemplary market access 
for the group’s North American equity gas production and 
LNG imports. We secured long-term capacity in several new
western US pipeline projects to support expected Rockies
production growth and avoid capacity constraints seen in the
past. We continued to expand our market presence in North
America by acquiring two gas marketing companies and
extending two key energy alliance agreements. 
Our solar business saw a record year, with strong sales
growth, a positive operating result and positive cash flow. 
The business benefited from the restructuring undertaken 
in 2003, which reduced the cost of supply, and also from
strong industry demand, which is supporting higher 
revenues. We reduced product lines and distributors and
improved customer focus and brand loyalty. Our global ‘lean
manufacturing’ initiative delivered major improvements in
productivity, and production from our main operating facilities
in Madrid, Spain, and Frederick, US, was stepped up to supply
the higher sales.
Strategy
• Capture distinctive world-scale market positions ahead 
of supply.
• Expand gross margin by providing distinctive products to
selected customer segments and optimizing the gas and
power value chains.
• Build a sustainable solar business and continue to 
assess the application of renewable and alternative 
energy sources.
Focus 
In line with changing demand patterns for cleaner fuels, 
BP seeks to participate at scale in the fast-growing markets 
for natural gas, gas liquids and solar energy. We currently hold
some of the largest market shares in volumes sold in North
American gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) and significant
strength in both the liquefied natural gas (LNG) and solar global
markets. We are expanding our LNG business by accessing
import terminals in Asia Pacific, North America and Europe.

Our fundamental purpose, as defined by BP’s board, is to
maximize shareholder value on a long-term basis by providing
constantly improving goods and services in a strongly
competitive way. To be sustainably successful, we have 
to gain and retain the support of many people, including
employees, shareholders, customers and communities.
This report summarizes our performance. More detail is
published in BP Sustainability Report 2004.
BP: our business
The way we work is guided by values – integrity, honest dealing,
treating everyone with respect and dignity, striving for mutual
advantage, transparency and contributing to human progress.
These values are enshrined in practical policies and standards
that govern areas of our activity, including health, safety,
security, environment, ethical conduct and business
relationships.
We use a system of risk management to assess the impact 
of our activities on the environment, local economies and
communities. Where appropriate, accountability for managing
environmental and social impacts is part of managers’
performance contracts, with specific objectives and milestones.
People’s safety is of the highest priority. Managers are
accountable for ensuring that safety risks are properly
addressed, staff are trained and facilities are well maintained.
We closely monitor our safety performance. 
In 2004, the number of injury cases (resulting in our
employees or contractors being away from work for a day or
more) was 0.08 per 200,000 hours worked, compared with
0.09 in 2003. This performance is approaching the best in our
industry and also within our target set at 0.09 for 2004.
Despite meeting this important target and reducing overall
injury rates, we deeply regret the 11 workforce fatalities in 2004.
This compares with 20 in 2003 and 13 in 2002. 
As a global organization, we believe our workforce, leadership
and recruitment should reflect the diverse communities in
which we operate. We are continuing to focus on employing
and developing local staff and leaders in our operations
worldwide. Programmes in countries including China, Angola
and Azerbaijan are ensuring that we continue to increase the
number of local employees. 
Our policy is to ensure equal opportunity in recruitment,
career development, promotion, training and reward for all
employees, including those with disabilities. All applicants and
employees are assessed against clear criteria related to job
requirements. Where existing employees become disabled, 
our policy is to provide continuing employment and training
wherever practicable.
Our People Assurance Survey (PAS), completed by 74% of 
our employees in 2004, showed a 4% improvement in overall
employee satisfaction. 
BP values the diversity of its leadership. At the end of 2004,
15% of our top 610 leaders were female and 19% were of
nationalities other than the UK or US. Our employee surveys
show that an inclusive culture is spreading. In 2004, 70% 
of BP employees who responded to the PAS believed the
company had created an environment where people with
diverse backgrounds could succeed, up from 67% in 2003 
and 60% in 2000. We strive to build an environment in which
everyone can feel part of a meritocratic organization.
During 2004, we made further progress in learning and
development opportunities for employees. Around 5,000 people
undertook the First Level Leaders programme, which provides
training for the first tier of management. More than 1,800 of 
our 6,000 senior leaders took part in the Senior Level Leaders
programme, designed to develop their leadership capabilities. 
BP’s fourth Global Graduate Forum was attended by around
300 graduates who joined in 2002, while around 250 people
attended the Discover BP programme, launched to help senior
experienced recruits integrate rapidly into BP .
We continue to support employee share ownership. Through
our award-winning ShareMatch plan, run in 75 countries, we
match BP shares purchased by employees. 
Communications with employees include global and local
magazines, intranet sites, DVDs, targeted e-mails and face-
to-face communication. Team meetings are the core of our
employee consultation, complemented by formal processes
through works councils in parts of Europe. This communication,
along with training programmes, raises awareness of the
financial, economic, social and environmental factors affecting
BP’s performance and contributes to employee development
and motivation.
We continue to emphasize the importance of doing business
with high standards of ethical conduct. To enhance our focus 
on compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies and
standards, we developed a new centralized compliance and
ethics function during 2004.
We promote our global employee concerns programme –
OpenTalk – to give our staff the opportunity to report possible
breaches of law or company policy without fear of retaliation.
OpenTalk can be contacted via telephone, letter, e-mail or fax
and provides a translation service. Matters raised are held in
strict confidence and are referred for investigation via regional
ombudsmen within BP for resolution. During 2004, 343 reports
were received from 44 countries and, where appropriate, action
was taken.
Staff in positions of responsibility review with their teams all
compliance and ethical issues arising during the year. They then

certify to their manager that their personal actions and those 
of their teams have complied with the law and with company
policy, disclosing any areas of possible non-compliance. 
On completion of the process, the group chief executive
prepares his personal certificate on behalf of BP . In future 
years, these reports will be prepared against the requirements
outlined in our new code of conduct.
We continue to apply our strong anti-corruption policy,
including prohibiting facilitation payments and identifying and
correcting any areas of non-compliance. We take disciplinary
measures where appropriate. In 2004, this included the
dismissal of 252 people for unethical behaviour, including 
fraud, theft and dishonesty.
BP does not make corporate political contributions anywhere
in the world and specifically made no donations to UK or other
EU political parties or organizations in 2004.
Promoting health awareness among our employees,
contractors and local communities provides long-term benefits
to our people and our business. In many areas of the world 
we face significant health issues, such as HIV/AIDS. During
2004, we increased our capability to assess health risks and
implemented local initiatives. 
BP and the environment 
BP was the first major oil company to state publicly that the
risks of climate change were serious and that precautionary
action was justified. While uncertainties remain, we believe
business planning and long-term strategy should be based 
on the need to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases.
In 2001, BP had succeeded in lowering operational
emissions by 10% from 1990 levels. We now aim to offset
growth in our emissions by 2012, with reductions achieved
partly from operational efficiency projects and partly from 
the supply of products that are cleaner or offer improved 
fuel efficiency. 
Our 2004 operational emissions of 81.7 million tonnes 
(Mte) were similar to those of 2003 (83.4Mte). Our emissions
would have been higher but for planned improvements in
operational efficiencies and divestments. The efficiencies
resulted in more than 1Mte of sustainable reductions, which
now total about 4Mte since 2001. 
BP recognizes the need to protect and conserve sensitive
areas that house the rich biodiversity of our planet. We will 
only work within sensitive areas if we believe we can properly
manage any risks to the environment. 
We have made a commitment to publish the results of 
risk assessments relating to any new activities in World
Conservation Union (IUCN) designated sites. In 2004, no
decisions were taken to go into such areas. Our website
details all known IUCN category I to VI areas where we have
facilities. During 2004, further work was undertaken to ensure
that our approach when entering areas for exploration and
production is consistent and transparent.
By the end of 2004, 100% of our major operations had 
been independently certified to the ISO 14001 international
standard on environmental management. This system drives
continuous performance improvement at our sites to reduce 
air emissions, water discharges and accidental releases,
including oil spills to sea or land.
Our shipping fleet transports significant volumes of oil and
gas around the world. In 2004, BP continued its strategy of
increasing its fleet in order to control the risk of a major oil 
spill more effectively. Our owned and operated fleet has 
grown from 36 ships in 2003 to 42 ships in December 2004,
38 of which are double-hulled. Most of these vessels are
leased, an approach that enables the group to renew the 
fleet periodically. We also charter additional vessels, which 
are vetted to ensure they meet our rigorous standards.
In the area of renewable and alternative energies, BP’s
research and development focus has been on photovoltaics
and hydrogen. We are pursuing initiatives aimed at improving
the efficiency and cost of solar cells as well as the
development of new silicon sources and alternative wafer
fabrication techniques. In hydrogen, we use our international
portfolio of practical demonstration projects to test new
technologies and foster innovation.
BP in society
We try to ensure that our relationships with non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), customers, suppliers, communities and
governments are founded on the basis of mutual advantage.
Our relationships develop over many years by seeking to
understand the needs and aspirations of all with whom we 
do business.
We made further progress on some concerns related 
to the construction of the BTC pipeline, a project that has
attracted some NGO opposition, particularly over human 
rights issues. The pipeline is being constructed to transport 
oil from the Caspian to the Mediterranean, so avoiding 
shipping through the Bosporus, and will help meet growing
world demand. 
We believe that open and thriving societies create the 
best environment for business. During 2004, we contributed 
to international discussions on the issue of transparency. 
The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is an
important programme that provides guidelines for disclosing
the amount of revenue governments receive from energy
companies, so demonstrating the scale of the funds available
for public spending. Towards the end of 2004, a Memorandum
of Understanding was signed in Baku, Azerbaijan, by the
government, state and foreign oil companies, setting out
clearly the process for implementation of the EITI in 
Azerbaijan. BP is committed to encouraging the acceleration 
of this process and will be supporting it with the publication 
of relevant data and information. 
Our business activities affect – and benefit – people
worldwide. We seek to extend these benefits as broadly 
as possible. During 2004, we reviewed our strategy of 
social investment and intend to focus on education, on 
the development of thriving local enterprise and on 
providing access to energy in remote locations. We continue 
to support many initiatives in the communities in which 
we operate. 32
Critical accounting policies
BP prepares its financial statements in accordance with 
UK generally accepted accounting practice (UK GAAP). The
group’s significant accounting policies are summarized on
pages 40-43.
The accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 have
been prepared using accounting policies consistent with those
adopted in the preparation of the 2003 accounts, except for 
the change in accounting policy for pensions and other post-
retirement benefits and for shares held in employee share
ownership plans for the benefit of employee share schemes.
Segment information for 2003 has been restated to reflect
the transfer of the natural gas liquids (NGLs) activities from
Exploration and Production to Gas, Power and Renewables. 
Inherent in the application of many of the accounting policies
used in the preparation of the financial statements is the need
for BP management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date
of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could
differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
The following summary provides further information about
the critical accounting policies that could have a significant
impact on the results of the group and should be read in
conjunction with the Notes on Accounts.
The accounting policies and areas that require the most
significant judgements and estimates to be used in the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements are in
relation to oil and natural gas accounting, including the
estimation of reserves; impairment; and provisions for deferred
taxation, decommissioning, environmental liabilities, pensions
and other post-retirement benefits.
Accounting policy changes in 2004 
From 1 January 2004, BP changed its accounting policies for
pensions and other post-retirement benefits. In addition, BP also
changed its accounting policy for shares held in employee share
ownership plans for the benefit of employee share schemes. 
With effect from 1 January 2004, BP has adopted a new 
UK accounting standard: Financial Reporting Standard No. 17
‘Retirement Benefits’ (FRS 17). FRS 17 requires that the assets
and liabilities arising from an employer’s retirement benefit
obligations and any related funding should be included in the
financial statements at fair value and that the operating costs of
providing retirement benefits to employees should be recognized
in the income statement in the periods in which the benefits 
are earned by employees. This contrasts with SSAP 24, which
requires the cost of providing pensions to be recognized on a
systematic and rational basis over the period during which the
employer benefits from the employee’s services. The difference
between the amount charged in the income statement and the
amount paid as contributions into the pension fund is shown as
a prepayment or provision on the balance sheet. 
Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract No. 38 ‘ Accounting for
Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trusts’ (Abstract No. 38)
changes the presentation of an entity’s own shares held in an
ESOP trust from requiring them to be recognized as assets 
to requiring them to be deducted in arriving at shareholders’
funds. Transactions in an entity’s own shares by an ESOP trust
are similarly recorded as changes in shareholders’ funds and do
not give rise to gains or losses. This treatment is in line with
the accounting for purchases and sales of own shares set out
in Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract No. 37 ‘Purchases and
Sales of Own Shares’ (Abstract No. 37).
Abstract No. 37 requires a holding of an entity’s own shares
to be accounted for as a deduction in arriving at shareholders’
funds, rather than being recorded as assets. Transactions in 
an entity’s own shares are similarly recorded as changes in
shareholders’ funds and do not give rise to gains or losses.
Abstract No. 37 applies where a company purchases treasury
shares under new legislation that came into effect in
December 2003.
Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract No. 17 ‘Employee share
schemes’ (Abstract No. 17) was amended by Abstract No. 38
to reflect the consequences for the profit and loss account of
the changes in the presentation of an entity’s own shares held
by an ESOP trust. Amended Abstract No. 17 requires that the
minimum expense should be the difference between the fair
value of the shares at the date of award and the amount that 
an employee may be required to pay for the shares (i.e. the
‘intrinsic value’ of the award). The expense was previously
determined either as the intrinsic value or, where purchases 
of shares had been made by an ESOP trust at fair value, 
by reference to the cost or book value of shares that were
available for the award. 
These changes in accounting policy have resulted in a prior
year adjustment. BP shareholders’ interest at 1 January 2003
has been reduced by $5,760 million and the profit for the year
ended 31 December 2003 increased by $215 million. 
Oil and natural gas accounting  Accounting for oil and gas
exploration activity is subject to special accounting rules that
are unique to the oil and gas industry. In the UK, these are
contained in the Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP)
‘Accounting for Oil and Gas Exploration, Development,
Production and Decommissioning Activities’.
The group follows the successful efforts method of accounting
for its oil and natural gas exploration and production activities.
The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic
information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is
expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research 
and development costs.
Licence and property acquisition costs are initially capitalized
as unproved properties within intangible assets. These costs
are amortized on a straight-line basis until such time as either
exploration drilling is determined to be successful or it is
unsuccessful and all costs are written off. Licence and
property acquisition costs are not subject to periodic
assessments for impairment.
For exploration wells, costs directly associated with the
drilling of wells are temporarily capitalized within intangible
fixed assets, pending determination of whether potentially
economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the
drilling effort. These costs include employee remuneration,
materials and fuel used, rig costs, delay rentals and payments
made to contractors. This is usually made within one year 
after well completion, but can take longer, depending on 
the complexity of the geologic structure. If the well did not
encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well
costs are expensed as a dry hole and are reported in exploration
Other financial issues BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
33
expense. Exploration wells that discover potentially economic
quantities of oil and gas and are in areas where major capital
expenditure (e.g. offshore platform or a pipeline) would be
required before production could begin, and where the economic
viability of that major capital expenditure depends upon the
successful completion of further exploration work in the area,
remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as additional
exploration appraisal work is under way or firmly planned.
For complicated offshore exploration discoveries, it is not
unusual to have exploration wells remaining suspended on the
balance sheet for several years while additional appraisal drilling
and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field is performed
or while the optimum development plans and timing are
established. As with licence and property acquisition costs,
there is no periodic impairment assessment of suspended
exploration well costs. All such carried costs are subject to
regular technical, commercial and management review, on 
at least an annual basis, to confirm the continued intent to
develop, or otherwise extract value from, the discovery. If this 
is no longer the case, the costs are immediately expensed.
Once a project is sanctioned for development, the carrying
values of licence and property acquisition costs and exploration
and appraisal costs are transferred to production assets within
tangible assets.
The capitalized exploration and development costs for proved
oil and gas properties (which include the costs of drilling
unsuccessful wells) are amortized on the basis of oil-equivalent
barrels that are produced in a period as a percentage of the
estimated proved reserves. The estimated proved reserves
used in these unit-of-production calculations vary with the
nature of the capitalized expenditure. The reserves used in the
calculation of the unit-of-production amortization are as follows:
(a) Proved developed reserves for producing wells.
(b) Total proved reserves for development costs.
(c) Total proved reserves for licence and property 
acquisition costs.
(d) Total proved reserves for future decommissioning costs.
The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt
with prospectively by amortizing the remaining book value 
of the asset over the expected future production. If proved
reserve estimates are revised downwards, earnings could 
be affected by higher depreciation expense or an immediate
write-down of the property’s book value (see discussion of
impairment of fixed assets and goodwill below).
Given the large number of producing fields in the group’s
portfolio, it is unlikely that any changes in reserve estimates,
year on year, will have a significant effect on prospective
charges for depreciation.
Oil and natural gas reserves  The group manages its
hydrocarbon resources in three major categories: prospect
inventory, non-proved reserves and proved reserves. When 
a discovery is made, volumes transfer from the prospect
inventory to the non-proved reserve category. The reserves
move through various non-proved reserves sub-categories as
their technical and commercial maturity increases through
appraisal activity. Reserves in a field will only be categorized 
as proved when all the criteria for attribution of proved status
have been met, including an internally imposed requirement for
project sanction, or for sanction expected within six months.
Internal approval and final investment decision are what we
refer to as project sanction.
At the point of sanction, all booked reserves will be
categorized as proved undeveloped (PUD). Volumes will
subsequently be recategorized from PUD to proved developed
(PD) as a consequence of development activity. The first PD
bookings will occur at the point of first oil or gas production.
Major development projects typically take one to four years from
the time of initial booking to the start of production. Adjustments
may be made to booked reserves due to production, reservoir
performance, commercial factors, acquisition and divestment
activity and additional reservoir development activity.
The group reassesses its estimate of proved reserves on an
annual basis. The estimated proved reserves of oil and natural
gas are subject to future revision. As discussed below, oil and
natural gas reserves have a direct impact on certain amounts
reported in the financial statements.
Proved reserves do not include reserves that are dependent on
the renewal of exploration and production licences unless there
is strong evidence to support the assumption of such renewal.
The group estimates its reserves of oil and natural gas
according to the UK Statement of Recommended Practice. This
differs from the basis for determining reserves required by the
US Securities and Exchange Commission. Estimates of the
group’s proved reserves of oil and natural gas are shown on
pages 87-92, together with more information about the group’s
processes for booking reserves and the difference between
the reserves determined for the group's UK and US reporting.
Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill BP assesses its fixed
assets, including goodwill, for possible impairment if there are
events or changes in circumstances that indicate that carrying
values of the assets may not be recoverable. Such indicators
include changes in the group’s business plans, changes in
commodity prices leading to unprofitable performance and, 
for oil and gas properties, significant downward revisions of
estimated proved reserve quantities. The assessment for
impairment entails comparing the carrying value of the income-
generating unit and associated goodwill with the recoverable
amount of the asset, that is, the higher of net realizable value
and value in use. Value in use is usually determined on the
basis of discounted estimated future net cash flows.
Determination as to whether and how much an asset is
impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain
matters such as future commodity prices, the effects of
inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses,
production profiles and the outlook for global or regional 
market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural 
gas, commodity chemicals and refined products.
For oil and natural gas properties, the expected future cash
flows are estimated based on the group’s plans to continue 
to produce and develop proved and associated risk-adjusted
probable and possible reserves. Expected future cash flows
from the sale or production of reserves are calculated based on
the group’s best estimate of future oil and gas prices. Previously,
these were a Brent Oil price of $20 per barrel and a Henry Hub
gas price of $3.50 per mmBtu. Beginning in the fourth quarter of
2004, this has been modified. Prices used for future cash flow
calculations are assumed to decline from existing levels in
equal steps over the next three years to the long-term planning Other financial issues
34
assumptions (currently $20/$3.50 for Brent and Henry Hub).
These long-term planning assumptions are subject to periodic
review and modification. The estimated future level of production
is based on assumptions about future commodity prices, lifting
and development costs, field decline rates, market demand
and supply, economic regulatory climates and other factors.
Charges for impairment are recognized in the group’s results
from time to time as a result of, among other factors, adverse
changes in the recoverable reserves from oil and natural gas
fields, low plant utilization or reduced profitability. If there 
are low oil prices or natural gas prices or refining margins 
or chemicals margins over an extended period, the group 
may need to recognize significant impairment charges.
Deferred taxation  The group has approximately $7.7 billion of
carry-forward tax losses in the UK and Germany, which would
be available to offset against future taxable income. It is
unlikely that the group’s effective tax rate will be significantly
affected in the near term by utilization of losses not previously
recognized as deferred tax assets. Carry-forward tax losses in
other taxing jurisdictions have not been recognized as deferred
tax assets, and are unlikely to have a significant effect on the
group’s tax rate in future years.
Deferred taxation is not generally provided in respect of
liabilities that may arise on the distribution of accumulated
reserves of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associated undertakings.
Decommissioning costs The group holds provisions for the
future decommissioning of oil and natural gas production
facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives. 
The largest asset removal obligations facing BP relate to the
removal and disposal of oil and natural gas platforms and
pipelines around the world. The estimated discounted costs of
dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued on the
installation of those facilities, reflecting our legal obligations at
that time. Most of these removal events are many years in the
future and the precise requirements that will have to be met
when the removal event actually occurs are uncertain. Asset
removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as
well as political, environmental, safety and public expectations.
Consequently, the timing and amounts of future cash flows are
subject to significant uncertainty.
The timing and amount of future expenditures are reviewed
annually, together with the interest rate to be used in discounting
the cash flows. The interest rate used to determine the balance
sheet obligation at the end of 2004 was 2.0%, 0.5% lower than
at the end of 2003. The interest rate represents the real rate
(i.e. adjusted for inflation) on long-dated government bonds.
Environmental costs BP also makes judgements and estimates
in recording costs and establishing provisions for environmental
clean-up and remediation costs, which are based on current
information on costs and expected plans for remediation. 
For environmental provisions, actual costs can differ from
estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, public
expectations, discovery and analysis of site conditions and
changes in clean-up technology.
The provision for environmental liabilities is reviewed at least
annually. The interest rate used to determine the balance sheet
obligation at 31 December 2004 was 2.0%, 0.5% lower 
than at the previous balance sheet date.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Accounting 
for pensions and other post-retirement benefits involves
judgement about uncertain events, including estimated
retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates,
rates of return on plan assets, determination of discount rates
for measuring plan obligations, healthcare cost-trend rates and
rates of utilization of healthcare services by retirees. These
assumptions are based on the environment in each country.
Determination of the projected benefit obligations for the
group’s defined benefit pension and post-retirement plans is
important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the
balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the
income statement. The assumptions used may vary from year
to year, which will affect future results of operations. Any
differences between these assumptions and the actual
outcome also affect future results of operations.
Pension and other post-retirement benefit assumptions 
are discussed and agreed with the independent actuaries in
December each year. These assumptions are used to determine
the projected benefit obligation at the year end and hence the
surplus and deficits recorded on the group’s balance sheet, and
pension and post-retirement expense for the following year.
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards
An ‘International Accounting Standards Regulation’ was
adopted by the Council of the European Union (EU) in June
2002. This regulation requires all EU companies listed on an 
EU stock exchange to use ‘endorsed’ International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS), published by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB), to report their consolidated
results with effect from 1 January 2005. The IASB completed
its development of IFRS to be adopted in 2005 during the first
half of 2004, but has also published certain amendments and
interpretations of IFRS which would be available for early
adoption if endorsed by the EU.
The process of endorsement of IFRS by the EU to allow
adoption by companies in 2005 is well advanced but not 
yet complete.
BP’s project team includes a broadly based representation
from across the group designed to plan for and achieve a
smooth transition to IFRS. The project team has examined 
all implementation aspects, including changes to accounting
policies, the presentation of the group’s results, systems
impacts and the wider business issues that may arise from
such a fundamental change. The group is now prepared to
report its results from the first quarter of 2005 onwards using
IFRS. However, the implementation may still be affected by
developments in the IASB’s standard-setting process and the
endorsement of standards and interpretations by the EU.
The group has decided that, for the purposes of the
restatement of prior periods currently reported under UK GAAP ,
the date of transition to IFRS is 1 January 2003. However, in
accordance with the provisions of IFRS 1, the date of adoption
of IAS Nos. 32 and 39, which deal with the recognition and
presentation of financial instruments, is set at 1 January 2005,
with no restatement of prior periods’ results. 
We are in the process of finalizing the restatements of the BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
35
results and financial position for 2003 and 2004 under IFRS, 
and intend to release this information in mid-March 2005. 
Our current view is that the major effects of changing from our
current accounting practice to IFRS are in the following areas:
goodwill acquired in a business combination; deferred tax
related to business combinations and in respect of the valuation
of stocks; accounting for items falling within the scope of 
IAS Nos. 32 and 39, including embedded derivatives and hedge
accounting; the treatment of major overhaul expenditure;
exchanges of fixed assets; recognition of dividend liabilities; and
share-based payments. Certain joint arrangements with third
parties, where BP currently accounts for its share of individual
assets, liabilities, income and expense, will be accounted for
using the equity method, resulting in reclassifications within 
the income statement and balance sheet. 
Financial risk management
The group co-ordinates certain key activities on a global basis
in order to optimize its financial position and performance.
These include the management of the currency, maturity and
interest rate profile of finance debt, cash, other significant
financial risks and relationships with banks and other financial
institutions. International oil, natural gas and power trading and
risk management relating to business operations are carried
out by the group’s oil, natural gas and power trading units.
The main financial risks faced by the group through its
normal business activities are market risk, credit risk and
liquidity risk. These risks and the group’s approach to dealing
with them are discussed below.
The adoption of IFRS from 1 January 2005 does not
fundamentally change BP’s approach to managing financial risk.
The new requirement may, however, introduce some volatility
into earnings for the recognition and measurement of certain
financial instruments.
Market risk Market risk is the possibility that changes in currency
exchange rates, interest rates or oil, natural gas and power
prices will adversely affect the value of the group’s financial
assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. Market risks are
managed using a range of derivatives. The group also trades
derivatives in conjunction with these risk management activities.
All derivative activity, whether for risk management or trading,
is carried out by specialist teams who have the appropriate
skills, experience and supervision. These teams are subject 
to close financial and management control. The appropriate
governance, control framework and reporting processes are in
place to oversee these internal control and risk management
activities. On an ongoing basis, an independent control function
monitors compliance with BP's policies that are in line with
generally accepted industry practice, reflecting the principles 
of the Group of Thirty Global Derivatives Study. The control
framework includes prescribed trading limits that are reviewed
regularly by senior management, daily monitoring of risk
exposure using value-at-risk principles, marking trading
exposures to market and stress testing to assess the exposure
to potentially extreme market situations.
For market risk management and trading, conventional
exchange-traded derivative instruments such as futures 
and options are used, as well as non-exchange-traded 
instruments such as swaps, ‘over-the-counter’ options and
forward contracts.
Where derivatives constitute a hedge, the group’s exposure
to market risk created by the derivative is offset by the
opposite exposure arising from the asset, liability, cash flow or
transaction being hedged. By contrast, where derivatives are
held for trading purposes, changes in market risk factors give
rise to gains and losses, which are recognized in earnings in
the current period.
Currency exchange rates Fluctuations in exchange rates can
have significant effects on the group’s reported profit. The effects
of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business
operating results through changing cost-competitiveness, lags
in market adjustment to movements in rates and conversion
differences accounted for on specific transactions. For this
reason, the total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not
identifiable separately in the group’s reported profit.
The main underlying economic currency of the group’s cash
flows is the US dollar. This is because BP’s major products are
priced internationally in US dollars. BP’s foreign exchange
management policy is to minimize economic and significant
transactional exposures arising from currency movements
against the US dollar. The group co-ordinates the handling 
of foreign exchange risks centrally, by netting off naturally
occurring opposite exposures wherever possible, to reduce 
the risks, and then dealing with any material residual foreign
exchange risks. Significant residual non-dollar exposures are
managed using a range of derivatives.
In addition, most group borrowings are in US dollars or are
hedged with respect to the US dollar.
Interest rates The group is exposed to interest rate risk on
short- and long-term floating rate instruments and as a result of
the refinancing of fixed rate finance debt. The group is exposed
predominantly to US dollar LIBOR (London Inter-Bank Offer
Rate) interest rates as borrowings are mainly denominated in,
or are swapped into, US dollars. The group uses derivatives 
to manage the balance between fixed and floating rate debt.
Oil, natural gas and power prices  BP’s trading function uses
financial and commodity derivatives as part of the overall
optimization of the value of the group’s equity oil production
and as part of the associated trading of crude oil, products 
and related instruments. It also uses financial and commodity
derivatives to manage certain of the group’s exposures to price
fluctuations on natural gas and power transactions. 
Credit risk Credit risk is the potential exposure of the group 
to loss in the event of non-performance by a counterparty. The
credit risk arising from the group’s normal commercial operations
is controlled by individual operating units within guidelines. In
addition, as a result of its use of derivatives to manage market
risk, the group has credit exposures through its dealings in 
the financial and specialized oil, natural gas and power markets.
The group controls the related credit risk through credit
approvals, limits, use of netting arrangements and monitoring
procedures. Counterparty credit validation, independent of the
dealers, is undertaken before contractual commitment. Other financial issues
36
Concentrations of credit risk The primary activities of the
group are oil and natural gas exploration and production, gas
and power marketing and trading, oil refining and marketing
and the manufacture and marketing of petrochemicals. The
group’s principal customers, suppliers and financial institutions
with which it conducts business are located throughout the
world. The credit ratings of interest rate and currency swap
counterparties are all of at least investment grade. The credit
quality is actively managed over the life of the swap.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of
funding for the group’s business activities may not be available.
The group has long-term debt ratings of Aa1 and AA+ assigned
respectively by Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s. The group
has access to a wide range of funding at competitive rates
through the capital markets and banks. It co-ordinates
relationships with banks, borrowing requirements, foreign
exchange requirements and cash management centrally. 
The group believes it has access to sufficient funding and 
also has undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet
currently foreseeable borrowing requirements.
At 31 December 2004, the group had substantial amounts 
of undrawn borrowing facilities available, including committed
facilities of $4,500 million expiring in 2005 ($3,700 million expiring
in 2004). These facilities are with a number of international
banks and borrowings under them would be at pre-agreed
rates. The group expects to renew these facilities on an annual
basis. Certain of these facilities support the group’s commercial
paper programme.
Insurance
The group generally restricts its purchase of insurance to
situations where this is required for legal or contractual
reasons. This is because external insurance is not considered
an economic means of financing losses for the group. Losses
will therefore be borne as they arise rather than being spread
over time through insurance premia with attendant transaction
costs. This position will be reviewed periodically.
Environmental expenditure
Operating and capital expenditure on the prevention, control,
abatement or elimination of air, water and solid waste pollution
is often not incurred as a separately identifiable transaction.
Instead, it forms part of a larger transaction that includes, for
example, normal maintenance expenditure. The figures for
environmental operating and capital expenditure in the table
below are therefore estimates, based on the definitions and
guidelines of the American Petroleum Institute.
$ million
2004 2003
Operating expenditure 526 498
Clean-ups 25 45
Capital expenditure 524 546
New provisions for
environmental remediation 588 515
New provisions for decommissioning 294 1,159
Environmental operating and capital expenditures for 2004
were broadly in line with 2003. Similar levels of operating and
capital expenditures are expected in the foreseeable future. In
addition to operating and capital expenditures, we also create
provisions for future environmental remediation. Expenditure
against such provisions is normally in subsequent periods and
is not included in environmental operating expenditure reported
for such periods. The charge for environmental remediation
provisions in 2004 includes $484 million resulting from a
reassessment of existing site obligations and $104 million 
in respect of provisions for new sites.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a
clean-up is probable and the amount reasonably determinable.
Generally, their timing coincides with commitment to a formal
plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of
inactive sites.
The extent and cost of future remediation programmes are
inherently difficult to estimate. They depend on the scale of 
any possible contamination, the timing and extent of corrective
actions and also the group’s share of liability. Although the 
cost of any future remediation could be significant and may 
be material to the result of operations in the period in which 
it is recognized, we do not expect that such costs will have a
material effect on the group’s financial position or liquidity. We
believe our provisions are sufficient for known requirements;
and we do not believe that our costs will differ significantly from
those of other companies engaged in similar industries, or that
our competitive position will be adversely affected as a result.
In addition, we make provisions over the useful lives of 
our oil- and gas-producing assets and related pipelines to 
meet the cost of eventual decommissioning. Provisions 
for environmental remediation and decommissioning are
usually set up on a discounted basis, as required by Financial
Reporting Standard No. 12, ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities
and Contingent Assets’.
Further details of our environmental and decommissioning
provisions appear in Note 30 on Accounts on page 67. New
provisions for decommissioning in 2004 include increases 
in respect of reassessment of existing provisions and new
provisions for certain fields on installation of facilities.
Creditor payment policy and practice
Statutory regulations issued under the UK Companies Act 
1985 require companies to make a statement of their policy
and practice in respect of the payment of trade creditors.
In view of the international nature of the group’s operations
there is no specific group-wide policy in respect of payments
to suppliers. Relationships with suppliers are, however,
governed by the group’s policy commitment to long-term
relationships founded on trust and mutual advantage. Within this
overall policy, individual operating companies are responsible for
agreeing terms and conditions for their business transactions
and ensuring that suppliers are aware of the terms of payment.
These terms are adhered to when payments are made, subject
to terms and conditions being met by the supplier.

Company law requires the directors to prepare accounts for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the company and the group and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing those accounts, the directors 
are required:
•
To select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
•
To make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
•
To state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the accounts.
•
To prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group will continue
in business.
The directors are also responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the group and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985. They 
are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
The directors confirm that they have complied with these requirements, and having a reasonable expectation that the company
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, continue to adopt the going concern basis
in preparing the accounts.

Independent auditors’ report
To the Members of BP p.l.c.
We have audited the group’s accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004, which comprise the group income statement,
balance sheets, group cash flow statement, statement of total recognized gains and losses, accounting policies and related notes
1 to 47. These accounts have been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report contained in BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004 that is described as having
been subject to audit.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report or 
for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts, including the accounts in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and accounting standards as set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the accounts.
Our responsibility is to audit the accounts and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is subject to audit in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements, United Kingdom Auditing Standards and the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the accounts give a true and fair view and whether the accounts and the parts of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report that are subject to audit have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report, contained in BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004, is not
consistent with the accounts, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if the information specified by law or the Listing Rules regarding directors’
remuneration and transactions with the group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement contained in BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004 reflects the
company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control
cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures.
We read other information contained in BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004 and consider whether it is consistent with the
audited accounts. This other information comprises the United States accounting principles, the supplementary information on 
oil and natural gas quantities, the five-year summaries, the Directors’ Report and the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
the accounts. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An 
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the accounts and the parts 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report that are subject to audit. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the accounts, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the accounts and the parts of the Directors’
Remuneration Report that are subject to audit are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity
or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the accounts and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is subject to audit.
Opinion
In our opinion:
•
the accounts give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the group as at 31 December 2004 and 
of the profit of the group for the year then ended; and
•
the accounts and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is subject to audit have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Accounting standards
These accounts are prepared in accordance with applicable UK
accounting standards. In preparing the financial statements for the
current year, the group has adopted Financial Reporting Standard 
No. 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’ (FRS 17) and Urgent Issues Task Force
Abstract No. 38 ‘ Accounting for Employee Share Ownership Plan
(ESOP) Trusts’ (Abstract No. 38). The adoption of FRS 17 and Abstract
No. 38 has resulted in changes in accounting policy for pensions and
other post-retirement benefits and the accounting of ESOP trusts. 
(See Note 44 for further information.)
In addition to the requirements of accounting standards, the
accounting for exploration and production activities is governed by 
the Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) ‘ Accounting for Oil
and Gas Exploration, Development, Production and Decommissioning
Activities’ issued by the UK Oil Industry Accounting Committee on
7June 2001. These accounts have been prepared in accordance with
the provisions of the SORP .
Group consolidation
The group financial statements comprise a consolidation of the
accounts of the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings
(subsidiaries). The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are
consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which
control passes.
An associated undertaking (associate) is an entity in which the 
group has a long-term equity interest and over which it exercises
significant influence. The consolidated financial statements include
the group proportion of the operating profit or loss, exceptional 
items, stock holding gains or losses, interest expense, taxation 
and net assets of associates (the equity method).
A joint venture is an entity in which the group has a long-term
interest and shares control with one or more co-venturers. The
consolidated financial statements include the group proportion of
turnover, operating profit or loss, exceptional items, stock holding 
gains or losses, interest expense, taxation, gross assets, gross
liabilities and minority shareholders’ interest of the joint venture 
(the gross equity method).
Certain of the group’s activities are conducted through joint
arrangements and are included in the consolidated financial statements
in proportion to the group’s interest in the income, expenses, assets
and liabilities of these joint arrangements.
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, or of an interest in a joint venture
or associate, fair values reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition
are attributed to the identifiable net assets acquired. When the cost of
acquisition exceeds the fair values attributable to the group’s share of
such net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill. This 
is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated
useful economic life, which is usually 10 years.
Where an interest in a separate business of an acquired entity is
held temporarily, pending disposal, it is carried on the balance sheet 
at its estimated net proceeds of sale.
Accounting convention
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, except
as explained under stock valuation. Accounts prepared on this basis
show the profits available to shareholders and are the most appropriate
basis for presentation of the group’s balance sheet. Profit or loss
determined under the historical cost convention includes stock holding
gains or losses and, as a consequence, does not necessarily reflect
underlying trading results.
Replacement cost
The results of individual businesses and geographical areas are
presented on a replacement cost basis. Replacement cost operating
results exclude stock holding gains or losses and reflect the average
cost of supplies incurred during the year, and thus provide insight into
underlying trading results. Stock holding gains or losses represent the
difference between the replacement cost of sales and the historical
cost of sales calculated using the first-in first-out method.
Stock valuation
Stocks, other than stock held for trading purposes, are valued at cost 
to the group using the first-in first-out method or at net realizable 
value, whichever is the lower. Stores are valued at cost to the group
mainly using the average method or net realizable value, whichever is
the lower.
Stock held for trading purposes is marked-to-market and any gains 
or losses are recognized in the income statement rather than the
statement of total recognized gains and losses. The directors consider
that the nature of the group’s trading activity is such that, in order for
the accounts to show a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
group and the results for the year, it is necessary to depart from the
requirements of Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985. Had the
treatment in Schedule 4 been followed, the profit and loss account
reserve would have been reduced by $100 million ($150 million) and
arevaluation reserve established and increased accordingly.
Revenue recognition
Revenues associated with the sale of oil, natural gas liquids, liquefied
natural gas, petroleum and chemical products and all other items are
recognized when the title passes to the customer. Supply buy/sell
arrangements with common counterparties are reported net, as are
physical exchanges. Oil and natural gas forward sales contracts are
included in turnover. Generally, revenues from the production of natural
gas and oil properties in which the group has an interest with other
producers are recognized on the basis of the group’s working interest
in those properties (the entitlement method). Differences between the
production sold and the group’s share of production are not significant. 
Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions by group companies are booked in 
the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of
transaction, or at the forward rate if hedged by a forward exchange
contract. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated
into the functional currency at rates of exchange ruling at the balance
sheet date, or at the forward rate. Exchange differences are included 
in operating profit.
Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary and associated
undertakings and joint ventures, including related goodwill, are
translated into US dollars at rates of exchange ruling at the balance
sheet date. The results and cash flows of overseas subsidiary and
associated undertakings and joint ventures are translated into US
dollars using average rates of exchange. Exchange adjustments arising
when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by
Accounting policies BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
41
overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings and joint ventures 
are translated into US dollars are taken directly to reserves and
reported in the statement of total recognized gains and losses.
Exchange gains and losses arising on long-term foreign currency
borrowings used to finance the group’s foreign currency investments
are also dealt with in reserves.
Derivative financial instruments
The group uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage
certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
and interest rates, and to manage some of its margin exposure from
changes in oil, natural gas and power prices. Derivatives are also traded
in conjunction with these risk management activities.
The purpose for which a derivative contract is used is identified at
inception. To qualify as a derivative for risk management, the contract
must be in accordance with established guidelines that ensure that 
it is effective in achieving its objective. All contracts not identified at
inception as being for the purpose of risk management are designated
as being held for trading purposes and accounted for using the fair
value method, as are all oil price derivatives.
The group accounts for derivatives using the following methods:
Fair value method Derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at fair
value (‘marked-to-market’) with changes in that value recognized in
earnings of the period. This method is used for all derivatives that are
held for trading purposes. Interest rate contracts traded by the group
include futures, swaps, options and swaptions. Foreign exchange
contracts traded include forwards and options. Oil, natural gas and
power price contracts traded include swaps, options and futures.
Accrual method Amounts payable or receivable in respect of 
derivatives are recognized ratably in earnings over the period of the
contracts. This method is used for derivatives held to manage interest
rate risk. These are principally swap agreements used to manage the
balance between fixed and floating interest rates on long-term finance
debt. Other derivatives held for this purpose may include swaptions
and futures contracts. Amounts payable or receivable in respect of
these derivatives are recognized as adjustments to interest expense
over the period of the contracts. Changes in the derivative’s fair value
are not recognized.
Deferral method Gains and losses from derivatives are deferred 
and recognized in earnings or as adjustments to carrying amounts, 
as appropriate, when the underlying debt matures or the hedged
transaction occurs. This method is used for derivatives used to convert
non-US dollar borrowings into US dollars, to hedge significant non-US
dollar firm commitments or anticipated transactions, and to manage
some of the group’s exposure to natural gas and power price
fluctuations. Derivatives used to convert non-US dollar borrowings 
into US dollars include foreign currency swap agreements and 
forward contracts. Gains and losses on these derivatives are deferred
and recognized on maturity of the underlying debt, together with
the matching loss or gain on the debt. Derivatives used to hedge
significant non-US dollar transactions include foreign currency forward
contracts and options and to hedge natural gas and power price
exposures include swaps, futures and options. Gains and losses 
on these contracts and option premia paid are also deferred and
recognized in the income statement or as adjustments to carrying
amounts, as appropriate, when the hedged transaction occurs.
Where derivatives used to manage interest rate risk or to convert
non-US dollar debt or to hedge other anticipated cash flows are
terminated before the underlying debt matures or the hedged
transaction occurs, the resulting gain or loss is recognized on a basis
that matches the timing and accounting treatment of the underlying
debt or hedged transaction. When an anticipated transaction is no
longer likely to occur or finance debt is terminated before maturity,
any deferred gain or loss that has arisen on the related derivative is
recognized in the income statement, together with any gain or loss
on the terminated item.
The effect of these policies on the accounts is described 
as follows:
Reporting in the income statement Gains and losses on oil price
contracts held for trading and for risk management purposes and
natural gas and power price contracts held for trading purposes that
are settled for difference in cash are reported in cost of sales in the
income statement in the period in which the change in value occurs.
Gains and losses on interest rate or foreign currency derivatives used
for trading are reported in other income and cost of sales, respectively.
Gains and losses in respect of derivatives used to manage interest 
rate exposures are recognized as adjustments to interest expense.
Where derivatives are used to convert non-US dollar borrowings 
into US dollars, the gains and losses are deferred and recognized 
on maturity of the underlying debt, together with the matching 
loss or gain on the debt. The two amounts offset each other in the 
income statement.
Gains and losses on derivatives identified as hedges of significant
non-US dollar firm commitments or anticipated transactions are not
recognized until the hedged transaction occurs. The treatment of the
gain or loss arising on the designated derivative reflects the nature 
and accounting treatment of the hedged item. The gain or loss is
recorded in cost of sales in the income statement or as an adjustment
to carrying values in the balance sheet, as appropriate.
Gains and losses arising from natural gas and power price derivatives
held for risk management purposes are recognized in earnings when
the hedged transaction occurs. The gains or losses are reported as
components of the related transactions.
Reporting in the balance sheet The carrying amounts of foreign
exchange contracts that hedge finance debt are included within finance
debt in the balance sheet. The carrying amounts of other derivatives,
including option premia paid or received, are included in the balance
sheet under debtors or creditors within current assets and current
liabilities respectively, as appropriate.
Cash flow effects Interest rate swaps give rise, at specified intervals,
to cash settlement of interest differentials. Under currency swaps 
the counterparties initially exchange a principal amount in two
currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date 
at the same exchange rate. The group’s currency swaps have terms 
of up to six years.
Interest rate futures require an initial margin payment and daily
settlement of margin calls. Interest rate forwards require settlement 
of the interest rate differential on a specified future date. Currency Accounting policies
42
forwards require purchase or sale of an agreed amount of foreign
currency at a specified exchange rate at a specified future date,
generally over periods of up to three years for the group. Currency
options involve the initial payment or receipt of a premium and will 
give rise to delivery of an agreed amount of currency at a specified
future date if the option is exercised.
For oil, natural gas and power price futures and options traded on
regulated exchanges, gains and losses are settled on a daily basis,
while exchange liquidity requirements are funded through letters 
of credit or cash deposits. For swaps and over-the-counter options, 
BP settles with the counterparty on conclusion of the pricing period.
In the statement of cash flows, the effect of interest rate derivatives
used to manage interest rate exposures is reflected in interest paid.
The effect of foreign currency derivatives used for hedging non-US
dollar debt is included under financing. The cash flow effects of foreign
currency derivatives used to hedge non-US dollar firm commitments
and anticipated transactions are included in net cash inflow from
operating activities for items relating to earnings or in capital
expenditure or acquisitions, as appropriate, for items of a capital
nature. The cash flow effects of all oil, natural gas and power price
derivatives and all traded derivatives are included in net cash inflow
from operating activities.
Oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditure
Oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditure is
accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting. 
Licence and property acquisition costs Exploration and property
leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized within intangible fixed 
assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
period of exploration. Upon determination of economically recoverable
reserves (‘proved reserves’ or ‘commercial reserves’), amortization
ceases and the remaining costs are aggregated with exploration
expenditure and held on a field-by-field basis within intangible fixed
assets. When development is sanctioned, the relevant expenditure 
is transferred to tangible production assets.
Exploration expenditure Geological and geophysical exploration costs
are charged against income as incurred. Costs directly associated 
with an exploration well are capitalized as an intangible asset until 
the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated.
If hydrocarbons are not found, the exploration expenditure is written
off as a dry hole. If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further
appraisal activity, are likely to be capable of commercial development,
the costs continue to be carried as an asset. All such carried costs 
are subject to regular technical, commercial and management review
to confirm the continued intent to develop or otherwise extract 
value from the discovery. When this is no longer the case, the costs
are written off. When proved reserves of oil and natural gas are
determined and development is sanctioned, the relevant expenditure 
is transferred to tangible production assets.
Development expenditure Expenditure on the construction, installation
or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines
and the drilling of development wells, including unsuccessful
development or delineation wells, is capitalized within tangible
production assets.
Decommissioning
Provision for decommissioning is recognized in full on the installation 
of oil and natural gas production facilities. The amount recognized is 
the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in
accordance with local conditions and requirements. A corresponding
tangible fixed asset of an amount equivalent to the provision is also
created. This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs 
of the production and transportation facilities. 
Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is
reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the fixed asset.
Depreciation
Oil and gas production assets are depreciated using a unit-of-
production method. The cost of producing wells is amortized over
proved developed reserves. Licence acquisition, decommissioning 
and field development costs are amortized over total proved 
reserves. The field development costs subject to amortization are
expenditures incurred to date together with sanctioned future
development expenditure. 
Other tangible and intangible assets are depreciated on the straight-
line method over their estimated useful lives. The average estimated
useful lives of refineries are 20 years, chemicals manufacturing
plants 20 years and service stations 15 years. Other intangibles
are amortized over a maximum period of 20 years.
The group undertakes a review for impairment of a fixed asset 
or goodwill if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of the fixed asset or goodwill may not be
recoverable. To the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the
recoverable amount, that is, the higher of net realizable value and 
value in use, the fixed asset or goodwill is written down to its
recoverable amount. The value in use is determined from estimated
discounted future net cash flows.
Maintenance expenditure
Expenditure on major maintenance, refits or repairs is capitalized
where it enhances the performance of an asset above its originally
assessed standard of performance; replaces an asset or part of 
an asset that was separately depreciated and is then written off; 
or restores the economic benefits of an asset that has been fully
depreciated. All other maintenance expenditure is charged to 
income as incurred.
Petroleum revenue tax
The charge for petroleum revenue tax is calculated using a unit-of-
production method.
Changes in unit-of-production factors
Changes in factors which affect unit-of-production calculations 
are dealt with prospectively, not by immediate adjustment of prior 
years’ amounts.
Environmental liabilities
Environmental expenditures that relate to current or future revenues
are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate
to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not
contribute to current or future earnings are expensed.
Liabilities for environmental costs are recognized when BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
43
environmental assessments or clean-ups are probable and the
associated costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing
of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan
of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.
The amount recognized is the best estimate of the expenditure
required. Where the liability will not be settled for a number of
years, the amount recognized is the present value of the estimated
future expenditure.
Leases
Assets held under leases that result in group companies receiving
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership (finance leases) are
capitalized as tangible fixed assets at the estimated present value
of underlying lease payments. The corresponding finance lease
obligation is included within finance debt. Rentals under operating
leases are charged against income as incurred.
Research
Expenditure on research is written off in the year in which it
is incurred.
Interest
Interest is capitalized gross of related tax relief during the period of
construction where it relates either to the financing of major projects
with long periods of development or to dedicated financing of other
projects. All other interest is charged against income.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
For defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit
schemes, scheme assets are measured at fair value and scheme
liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit
method and discounted at an interest rate equivalent to the current
rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent currency
and term to the scheme liabilities. Full actuarial valuations are obtained
at least every three years and are updated at each balance sheet 
date. The resulting surplus or deficit, net of taxation thereon, is
presented separately above the total for net assets on the face of 
the balance sheet.
The service cost of providing pension and other post-retirement
benefits to employees for the year is charged to the income
statement. The cost of making improvements to pension and other
post-retirement benefits is recognized in the income statement on a
straight-line basis over the period during which the increase in benefits
vests. To the extent that the improvements in benefits vest
immediately, the cost is recognized immediately. These costs are
recognized as an operating expense.
A charge representing the unwinding of the discount on the scheme
liabilities during the year is included within other finance expense.
A credit representing the expected return on the scheme assets
during the year is included within other finance expense. This credit is
based on the market value of the scheme assets, and expected rates
of return, at the beginning of the year.
Actuarial gains and losses may result from: differences between the
expected return and the actual return on scheme assets; differences
between the actuarial assumptions underlying the scheme liabilities
and actual experience during the year; or changes in the actuarial
assumptions used in the valuation of the scheme liabilities. Actuarial
gains and losses, and taxation thereon, are recognized in the
statement of total recognized gains and losses. 
For defined contribution schemes, contributions payable for the 
year are charged to the income statement as an operating expense.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of all timing differences that
have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in
an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future.
In particular:
•
Provision is made for tax on gains arising from the disposal of fixed
assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only 
to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding
agreement to dispose of the replacement assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available
evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that 
the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and
charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold.
•
Provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance 
of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures 
and associated undertakings only to the extent that, at the balance
sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is
considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable
profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates
that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences
reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted
at the balance sheet date.
Discounting
The unwinding of the discount on provisions is included within 
other finance expense. Any change in the amount recognized for
environmental and other provisions arising through changes in discount
rates is included within other finance expense.
Use of estimates
The preparation of accounts in conformity with generally accepted
accounting practice requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues 
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could 
differ from these estimates.
Comparative figures
Information for 2003 has been restated to reflect the transfer of 
natural gas liquids activities from Exploration and Production to 
Gas, Power and Renewables. (See Note 45 for further information.)

Group audit fees for 2004 include $1 million of additional fees for 2003. Group audit fees include $4 million ($2 million) in respect of the parent
company. Audit fees are included in the income statement within distribution and administration expenses.
The audit committee has established pre-approval policies and procedures for the engagement of Ernst & Young to render audit and certain
assurance and tax services. The audit fees payable to Ernst & Young are reviewed by the audit committee in the context of other global companies
for cost-effectiveness. Ernst & Young performed further assurance and tax services that were not prohibited by regulatory or other professional
requirements and were pre-approved by the committee. Ernst & Young is engaged for these services when its expertise and experience of BP 
are important. Most of this work is of an audit nature. Tax services were awarded either through a full competitive tender process or following 
an assessment of the expertise of Ernst & Young relative to that of other potential service providers. These services are for a fixed term.
Fees paid to major firms of accountants other than Ernst & Young for other services amount to $82 million ($44 million). BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004

The charge for depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in 2004 includes asset write-downs and impairment charges of
$1,743 million in total. Exploration and Production recognized a charge of $621 million for the impairment of certain assets. During the year, as a
result of impairment triggers, reviews were conducted which have resulted in impairment charges of $83 million in respect of King’s Peak in the
Gulf of Mexico, $20 million in respect of two fields in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf Matagorda Island area and $184 million in respect of various US
onshore fields. A charge of $88 million was reflected in respect of a gas processing plant in the US and a charge of $60 million following the blow-
out of the Temsah platform in Egypt. In addition, following the lapse of the sale agreement for DZO and Boqueron in Venezuela, an impairment
charge of $186 million was reflected. In connection with the Solvay transactions, the group has recognized impairment charges of $325 million for
goodwill and $306 million for tangible fixed assets in BP Solvay Polyethylene Europe. As part of a restructuring of the North American Olefins and
Derivatives businesses, decisions were taken to exit certain businesses and facilities resulting in impairments and write-downs of $291 million.
With the formation of Olefins and Derivatives and its planned divestment, certain agreements and assets have been restructured to reflect the
arm’s-length relationship that will exist in the future. This has resulted in a $188 million impairment of the facilities at Hull, UK. Other businesses
and corporate recognized an impairment charge of $12 million for certain investments.
The 2003 charge for depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles includes asset write-downs and impairment charges on
exploration and production properties of $738 million. This includes a charge of $296 million for four fields in the Gulf of Mexico following technical
reassessment and re-evaluation of future investment options; charges of $133 million and $49 million respectively for the Miller and Viscount fields
in the UK North Sea as a result of a decision not to proceed with waterflood and gas import options and a reserve write-down respectively; a
charge of $105 million for the Yacheng field in China; a charge of $108 million for the Kepadong field in Indonesia; and $47 million for the Eugene
Island/West Cameron fields in the US as a result of reserve write-downs following completion of our routine full technical reviews.
In assessing the value in use of potentially impaired assets, a nominal discount rate of 9% before tax has been used. Asset values are
determined by deriving the net present value of the future cash flows; the cash flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset. Notes on accounts

Factors that may affect future tax charges
From 1 January 2005, the group has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). As a consequence, there will be a change in the
basis of providing deferred taxation in such areas as business combinations and the valuation of stock, which will lead to changes to certain of the
factors described below and may lead to a change in the group’s effective tax rate.
The group earns income in many different countries and, on average, pays taxes at rates higher than the UK statutory rate. The overall impact 
of these higher taxes, which include the supplementary charge of 10% on UK North Sea profits, is subject to changes in enacted tax rates and the
country mix of the group’s income. However, it is not expected to change significantly in the near term.
The group has around $7.7 billion ($4.5 billion) of carry-forward tax losses in the UK and Germany, which would be available to offset against
future taxable income. At the end of 2004, no tax assets were recognized on these losses (at the end of 2003, $285 million of assets were
recognized). Tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that suitable taxable income will arise.
Carry-forward losses in other taxing jurisdictions have not been recognized as deferred tax assets, and are unlikely to have a significant effect 
on the group’s tax rate in future years.
The group’s profit before taxation includes stock holding gains or losses. These gains (or losses) are not taxed (or deductible) in certain
jurisdictions in which the group operates, and therefore give rise to decreases or increases in the effective tax rate. The impact of this item will 
be reduced under IFRS.
The impact on the tax rate of acquisition amortization (non-deductible depreciation and amortization relating to the fixed asset revaluation
adjustments and goodwill consequent upon the ARCO and Burmah Castrol acquisitions) is likely to be eliminated when the group reports its 
results under IFRS.
The major component of timing differences in the current year is accelerated tax depreciation. Based on current capital investment plans, 
the group expects to continue to be able to claim tax allowances in excess of depreciation in future years at a level similar to the current year.

Basic earnings per share 72.08 47.27
Diluted earnings per share 70.79 46.83
The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, i.e. profit for the year less
preference dividends, related to the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. The profit attributable to ordinary
shareholders is $15,729 million ($10,480 million). The average number of shares outstanding excludes the shares held by the Employee Share
Ownership Plans.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, adjusted for the unwinding of the
discount on the deferred consideration for the acquisition of our interest in TNK-BP , of $15,793 million ($10,504 million). The number of shares
outstanding is adjusted to show the potential dilution if employee share options are converted into ordinary shares, and for the ordinary shares
issuable, in two further annual tranches, in respect of the TNK-BP joint venture. The number of ordinary shares outstanding for basic and diluted
earnings per share may be reconciled as follows:
shares thousand

Weighted average number of ordinary shares 21,820,535 22,170,741

22,310,326 22,429,372
In addition to basic earnings per share based on the historical cost profit for the year, a further measure, based on replacement cost profit for the
year, is provided as it is considered that this measure gives an indication of underlying performance.

Acquisitions in 2004
On 2 November 2004, Solvay exercised its option to sell its interests in BP Solvay Polyethylene Europe and BP Solvay Polyethylene North America
to BP . Solvay held 50% of BP Solvay Polyethylene Europe and 51% of BP Solvay Polyethylene North America. On completion, the two entities,
which manufacture and market high-density polyethylene, became wholly owned subsidiaries of BP.The total consideration for the acquisition 
was $1,391 million. The consideration is subject to final closing adjustments. Other minor acquisitions were made for a total consideration of
$14 million. All business combinations have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The fair value of the tangible fixed
assets has been estimated by determining the net present value of future cash flows. No significant adjustments were made to the other assets
and liabilities acquired. The assets and liabilities acquired as part of the 2004 acquisitions are shown in aggregate in the table above.
During the year, BP China and Sinopec announced the establishment of the BP-Sinopec (Zhejiang) Petroleum Co. Ltd, a retail joint venture
between BP and Sinopec. Based on the existing service station network of Sinopec, the new joint venture will build, operate and manage a
network of 500 service stations in Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shaoxing. Also during the year, BP China and PetroChina announced the establishment 
of BP-PetroChina Petroleum Company Limited. Located in Guangdong, one of the most developed provinces in China, the joint venture will acquire,
build, operate and manage 500 service stations in the province. The initial investment in both joint ventures amounted to $106 million.
Acquisitions in 2003
BP made a number of minor acquisitions in 2003 for a total consideration of $82 million. All these business combinations were accounted for using
the acquisition method of accounting. No significant fair value adjustments were made to the acquired assets and liabilities. Goodwill of $5 million
arose on these acquisitions. In addition, the group redeemed the outstanding stock in CH-Twenty, Inc., a subsidiary undertaking, for $150 million.
TNK-BP
On 29 August 2003, BP and the Alfa Group and Access-Renova (AAR) combined certain of their Russian and Ukranian oil and gas businesses to
create TNK-BP , a new company owned and managed 50:50 by BP and AAR. TNK-BP is a joint venture and accounted for under the gross equity
method. BP contributed its 29% interest in Sidanco, its 29% interest in Rusia Petroleum and its holding in the BP Moscow retail network. There
was additional consideration from BP to AAR comprising an immediate $2,604 million in cash (which was subsequently reduced by receipt of
pre-acquisition dividends net of other adjustments, of $298 million) together with annual tranches of $1,250 million in BP shares payable in 2004, 
2005 and 2006. There were costs of $45 million in connection with the transaction. The first tranche was issued in September 2004.
BP also agreed with AAR to incorporate AAR’s 50% interest in Slavneft into TNK-BP in return for $1,418 million in cash (which was subsequently
reduced by receipt of pre-acquisition dividends of $64 million to $1,354 million). This transaction was completed on 16 January 2004. Notes on accounts

17 Disposals
As part of the strategy to upgrade the quality of its asset portfolio, the group has an active programme to dispose of non-strategic assets. In the
normal course of business in any particular year, the group may sell interests in exploration and production properties, service stations and pipeline
interests as well as non-core businesses. Disposal proceeds also include monies received from the repayment of loans.
Cash received during the year from disposals amounted to $5.0 billion ($6.4 billion). The major transactions in 2004 which generated over
$2.3 billion of proceeds were the sale of the group’s investments in PetroChina and Sinopec. For 2003, the major disposals representing over
$3.0 billion of the proceeds were the divestment of a further 20% interest in BP Trinidad and Tobago LLC; the sale of 50% of our interest in the 
In Amenas gas condensate project and 49% of our interest in the In Salah gas development in Algeria; and the sale of the UK North Sea Forties 
oil field, together with a package of 61 shallow-water assets in the Gulf of Mexico. The principal transactions generating the proceeds for each
segment are described below.
Exploration and Production $921 million ($4,867 million) The group divested interests in a number of oil and natural gas properties in both years.
During 2004, in the US we sold 45% of our interest in King’s Peak in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico to Marubeni Oil & Gas; divested our interest in
Swordfish; and additionally, we sold various properties including our interest in the South Pass 60 property in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf. In Canada,
BP sold various assets in Alberta to Fairborne Energy. In Indonesia, we disposed of our interest in the Kangean Production Sharing Contract and our
participating interest in the Muriah Production Sharing Contract. In 2003, the UK North Sea Forties oil field, together with a package of 61 shallow-
water assets in the Gulf of Mexico, were sold to Apache. A 12.5% interest in the Tangguh liquefied natural gas project in Indonesia was sold to
CNOOC. Interests in 14 UK Southern North Sea gas fields, together with associated pipelines and onshore processing facilities, including the
Bacton terminal, were sold to Perenco. BP sold 50% of its interest in the In Amenas gas condensate project and 49% of its interest in the In Salah
gas development in Algeria to Statoil. In January 2003, Repsol exercised its option to acquire a further 20% interest in BP Trinidad and Tobago LLC.
BP’s interest in the company is now 70%. In February 2003, BP called its $420 million Exchangeable Bonds which were exchangeable for Lukoil
American Depositary Shares (ADSs). Bondholders converted to ADSs before the redemption date.
Refining and Marketing $906 million ($1,053 million) The churn of retail assets represents a significant element of the total in both years. 
In addition, for 2004, major asset transactions included the sale of the Singapore refinery, and the Cushing and other pipeline interests in the US.
As a condition of the approval of the acquisition of Veba in 2002, BP was, among other things, required to divest approximately 4% of its retail
market share in Germany and a significant portion of its Bayernoil refining interests. The sale of 494 retail sites in the northern and north-eastern
part of Germany to PKN Orlen and the sale of retail and refinery assets in Germany and Central Europe to OMV in 2003 completed the
divestments required.
Petrochemicals $717 million ($236 million) In 2004, these related principally to the sale of the speciality intermediate chemicals and fabrics and
fibres businesses. For 2003, the proceeds related to the completion of the divestment of the former Burmah Castrol speciality chemicals business
Sericol and Fosroc Mining.
Gas, Power and Renewables $144 million ($67 million) In 2004, the group sold its interest in two Canadian natural gas liquids plants.
Other businesses and corporate $2,360 million ($209 million) The disposal of the group’s investments in PetroChina and Sinopec were the major
transactions in 2004. In 2003, the group sold its 50% interest in Kaltim Prima Coal, an Indonesian company.

25 Financial instruments
An outline of the group’s financial risks and the policies and objectives pursued in relation to those risks is set out in the financial risk management
section of Other Financial Issues on pages 35-36.
Financial instruments comprise primary financial instruments (cash, fixed and current asset investments, debtors, creditors, finance debt and
provisions) and derivative financial instruments (interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts, oil price contracts, natural gas price contracts
and power price contracts). Interest rate contracts include futures contracts, swap agreements and options. Foreign exchange contracts include
forwards, futures contracts, swap agreements and options. Oil, natural gas and power price contracts are those that require settlement in cash and
include futures contracts, swap agreements and options. Oil, natural gas and power price contracts that require physical delivery are not financial
instruments. However, if it is normal market practice for a particular type of oil, natural gas and power contract, despite having contract terms that
require settlement by delivery, to be extinguished other than by physical delivery (e.g. by cash payment), it is called a cash-settled commodity
contract. Contracts of this type are included with derivatives in the disclosures in Notes 26 and 27.
With the exception of the table of currency exposures shown on page 61, short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the group’s
operations have been excluded from the disclosures contained in this note, as permitted by Financial Reporting Standard No. 13 ‘Derivatives and
Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.

with payment dates spread over a number of years.
The proportion of floating rate debt at 31 December 2004 was 96% of total finance debt outstanding. Aside from debt issued in the US
municipal bond markets, interest rates on floating rate debt denominated in US dollars are linked principally to London Inter-Bank Offer Rate
(LIBOR), while rates on debt in other currencies are based on local market equivalents. The group monitors interest rate risk using a process of
sensitivity analysis. Assuming no changes to the finance debt and hedges described above, it is estimated that a change of 1% in the general 
level of interest rates on 1 January 2005 would change 2005 profit before tax by approximately $215 million. Notes on accounts

The floating rate financial assets earn interest at various rates set principally with respect to LIBOR or the local market equivalent. Fixed asset
investments included in the table above are held for the long term and have no maturity period. They are excluded from the calculation of weighted
average time until maturity.
26 Derivative financial instruments
In the normal course of business, the group is a party to derivative financial instruments (derivatives) with off balance sheet risk, primarily to
manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating
rate and fixed rate debt. The group also manages certain of its exposures to movements in oil, natural gas and power prices. In addition, the group
trades derivatives in conjunction with these risk management activities.
Risk management
Gains and losses on derivatives used for risk management purposes are deferred and recognized in earnings or as adjustments to carrying
amounts, as appropriate, when the underlying debt matures or the hedged transaction occurs. When an anticipated transaction is no longer likely 
to occur or finance debt is terminated before maturity, any deferred gain or loss that has arisen on the related derivative is recognized in the 
income statement, together with any gain or loss on the terminated item. Where such derivatives used for hedging purposes are terminated before
the underlying debt matures or the hedged transaction occurs, the resulting gain or loss is recognized on a basis that matches the timing and
accounting treatment of the underlying hedged item. The unrecognized and carried-forward gains and losses on derivatives used for hedging, and
the movements therein, are shown in the following table.

Trading activities
The group maintains active trading positions in a variety of derivatives. This activity is undertaken in conjunction with risk management activities.
Derivatives held for trading purposes are marked-to-market and any gain or loss recognized in the income statement. For traded derivatives, many
positions have been neutralized, with trading initiatives being concluded by taking opposite positions to fix a gain or loss, thereby achieving a zero
net market risk.
The following table shows the fair value at 31 December of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes. The fair values
at the year end are not materially unrepresentative of the position throughout the year.

The group measures its market risk exposure, i.e. potential gain or loss in fair values, on its trading activity using value-at-risk techniques. These
techniques are based on a variance/covariance model or a Monte Carlo simulation and make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from
possible future changes in market values over a 24-hour period. The calculation of the range of potential changes in fair value takes into account a
snapshot of the end-of-day exposures, and the history of one-day price movements over the previous 12 months, together with the correlation of
these price movements. The potential movement in fair values is expressed to three standard deviations, which is equivalent to a 99.7%
confidence level. This means that, in broad terms, one would expect to see an increase or a decrease in fair values greater than the value at risk 
on only one occasion per year if the portfolio were left unchanged.
The group calculates value at risk on all instruments that are held for trading purposes and that therefore give an exposure to market risk. The
value-at-risk model takes account of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate forward and futures contracts, swap agreements, options
and swaptions; foreign exchange forward and futures contracts, swap agreements and options; and oil, natural gas and power price futures, swap
agreements and options. Financial assets and liabilities and physical crude oil and refined products that are treated as trading positions are also
included in these calculations. The value-at-risk calculation for oil, natural gas and power price exposure also includes cash-settled commodity
contracts such as forward contracts.
The following table shows values at risk for trading activities.

The presentation of trading results shown in the table below includes certain activities of BP’s trading units that involve the use of derivative
financial instruments in conjunction with physical and paper trading of oil, natural gas and power. It is considered that a more comprehensive
representation of the group’s oil, natural gas and power price trading activities is given by aggregating the gain or loss on such derivatives together
with the gain or loss arising from the physical and paper trades to which they relate, representing the net result of the trading portfolio.

27 Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The estimated fair value of the group’s financial instruments is shown in the table below. The table also shows the ‘net carrying amount’ of the
financial asset or liability. This amount represents the net book value, i.e. market value when acquired or later marked-to-market. Interest rate
contracts include futures contracts, swap agreements and options. Foreign exchange contracts include forward and futures contracts, swap
agreements and options. Oil, natural gas and power price contracts include futures contracts, swap agreements and options and cash-settled
commodity contracts such as forward contracts.
Short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the group’s operations have been excluded from the disclosures contained in this note,
as permitted by Financial Reporting Standard No. 13 ‘Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.
The fair value and carrying amounts of finance debt shown below exclude the effects of currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward
contracts (which are included for presentation in the balance sheet). Long-term borrowings in the table below include debt that matures in the year
from 31 December 2004, whereas in the balance sheet long-term debt of current maturity is reported under amounts falling due within one year.
Long-term borrowings also include US Industrial Revenue/Municipal Bonds classified on the balance sheet as repayable within one year.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the group in estimating its fair value disclosures for its financial instruments:
Fixed assets – Investments The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for unlisted fixed asset investments approximates their fair value.
The fair value of listed fixed asset investments has been determined by reference to market prices.
Current assets – Debtors falling due after more than one year The fair value of other debtors due after one year is estimated not to be materially
different from its carrying value.
Current assets – Investments and cash at bank and in hand The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for unlisted current asset
investments and cash at bank and in hand approximates their fair value. The fair value of listed current asset investments has been determined 
by reference to market prices.
Finance debt The carrying amount of the group’s short-term borrowings, which mainly comprise commercial paper, bank loans and overdrafts,
approximates their fair value. The fair value of the group’s long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations is estimated using quoted prices 
or, where these are not available, discounted cash flow analyses, based on the group’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types and
maturities of borrowing.
Creditors – Amounts falling due after more than one year – Other creditors Deferred consideration for the acquisition of our interest in 
TNK-BP is discounted to the present value of the future payments. The carrying value thus approximates the fair value. The remaining liabilities 
are predominantly interest-free. In view of their short maturities, the reported carrying amount is estimated to approximate the fair value.
Provisions for liabilities and charges – Other provisions Where the liability will not be settled for a number of years, the amount recognized 
is the present value of the estimated future expenditure. The carrying amount of provisions thus approximates the fair value.
Derivative financial instruments and cash-settled commodity contracts The fair values of the group’s interest rate and foreign exchange contracts
are based on pricing models that take into account relevant market data. The fair values of the group’s oil, natural gas and power price contracts
(futures contracts, swap agreements, options and forward contracts) are based on market prices. Notes on accounts

Where finance debt is swapped into another currency, the finance debt is accounted in the swap currency and not in the original currency of
denomination. Total finance debt includes an asset of $835 million ($745 million) for the carrying value of currency swaps and forward contracts.
Included within Other loans repayable within one year are US Industrial Revenue/Municipal Bonds of $2,487 million ($2,503 million) with
maturity periods ranging up to 34 years. They are classified as repayable within one year, as required under UK GAAP , as the bondholders typically
have the option to tender these bonds for repayment on interest reset dates. Any bonds that are tendered are usually remarketed and BP has not
experienced any significant repurchases. BP considers these bonds to represent long-term funding when assessing the maturity profile of its
finance debt.
At 31 December 2004, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, including committed facilities of 
$4,500 million expiring in 2005 ($3,700 million expiring in 2004). These facilities are with a number of international banks and borrowings under
them would be at pre-agreed rates. The group expects to renew the facilities on an annual basis. Certain of these facilities support the group’s
commercial paper programme.
At 31 December 2004, the group’s share of third-party finance debt of joint ventures and associated undertakings was $2,821 million
($2,151 million) and $1,048 million ($922 million) respectively. These amounts are not reflected in the group’s debt on the balance sheet.

The group makes full provision for the future cost of decommissioning oil and natural gas production facilities and related pipelines on a discounted
basis on the installation of those facilities. At 31 December 2004, the provision for the costs of decommissioning these production facilities and
pipelines at the end of their economic lives was $5,580 million ($4,720 million). The provision has been estimated using existing technology, at
current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 2.0% (2.5%). These costs are expected to be incurred over the next 30 years. While 
the provision is based on the best estimate of future costs and the economic lives of the facilities and pipelines, there is uncertainty regarding 
both the amount and timing of incurring these costs.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount reasonably determinable. Generally, this
coincides with commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or closure of inactive sites. The provision for environmental
liabilities at 31 December 2004 was $2,458 million ($2,298 million). The provision has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices
and discounted using a real discount rate of 2.0% (2.5%). The majority of these costs are expected to be incurred over the next 10 years. The
extent and cost of future remediation programmes are inherently difficult to estimate. They depend on the scale of any possible contamination, 
the timing and extent of corrective actions, and also the group’s share of liability.
The group also holds provisions for expected rental shortfalls on surplus properties, litigation and sundry other liabilities. To the extent that 
these liabilities are not expected to be settled within the next three years, the provisions are discounted using either a nominal discount rate 
of 4.5% (4.5%) or a real discount rate of 2.0% (2.5%), as appropriate.
31 Pensions
Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. 
Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans (money purchase schemes) or defined benefit plans (final salary and other
types of schemes with committed pension payments). For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds
arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee. For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as the
employees’ pensionable salary and length of service. Defined benefit plans may be externally funded or unfunded. The assets of funded plans 
are generally held in separately administered trusts.
Contributions to funded defined benefit plans are based on advice from independent actuaries using actuarial methods, the objective of which 
is to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due. The pension plans in the UK and US are reviewed annually by the
independent actuaries and subject to a formal actuarial valuation at least every three years. The date of the latest actuarial valuation for the UK 
and US plans was 1 January 2003 and 1 January 2004 respectively. The date of the most recent actuarial reviews was 31 December 2004.
During 2004, contributions of $249 million ($258 million) and $30 million ($2,189 million) were made to the UK plans and US plans respectively.
In addition, contributions of $116 million ($86 million) were made to other funded defined benefit plans. The aggregate level of contributions in
2005 is expected to be approximately $600 million. Notes on accounts

31 Pensions continued
The pension assumptions for the principal plans are set out below. The assumptions used to evaluate accrued pension benefits at 31 December in
any year are used to determine pension expense for the following year, that is, the assumptions at 31 December 2004 are used to determine the
pension liabilities at that date and the pension cost for 2005. The assumptions for the parent company are the same as those shown for the UK.

32 Other post-retirement benefits
Certain group companies in the US provide post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits to their retired employees and dependants. The
entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum period of
service. The plans are funded to a limited extent. The cost of providing post-retirement benefits is assessed annually by independent actuaries
using the projected unit method. The date of the latest actuarial valuation was 1 January 2004 and the date of the most recent actuarial review was
31 December 2004.
At 31 December 2004, the independent actuaries reassessed the obligation for post-retirement benefits at $3,676 million ($4,143 million). 
The discount rate used to assess the obligation at 31 December 2004 of the plans was 5.75% (6.0%).

The assumed healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed
healthcare cost trend rate would have had the following effects:

BP’s post-retirement medical plans in the US provide prescription drug coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees. The group’s obligation for other 
post-retirement benefits at 31 December 2004 reflects the effects of the recent Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization 
Act of 2003 (the Act). The provisions of the Act provide for a federal subsidy for plans that provide prescription drug benefits and meet certain
qualifications, and alternatively would allow prescription drug plan sponsors to co-ordinate with the Medicare benefit. BP reflected the impact of the
legislation by reducing its actuarially determined obligation for post-retirement benefits at 31 December 2004 and will reduce the net cost for post-
retirement benefits in subsequent periods. The reduction in liability was reflected in the 2004 results as an actuarial gain (assumption change).
The expected long-term rates of return and market values of the various categories of assets held by the plans at 31 December are set

33 Called up share capital
The company’s authorized ordinary share capital remains unchanged at 36 billion shares of 25 cents each, amounting to $9 billion. In addition, 
the company has authorized preference share capital of 12,750,000 shares of £1 each ($21 million). During 2004, the number of ordinary shares 
in issue decreased by 596,632,202. The number of ordinary shares bought back for cancellation exceeded the number issued in connection with
the deferred consideration for the TNK-BP transaction, for employee share schemes and in connection with the ARCO acquisition. Further details 
of movements in share capital are shown in Note 34.
The allotted, called up and fully paid share capital at 31 December was as follows:
2004 2003
Shares $ million Shares $ million
Non-equity
8% cumulative first preference shares of £1 each 7,232,838 12 7,232,838 12

5,403 5,552
Voting on substantive resolutions tabled at a general meeting is on a poll. On a poll, shareholders present in person or by proxy have two votes for
every £5 in nominal amount of the first and second preference shares held and one vote for every ordinary share held. On a show-of-hands vote
on other resolutions (procedural matters) at a general meeting, shareholders present in person or by proxy have one vote each.
In the event of the winding up of the company, preference shareholders would be entitled to a sum equal to the capital paid up on the
preference shares plus an amount in respect of accrued and unpaid dividends and a premium equal to the higher of (i) 10% of the capital paid up
on the preference shares and (ii) the excess of the average market price of such shares on the London Stock Exchange during the previous six
months over par value.

The exercise prices for BP options granted during the year were £4.22/$7.73 (weighted average price) for Executive Directors’ Incentive Plan (2,783,333 options);
£4.38/$8.01 (weighted average price) for 71,750,436 options granted under the BP Share Option Plan; and £3.86/$7.06 (5,860,991 options) for savings-related and 
similar plans.
BP offers most of its employees the opportunity to acquire a shareholding in the company through savings-related and/or matching share plan
arrangements. Such arrangements are now in place in more than 80 countries. BP also uses long-term performance plans (see Note 38) and the
granting of share options as elements of remuneration for executive directors and senior employees.
During 2004, share options were granted to the executive directors under the Executive Directors’ Incentive Plan (EDIP). For these options, the
option exercise price was the market value (as determined in accordance with the plan rules) on the grant date. The options granted to executive
directors reflect BP’s performance in terms of total shareholder return, that is, share price increase with all dividends reinvested, relative to the
FTSE Global 100 group of companies over the three years preceding the grant as well as the underlying health of the business and the competitive
marketplace. Options have not been granted in any year unless the criteria for an award of shares under the share element of the EDIP (see Note
38) have been met. Options vest over three years (one-third each after one, two and three years respectively) and have a life of seven years after
the grant. 
Share options were also granted in 2004 under the BP Share Option Plan to certain categories of employees. Subject to certain vesting
requirements, the options are exercisable between the third and 10th anniversaries of the date of grant. There are no performance conditions
attaching to the options granted during the year.
Under the BP ShareSave Plan (a savings-related share option plan), employees save on a monthly basis over a three- or five-year period towards
the purchase of shares at a price fixed when the option is granted. The option price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price at the time
of grant. The option must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract; otherwise it lapses. The plan is run in the UK and a
small number of other countries. 
Under the BP ShareMatch Plan, BP matches employees’ own contributions of shares, up to a predetermined limit. The shares are then held in
trust for a defined minimum period. The plan is run in the UK and in over 70 other countries.
The group takes advantage of the exemption granted under Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract No. 17 (revised 2003) ‘Employee Share
Schemes’, whereby no compensation expense need be recognized for the BP ShareSave Plan. BP does not recognize an expense in respect of
share options granted to employees under the BP Share Option Plan. If the fair value of options granted in any particular year is estimated and this
value amortized over the vesting period of the options, an indication of the cost of granting options to employees can be made. The fair value of
each share option granted has been estimated using a Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
2004 2003 
Risk-free interest rate 4.00% 3.5%
Expected volatility 22% 30%

The additional expense that would have been recognized in 2004 on this basis would be $79 million ($79 million) and the impact on earnings per
share would be 1 cent (1 cent).
The company sponsors a number of savings plans covering most US employees. Under these plans, most employees may contribute up to
100% of their salary subject to certain regulatory limits. Most employees are eligible for a dollar-for-dollar company-matched contribution for the
first 7% of eligible pay contributed on a before-tax or after-tax basis, or a combination of both. The precise arrangement may vary in certain
business units. Plan participants may invest contributions in more than 200 investment options, including a fund comprised primarily of BP ADSs.
The company’s contributions generally vest over a period of three years (0% for years one and two and 100% after completion of three years).
Company contributions to savings plans during the year were $138 million ($130 million).
An Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) was established in 1997 to acquire BP shares to satisfy future requirements of employee share
plans, principally the BP ShareMatch Plan. The ESOP holds the shares for participants during the retention period of the plan. The company provides
funding to the ESOP . Until such time as the company’s own shares held by the ESOP trust vest unconditionally in employees, the amount paid for
those shares is deducted in arriving at shareholders’ interest (see Notes 34 and 35). Other assets and liabilities of the ESOP are recognized as
assets and liabilities of the company. The ESOP has waived its rights to dividends.
During 2004, the ESOP released 14,156,047 shares (16,892,853 shares) for the matching share plans. The cost of shares released for these
plans has been charged in these accounts. At 31 December 2004, the ESOP held 2,682,860 shares (7,811,544 shares), which had a market value
of $26 million ($63 million). BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004

Details of directors’ individual participation in share schemes are given in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 116-125.
38 Long-term performance plans
During 2004, the company operated two long-term performance plans: the Executive Directors’ Incentive Plan (EDIP) for executive directors and
the Long Term Performance Plan (LTPP) for senior employees. Executive directors participated in the LTPP prior to 2002 or to their appointment 
as an executive director, whichever was the later. Both plans are incentive schemes under which the company may award shares to participants 
or fund the purchase of shares for participants if long-term targets are met. Awards were made in 2004 in respect of the 2001-2003 LTPP . 
Further details of the plans are given in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 116-125.
The costs of potential future awards for both the EDIP and LTPP are accrued over the three-year performance periods of each plan. The amount
charged in 2004 was $89 million ($94 million). The value of awards under the 2001-2003 LTPP made in 2004 was $42 million (2000-2002 LTPP
$35 million). Employees are able to defer the date of their potential award beyond the end of the performance period. The amount charged in
respect of the increase in deferred awards after the expiry of the relevant performance periods was $23 million ($17 million).
Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) have been established to acquire BP shares to satisfy any awards made to participants under the
EDIP and LTPP and then to hold them for the participants during the retention period of the plan. The company provides funding to the ESOPs.
Until such time as the company’s own shares held by the ESOP trusts vest unconditionally in employees, the amount paid for those shares is
deducted in arriving at shareholders’ interest (see Notes 34 and 35). Other assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and
liabilities of the company. The ESOPs have waived their rights to dividends on shares held for future awards.
At 31 December 2004, the ESOPs held 5,938,359 shares (4,118,835 shares) for potential future awards, which had a market value of 
$58 million ($33 million). Notes on accounts

Office facilities for former chairmen and deputy chairmen
It is customary for the company to make available to former chairmen and deputy chairmen, who were previously employed executives, the use 
of office and basic secretarial facilities following their retirement. The cost involved in doing so is not significant.

The joint venture TNK-BP was created on 29 August 2003. (See Note 16 for further information.) TNK-BP , in which BP holds a 50% interest, is an
integrated oil company operating, inter alia, in Russia.
The preliminary fair values attributed to the assets and liabilities of TNK-BP in 2003 have been revised in 2004 as permitted by Financial
Reporting Standard No. 7 ‘Fair Values in Acquisition Accounting’.
The results for TNK-BP for 2004 have been estimated. Any difference between the estimated and actual results for this period will be included 
in the results for 2005. The adjustment included in 2004 in respect of 2003 was a charge of $36 million.
BP Solvay Polyethylene Europe and BP Solvay Polyethylene North America became subsidiary undertakings with effect from 2 November 2004.

42 Contingent liabilities
There were contingent liabilities at 31 December 2004 in respect of guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course of the
group’s business. No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities.
Approximately 200 lawsuits were filed in State and Federal Courts in Alaska seeking compensatory and punitive damages arising out of the
Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound in March 1989. Most of those suits named Exxon (now ExxonMobil), Alyeska Pipeline Service
Company (Alyeska), which operates the oil terminal at Valdez, and the other oil companies that own Alyeska. Alyeska initially responded to the spill
until the response was taken over by Exxon. BP owns a 47% interest (reduced during 2001 from 50% by a sale of 3% to Phillips) in Alyeska
through a subsidiary of BP America Inc. and briefly indirectly owned a further 20% interest in Alyeska following BP’s combination with Atlantic
Richfield Company (Atlantic Richfield). Alyeska and its owners have settled all the claims against them under these lawsuits. Exxon has indicated
that it may file a claim for contribution against Alyeska for a portion of the costs and damages which it has incurred. If any claims are asserted by
Exxon that affect Alyeska and its owners, BP will defend the claims vigorously. 
Since 1987, Atlantic Richfield, a current subsidiary of BP , has been named as a co-defendant in numerous lawsuits brought in the US alleging
injury to persons and property caused by lead pigment in paint. The majority of the lawsuits have been abandoned or dismissed as against Atlantic
Richfield. Atlantic Richfield (and in one case two of its affiliates) is named in these lawsuits as alleged successor to International Smelting &
Refining which, along with a predecessor company, manufactured lead pigment during the period 1920-1946. Plaintiffs include individuals and
governmental entities. Several of the lawsuits purport to be class actions. The lawsuits (depending on plaintiff) seek various remedies, including:
compensation to lead-poisoned children; cost to find and remove lead paint from buildings; medical monitoring and screening programmes; 
public warning and education on lead hazards; reimbursement of government healthcare costs and special education for lead-poisoned citizens; 
and punitive damages. No lawsuit against Atlantic Richfield has been settled or tried to conclusion. The amounts claimed and, if such suits were
successful, the costs of implementing the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial. While it is not possible to predict the
outcome of these legal actions, Atlantic Richfield believes that it has valid defences and it intends to defend such actions vigorously and thus 
the incurring of a liability by Atlantic Richfield is remote. Consequently, BP believes that the impact of these lawsuits on the group’s results of
operations, financial position or liquidity will not be material.
The group is subject to numerous national and local environmental laws and regulations concerning its products, operations and other activities.
These laws and regulations may require the group to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release 
of chemicals or petroleum substances by the group or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites including refineries, chemical
plants, oil fields, service stations, terminals and waste disposal sites. In addition, the group may have obligations relating to prior asset sales or
closed facilities. The ultimate requirement for remediation and its cost are inherently difficult to estimate. However, the estimated cost of known
environmental obligations has been provided in these accounts in accordance with the group’s accounting policies. While the amounts of future
costs could be significant and could be material to the group’s results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, BP does not expect
these costs to have a material effect on the group’s financial position or liquidity. 
The group generally restricts its purchase of insurance to situations where this is required for legal or contractual reasons. This is because
external insurance is not considered an economic means of financing losses for the group. Losses will therefore be borne as they arise rather
than being spread over time through insurance premia with attendant transaction costs. The position is reviewed periodically.
The parent company has issued guarantees under which amounts outstanding at 31 December 2004 were $21,106 million ($20,903 million),
including $21,050 million ($20,847 million) in respect of borrowings by its subsidiary undertakings and $56 million ($56 million) in respect of
liabilities of other third parties. In addition, other group companies have issued guarantees under which amounts outstanding at 31 December 2004
were $1,281 million ($635 million) in respect of borrowings of joint ventures and associated undertakings and $650 million ($304 million) in respect
of liabilities of other third parties.
43 Capital commitments
Authorized future capital expenditure by group companies for which contracts had been placed at 31 December 2004 amounted to $6,765 million
($6,420 million). BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004

44 New accounting standards
Comparative information for 2003 has been restated to reflect the changes described below:
(a) New accounting standard for pensions and other post-retirement benefits
With effect from 1 January 2004, BP has adopted Financial Reporting Standard No. 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’ (FRS 17). FRS 17 requires that
financial statements reflect at fair value the assets and liabilities arising from an employer’s retirement benefit obligations and any related funding.
The operating costs of providing retirement benefits are recognized in the period in which they are earned, together with any related finance costs
and changes in the value of related assets and liabilities. This contrasts with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No. 24 ‘ Accounting for
Pension Costs’, which required the cost of providing pensions to be recognized on a systematic and rational basis over the period during which the 
employer benefited from the employee’s services. The difference between the amount charged in the income statement and the amount paid 
as contributions into the pension fund was shown as a prepayment or provision on the balance sheet.
This change in accounting policy has resulted in a prior year adjustment. Shareholders’ interest at 1 January 2003 has been reduced by 
$5,601 million and the profit for the year ended 31 December 2003 increased by $215 million. Profit for the current year has been increased 
by approximately $301 million as a result of the change in accounting policy.
(b) Accounting for Employee Share Ownership Plans
With effect from 1 January 2004, BP has adopted Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract No. 38 ‘ Accounting for Employee Share Ownership Plan
(ESOP) Trusts’. This abstract requires that BP shares held by the group for the purposes of Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) are deducted
from equity on the balance sheet. Such shares were previously classified as fixed asset investments. In addition, accruals for awards under the
Long Term Performance Plan have also been included in reserves.
This change in accounting policy has resulted in a prior year adjustment. Shareholders’ interest at 1 January 2003 has been increased by 
$26 million. The impact of the change in accounting policy on profit for the years ended 31 December 2003 and 2004 is not significant.

BP reserves governance
BP manages its hydrocarbon resources in three major categories:
prospect inventory, non-proved reserves and proved reserves. 
When a discovery is made, volumes transfer from the prospect
inventory to the non-proved reserve category. The reserves move
through various non-proved reserves sub-categories as their technical
and commercial maturity increases through appraisal activity. 
Reserves in a field will only be categorized as proved when all the
criteria for attribution of proved status have been met, including 
an internally imposed requirement for project sanction, or for 
sanction expected within six months, or as part of a rolling drilling
programme included within our business planning process. Internal
approval and final investment decision are what we refer to as 
project sanction.
At the point of sanction, all booked reserves will be categorized 
as proved undeveloped (PUD). Volumes will subsequently be
recategorized from PUD to proved developed (PD) as a consequence 
of development activity. The first PD bookings will occur at the 
point of first oil or gas production. Major development projects 
typically take one to four years from the time of initial booking 
to the start of production. Adjustments may be made to booked
reserves owing to production, reservoir performance, commercial
factors, acquisition and divestment activity and additional reservoir
development activity.
BP has an internal process to control the quality of reserve bookings
that forms part of a holistic and integrated system of internal control.
BP’s process to manage reserve bookings has been centrally controlled
for over 15 years and it currently has several key elements. 
The first element is the accountabilities of certain officers of the
company, which ensure that there is clear responsibility for review and,
where appropriate, endorsement of changes to reserves bookings; 
that the review is independent of the operating business unit for the
integrity and accuracy of the reserve estimates; and that there are
effective controls in the reserve approval process and verification that
the group’s reserve estimates and the related financial impacts are
reported in a timely manner. 
The second element is the capital allocation processes whereby
delegated authority is exercised to commit to capital projects that are
consistent with the delivery of the group’s business plan. A formal
review process exists to review that both technical and commercial
criteria are met prior to the commitment of capital to projects.
The third element is internal audit, whose role includes
systematically examining the effectiveness of the group’s financial
controls designed to assure the reliability of reporting and safeguarding
of assets and examining the group’s compliance with laws, regulations
and internal standards. 
The fourth element is a quarterly due diligence review, which is
separate and independent from the operating business units, of
reserves associated with properties where technical, operational 
or commercial issues have arisen.
The fifth element is the established criteria whereby reserves 
above certain thresholds require central authorization. Furthermore, 
the volumes booked under these authorization levels are reviewed 
on a periodic basis. The frequency of review is determined according 
to field size and ensures that more than 70% of the BP reserves base
undergoes central review every two years and more than 80% is
reviewed every four years.
Reserves reporting
Our proved reserves are associated with both concessions 
(tax and royalty arrangements) and production-sharing agreements
(PSAs). In a concession, the consortium of which we are a part is
entitled to the reserves that can be produced over the licence period,
which may be the life of the field. In a PSA, we are entitled to recover
volumes that equate to costs incurred to develop and produce the
reserves and an agreed share of the remaining volumes or the
economic equivalent. As part of our entitlement is driven by the
monetary amount of costs to be recovered, price fluctuations will 
have an impact on both production volumes and reserves. Twenty-one
per cent of our proved reserves are associated with PSAs. The main
countries in which we operate under PSA arrangements are Algeria,
Angola, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam. 
As a UK-registered company reporting under UK GAAP , BP 
estimates its proved reserves under UK accounting rules for oil and 
gas companies contained in the Statement of Recommended Practice,
’Accounting for Oil and Gas Exploration, Development, Production and
Decommissioning Activities’ (UK SORP). In estimating its reserves
under UK SORP , BP uses long-term planning prices; these are the long-
term price assumptions on which the group makes decisions to invest
in the development of a field. Using planning prices for estimating
proved reserves removes the impact of the volatility inherent in 
using year-end spot prices on our reserve base and on cash flow
expectations over the long term. The group’s planning prices for
estimating reserves through the end of 2004 were $20 per barrel
for oil and $3.50 per mmBtu for natural gas. 
In determining ’reasonable certainty’ for UK SORP purposes, 
BP applies a number of additional internally imposed assessment
principles, such as the requirement for internal approval and final
investment decision (which we refer to as project sanction), or for 
such project sanction within six months and, for additional reserves in
existing fields, the requirement that the reserves be included in the
business plan and scheduled for development within three years. 
On the basis of UK SORP , our total proved reserves for subsidiaries
and equity-accounted entities at the end of 2004 increased to
18,583 mmboe, representing a proved reserve replacement ratio
(RRR) before acquisitions and divestments of 110%, versus 109% in
2003. Our principal equity-accounted entity is TNK-BP . For subsidiaries
only, the RRR is 106% and, for equity-accounted entities only, the
RRR is 118%. The proved reserve replacement ratio (also known as
the production replacement ratio) is the extent to which production
is replaced by proved reserve additions. This ratio is expressed in oil
equivalent terms and includes changes resulting from revisions to
previous estimates, improved recovery, extensions, discoveries and
other additions, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestments.
Natural gas is converted to oil equivalent at 5.8 billion cubic feet equals
1 million barrels. By their nature, there is always some risk involved in
the ultimate development and production of reserves, including but
not limited to final regulatory approval, the installation of new or
additional infrastructure as well as changes in oil and gas prices
and the continued availability of additional development capital.
The estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves on this basis
are shown on pages 89-90. 
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules for
estimating reserves are different in certain respects from SORP; 
in particular, the SEC requires the use of year-end prices.

At 31 December 2004, the marker price for Brent crude was $40.24
per barrel and for Henry Hub gas it was $6.01 per thousand cubic
feet.
Applying higher year-end prices to reserve estimates and assuming
they apply to the end-of-field life has the effect of increasing proved
reserves associated with concessions (tax and royalty arrangements)
for which additional development opportunities become economic at
higher prices or where higher prices make it more economic to extend
the life of a field. On the other hand, applying higher year-end prices to
reserves in fields subject to PSAs has the effect of decreasing proved
reserves from those fields because higher prices result in lower
volume entitlements. 
The company’s proved reserves estimates on an SEC basis for the
year ended 31 December 2004 reflect year-end prices and some
adjustments that have been made vis-à-vis individual asset reserve
estimates based on different applications of certain SEC interpretations
of SEC regulations relating to the use of technology (mainly seismic) 
to estimate reserves in the reservoir away from wellbores and the
reporting of fuel gas (i.e. gas used for fuel in operations on the lease)
within proved reserves. On an aggregate basis, the net impact of
these changes, comprising some reductions and some additions,
is a decrease of 286 mmboe, resulting in total proved reserves of
18,297 mmboe (including equity-accounted entities) compared with
our reserves under UK SORP . Excluding equity-accounted entities,
our proved reserves on an SEC basis were 14,625 mmboe.
The total net movement in subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities
comprises a decrease of 452 mmboe as a result of using the year-end
price, offset by a net increase of 166 mmboe in respect of fuel gas and
technology interpretations.
On an SEC basis, our total proved reserves for subsidiaries and
equity-accounted entities at the end of 2004 decreased by 64 mmboe
from 18,361 to 18,297 mmboe, representing a proved reserve
replacement ratio (RRR) before acquisitions and divestments of 89%
versus 111% in 2003. For subsidiaries only, the RRR is 78% and, for
equity-accounted entities only, the RRR is 114%.
We have included certain reserve replacement ratios that are
calculated using proved reserves attributed to equity-accounted entities
as well as consolidated entities and which exclude acquisitions and
divestments. SEC staff guidance states that such measures should 
not include both proved reserve additions attributable to consolidated
entities and equity-accounted entities and should be based on
beginning and ending proved reserve quantities as disclosed in the
Annual Report on Form 20-F . On this basis our RRR would be 64%
(39% for 2003).

SEC basis are shown on pages 91-92. BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004

Replacement cost profit excludes stock holding gains and losses. The effect of this is to set against income for the period the average cost of supplies incurred in the
same period rather than applying costs obtained by using the first-in first-out method. Profit on the replacement cost basis therefore reflects more immediately changes
in purchase costs and provides an indication of the underlying trend in trading performance in a continuing business. This basis is used to assist in the interpretation of
operating profit.

Governance and the role of our board 
Good governance is often defined in terms of the presence or 
absence of particular practices without reference to the underlying
purpose of governance processes. We believe that governance is 
a more powerful concept. 
Governance is not an exercise in compliance nor is it a higher form
of management. Governance lies at the heart of all the board does and
it is the task our owners entrust to the board. It has a clear objective –
ensuring the pursuit of the company’s purpose. The board’s role is
focused on this task, which is unique to it as the representative of 
BP’s owners. This task is discharged by the board through undertaking
such activities as are necessary for the effective promotion of
shareholder interest.
Governance is the system by which the company’s owners and 
their representatives on the board ensure that it pursues, does not
deviate from and only allocates resources to its defined purpose.
As a company, we recognize the importance of good governance 
and that it is a discrete task from management. Clarity of roles is 
key to our approach. Policies and processes depend upon the people
who operate them. Governance requires distinct skills and processes.
In the context of BP , governance is overseen by our board while
management is delegated to the group chief executive by means 
of the board governance policies. 
Our board governance policies use a coherent, principles-based
approach, which anticipated many developments in UK governance
regulation. They ensure that our board and management operate 
within a clear and efficient governance framework that goes beyond
regulatory compliance and places shareholder interest at the heart 
of all we do. 
Accountability to shareholders
Our board is accountable in a variety of ways. It is required to be
proactive in obtaining an understanding of shareholder preferences 
and to evaluate systematically the economic, social, environmental 
and ethical matters that may influence or affect the interest of 
our shareholders. 
Our board is accountable to shareholders for the performance 
and activities of the entire BP group. It embeds shareholder 
interest in the goals established for the company.
In carrying out its work in policy-making and monitoring and in its
active consideration of group strategy, our board exercises judgement
on how best to further shareholder interest. The board seeks to do 
so by maximizing the expected value of shareholders’ interest in the
company, not by eliminating the possibility of any adverse outcomes. 
Reporting Our board makes use of a number of formal communication
channels to account to shareholders for the performance of the
company. These include the Annual Report and Accounts, the Annual
Review, the Annual Report on Form 20-F , quarterly Forms 6-K and
announcements made through stock exchanges on which BP shares
are listed, as well as through the annual general meeting (AGM). 
Dialogue with directors Presentations given at appropriate intervals 
to representatives of the investment community are available to all
shareholders by internet broadcast or open conference call. Less
formal processes include contacts with institutional shareholders by 
the chairman and other non-executive directors. This is supported 
by the dialogue with shareholders concerning the governance and
operation of the group maintained by the company secretary’s 
office, investor relations and other BP teams.
AGM and voting Given the size and geographical diversity of our
shareholder base, the opportunities for shareholder interaction at 
the AGM are limited. However, the chairman and all board committee
chairmen were present at the 2004 AGM to answer shareholders’
questions and hear their views during the meeting. Members of 
the board met informally with shareholders afterwards. All votes at
shareholder meetings, whether by proxy or in person, are counted
since votes on all matters, except procedural issues, are taken by way
of a poll. We have pioneered the use of electronic communications to
facilitate the exercise of shareholder control rights and continue to
promote the use of electronic voting through our registrar’s website
and through CREST . 
Directors’ elections Directors are required to stand for re-election 
each year. New directors are subject to election at the first opportunity
following their appointment. All names submitted to shareholders for 
election are accompanied by detailed biographies. 
How our board governs the company
The board’s governance policies regulate its relationship with
shareholders, the conduct of board affairs and the board’s relationship
with the group chief executive. The policies recognize the board’s
separate and unique role as the link in the chain of authority between
the shareholders and the group chief executive. It is this unique task
that gives the board its central role in governance.
The dual role played by the group chief executive and executive
directors as both members of the board and leaders of the executive
management is also recognized and addressed. The policies require a
majority of the board to be composed of independent non-executive
directors. To assure the integrity of the governance process, the
relationship between the board and the group chief executive is
governed by the non-executive directors, particularly through the 
work of the board committees they populate. 
Recognizing that as a group its capacity is limited, our board
reserves to itself the making of broad policy decisions. It delegates
more detailed considerations involved in meeting its stated
requirements either to board committees and officers (in the 
case of its own processes) or to the group chief executive (in 
the case of the management of the company’s business activities).
The board governs BP through setting general policy for the conduct 
of business (and critically, by clearly articulating its objective) and by
monitoring its implementation by the group chief executive.

111
To discharge its governance function in the most effective 
manner, our board has laid down rules for its own activities 
in a board process policy. The board process policy covers: 
• The conduct of members at meetings.  
• The cycle of board activities and the setting of agendas.  
• The provision of timely information to the board.  
• Board officers and their roles.  
• Board committees – their tasks and composition.  
• Qualifications for board membership and the process 
of the nomination committee.  
• The evaluation and assessment of board performance. 
• The remuneration of non-executive directors.  
• The process for directors to obtain independent advice.  
• The appointment and role of the company secretary. 
The responsibility for implementation of this policy is placed 
on the chairman.
The board-executive linkage policy sets out how the board 
delegates authority to the group chief executive and the extent 
of that authority. In its goals policy, the board states the long-term
outcome and required results it expects the group chief executive 
to deliver. The restrictions on the manner in which the group 
chief executive may achieve the required results are set out in the 
executive limitations policy. This policy addresses internal control, 
risk preferences, financing, ethical behaviour, health, safety, the
environment, treatment of employees and political considerations.
Through the goals and executive limitations policies, the board 
shapes BP’s values and standards.
Accountability in our business
Our group chief executive outlines how he intends to deliver the
required outcome in annual and medium-term plans, which also
address a comprehensive assessment of the group’s risks. 
Progress towards the expected outcome forms the basis of a report 
to the board that covers actual results and a forecast of results for 
the current year. This report is reviewed at each board meeting. 
The group chief executive is obliged through dialogue and 
systematic review to discuss with our board all material matters
currently or prospectively affecting the company and its performance
and all strategic projects or developments. This key dialogue specifically
includes any materially under-performing business activities and actions
that breach the executive limitations policy and material matters of a
social, environmental and ethical nature. 
The board-executive linkage policy also sets out how the group chief
executive’s performance will be monitored and recognizes that, in the
multitude of changing circumstances, judgement is always involved.
The systems set out in the board-executive linkage policy are designed
to manage, rather than to eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve the
board goals policy or observe the executive limitations policy. They
provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
Who is on the board?
The board is composed of the chairman, 12 non-executive and six
executive directors. In total, five nationalities are represented on 
the board. Directors’ biographies are set out on pages 126-127. As
reported last year, the board is actively engaged in succession planning
issues. As a result, the size of the board has increased during the past
year despite the departure of Mr Maljers and Mr Olver. Mr Burgmans
(February), Sir Tom McKillop (July) and Mr Flint (from January 2005)
were appointed as non-executive directors, while Mr Conn joined 
the board as an executive director in July. 
The efficiency and effectiveness of the board are paramount
concerns. Our board is large but this is necessary to allow sufficient
executive director representation to cover the breadth of the group’s
business activities and sufficient non-executive representation to
reflect the scale and complexity of BP and to staff our board
committees. A board of this size allows orderly succession planning
for key roles.
Governance policies and processes depend upon the quality 
and commitment of the people who operate them. 
New non-executive directors will be appointed over the coming
years. Mr Knight and Sir Robin Nicholson will retire at the 2005 AGM.
Subject to their annual re-election, Mr Miles will retire in 2006 and
Mr Bryan and Mr Wilson in 2007. We believe refreshing the
composition of the board should be an orderly process of evolution
that ensures its continuing effectiveness.
Board independence
The qualification for board membership includes a requirement that 
all our non-executive directors be free from any relationship with the
executive management of the company that could materially interfere
with the exercise of their independent judgement. In the board’s view,
all our non-executive directors fulfil this requirement. It determined all
12 who served during 2004 to be independent directors.
Mr Knight and Sir Robin Nicholson were appointed to the BP board 
in 1987 and Mr Miles was appointed in 1994. The length of their
respective service on the board exceeds the nine years referred to 
in the Combined Code. The board considers that the experience and 
long-term perspective of each of these directors on BP’s business
during its recent period of growth provide a valuable contribution to 
the board, given the long-term nature of our business. The integrity 
and independence of character of these directors are beyond doubt.
Both Mr Knight and Sir Robin will retire at the 2005 AGM. Mr Miles 
will retire in 2006. 
Those directors who joined the BP board in 1998 after service on
the board of Amoco Corporation (Messrs Bryan, Massey, Wilson and
Davis) are considered independent since the most senior executive
management of BP comprises individuals who were not previously
Amoco employees. While Amoco businesses and assets are a key 
part of the group, the scope and scale of BP since its acquisition of 
the ARCO, Burmah Castrol and Veba businesses are fundamentally
different from those of the former Amoco Corporation. 
The board has satisfied itself that there is no compromise to the
independence of those directors who serve together as directors 
on the boards of outside entities (or who have other appointments 
in outside entities). Where necessary, our board ensures appropriate
processes are in place to manage any possible conflict of interest. 
Sir Robin Nicholson received fees during 2004 for representing 
the board on the BP technology advisory council. Since these fees
relate to board representation, they do not compromise Sir Robin’s
independence. Full details of these fees are disclosed on page 125.
Directors’ appointments, retirement policies and insurance
The chairman and non-executive directors of BP are elected each 
year and, subject to BP’s Articles of Association, serve on the basis 
of letters of appointment. Executive directors of BP have service
contracts with the company. Details of all payments to directors 
are reviewed in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 116-125.  Governance: board performance report 
112
Annual elections for all directors and the provision of independent 
support to our board and board committees underscore our
commitment to good governance practice.
BP’s policy on directors’ retirement is as follows: executive directors
retire at age 60, while non-executive directors ordinarily retire at the
AGM following their 70th birthday. It is the board’s policy that non-
executive directors are not generally expected to hold office for 
more than 10 years.
In accordance with BP’s Articles of Association, directors are 
granted an indemnity from the company to the extent permitted 
by law in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office. In
respect of those liabilities for which directors may not be indemnified,
the company purchased and maintained a directors’ and officers’
liability insurance policy throughout 2004. This insurance cover was
renewed at the beginning of 2005. Neither the company’s indemnity
nor insurance provides cover in the event that the director is proved 
to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Board and committees: meetings and attendance
In addition to the AGM (which all but one director attended), the board
met eight times during 2004, five times in the UK, twice in the US 
and once in continental Europe. Two of these meetings were two-day
strategy discussions. 2004 saw an increased number of committee
meetings, with no sign that this trend will reverse. 
The board requires all members to devote sufficient time to the
work of the board to discharge the office of director and to use their
best endeavours to attend meetings. Directors’ attendance at board
and committee meetings is set out below. All directors attended at
least 75% of meetings, except Mr Burgmans. Several board meetings
coincided with commitments entered into by Mr Burgmans before his
appointment to the board in February 2004, a matter made known to
the board on his appointment. The board and Mr Burgmans are looking
forward to his full participation in the years ahead. 
Serving as a director: induction, training and evaluation
Induction Directors receive induction on their appointment to the
board as appropriate, covering matters such as the operation and
activities of the group (including key financial, business, social and
environmental risks to the group’s activities), the role of the board 
and the matters reserved for its decision, the tasks and membership 
of the principal board committees, the powers delegated to those
committees, the board’s governance policies and practices, and the
latest financial information about the group. The chairman is accountable
for the induction of new board members.
Training Our directors are updated on BP’s business, the environment 
in which it operates and other matters throughout their period in office.
We advise directors on their appointment of the legal and other duties
and obligations they have as directors of a listed company. The board
regularly considers the implications of these duties under our board
governance policies. Our non-executive directors receive training
specific to the tasks of the particular board committees on which 
they serve.
Outside appointments As part of their ongoing development, our
executive directors are permitted to take up an external board
appointment, subject to the agreement of our board. Executive
directors retain any fees received in respect of such external
appointments. 
Generally outside appointments for executive directors are limited 
to one outside company board only, although our group chief executive,
by exception, serves on two outside company boards. Our board is
satisfied that these appointments do not conflict with his duties and
commitment to BP . Non-executive directors may serve on a number 
of outside boards, always provided they continue to demonstrate 
the requisite commitment to discharge effectively their duties to BP .
The nomination committee keeps the extent of directors’ other
interests under review to ensure that the effectiveness of our board 
is not compromised. 
As the board attendance table below illustrates, our directors’
commitment to the work of the board is manifest.
Evaluation During 2004, our board continued its ongoing evaluation
processes to assess its performance and identify areas in which its
effectiveness, policies or processes might be enhanced. The board
reviewed the conclusions and actions from the 2003 evaluation and
determined that there should be a focus on evaluating the performance
of the board committees during 2004.

Regular evaluation of board effectiveness underpins our confidence
in BP’s governance policies and processes and affords opportunity
for their development.
Evaluations of both the audit and the ethics and environment
assurance committees took place during the year. An evaluation of the
work of the remuneration committee will take place this year as the
review of executive remuneration is concluded and Dr Julius assumes
chairmanship of the committee. Work on a further evaluation of the
board and the performance of individual directors has commenced.
The chairman and senior independent director 
BP’s board governance policies require the chairman and deputy
chairman to be non-executive directors; throughout 2004 the posts
were held by Mr Sutherland and Sir Ian Prosser respectively. Sir Ian 
also acts as our senior independent director and is the director whom
shareholders may contact if they feel their concerns are not being
addressed through normal channels.
Between board meetings, the chairman has responsibility for
ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of the board/executive
relationship. This requires his interaction with the group chief executive
between board meetings, as well as his contact with other board
members and shareholders. The chairman represents the views of 
the board to shareholders on key issues, not least in succession
planning issues for both executive and non-executive appointments.
The chairman and all the non-executive directors meet periodically 
as the chairman’s committee (see report on page 114). The
performance of the chairman is evaluated each year at a meeting 
of the chairman’s committee, for which item of business he is not
present. The company secretary reports to the chairman and is not 
part of the executive management. 
Board committees 
The board process policy allocates the tasks of monitoring executive
actions and assessing performance to certain board committees.
These tasks, rather than any terms of reference, prescribe the
authority and the role of the board committees. Reports for each
of the committees for 2004 appear below. In common with the board,
each committee has access to independent advice and counsel 
as required and each is supported by the company secretary and 
his office, which is demonstrably independent of the executive
management of the group. 
Audit committee report
Schedule and composition The committee met 13 times
during 2004 and comprised the following directors: 
Sir Ian Prosser (chairman), J H Bryan, E B Davis, Jr, 
H M P Miles, M H Wilson. 
All members of the audit committee are independent 
non-executive directors. The board considers that the membership 
of the audit committee as a whole has sufficient recent and relevant
financial experience to discharge its functions, but it has determined
not to identify any single member as having such experience. 
The external auditors’ lead partner, the BP general auditor (head of 
internal audit), together with the group chief financial officer, the 
chief accounting officer and the group controller, attend each meeting
at the request of the committee chairman. At least twice a year, the
committee meets with the external auditor without the executive
management being present. The committee also meets in private
session with the general auditor. 
Role and authority The audit committee’s tasks are considered by the
committee to be broader than those envisaged under Combined Code
Provision C.3.2. The committee is satisfied that it addresses each of
those matters identified as properly falling within an audit committee’s
purview. The committee has full delegated authority from the board 
to address those tasks assigned to it. In common with the board 
and all committees, it may request any information from the executive
management necessary to discharge its functions and may, where 
it considers necessary, seek independent advice and counsel. 
Process The committee structures its work programme so as to
discharge its tasks, which include systematic monitoring and obtaining
assurance that the legally required standards of disclosure are being
fully and fairly observed and that the executive limitations relating to
financial matters are being observed. The committee chairman reports
on the committee’s activities to the board meeting immediately
following a committee meeting. Between meetings, the committee
chairman reviews emerging issues with the group chief financial
officer, the external auditor and the BP general auditor. He is 
supported in this task by the company secretary’s office. 
During the year, external specialist legal and regulatory advice has
also been provided to the committee by Sullivan & Cromwell LLP . 
With significant changes in accounting practices being introduced 
in 2005, the committee undertook initial training in the implementation
of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and how these
standards are expected to affect the group’s reported results.
Activities in 2004 Financial reports: During the year, the committee
reviewed all annual and quarterly financial reports before recommending
their publication on behalf of the board. In particular, the committee
discussed significant accounting policies, estimates and judgements
that had been applied in preparing these reports and received
independent advice from the external auditors. 
Accounting treatment: The committee also received during the 
year separate reports concerning the group’s environmental and
decommissioning provisions, tax exposures, pension assumptions 
and the status of current litigation. The committee gained assurance
that such liabilities and contingencies were appropriately reflected 
in the financial results. 
System of internal control: Each year, specific reports on risk
management and internal control within selected business and
functional activities are considered. During 2004, the exploration and
production and petrochemicals segments were reviewed, along with
accounting issues of the supply and trading function that services all
BP’s businesses. Given the increased public and regulatory attention 
to hydrocarbon reserves reporting, the committee sought and received
additional assurance that BP’s management and recording processes
are applied in a consistent and coherent manner throughout the group.
Following the adoption of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, an
increased regulatory requirement has been placed on all companies
that offer shares by listing on US stock exchanges. The committee has
monitored the company’s response to the applicable requirements of
this Act and, in particular, its progress in evaluating internal controls 
as required by rules pursuant to Section 404 of the Act. 
Employee concerns reporting/whistleblowing: The committee receives
regular reports of the matters raised through the employee concerns
programme (OpenTalk) and, through this process, is alerted to
instances of potential fraud or matters of concern raised related 
to the finances and financial accounting policies of the group. 
Auditor independence and rotation: The committee reviews on behalf 
of the board the independence, objectivity and viability of the auditors
before an appointment recommendation is made to shareholders at Governance: board performance report 
114
the AGM. A new lead audit partner is appointed every five years and
other senior audit staff are rotated every seven years.
Policy on non-audit services provided by the auditor: To safeguard 
the independence of the audit process, non-audit services provided 
by the auditor are limited to defined audit-related work and tax services
that fall within specific categories. Additionally, all such services must
be pre-approved by the committee. These services have been
substantially reduced in 2004 but overall fees paid to Ernst & Young
have increased, since audit fees have risen significantly across the
market due to the increased regulatory burden on listed companies
(see page 50 for details).
Internal audit: The committee considers the internal auditor’s
programme and its effectiveness twice a year. It receives regular
reports of work undertaken, actions recommended and the executive
management’s responses to those recommendations. 
Performance evaluation: Each year the committee critically reviews its
own performance and considers where improvements can be made.
During 2004, the committee strengthened its tracking of outstanding
issues and clarified the scope of its role and relationship with that of 
the ethics and environment assurance committee. It also allocated
additional time to training, not least on the implications of the
introduction of IFRS. To accommodate all such matters and discharge
its ongoing tasks the committee increased the number of meetings
from nine in 2003 to 13 in 2004. 
Ethics and environment assurance committee report
Schedule and composition The committee met six times
during 2004 and comprised the following directors: 
Dr W E Massey (chairman), A Burgmans (from October
2004), F A Maljers (to April 2004), H M P Miles, 
M H Wilson. 
All members of the ethics and environment assurance committee are
independent non-executive directors. The external auditors’ lead partner
and the BP general auditor (head of internal audit) attend each meeting
at the request of the committee chairman. The committee met once
during 2004 with the general auditor and external auditor but without
the executive management being present.
Role and authority The task of the committee is to monitor matters
relating to the executive management’s processes to address
environmental, health and safety, security and ethical behaviour issues.
The committee monitors the observance of the executive limitations
relating to non-financial risks to the group. 
Process and activities in 2004  At each meeting, the committee
considered a report from executive management on current
developments in business and functional areas giving rise to ongoing
and emergent non-financial risks to the group’s activities. In particular,
during the course of 2004, the committee directed its attention to 
the BTC pipeline project and operations in Alaska and Russia. The
committee’s work programme also addressed:
Environmental liabilities: Including a review of the group’s approach 
to remediation at operational and disused sites, encompassing 
all businesses ranging from mining activities to oil terminals to 
service stations. 
Health, safety and environmental performance: Greenhouse gas 
and other emissions, spills and containment practices and safety 
at work issues, both group-wide and in specific businesses and
locations (for example, shipping, road safety and the operational
integrity of plant and equipment). 
Security: Group preparedness and mitigation plans in respect of
identified and potential security threats to staff, physical infrastructure
and the digital infrastructure of the group. 
Employees: The results of the annual People Assurance Survey,
employee health and welfare and the impact of HIV/AIDS on our
business. 
Ethical behaviour: Matters arising from the annual ethics certification
process and OpenTalk (BP’s employee concerns reporting programme),
as well as other conduct and compliance issues. 
Disaster recovery and business continuity planning and capability:
Development of the group’s capacity and capability to respond 
to catastrophic events and to maintain its business activities.
Performance evaluation: The committee addressed the nature 
of its remit and authority, its interface with the audit committee 
and the scope and focus of its activities, as well as its overall
effectiveness and refinements to its processes. The committee
increased the number of its meetings from five in 2003 to 
six in 2004. 
Remuneration committee report
Schedule and composition The committee met seven
times during 2004 and comprised the following directors:
Sir Robin Nicholson (chairman, retiring at the 2005 AGM),
Dr D S Julius (chairman elect), E B Davis, C F Knight
(retiring at the 2005 AGM), Sir Ian Prosser, J H Bryan 
(from November 2004), Sir Tom McKillop (from November 2004). 
All members of the remuneration committee are non-executive
directors and are considered by the board to be independent. 
The chairman of the board also attends committee meetings. 
The committee is independently advised.  
Role and authority The committee’s main task is to determine the
terms of engagement and remuneration of the executive directors. 
A key priority for the committee in 2004 has been its review of
executive directors’ remuneration policy in preparation for the 
renewal of the long-term incentive plan for executive directors 
at the 2005 AGM.
Process and activities in 2004 Full details of the committee’s 
remit and work are set out in the remuneration report on pages 
116-125, which is the subject of a vote by shareholders at the
forthcoming AGM.
Chairman’s committee report
Schedule and composition The chairman’s committee 
met three times during 2004 and comprised all the 
non-executive directors.
Role and authority The task of the committee is to consider
broad issues of governance, including the performance of
the chairman and the group chief executive, succession planning, the
organization of the group and any matters referred to it for an opinion
from another board committee. 
Process and activities in 2004 At its various meetings, the committee
evaluated the performance of the chairman and the group chief
executive, considered the plan for executive succession and
considered a number of other broad matters of governance, including
the future governance of the Olefins and Derivatives business as it 
is prepared for its planned disposal. Additionally, the committee
addressed non-executive succession planning issues in co-ordination
with the nomination committee.  BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004

BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
Nomination committee report
Schedule and composition The committee met twice during 2004 
and comprised the following directors: P D Sutherland (chairman), 
Dr W E Massey, Sir Robin Nicholson, Sir Ian Prosser. 
All members of the nomination committee are considered by the 
board to be independent. 
Role and authority The task of the nomination committee is to identify
and evaluate candidates for appointment and reappointment as director
or company secretary of BP . 
Process During the year, the nomination committee carried out 
a detailed review of the skills and expertise of the non-executive
directors as part of the board succession planning described earlier.
The committee receives external assistance as required. The
committee consults with the group chief executive concerning 
the identification and appointment of new executive directors. 
Activities in 2004 The committee considered the composition 
of the board and board committees in the context of forthcoming 
work programmes, BP’s strategy and business activities and
retirements from the board. Board and committee evaluation
processes informed its work in identifying the skills and experiences
sought from potential candidates. 
External search consultants were retained in the UK, continental
Europe and the US to assist the committee in the identification of
potential candidates as non-executive directors. In close co-ordination
with the chairman’s committee (all the non-executive directors), the
nomination committee recommended the appointment of the following
directors during the year: Sir Tom McKillop, I C Conn and D J Flint.
Combined Code compliance
BP complied throughout 2004 with the provisions of the Combined
Code Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice, 
except in the following aspects:
A.4.4 Letters of appointment do not set out fixed time commitments
since the schedule of board and committee meetings is subject to
change according to the exigencies of the business. All directors are
expected to demonstrate their commitment to the work of the board
on an ongoing basis. This is reviewed by the nomination committee 
in recommending candidates for annual re-election.
B.1.4  The amount of fees received by executive directors in respect of
their service on outside boards is not disclosed since this information
is not considered relevant to BP . 
B.2.2 The remuneration of the chairman is fixed by the board as a
whole (rather than by the remuneration committee) within the limits
set by shareholders, since the chairman’s performance is a matter for
the whole board. 
Internal control review
The board governance policies include a process for the board to review
regularly the effectiveness of the system of internal control as required
by Code provision C.2.1. As part of this process, the board, the audit 
and the ethics and environment assurance committees requested,
received and reviewed reports from executive management, including
management of the principal business segments, at their regular
meetings. That enabled them to assess the effectiveness of the system
of internal control in operation for managing significant risks (including
social, environmental and ethical risks) throughout the year. This process
did not extend to joint ventures or associates.
The executive management presented reports to the January 
and February 2005 meetings of both the audit and the ethics and
environment assurance committees to support the board in its annual
assessment of internal control. The reports described how significant
risks were identified and embedded within business segment and
function plans across the group. They reviewed the executive
management’s assurance process and the continuing development 
of the systems of internal controls in place to identify, address and
manage risks. The reports also highlighted future potentially significant
risks to the company’s plans. The two committees engage with
executive management on a regular basis to monitor the management
of these risks. Significant incidents that occurred and management’s
response to them were considered by the committees during the year. 
In the board’s view, the information it received was sufficient to
enable it to review the effectiveness of the company’s system of
internal control in accordance with the Guidance for Directors on
Internal Control (Turnbull).

In disclosing the above interests to the company under the Companies Act 
1985, directors did not distinguish their beneficial and non-beneficial interests.
Executive directors are also deemed to have an interest in such shares 
of the company held from time to time by BP QUEST Company Limited
and The BP Employee Share Ownership Plan (No. 2) to facilitate the operation 
of the company’s option schemes.
No director has any interest in the preference shares or debentures of the
company, or in the shares or loan stock of any subsidiary company. 116
The directors’ remuneration report covers all directors, both executive
and non-executive, and is set out on pages 116-125.
It is divided into two parts. Executive directors’ remuneration is in
the first part, which was prepared by the remuneration committee.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration is in the second part, 
which was prepared by the company secretary on behalf of 
the board.
The report has been approved by the board and signed on its 
behalf by the company secretary. This report is subject to the 
approval of shareholders at the annual general meeting (AGM).
Part 1 – Executive directors’ remuneration
Dear Shareholder 
2004 was a good year. Company results, as explained elsewhere, were excellent and the remuneration committee’s priority on relating pay to
performance is reflected in the annual bonus payments commensurate with this high level of achievement. These and all other aspects of the
executive directors’ remuneration during the year are set out in detail in the committee’s report that follows.
The committee also undertook a comprehensive and independent review of remuneration policy for the executive directors during 2004, 
prior to seeking your approval for the renewal of the long-term incentive plan at this year’s AGM (resolution 23). As part of this review, we
commissioned significant and wide-ranging academic research and sought the views of major shareholders in an effort to consider the fundamental
bases underlying our remuneration policies and practices. The depth and extensive nature of this review have meant that our policy and practices
are underpinned by a strong set of principles, which guide the committee’s(deliberations. Full details of these are set out in the report.
Measures of performance lie at the heart of any performance-based system and we have, with extensive advice and considerable time,
examined different approaches. While there is no perfect measure, we believe the selected quantitative and qualitative measures are the most
appropriate for BP . Given the inherent imperfections of any measure of performance, we also see the use of our judgement as an integral part 
of the process. We recognize that our relationship with you is built on trust, and we are clear that it is important for us to be transparent in our
explanations to you of how we have reached decisions and exercised our discretion.
We have an excellent team of world-class executive directors leading the company. The remuneration decisions we have taken for 2004
appropriately reflect the high level of performance achieved during the year. The policy we have set out for the future should continue to align 
their remuneration with shareholders’ interests as well as to engage them in pursuing long-term shareholder value.
Sir Robin Nicholson Dr D S Julius
Chairman, Remuneration Committee Chairman elect, Remuneration Committee
7 February 2005 
The remuneration committee
Tasks  The committee’s tasks are:
• To determine on behalf of the board the terms of engagement 
and remuneration of the group chief executive and the executive
directors and to report on those to the shareholders.
• To determine on behalf of the board matters of policy over which 
the company has authority relating to the establishment or operation
of the company’s pension scheme of which the executive directors
are members.
• To nominate on behalf of the board any trustees (or directors of
corporate trustees) of such scheme.
• To monitor the policies being applied by the group chief executive 
in remunerating senior executives other than executive directors.
Constitution and operation The committee members are all non-
executive directors. Sir Robin Nicholson (chairman), Mr Davis, Dr Julius,
Mr Knight and Sir Ian Prosser were members of the committee
throughout the year, with Sir Tom McKillop and Mr Bryan joining them
in November 2004. Sir Robin Nicholson and Mr Knight will both be
retiring at the 2005 AGM and Dr Julius will become the committee
chairman. Each member is now subject to annual re-election as a
director of the company. The board considers all committee members 
to be independent (see page 111). They have no personal financial
interest, other than as shareholders, in the committee’s decisions. 
The committee met seven times in the period under review. There 
was a full attendance record, except that Sir Ian Prosser and Mr Knight
were each unable to attend one meeting. Mr Sutherland, as chairman
of the board, has attended all committee meetings. 
The committee is accountable to shareholders through its annual
report on executive directors’ remuneration. It will consider the
outcome of the vote at the AGM on the remuneration report, and 
the views of shareholders will be taken into account by the committee
in its future decisions. The committee values its dialogue with major
shareholders on remuneration matters.
Advice Advice is provided to the committee by the company
secretary’s office, which is independent of executive management 
and reports to the chairman of the board. Mr Aronson, an independent
Directors’ remuneration report BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
117
consultant, is the committee’s secretary and special adviser. 
Advice was also received from Mr Jackson (company secretary) 
and Mrs Martin (senior counsel, company secretary’s office).
The committee also appoints external professional advisers to
provide specialist advice and services on particular remuneration
matters. The independence of advice is subject to annual review. 
In 2004, the committee consulted three independent academics,
Michael Jensen, professor emeritus of Harvard Business School, and
professors Sir Andrew Likierman and James Dow, both of London
Business School, in connection with its fundamental review of
remuneration policy. 
The committee appointed Towers Perrin as its principal external
adviser during 2004. Towers Perrin also provided limited ad hoc
remuneration and benefits advice to parts of the group, mainly
comprising pensions advice in Canada, as well as providing some
market information on pay structures. The committee also appointed
Kepler Associates to advise on performance measurement. Kepler
Associates also provided performance data and limited ad hoc advice
on performance measurement to the group.
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Martin Moore, QC, have 
provided legal advice on specific matters to the committee. 
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer also provided some legal advice,
principally overseas, to subsidiaries in the group.
Ernst & Young, in their capacity as auditors, reviewed the
calculations in respect of financial-based targets that form the 
basis of the performance-related pay for the executive directors. 
They also provided audit, audit-related and taxation services to 
the group.
Lord Browne (group chief executive) was consulted on matters
relating to the other executive directors who report to him and,
together with Dr Allen (group chief of staff), on matters relating 
to the performance of the company. Neither was present when
matters affecting his own remuneration were considered.
Policy on executive directors’ remuneration
A key priority for the committee in 2004 has been its comprehensive
and independent review of all elements of remuneration policy for
executive directors prior to seeking specific shareholder approval 
for renewal of the Executive Directors’ Incentive Plan, which expires 
in 2005. This wide-ranging review sought to address the fundamental
bases of the remuneration policies and plans for the executive
directors. It involved significant academic research as well as 
seeking the views of plan participants, major shareholders and
professional advisers. The committee focused on seeking to ensure
that, in determining remuneration policy, there is a clear link between
the company’s purpose, the business plans and executive reward.
As part of its review, the committee developed the following key
principles to guide its policy:
• Policy for the remuneration of executive directors shall be 
determined and regularly reviewed independently of executive
management and will set the tone for the remuneration of other
senior executives.
• The remuneration structure shall support and reflect BP’s stated
purpose to maximize long-term shareholder value.
• The remuneration structure shall reflect a just system of rewards 
for the participants.
• The overall quantum of all potential remuneration components 
shall be determined by the exercise of informed judgement of 
the independent remuneration committee, taking into account 
the success of BP and the competitive global market.
• The majority of the remuneration shall be linked to the achievement
of demanding performance targets that are independently set and
reflect the creation of long-term shareholder value.
• Assessment of performance shall be quantitative and qualitative 
and shall include exercise of informed judgement by the
remuneration committee within a framework that takes account 
of sector characteristics and is approved by shareholders.
• The committee shall be proactive in obtaining an understanding 
of shareholder preferences.
• Remuneration policy and practices shall be as transparent as
possible both for participants and shareholders.
Key policy decisions The committee then reviewed the existing
remuneration policies and plans against these principles and made 
the following key policy decisions:
• The overall quantum of remuneration and the general balance
between short-term and long-term elements are to be maintained.
• Salary levels will continue to be reviewed regularly by reference 
to those in Europe-based top global companies and the US oil 
and gas sector applying the committee’s judgement.
• The long-term incentives framework of the existing Executive
Directors’ Incentive Plan (EDIP) remains sound, although some
changes to policy and application are now appropriate. Specific
shareholder approval is being sought for renewal of the EDIP 
for a further five years.
• The share element of the EDIP will provide the long-term
performance-based component of the executive directors’
remuneration package. There is no current intention to make 
further share options grants. 
• The majority of the value previously attributed to share options 
is to be redistributed to the share element, with the remainder 
going to the annual bonus. 
• The measure of long-term performance for the share element 
will be relative total shareholder return (TSR) compared with the
other oil majors over three-year periods, with underlying relative
performance also being assessed by the committee. 
• A proportion of the share element for the current group chief
executive will be based on long-term personal leadership 
measures.
• To simplify the operation of the EDIP and increase transparency, 
the share element will use performance shares rather than the
current performance units and multiples.
• The performance shares will accrue dividends during the
performance period.
• The current shareholding requirement for executive directors 
is to be maintained at 5 x the director’s base salary, to ensure
alignment of their interests with those of shareholders.
• The current pension approach based on national policies is to 
be maintained. 
• The wider scene, including pay and employment conditions
elsewhere in the group, will be taken into account, especially 
when determining annual salary increases.
Elements of remuneration The executive directors’ total remuneration
will continue to consist of salary, annual bonus, long-term incentives,
pensions and other benefits. This reward structure will be regularly
reviewed by the committee to ensure that it is achieving its objectives.
In 2005, over three-quarters of executive directors’ potential direct
remuneration will again be performance-related (see illustrative chart
on page 118). Directors’ remuneration report
118
This chart reflects on-target values for annual bonus and share element.
Salary The committee expects to review salaries in 2005. In doing 
so, the committee considers both Europe-based top global companies 
and the US oil and gas sector; each of these groups is defined and
analysed by the committee’s independent external remuneration
advisers. The committee then assesses the market information 
and advice and applies its judgement in setting the salary levels. 
Annual bonus Each executive director is eligible to participate in an
annual performance-based bonus scheme. The committee reviews 
and sets bonus targets and levels of eligibility annually. 
For 2005, the target level will be increased from 100% to 120% 
of base salary (except for Lord Browne, for whom, as group chief
executive, it is considered appropriate to increase his target from
110% to 130%). These increases reflect part of the value previously
attributed to the share option element of their remuneration packages.
In normal circumstances, the maximum payment level for substantially
exceeding targets will continue to be 150% (165% for the group chief
executive) of base salary. In exceptional circumstances, outstanding
performance may be recognized by bonus payments moderately in
excess of the 150% (and 165%) levels at the discretion of the
remuneration committee. Similarly, bonuses may be reduced where 
the committee considers that this is warranted and, in exceptional
circumstances, bonuses can be reduced to zero. 
The committee recognizes that it is responsible to shareholders 
to use its discretion in a reasonable and informed manner in the best
interests of the company and that it has a corresponding duty to be
accountable and transparent as to the manner in which it exercises 
its discretion. The committee will explain any significant exercise of
discretion in the subsequent directors’ remuneration report. 
The key aim of the revised annual bonus is to ensure that it is
closely tied to the annual business plan and that it reflects short-term
deliverables towards the creation of long-term shareholder value.
Executive directors’ annual bonus awards for 2005 will be based on
a mix of demanding financial targets, based on the company’s annual
plan and leadership objectives established at the beginning of the year,
in accordance with the following weightings:
• 50% financial measures from the annual plan principally on 
cash flow.
• 30% annual strategic metrics and milestones taken from the 
five-year group business plan. There is a wide range of measures,
including those relating to people, safety, environment, technology
and organization, as well as operational actions and business

On-target remuneration elements
Base salary
Performance-related annual bonus
Performance-related share element
In assessing the final outcome of the individual bonuses each year, 
the committee will also carefully review the underlying performance 
of the group in the context of the five-year group business plan, as well
as looking at competitor results, analysts’ reports and the views from
the chairmen of other BP board committees. All the calculations are
reviewed by the auditors.
Long-term incentives Long-term incentives will continue to be
provided under the EDIP . It will continue to have within its framework
three elements: a share element, a share option element and a cash
element. The committee does not currently intend to use either the
share option or cash elements but, in exceptional circumstances, 
may do so.
Each executive director participates in the EDIP . The committee’ s
policy, subject to unforeseen circumstances, is that this should
continue until the EDIP expires or is renewed in 2010. 
The committee’s policy continues to be that each executive director
should hold shares equivalent in value to 5 x the director’s base salary
within five years of being appointed an executive director. This policy 
is reflected in the terms of the EDIP , as shares awarded under the
share element will only be released at the end of the three-year
retention period (as described below) if the minimum shareholding
guidelines have been met.
1. Share element  The committee may make conditional share 
awards (performance shares) to executive directors, which will 
only vest to the extent that a demanding performance condition
imposed by the committee is met at the end of a three-year
performance period. As explained above, for 2005 and future 
years, the committee currently intends that the share element alone
will provide the long-term performance-based component of the
executive directors’ package, and award levels have been adjusted 
to reflect this. 
Share element awards have been made in 2001 to 2004 inclusive
using performance units that may convert into ordinary shares at a
ratio of up to two shares for each performance unit (full details of
which are set out on page 123). To simplify the operation of the plan
and increase transparency, the award of performance shares will, 
for 2005 and future years, replace performance units. Vesting of
performance shares will be at a maximum ratio of one-for-one. 
This change will not increase the value of the award levels or 
make performance conditions easier to achieve. 
The maximum number of performance shares that may be 
awarded to an executive director in any one year will be determined 
at the discretion of the remuneration committee and will not normally 
exceed 5.5 x base salary and, in the case of the group chief executive,
7.5 x base salary. 
In addition to the performance condition described below, 
the committee will have an overriding discretion, in exceptional
circumstances, to reduce the number of shares which vest (or 
to provide that no shares vest). 
The shares which vest will normally be subject to a compulsory
retention period determined by the committee, which will not normally
be less than three years. This gives executive directors a six-year
incentive structure, and is designed to ensure that their interests are
aligned with those of shareholders. Where shares ~est under awards
made in 2005 and future years, the executive director will receive
additional shares representing the value of reinvested dividends 
on these shares. BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
119
For share element awards in 2005, the performance condition 
will relate to BP’s total shareholder return (TSR) performance against
the other oil majors (ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and ChevronTexaco) 
over a three-year period. TSR is calculated by taking the share price
performance of a company over the period, assuming dividends 
to be reinvested in the company’s shares. All share prices will be
averaged over the three months before the beginning and end of 
the performance period and will be measured in US dollars. At the 
end of the performance period, the TSR performance of each of 
the companies will be ranked to establish the relative total return 
to shareholders over the period. Shares under the award will vest 
as to 100%, 70% and 35% if BP achieves first, second or third place
respectively; no shares will vest if BP achieves fourth or fifth place. 
Extensive research was independently commissioned by the 
committee into alternative measures of business performance. After
careful review of the studies, the committee is satisfied that relative 
TSR is the most appropriate measure of performance for BP’s long-
term incentives for executive directors as it best reflects the creation
of long-term shareholder value. Relative performance of the peer group
is particularly key in order to minimize the influence of sector-specific 
effects, including oil price. 
The committee is convinced that this comparator group, while 
small, has the distinct advantage of being very clearly comprised 
of BP’s global competitors. Consultation with major shareholders
confirmed that this is the group already used by most of them, as 
well as by management, in assessing BP’s comparative performance.
The committee will have the discretion to amend this peer group in
appropriate circumstances, for example, in the case of any significant
consolidations in the industry. 
The committee is mindful of the possibility that a simple ranking
system may in some circumstances give rise to distorted results in
view of the broad similarity of the oil majors’ underlying businesses,
the small size of the comparator group and inherent imperfections 
in measurement. To counter this, the committee will have the ability 
to exercise discretion in a reasonable and informed manner to adjust
(upwards or downwards) the vesting level derived from the ranking 
if it considers that the ranking does not fairly reflect BP’s underlying
business performance relative to the comparator group.
The exercise of this discretion would be made after a broad analysis
of the underlying health of BP’s business relative to competitors, as
shown by a range of other measures including, but not limited to,
return on average capital employed, earnings per share growth,
reserves replacement and cash flow. This will enable a more
comprehensive review of long-term performance, with the aims of
tempering anomalies created by relying solely on a formula-based
approach and ensuring that the objectives of the plan are met. 
It is anticipated that the need to use discretion is most likely to 
arise where the TSR performance of some companies is clustered, 
so that a relatively small difference in TSR performance would 
produce a major difference in vesting levels. In these circumstances,
the committee will have power to adjust the vesting level, normally

by determining an average vesting level for the companies affected 
by the clustering. 
In line with its policy on transparency, the committee will explain 
any adjustment to the relative TSR ranking in the next directors’
remuneration report following the vesting. 
The committee may amend the performance conditions if events
occur that would make the amended conDition a fairer measure of
performance and provided that any amended condition is no easier 
to satisfy.
For 2005, all executive directors will receive performance share
awards on the above basis, over a maximum number of shares set by
reference to 5.5 x base salary. For awards under the share element in
future years, the committee may continue with the same performance
condition, or may impose a different condition which it considers to be
no less demanding. 
As group chief executive, Lord Browne is eligible for performance
share awards of up to 7.5 x base salary. The committee has
determined that, while the largest part of this should relate to 
the TSR measure described above, it is appropriate that a specific 
part (up to 2 x base salary) should be based on long-term leadership
measures. These will focus on sustaining BP’s financial, strategic 
and organizational health and will include, but not be limited to,
maintenance of BP’s performance culture and the continued
development of BP’s business strategy, executive talent and internal
organization. As with the TSR part of his award, this part will be
measured over three-year performance periods. 
Share element awards made in previous years
For outstanding awards of performance units made under the plans 
for the periods 2002-2004, 2003-2005 and 2004-2006, the existing
performance conditions will apply for the three-year performance
periods in each of the plans. The primary measure is BP’s shareholder
return against the market (SHRAM), which accounts for nearly two-
thirds of the potential total award, the remainder being assessed on
BP’s relative return on average capital employed (ROACE) and earnings
per share growth (EPS). 
BP’s SHRAM is measured against the companies in the FTSE 
All World Oil & Gas Index. Companies within the index are weighted
according to their market capitalization at the beginning of each 
three-year period in order to give greatest emphasis to oil majors. 
BP’s ROACE and EPS growth are measured against ExxonMobil, 
Shell, Total and ChevronTexaco. All calculations are reviewed by the
auditors to ensure that they meet an independent objective standard.
The relative position of the company within the comparator group
determines the number of shares awarded per performance unit,
subject to a maximum of two shares per unit. 
2. Share option element The share option element of the EDIP 
permits options to be granted to executive directors at an exercise
price no lower than the market value of a share at the date the 
option is granted. The committee does not currently intend to use 
this element.
3. Cash element The cash element allows the committee to grant 
long-term cash-based incentives. This element was not used during 
the first five years of the EDIP and the committee would only do 
so in special circumstances. 
Pensions Executive directors are eligible to participate in the
appropriate pension schemes applying in their home countries.  Directors’ remuneration report
120
UK directors UK directors are members of the regular BP Pension 
Scheme. Scheme members’ core benefits are non-contributory. 
They include a pension accrual of 1/60th of basic salary for each year 
of service, subject to a maximum of two-thirds of final basic salary;
and a dependant’s benefit of two-thirds of the member’s pension.
Bonuses are not pensionable for UK directors. The scheme pension 
is not integrated with state pension benefits.
Normal retirement age is 60, but scheme members who have 30 
or more years’ pensionable service at age 55 can elect to retire early
without an actuarial reduction being applied to their pension.
In accordance with the company’s past practice for executive
directors who retire from BP on or after age 55 having accrued at 
least 30 years’ service, Lord Browne remains eligible for consideration
for a payment from the company of an ex-gratia lump-sum
superannuation payment equal to one year’s base salary following 
his retirement. All matters relating to such superannuation payments
are considered by the remuneration committee. Any such payment
would be additional to his pension entitlements referred to above. 
No other executive director is eligible for consideration for a
superannuation payment on retirement, as the remuneration
committee decided in 1996 that appointees to the board after 
that time should cease to be eligible for consideration for such 
a payment. 
The UK government has announced important proposals on pensions,
the impact of which will be reviewed further by the committee in 2005
in conjunction with studies being carried out by the company into the
wider effects of the new legislation for employees. The intention is that
the approach to the new legislation should be consistent for directors
and other employees. The committee will report further on the outcome
of these studies in the next remuneration report.
US director Dr Grote as a US director participates in the US BP
Retirement Accumulation Plan (US plan), which features a cash 
balance formula. The current design of the US plan became effective
on 1 July 2000.
Consistent with US tax regulations, pension benefits are provided
through a combination of tax-qualified and non-qualified benefit
restoration plans, as applicable.
The Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefit (supplemental 
plan) is a non-qualified top-up arrangement that became effective 
on 1 January 2002 for US employees above a specified salary level. 
The benefit formula is 1.3% of final average earnings, which
comprise base salary and bonus in accordance with standard US
practice (as specified under the qualified arrangement) multiplied 
by years of service, with an offset for benefits payable under all other 
BP qualified and non-qualified pension arrangements. This benefit is
unfunded and therefore paid from corporate assets. 
Dr Grote is an eligible participant under the supplemental plan, 
and his pension accrual for 2004 includes the total amount that 
may become payable under all plans.
Other benefits
• Benefits and other share schemes: Executive directors are eligible 
to participate in regular employee benefit plans and in all-employee
share schemes and savings plans applying in their home countries.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
• Resettlement allowance: Expatriates may receive a resettlement
allowance for a limited period.

R L Olver 31 December 1997
The committee’s policy is for service contracts to expire at normal
retirement date and have a notice period of one year. All contracts
comply with this. 
The service contracts of Dr Allen, Dr Hayward, Mr Manzoni and 
Mr Conn may also be terminated by the company at any time with
immediate effect on payment in lieu of notice equivalent to one year’s
salary or the amount of salary that would have been paid if the contract
had terminated on the expiry of the remainder of the notice period.
Dr Grote’s service contract is with BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. 
He is seconded to BP p.l.c. under a secondment agreement dated 
7 August 2000 that had an unexpired term of three years at
31 December 2004. The secondment may be terminated by one
month’s notice by either party and terminates automatically on the
termination of Dr Grote’s service contract. 
There are no other provisions for compensation payable on early
termination of the above contracts. In the event of early termination
under any of the above contracts by the company other than for 
cause (or under a specific termination payment provision), the relevant
director’s then current salary and benefits would be taken into account
in calculating any liability of the company. 
Since January 2003, the committee has included a provision in 
new service contracts to allow for severance payments to be phased,
where appropriate to do so. It will also consider mitigation to reduce
compensation to a departing director, where appropriate to do so.

This chart reflects the average mix of total remuneration received by
executive directors in 2004 and includes actual salary, bonus and share

Salary Following a review of appropriate comparator groups of 
Europe-based top global companies and the US oil and gas sector,
base salaries for Lord Browne, Dr Allen, Dr Hayward and Mr Manzoni
were increased by 5% per annum with effect from 1 July 2004. 
On his appointment to the board in 2004, Mr Conn’s salary was
determined by reference to the same comparator groups.
In deciding upon these new salary levels the committee applied 
its judgement, taking into account the modest market movements 
in Europe and the US and the fact that no salary increases had been

since that time.
Dr Grote’s salary was increased in the context of the comparative
market information by approximately 15% with effect from 1 July 2004
to reflect his expanded senior role following the retirement of Mr Olver. 
Annual bonus Fifty per cent of the annual bonus awards for 2004 is
based on a mix of financial targets (primarily cash from operations) and
50% is based on long-run metrics and wide-ranging milestones that
drive performance improvement and measure the continuing delivery
of strategy (including production and sales levels, efficiency, cost
management, business development, project delivery and technology
progress). All the targets were established at the beginning of the year
by the remuneration committee. 2004 was an extremely good year.
The group met or exceeded its annual plan in all material respects. The
primary financial target, cash from operations, was exceeded. All the
key metrics and milestones were delivered, along with some notable
successes in relation to Russia and exploration in Egypt and the Gulf 
of Mexico. Assessment of all the results, including those on people,
safety, environment and organization, resulted in awards of 150% of
salary for the executive directors. The committee determined that, given
the year's excellent performance, it was appropriate that Lord Browne
receive 165% of salary, reflecting his higher bonus target level. All
calculations have been reviewed by the auditors.

thE ranking of the company’s TSR against the TSR of the FTSE Global 100 group of companies over the three-year period prior to the grant.
BPA = BP Amoco share option plan, which applied to US executive directors prior to the adoption of the EDIP .
SAR = Stock Appreciation Rights under BP America Inc. Share Appreciation Plan. In keeping with the US market practice, none of the options under the BPA and 
SAR is subject to performance conditions because they were granted under American plans to the relevant individuals.
SAYE = Save As You Earn employee share option scheme. These options are not subject to performance conditions because this is an all-employee share scheme
governed by specific tax legislation.

Share element of EDIP and Long T erm Performance Plans (LTPPs) 
Under the share element of the EDIP and the Long Term Performance
Plans, performance units were granted at the beginning of the three-
year period and converted into an award of shares at the end of the
period, depending on performance. There is a maximum of two shares
per performance unit. For 2005 and future years, a different grant
mechanism will apply (as described on page 118). 
For the 2002-2004 share element of the EDIP and the LTPPs, BP’s
performance was assessed in terms of SHRAM, ROACE and EPS
growth. BP’s three-year SHRAM was measured against the companies
in the FTSE All World Oil & Gas Index. Companies within the index 
are weighted according to their market capitalization at the beginning
of each three-year period in order to give greatest emphasis to oil
majors. BP’s ROACE and EPS were measured against ExxonMobil,
Shell, Total and ChevronTexaco. Based on a performance assessment
of 75 points out of 200 (0 for SHRAM, 50 for ROACE and 25 for EPS
growth), the committee expects to make awards of shares to executive
directors as highlighted in the 2002-2004 lines of the table below.

Dr Allen, Dr Hayward and Mr Manzoni continue to have performance units for the performance periods 2001-2003 and 2002-2004 granted under LTPPs, 
and Mr Conn for the periods 2001-2003 to 2004-2006 inclusive. They are not required to relinquish these rights, which were granted prior to their appointments 
as executive directors. All other units were granted under the EDIP as explained on pages 118-119. BP’s performance is assessed against the oil sector. 
For 1998-2000, BP’s SHRAM was measured against ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and ChevronTexaco. For 2001-2003, BP’s SHRAM, ROACE and EPS growth 
were measured against ExxonMobil, Shell, Total, ChevronTexaco, ENI and Repsol. For 2004-2006, BP’s SHRAM is measured against companies in the 
All World Oil & Gas Index and BP’s ROACE and EPS growth against ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and ChevronTexaco. Each performance period ends on 
31 December of the third year.

and chairman of the audit committee of the joint venture company,

Part 2 – Non-executive directors’ remuneration
Policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration
The board sets the level of remuneration for all non-executive directors
within the limit approved from time to time by shareholders. In line
with BP’s governance policies, by the remuneration of the chairman is 
set by the board rather than by the remuneration committee, since the
performance of the chairman is a matter for the board as a whole
rather than any one committee.
The board has adopted the following policies to guide its current 
and future decision-making with regard to non-executive directors’
remuneration.
• Within the limits set by the shareholders from time to time,
remuneration should be sufficient to attract, motivate and 
retain world-class non-executive talent. 
• Remuneration of non-executive directors is set by the board and
should be proportional to their contribution towards the interests 
of the company.
• Remuneration practice should be consistent with recognized 
best-practice standards for non-executive directors’ remuneration.
• Remuneration should be in the form of cash fees, payable monthly.
• Non-executive directors should not receive share options from 
the company. 
• Non-executive directors should be encouraged to establish 
a holding in BP shares broadly related to one year’s base fee, 
to be held directly or indirectly in a manner compatible with 
their personal investment activities, and any applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements.
Elements of remuneration
Non-executive directors’ pay comprises cash fees, paid monthly, 
with increments for positions of additional responsibility, reflecting
additional workload and consequent potential liability. For all non-
executive directors, except the chairman, a fixed sum allowance 
is paid for transatlantic travel undertaken for the purpose of 
attending a board or board committee meeting. In addition, non-
executive directors receive reimbursement of reasonable travel 
and related business expenses. No share or share option awards 
are made to any non-executive director in respect of service on 
the board. 
Letters of appointment
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment, which recognize
that, subject to the Articles of Association, their service is at the
discretion of the shareholders. All directors stand for re-election 
at each annual general meeting. 
Mr Chase’s consultancy to BP in relation to the TNK-BP transaction
ended in May 2004 and he left the board of TNK-BP Limited in March
2004. Under the consultancy agreement, he received $250,000 in 
2004 and as a director, deputy chairman and chairman of the audit
committee of TNK-BP Limited he received $30,000 in fees from 
that company.
Long-term awards for both former directors of BP p.l.c. are 
in accordance with scheme rules and are outlined in the table on 
page 123. BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
125
Non-executive directors’ annual fee structure 
The fees paid to non-executive directors are set by the board within the
limit set by shareholders in accordance with the Articles. Shareholders
approved an increase to this limit at the 2004 AGM. All fees are fixed
and paid in pounds sterling. Fees payable to non-executive directors
were last adjusted during 2002.

Amoco Non-Employee Directors’ Restricted Stock Plan
Non-executive directors of Amoco Corporation were allocated
restricted stock in the Amoco Non-Employee Directors’ Restricted
Stock Plan by way of remuneration for their service on the board of
Amoco Corporation prior to its merger with BP in 1998. On merger,
interests in Amoco shares in the plan were converted into interests
in BP ADSs. Under the terms of the plan, the restricted stock will vest
upon the retirement of the non-executive director having reached age
70 or upon earlier retirement at the discretion of the board. Since the
merger, no further entitlements have accrued to any director under the
plan. These residual interests require disclosure under the directors’
remuneration report regulations 2002 as interests in a long-term
incentive scheme.

b
For the purposes of the regulations, the date on which the director retires
from the board at or after the age of 70 is the end of the qualifying period. 
If the director retires prior to this date, the board may waive the restrictions.
c
Mr Maljers retired from the board on 15 April 2004 and, in accordance with
the terms of the plan, his awards vested on that date (when the BP ADS
closing price was $54.16) without payment by him. These awards over 
BP ADSs derived from awards over Amoco shares granted between 
26 April 1994 and 28 April 1998. The awards were granted over Amoco 
stock prior to the merger but their notional weighted average market 
value at the date of grant (applying the subsequent merger ratio of 
0.66167 of a BP ADS for every Amoco share) was $27.87 per BP ADS. 
Superannuation gratuities
In accordance with the company’s long-standing practice, non-
executive directors who retire from the board after at least six years’
service are, at the time of their retirement, eligible for consideration 
for a superannuation gratuity. The board is authorized to make such
payments under the company’s Articles. The amount of the payment 
is determined at the board’s discretion (having regard to the director’s
period of service as a director and other relevant factors). 
In 2002, the board revised its policy with respect to such payments
so that: (i) non-executive directors appointed to the board after 1 July
2002 would not be eligible for consideration for such a payment; and 
(ii) while non-executive directors in service at 1 July 2002 would remain
eligible for consideration for a payment, service after that date would
not be taken into account by the board in considering the amount of
any such payment. 
The board made no superannuation gratuity payments during 
the year. 
This directors’ remuneration report was approved by the board 
and signed on its behalf by David J Jackson, company secretary, 
on 7 February 2005. 126

June, September and December. Holders of ordinary shares receive
their dividends in pounds sterling; holders of American depositary
shares (ADSs) receive their dividends in US dollars. One ADS

C11869_BPARev_2004_Covers.qxd  18/2/05  12:45 pm  Page 2 In mapping the future of BP , we began with a
business purpose – a strategy, a set of assets and
market positions that gave us scope, scale and
potential as a leader in our industry. Today, this
model describes us well – but not completely. 
Now our strategy is being driven further, by a belief
that everything we do can – and should – be done
better. Our people put this principle of operational
excellence to work every day throughout BP . 
You can see it in the ways we aim to use resources
efficiently to deliver sustainable production;
confidently act first in a complex marketplace; 
focus on the most meaningful markets; fulfil our
customers’ needs; learn from our best practices; 
and lead by example. All to perform reliably and
responsibly on behalf of our shareholders worldwide. 
At BP , this is how we’re making the right choices. 2
These tables and charts show the highlights of BP’s achievements
in 2004. They reflect more than our financial performance. Our
strong profitability has allowed us to increase the dividend year on
year, and we are continuing to invest in the future. Environmental
and safety performance remains a key focus. We continue to
make significant financial commitments in the communities in
which we operate.
In this Review, BP presents pro forma results in addition to
its reported results, to enable shareholders to evaluate better
our performance against that of our competitors. The pro forma
result is replacement cost profit excluding acquisition amortization
as defined in footnote 
b
to the reconciliation table (below). 
Both the pro forma result and replacement cost profit include
exceptional items and non-operating items as defined in 
footnote 
a
to the reconciliation table (below). The pro forma 
result has been derived from our UK GAAP accounting
information but is not in itself a recognized UK or US GAAP
measure. BP will discontinue pro forma reporting at the time it
adopts International Financial Reporting Standards with effect
from the first quarter of 2005. References within BP Annual
Review 2004 to ‘result’ are to pro forma results. References to
‘capital employed’, ‘operating capital employed’ and ‘net debt
plus equity’ are to these measures on a pro forma basis that
excludes the fixed asset revaluation adjustment and goodwill
consequent upon the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) and
Burmah Castrol acquisitions in 2000. ‘Return’, ‘return on
average capital employed’ and the ‘net debt ratio’ (net debt/net
debt plus equity) refer to ratios calculated using these measures.
The financial information for 2003 has been restated to reflect
(a) the transfer of natural gas liquids (NGLs) operations from
the Exploration and Production segment to Gas, Power and
Renewables on 1 January 2004; (b) the adoption by the group
of Financial Reporting Standard No. 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’
(FRS 17) with effect from 1 January 2004; and (c) the adoption
by the group of Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract No. 38
‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’ with effect from 1 January 2004.

Replacement cost profit for the period includes the net profit or loss on the sale of fixed assets and businesses or termination of operations. It also includes non-
operating items identified by the group, primarily asset write-downs/impairment, environmental and other provisions and restructuring, integration and rationalization
costs. These items do not meet the criteria to be classified as operating exceptional items.
b
Acquisition amortization refers to depreciation relating to the fixed asset revaluation adjustment and amortization of goodwill consequent upon the ARCO and Burmah
Castrol acquisitions. The results for 2003 and 2004 include accelerated depreciation of the revaluation adjustment in respect of the impairment of former ARCO assets
of $381 million and $214 million, respectively. BP Annual Review 2004

Chairman’s letter
Dear Shareholder  BP has delivered another excellent set of
results for the year. Sustained high oil and gas prices, coupled
with advances in operational performance, have resulted in 
a strong cash flow, accelerating our returns to shareholders 
in the near term through significant share repurchases.
Returning cash in excess of our investment requirements to
our shareholders – both through buybacks and our continued
pursuit of a progressive dividend policy – is fundamental to 
our strategy. 
Exchange-rate issues – especially the relative weakness 
of the dollar in the past year – have been felt by those who
receive their dividends in sterling. Over the longer term,
fluctuating exchange rates generally benefit shareholders 
on each side of the Atlantic at different times. For instance, 
in the five-year period from 1996 to 2001, the sterling dividend
rose by 58%. The rationale for declaring our dividend in US
dollars remains sound, since our principal businesses all trade
in that currency. While headline increases in sterling and dollar
dividends show a differential, the key element to note is that
both are growing.
2004 has seen a rapid acceleration of our buyback programme,
with $7.5 billion worth of shares bought back and cancelled
during the year. While this has been welcomed by larger 
and institutional investors, the benefit for all shareholders
committed to long-term investment in BP will be felt through
the ultimate capital appreciation of their shares. The board
keeps its strategy in this area under review to ensure the
balance between dividend and buybacks remains appropriate
for our owners as a whole.
Against this background, our confidence in the future 
of the business enables us to make a step change in the 
fourth-quarter dividend, which I am pleased to confirm 
as 8.50 cents per share. This makes the annual payment 
29.45 cents per share or 16.099 pence per share, an increase
in dollar terms over last year of 13% and an increase of 4% 
in sterling terms. 
2004 saw heightened regulatory attention on our industry, 
not least in the area of the reporting of hydrocarbon reserves.
Reserves reporting is an important measure of our
performance as it demonstrates the extent to which we are
replacing the hydrocarbons we are producing – a particular
strength of BP in recent years. As a UK company, our reserves
are estimated in accordance with UK accounting practice.
These reserves are stated each year in our Annual Report. 
For US regulatory purposes we report reserves estimates 
in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. During the course of the year, the board and 
its audit committee have exercised considerable scrutiny in 
this area. In this year’s full Annual Report, we have included, 
for the first time, US SEC-based estimates in addition to our 
UK reserves bookings. 
Our business is global and complex, and we are fortunate 
to have a first-rate executive team to address these challenges.
During the year, the executive management team, so ably 
led by John Browne, has sustained its formidable track record.
They have our full confidence and support. I would like to thank
John and his team for their exemplary efforts on your behalf 
in 2004. Our thanks are also due to all 102,900 BP employees BP Annual Review 2004
5
around the world for their unremitting effort and the value they
have created for our shareholders. 
Within a company with such a strong executive management
team, it is important that the role of the board is understood. As
a board, we are conscious that we oversee the activities of the
business in the interests of all our owners. The recent debate
on corporate governance has focused on the mechanisms of
board process and reporting – ensuring appropriate checks 
and balances are in place. Against this background, too many
company directors have complained that they want to ‘move
away from corporate governance’ and ‘get back to running 
our businesses’. 
Correctly, I think, our board recognizes that the primary
business of the board is corporate governance. Governing 
BP is not a matter to be driven solely by compliance concerns,
but by the business purpose of the company you entrust us 
to govern on your behalf. Our role as a board therefore focuses
on ensuring your interests are promoted and that our business
maximizes long-term value for you, our owners. 
Ensuring that our business remains nimble and competitive,
able to leverage the manifold talents of our managers, is key 
to the pursuit of that goal. To discharge the trust you place in
us as a board, we test the strategic direction of the company’s
business. We also monitor the operations of the business in
pursuit of that strategy to ensure both that BP’s activities live
out the values we set and also, critically, that shareholder value
lies at the heart of all we do. 
2004 saw a continuation of our very significant capital
investment programme that is key to the long-term future 
of our business. As a board, we continue to scrutinize the
strategic direction of the company, especially as our activities
take us to more challenging geographic locations, to ensure
that it continues to provide the prospect of the best long-term
returns for our shareholders.
In the course of the year, significant work has been
undertaken by the chairman’s committee and the nomination
committee, both of which I chair, as issues of executive and
non-executive succession planning and performance come 
into ever-greater focus. Likewise the remuneration committee,
led by Sir Robin Nicholson and his designated successor 
Dr DeAnne Julius, has been heavily engaged in the development
of new incentive plans for our executive directors. 
The summary board performance report on pages 38-39
expands upon the way in which the board and its committees
discharge their mandate of governance. 
Last year, I commented on board succession and
development planning for the coming years. At the forthcoming
AGM, two of our senior non-executive directors, Sir Robin
Nicholson and Charles (Chuck) Knight, will step down.
Robin has served on the BP board since 1987 and has
been an excellent chairman of our remuneration committee.
He has had a substantial impact on the board and the company
over the past 17 years and been a major contributor to all
our board debates; we shall miss his wisdom and insight.
On a personal note, I shall miss his sage counsel and technical
insight, but am delighted that he has agreed to continue to
chair the group’s technology advisory committee in the
short term.
Chuck Knight also joined the board in 1987. His perspective
on corporate practices in the United States and experience 
as a senior chief executive operating within the US market
have proved invaluable, not least as BP has evolved in that
marketplace over the past two decades. I will miss his unique
contributions to the board’s discussions. 
I would like to thank both Robin and Chuck on your behalf 
for all their years of distinguished service.
The endorsement of the strength of our executive team 
by the invitation extended to Dick Olver to take on the
chairmanship of BAE Systems plc was, of course, tinged 
with sadness at having to bid farewell to a first-rate colleague,
who had served the company so well over the past 31 years.
We wish Dick well for the future and thank him for his years 
of dedicated service to BP .
Three new appointments have been made to the board 
in the last year. Iain Conn has been appointed an executive
director. Iain has had a substantial career within BP and is
responsible for strategic resources. Sir Tom McKillop, chief
executive of AstraZeneca PLC, joined the board in July 2004 
and Douglas Flint, chief financial officer of HSBC Holdings plc,
joined in January 2005. Each brings his own particular skills 
and experience to complement those of his fellow directors 
in the coming years. 
The world in which BP operates is ever more complex 
and challenging. The coming year will see the continued
development of our business strategy. I believe your board is
well resourced to address shareholders’ interests during this
period. I look forward to reporting on their successful advance
in the years ahead. We have an exciting future together. 
Thank you for all your continued support and interest in 
this company.

Group chief executive’s review
Dear Shareholder 2004 was a great year for BP . In terms of
overall performance, it was the best since the recent series 
of mergers and acquisitions. 
High demand for energy and higher oil prices certainly
contributed to our performance and led to our record financial
results. But our success in 2004 was based on more than
these external factors. 
We showed that we had the capability to deliver our strategy
and to translate our scope and scale into competitive advantage.
We demonstrated that we had the human talent to increase
production, make new discoveries, gain new customers,
enhance safety and grow our reputation. Our global workforce
worked as a seamless team and I thank every one of them. 
As you read this Annual Review and follow our efforts to
create value, it may be helpful to understand how we achieve
excellent performance. 
Our purpose and strategy We begin with our purpose as a
group – to provide better goods and services in the form 
of light, heat, power and mobility to increasing numbers of
people. To succeed, we do this in a way that is profitable,
sustainable and consistent. This is reflected in value generated
for shareholders. 
To deliver profitable performance, we provide high-quality
products in a competitive way – maximizing revenues and
minimizing costs. 
To deliver sustainable performance, we also provide these
products in a sustainable way – attracting the best people,
accessing large-scale oil and gas resources, building markets 
in which we enjoy customers’ trust while doing business in a
mutually advantageous way that brings benefits to everyone
concerned – customers, communities, governments, suppliers,
citizens – and so generates ‘repeat business’. 
To deliver consistent performance, we invest enough to
deliver long-term growth, while balancing this with returns 
to our shareholders. Too fast a growth rate is unsustainable,
while too slow a rate sacrifices competitive advantage. Our
analysis gives us confidence that an investment level of around
$14 billion is right for 2005 and 2006, taking into account the
present level of the dollar and recent sector-specific inflation. 
To achieve our purpose, we have a strategy. We make
choices about the assets and markets where we operate. 
Our business strategy remains unchanged. In Exploration
and Production, we seek out long-term assets – the largest,
low-cost, new hydrocarbon deposits – while managing the
decline of mature fields. In our customer-facing businesses, 
we look to attract more and more customers through improved
quality of products and service. Our challenge is to add new
sources of cash flow whose cash returns are at least as good
as existing ones. 
2004 in context  As I wrote last year, we started 2004 with
greater scale, common values and a clear strategy. But nothing
was a given. We were cautious about our ability to execute –
whether our people operating in 100 countries could effectively
translate our worldwide assets into world-class performance.
We were wary of global developments, including ongoing
conflict in Iraq, the threat of terrorism and public mistrust of
large companies. And we found ourselves in one of the more
volatile oil markets in history, driven by demand and anxiety
about supply. Against this backdrop, the team delivered 
record performance.
As the world’s energy market entered uncharted territory in
2004, the subject of the future of energy supply took centre
stage. Rising demand – which matched the rate of global
economic growth for the first time in 30 years – produced both
short-term anxiety about fuel prices and long-term concern
about supply. Had there been a fundamental shift in the oil
market? Were there enough reserves? What else could disrupt
supply? Were companies investing enough to meet demand?
In this uncertain climate, a little history can be reassuring.
Clearly, questions over security of supplies have driven oil
prices upwards. But, amid all the market disruptions of the past
few years, supply has never fallen short of demand. Increased
investment by the private sector has led to production gains 
of more than 15% a year during the last five years. Global
production in 2004 rose at the fourth-highest rate in history.
Choosing our goals We execute our strategy against the
context of the time. We make plans to achieve three targets:
• To underpin growth by a focus on performance, particularly
on cash returns, investing at a rate appropriate for long-term
growth. 
• To increase dividends. 
• To return to shareholders, by way of share buybacks, 
100% of free cash flow generated above what is needed 
for investment and dividends: this generally occurs, all 
other things being appropriate, when the price of oil 
exceeds $20 a barrel. 
These plans are executed by applying resources and
capabilities across the organization. 
In last year’s report, I wrote that organizational alignment 
and operational excellence would shape our future as a group
and that we had developed a new management framework 
to harness the energy and imagination of our people. In 2004,
we took further steps to embed these common values and
processes, clarifying individual accountability. In 2005, 
we will issue a new code of conduct to ensure that each
individual in BP continues to exhibit high and consistent
standards of ethical behaviour. 
We continue to innovate and apply leading-edge technology.
For example, our new Thunder Horse platform in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico breaks many records as the largest
floating facility and will operate in the deepest water, with the
harshest reservoir pressure and temperature regime.
We also continue to strengthen the development opportunities
that we offer to our people. For example, we have the Projects
Academy, in which we partner with the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology to help people gain best-in-class project
management skills. 
We measure the views of our staff through a People
Assurance Survey. In 2004, this showed a significant rise in  BP Annual Review 2004
7
the overall employee satisfaction index, demonstrating 
an increasing sense of enthusiasm and teamwork among 
BP’s employees. 
Reaching new milestones In a year of great success, there
were notable operational highlights:
• Our safety record improved for the eighth year running,
although tragically we still suffered 11 fatalities among
contractors and employees. 
• Exploration and Production made new discoveries in 
Angola, Egypt, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Trinidad 
and Sakhalin Island in Russia and brought on stream
three new fields.
• Our production growth of more than 10% was in line
with our indicator of a 7% average for 2003-2008.
• Replacement of proved reserves (for subsidiaries and 
equity-accounted entities) at over 100% exceeded 
production for the 12th year running. TNK-BP contributed 
$1.5 billion, after interest and tax, to our result, paid to 
us $1.9 billion of dividends and increased oil production
volumes by 14%.
• In Refining and Marketing, refining margins reached their
highest levels since at least 1990. We continued to find 
ways to maximize our global refining capacity.
• Premium Ultimate fuels have been newly launched in 
six markets, attracting new customers to these higher-
performance, cleaner, higher-margin products.
• BP’s retail sales continued to outpace the sector. At our
convenience locations worldwide, sales per square metre
grew by an average of 3%.
• We entered into agreements to sell liquefied natural 
gas to the US, China, South Korea and Mexico, and 
produced growth in sales volumes. 
• Our solar business streamlined its operations, tightened 
its market focus and delivered its first profit.
• We initiated the separation of the Petrochemicals business
into two entities, while still achieving record sales 
volumes through increased plant use and reliability.
• Through disciplined portfolio management, we made 
$5 billion of divestments.
Through our activities, BP delivered a record result of
$16.2 billion in 2004. With cash inflow of $6 billion and cash
returns of 35%, our performance continued to allow for strong
investment in our long-term growth as well as to return value 
to investors in the form of higher dividends – 29.45 cents per
share in 2004, an increase of 13% year on year – and significant
share buybacks, amounting to $7.5 billion in the year. 
BP now has the assets, market positions and organizational
capability to continue to deliver its unchanged strategy. 
We are meeting our three targets, with disciplined
investments, increased dividends and excess free cash flow 
for significant share buybacks.
We have confidence in our ability to perform sustainably,
focusing mainly on conventional oil and gas resources,
seeking to add value to products and services in customer-
facing businesses. 
In my many meetings with BP people around the world, 
I am constantly struck by their commitment to deliver ever-
improved performance, but responsibly and with integrity. 
My role is to provide the framework that guides and
encourages them to make the right choices: today, 
tomorrow and for the long-term future of your company. 
As always, the best is yet to come.

The fact is, there is no formula for operational
excellence. There’s no patented system, established
path or single way to achieve it. For every company
that competes on a global basis, the journey to
operational excellence is unique. For BP , operational
excellence enables us reliably and responsibly to
deliver our strategy. From the assets we’ve built to
the returns we offer our investors – and the ideas we
turn into action along the way – individuals and teams
across BP are putting operational excellence into
practice, making it an organizational principle, not
simply an aspiration. Making the right choices
10
Resourcefulness on a new scale
Our resources business is about renewal. We operate
within the world’s largest supply-and-demand
relationship, a marketplace in which our long-term
success depends on the ability of our teams to replace
reserves at least as fast as they bring them to market.
So how have we done? As we describe later, in each
of the last 12 years, we’ve replaced more than100%
of our production and, at the same time, delivered
some of the lowest finding costs in our industry.
Developing our resources through operational
excellence is converting our scale into profitability.
Turning our technologies into discoveries. Bringing our
projects into production. Connecting our exceptional
people through best practices. And extending the
potential of the world’s energy resources. BP Annual Review 2004
11
Seeing into the future Discovery never ends. That’s a principle our people learned long ago. Even in the most mature oil
and gas fields, there is hidden potential – if you know where and how to look. Egypt is a great example. As global gas
demand and infrastructure have grown, we’ve rewritten our strategy there. As well as extending the productivity of
existing oil fields, BP teams are now applying new technology and capital to discover natural gas resources. In the Nile
Delta, leading-edge aeromagnetic and seismic technology is allowing our exploration team to ‘see’ beneath the sea 
floor, taking them through deeper water towards uncharted gas reservoirs. The team’s efforts in imaging, interpretation,
integrated planning, testing and drilling have turned their raw data into real potential, and in 2004 confirmed the presence
of a promising new gas field, called Raven. What’s the next boundary? The team’s newest wells will determine the Raven
field’s size. But they are already contributing towards BP’s development of a major liquefied natural gas (LNG) business
to help meet the world’s growing demand for cleaner energy. Making the right choices
12
A mature outlook Conventional oil business wisdom holds that, once a field has reached maturity, its descent into
unprofitability is almost inevitable. At BP , however, our people tend to see ‘mature’ fields differently. Since 2000, our
existing profit centres have been run with an efficiency that’s led to an average replacement rate of 72% for the proved
reserves they have produced over this period. These ‘mature’ operations, some of which date back to the 1960s, have
maintained their vitality. Today, their output is projected to decline at a modest 3% annually until 2008. What’s made this
possible? Discipline, creativity and the kind of operating efficiency that comes from decades of knowledge and innovative
team practices in the field. We aim to extend this life expectancy. In established fields from Alaska to the North Sea, our
teams are applying remote control and online field management, increasing well recovery rates, streamlining maintenance
and even tapping into new discoveries. All of which means they’re getting more from our existing hydrocarbon base
with greater reliability and predictable cost – producing our resources as efficiently as we discover them. BP Annual Review 2004
13
Producing in new dimensions How much? How long? What next? These are the biggest questions in the world of energy
today. Part of the answer is a broader set of skills in production – creativity, efficiency, speed – to bring discoveries
consistently and responsibly to market. In oil and gas fields worldwide, our people are helping to make us productive at
an unprecedented scale. We now find oil and deliver new production with an efficiency that’s on a par with the industry’s
best. The ideas, energy and organization of our teams have also led us into our most prolific era for operational start-ups.
Over the last two years, we have completed nine major projects. From now until December 2006, we have 10 more major
oil and gas project completions planned, including some of the world’s largest construction projects in some of the most
geologically challenging locations. Among them is the Gulf of Mexico, where our teams are redefining what is possible in
deepwater operations at four fields simultaneously under development, including the massive Holstein platform (above). Making the right choices
14
The best routes to market
In today’s energy marketplace, bringing resources to
the world involves far more than making deliveries. 
It takes a business model that consistently finds the
most efficient ways of getting there. After years 
of building assets in the natural gas marketplace, 
BP is now one of the world’s largest non-state gas
companies in terms of production and sales volumes.
In the world’s largest gas market, North America, we
sell the largest volumes of end-user and wholesale
gas, and are one of the largest marketers of natural
gas liquids. Globally, in liquefied natural gas we are
the second largest non-state supplier of gas into
liquefaction plants. But our real advantage goes
beyond our size and reach. It’s the way our people 
run our businesses – the commercial and operational
practices they use to open up markets for tomorrow
and maximize the value of our resources today. BP Annual Review 2004
15
Building a mobile pipeline The distance between a natural gas field and a market can be measured in miles. It can also 
be calculated in years. BP’s LNG strategy is bringing our gas closer to market. To capture a growing share of future
customers for cleaner natural gas, our LNG teams have built a flexible system to supply growing demand – a ‘mobile
pipeline’ to serve major regional markets and meet the needs of customers in the US, UK, Spain, Japan, South Korea
and China. These locations increasingly rely on gas imports for primary energy and electricity needs, but they are often
far from sources of natural gas. LNG bridges the gap: gas is lifted from underground, chilled to liquid, transported on
ships from one part of the world to another, and then warmed back into gas to fuel a power plant, factory or home. 
As well as managing long-term point-to-point contracts, we are able to use our own ships to direct LNG to markets
where demand is greatest and value highest – opening new markets and using the open seas to supply them. Making the right choices
16
Flowing with information In the marketplace for oil and gas, one of the most valuable commodities is intelligence – the
ability to understand and interpret market information. You’ll find our people at this intersection of supply and demand.
Their minute-by-minute knowledge of the direction of supply and demand on a global basis is a discipline that allows our
teams to find the most productive links between assets and across supply chains. To streamline manufacturing flows. 
And to serve our customers distinctively and with competitive advantage. We do this by making a significant investment 
in digital and communications technology. We align that investment with a host of ‘people’ capabilities – human strengths
in analysis, logistics, trading and risk management. Our people use real-time data, information systems, transaction
automation and their own trading wisdom to act on some of the best available market intelligence worldwide. All this
allows BP to connect the dots in ways that others might not see, giving our customers a better level of service. That’s
how we take decisions that help to make the most of our resources. BP Annual Review 2004
17
Fine-tuning refining In refining, what matters more – processes or people? Traditional industry benchmarks for operational
excellence in the refining business focus on uptime, the reliability of plant and equipment and the productivity of the
manufacturing process. But people in our refining operations find that their individual actions – large and small – can help
to set an even higher standard. Since 2002, our global refining workforce has started thinking of reliability in personal
terms. By adopting the mindset of a High Reliability Organization (HRO), decision-making happens at the level where the
knowledge and expertise reside. And this leads to faster, better decisions that drive consistent, high-quality operating
performance and commercial production. More than a management technique, HRO is a way of thinking that encourages
team members to speak out, find root causes of problems and take action early when they catch even the smallest
failures. HRO is the way refining thinks best – and the best way we know to perform reliably for our customers. Making the right choices
18
Getting closer to customers
Every day, in locations around the world, our people
serve about 13 million customers. To put this in
perspective, our businesses and brands – among them
BP , Castrol, ARCO, Aral, Ultimate, Connect and am/pm –
reach nearly as many customers as Wal-Mart, the world’s
largest retailer. But to be operationally excellent where
our products meet the marketplace, our customer
relationships have to be defined by quality as well as
quantity – the distinctiveness and competitiveness 
of what we offer and the operating processes that
underpin customer experiences. Our customer-facing
businesses are gaining advantage and improving
performance by carefully determining what customers
want. By being consistent and creative in meeting
those needs. By strengthening brands through
innovation. And by locating facilities where they can
most effectively and conveniently deliver our offers. BP Annual Review 2004
19
am/pm is the preferred
fuel station convenience
store brand on the
US West Coast.
ARCO has the largest
retail fuels market
share on the US
West Coast.
Castrol is one of the top-
selling passenger car
lubricants in the world.
The BP brand is 
strongly recognized
throughout the world.
Awareness of the brand
is growing through
improved business 
offers and targeted
communication efforts. 
Aral is the largest 
retail fuel marketer in
Germany. Its position 
has benefited from 
the rebadging of the 
BP network, largely
completed in 2004.
Building a better brand In the minds of our customers, what our products stand for is just as important as what we
make. This means that not only our investment in assets but also every decision we make in choosing routes to market
must be sustained by careful management of our brands. As the face of BP , our brands are more than just logos. They 
are business assets. In combination with the well-defined advantages of our products, they tell a compelling story to 
our customers – the kind that builds preferences and sustains relationships. Which is why our brands rely on operational
excellence. They include Ultimate, which is consistently ranked as the highest quality premium retail fuel by random
samples of motorists. In lubricants, our Castrol brand has used its technological advantage, rigorous segmentation and
customer loyalty to drive sales consistently ahead of market growth. Our updated and expanded retail locations are
accelerating operating performance, increasing customers and driving sales per square metre. Applying operational
excellence to the marketplace makes our brands more meaningful – and our businesses more valuable. Making the right choices
20
Driven by distinctiveness In striving for operational excellence, where you choose to compete is often as important as how
efficiently you do it. BP’s lubricants team has proved that effective strategic choices in market segmentation, customer
relationships and brand visibility can enhance the value of assets and accelerate growth. In global lubricants markets,
characterized by limited volume growth and increasing competitive pressure, BP stands out. Our marketing strength,
technological distinctiveness and premium position have led to above-market year-on-year sales growth in automotive
lubricants. What makes us different? While we sell lubricants, led by Castrol, in more than100 countries worldwide, 
our people think in terms of market segments – motorcycles, passenger cars, trucks and vehicle manufacturers – 
rather than marketplaces. This perspective allows them to capture customers for whom our technology, consumer insight
and brands add value and can generate higher returns for BP . In applying this strategy to new markets such as China,
where lubricants growth is dramatic and preferences form quickly, our teams are already capitalizing on the strength 
of our brands to build distribution channels, market share and customer loyalty. BP Annual Review 2004
21
Solving the solar equation We all know the appeal of solar power – sustainability, acceptability and independence. Yet its
potential as an energy source has often been overshadowed by its economics as a business. At least until now. Beginning
in 2003, our BP solar team refocused its activities to become the profit centre that it could be – better understanding
customers, operating at the right scale and reaching the best markets. We’re now running a profitable solar operation –
still small by BP standards, but one that grew its megawatt capacity sales of photovoltaic equipment by more than 30% 
in 2004. This performance is being driven by manufacturing consolidation, product innovation and, in particular, the team’s
focus on eight global sectors where well-defined customer needs, improved system performance and government
incentives converge. A good example is Germany, the world’s second largest solar market after Japan. Our large commercial
installation at Geiseltalsee (above) provides sustainable benefits on two fronts: the field generates four megawatts of
power, enough to supply 1 ,000 four-person households each year, and has reclaimed the site of a former oil depot. Making the right choices
22
The point of excellence
Our upstream and downstream activities reach not
only the marketplace but also investors, regulators,
government leaders and the public. Our abilities as 
an organization to sustain and improve our standing
among these groups are key to our definition of
operational excellence. These abilities support our
new scope and scale while retaining the diverse
heritage of our people and businesses. They help
equip BP with the skills, knowledge and reputation 
that enable us to conduct business in a chosen
country – and let us navigate an increasingly 
complex and unpredictable world with sensitivity.  BP Annual Review 2004
23
Our human potential In business in general, and within BP in particular, the relationship between employee and
performance is unbreakable. Simply put, our employees hold the knowledge, skills and energy that enable our
enterprise to thrive. At BP , operational excellence includes the ways in which we expand our employees’ range of
possibilities as they expand ours. A good example is our Projects Academy. In 2003, we began working with the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to change how our teams deliver major projects. Focusing on project
leadership, business knowledge and technical excellence, the MIT programme is bringing BP’s senior project 
leaders together with recognized leaders in engineering and project management. The first two Projects Academy
classes graduated in 2004. Their members are already applying new insights to manage the complexity of their
projects, understand team dynamics, clarify priorities and build a well-connected network of ideas. The Projects
Academy, Marketing Academy and other practical initiatives give BP the capacity to learn and share knowledge 
on an everyday, global basis, and to grow our most prized resource – our people. Financial and business operating review

Business environment
Trading conditions in 2004 were affected by tight supplies in 
oil markets and by strong world economic growth. 
Average crude oil prices in nominal terms in 2004 were the
highest for 20 years, driven by exceptionally strong global oil
demand growth and the physical disruption to US oil operations
caused by Hurricane Ivan. The Brent price averaged $38.27 per
barrel, an increase of more than $9 per barrel over the $28.83
per barrel average seen in 2003, and varied between $29.13
and $52.03 per barrel.
Natural gas prices in the US were also strong during 2004. The
Henry Hub First of the Month Index averaged $6.13 per million
British thermal units (mmBtu), up by more than $0.70 per mmBtu
compared with the 2003 average of $5.37 per mmBtu. Prices fell
slightly relative to oil prices as the levels of gas in storage rose
sharply. UK gas prices were also up strongly in 2004, averaging
24.39 pence per therm at the National Balancing Point compared
with a 2003 average of 20.28 pence per therm.
Refining margins averaged record highs in 2004, despite
weakening towards the end of the year. This reflected strong
oil demand growth and record refinery throughput levels. 
Retail margins weakened in 2004, as rising product prices and
price volatility made their impact in a competitive marketplace.
In Petrochemicals, generally improved market conditions led 
to a gradual increase in both volumes and margins through 
the year. Such gains were, however, partially offset by high 
and volatile energy and feedstock prices, together with adverse
foreign exchange impacts.
Results
BP’s result for the year was $16,208 million, compared with
$12,858 million in 2003. The result per share was 74.27 cents, an
increase of 28%. Replacement cost profit was $14,088 million
(2003 $10,466 million). Both the result and replacement cost
profit include exceptional and non-operating items.
The return on average capital employed was 20%, compared
with 18% in 2003. On a replacement cost basis, the 2004
return was 15% (2003 12%), and 17% (2003 12%) on a
historical cost basis.
Net exceptional gains of $815 million before tax principally relate
to gains from the sale of our interests in PetroChina and Sinopec
and the divestment of certain upstream interests, partly offset by
net losses on a number of business sales and facility closures.
Non-operating items in 2004 were a net charge of $2,120
million before tax and are shown on page 25. The majority of the
asset write-downs and impairments relate to the Petrochemicals
segment, reflecting the portfolio separation described on page 28.
Interest expense was $642 million, compared with 
$644 million in 2003. This primarily reflects lower interest rates
and debt buyback costs and an increase in capitalized interest,
offset by the inclusion of BP’s share of a full year’s interest
expense from TNK-BP in 2004.
Corporate tax expense was $8,282 million (2003 
$6,111 million), representing an effective tax rate of 34% 
on the pro forma result (2003 32%).
Historical cost profit was $15,731 million, including
exceptional net gains after tax of $1,076 million and stock
holding gains of $1,643 million. The corresponding figures for
2003 were $10,482 million profit, $708 million net gains and
$16 million gains respectively.
Capital expenditure and acquisitions amounted to 
$17,249 million, including $1,354 million for including TNK’s
interest in Slavneft within TNK-BP and $1,355 million for the
acquisition of Solvay’s interests in BP Solvay Polyethylene 
Europe and BP Solvay Polyethylene North America. Excluding
acquisitions, capital expenditure was $14,408 million, compared
with $13,986 million in 2003.
Net cash inflow for the year was $6,038 million, compared
with an inflow of $1,405 million in 2003; higher operating 
cash flow and higher dividends from joint ventures were 
partly offset by higher tax payments, lower disposal proceeds 
and higher acquisition spending. Net cash outflow for 
capital expenditure and acquisitions, net of disposals, was 
$11,954 million (2003 $9,672 million). During 2004, we made
incremental payments of $395 million into a number of the
group’s pension funds (2003 $2,533 million).
The group’s net debt, that is debt less cash and liquid
resources, was $21,607 million at the end of 2004, compared
with $20,193 million at the end of the previous year. The ratio 
of net debt to net debt plus equity was 24%, at the bottom of
the target range, compared with 26% a year ago. On a reported
basis, the percentage was 22% (2003 22%).
In addition to reported debt, BP uses conventional off
balance sheet sources of finance such as operating leases 
and borrowings in joint ventures and associates. The group 
has access to significant sources of liquidity in the form of
committed facilities and other arrangements.
BP has a financial risk management process that addresses
the various risk exposures we encounter in the financial
markets; these include market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Dividends and share repurchases
The total dividends announced for 2004 were $6,371 million,
against $5,753 million in 2003. Dividends per share for 2004
were 29.45 cents, an increase of 13% compared with 2003. 
In sterling terms, the dividend was 4% higher. This increase is a
result of our strong cash flow and improvements in underlying
performance in line with strategy. In addition, our confidence 
in the future enabled us to make a step change in the fourth
quarterly dividend. The board sets the dividend based upon 
the prevailing circumstances of the group, future investment
patterns and the sustainability of the group, and the future
trading environment. The steady increases in the dollar dividend
in recent years reflect the board’s progressive dividend policy.
BP intends to continue the operation of the Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) for shareholders who wish to
receive their dividend in the form of shares rather than cash.
The BP Direct Access Plan for US and Canadian investors also
includes a dividend reinvestment feature.
The group aims to demonstrate financial discipline by
balancing cash in and cash out over time. When trading
conditions are favourable, cash flow may be in excess of what
is needed for operational requirements, including funding the
capital programme and any acquisitions and dividend
payments. As part of giving a return to shareholders, one of
the steps we take from time to time is to repurchase our own
shares. During 2004, a total of 827 million shares were
repurchased and cancelled at a cost of $7,548 million. The
repurchased shares had a nominal value of $207 million and
represented 3.7% of ordinary shares in issue at the end of
Financial performance BP Annual Review 2004
25
2003. Since the inception of the share repurchase programme
in 2000, 1,602 million shares have been repurchased and
cancelled at a cost of $13.5 billion. BP intends to continue
making share repurchases, subject to market conditions and
continuing authority at the April 2005 annual general meeting. 
During the year, shares to the value of $1.25 billion were
issued to Alfa Group and Access-Renova (AAR) as the first
instalment of the deferred consideration for our investment in
TNK-BP.Two more instalments of $1.25 billion are due in the
third quarters of 2005 and 2006.
Critical accounting policies
The group’s accounts are prepared in accordance with UK
generally accepted accounting practice (UK GAAP). This requires
the directors to adopt those accounting policies most appropriate
to its particular circumstance for the accounts to give a true and
fair view. In preparing the accounts, the directors are required 
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual
outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
The areas that require the most significant judgements 
and estimates to be used in the preparation of consolidated
accounts relate to oil and natural gas accounting, including the
estimation of reserves; impairment; and provisions for deferred
taxation, decommissioning, environmental liabilities, pensions
and other post-retirement benefits.
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards
An ‘International Accounting Standards Regulation’ was
adopted by the Council of the European Union (EU) in June
2002. This regulation requires all EU companies listed on an 
EU stock exchange to use ‘endorsed’ International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS), published by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB), to report their
consolidated results with effect from 1 January 2005. 
We are in the process of finalizing the restatements of the
results and financial position for 2003 and 2004 under IFRS, 
and intend to release this information in mid-March 2005. 
Our current view is that the major effects of changing from 
our current accounting practice to IFRS are in the following
areas: goodwill acquired in a business combination; deferred 
tax related to business combinations and in respect of the 
valuation of stocks; accounting for items falling within the 
scope of IAS Nos. 32 and 39, including embedded derivatives and
hedge accounting; the treatment of major overhaul expenditure;
exchanges of fixed assets; recognition of dividend liabilities; and
share-based payments. Certain joint arrangements with third
parties, where BP currently accounts for its share of individual
assets, liabilities, income and expense, will be accounted for
using the equity method, resulting in reclassifications within
the income statement and balance sheet.
Insurance
The group generally restricts its purchase of insurance to
situations where this is required for legal or contractual
reasons. This is because external insurance is not considered
an economic means of financing losses for the group. Losses
will therefore be borne as they arise rather than being spread
over time through insurance premia with attendant transaction
costs. This position will be reviewed periodically.

Creditor payment policy and practice
As a general policy, the group encourages long-term
relationships founded on trust and mutual advantage. Within this
overall policy, individual operating companies are responsible for
agreeing terms and conditions for their business transactions
and ensuring that suppliers are aware of the terms of payment.
These terms are adhered to when payments are made, subject
to terms and conditions being met by the supplier.
BP p.l.c. is a holding company with no business activity other
than the holding of investments in the group and therefore had
no trade creditors at 31 December 2004. Financial and business operating review

Business performance
Exploration and Production
Exploration and Production
The result for the year was a record $19,759 million,
representing an improvement of 22% over 2003, arising 
from increased production and higher oil and gas prices. 
Our production was 3,997 thousand barrels of oil equivalent
per day, an increase of more than 10% over 2003, primarily
from incremental production in TNK-BP and our new profit
centres. The increase was partly offset by a severe hurricane
season in the Gulf of Mexico, a blow-out at the non-BP-operated
Temsah platform in Egypt, the impact of divestments and
decline in our existing profit centres.
We sanctioned four new major projects (Azeri-Chirag-
Gunashli phase three in Azerbaijan, Rosa in Angola, Magnus
extension in the UK North Sea and viscous oil in Alaska) and
completed four major projects (In Salah in Algeria, Australia
North West Shelf Train 4, Kizomba A in Angola and Holstein in
the Gulf of Mexico). The increase in capital spending this year
primarily reflected continued high development activity as 
we progressed projects in the new profit centres. Despite
significant success across the supply chain to minimize the
impact, inflationary pressures on our raw materials and the
weaker dollar contributed to the increase.
Progress continued in our existing profit centres. Production
from the Cerro Dragon field in Argentina grew through further
infill drilling. In the North Sea, progress continued as expected
on the Rhum development. 
Each of our new profit centres progressed in line with our
expectations this year. 
In Trinidad, from where BP has prime access to US and
European liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets, we built on 
our integrated position. In July, Atlas Methanol, the world’s
largest methanol plant, came on line. Train 4 of Atlantic LNG
remains on track for start-up in the fourth quarter of 2005. 
It will be supplied in part by the Cannonball gas development,
which is Trinidad and Tobago’s first major in-country offshore
construction project.
In Azerbaijan, construction continued on the Central Azeri 
field, with topsides commissioning under way. First oil is
expected in the first half of 2005. We plan to transport this 
oil via the 1,760-kilometre Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline.
When complete, the pipeline will export crude oil from the
Caspian to world markets. In addition, construction continued on
the Shah Deniz gas field, and in-country assembly of the drilling
rig and platform is under way for a planned 2006 start-up.
In the Gulf of Mexico, the Holstein field started production 
in December, despite the effects of Hurricane Ivan. In 2004,
significant progress was made on Mad Dog, currently in the
final commissioning stages with first production expected in
early 2005, and on Thunder Horse, on track to begin production
by the end of 2005. This will be followed by Atlantis, with first
production expected in 2006.
In Angola, the Kizomba A field started production in August,
ahead of schedule, while Kizomba B remains on track for 
start-up in late 2005. All major contracts were awarded on 
the Greater Plutonio development and fabrication of the
Floating Production Storage and Offloading topsides began. 
In Algeria, the In Salah project started production in mid-
2004 and the In Amenas project remains on track for start-up 
in late 2005-early 2006.
Oil production from TNK-BP (excluding Slavneft) grew 
by about 14% over 2003. Our result for the year included
$2.4 billion from TNK-BP.We also received $1.9 billion of cash
dividends from the venture. 
We continually seek to enhance our portfolio through a
planned annual divestment programme. 
In 2004, this yielded $747 million of proceeds and covered
assets primarily in Indonesia, the US and Canada. We also
signed sales and purchase agreements for the Ormen 
Strategy
• Create new profit centres by accessing areas with the
potential for large oil and natural gas fields; exploring
successfully; and pursuing the best projects for development.
• Manage the performance of producing assets by investing 
in the best available opportunities and optimizing operating
efficiency.
• Sell assets that are no longer strategic to us and have
greater value to others.
Focus 
BP invests in a portfolio of large, lower-cost oil and natural 
gas fields chosen for their potentially strong return on capital
employed, and seeks to manage those assets safely with
maximum capital and operating efficiency. We continue to
develop new profit centres in which we have a distinctive
position: Trinidad, Angola, Azerbaijan, deepwater Gulf of
Mexico, Asia Pacific gas and Algeria. These new profit centres,
in addition to our growing operations in Russia, augment 
the production assets in our existing profit centres, providing
greater reach, investment choice and opportunity for growth.

Lange field in Norway, which is planned to complete in 
early 2005.
New oil and gas discoveries were made in Egypt, Angola, 
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Trinidad and offshore Sakhalin
Island in Russia. Recoverable oil and gas from these finds is
estimated to be more than one billion barrels of oil equivalent.
On the basis of UK generally accepted accounting practice
(SORP), our proved reserves replacement ratio (RRR) was
106%, excluding equity-accounted entities. On the same basis,
including equity-accounted entities, the RRR was 110%. This
was the 12th consecutive year in which our RRR was greater
than 100%. We also prepare estimates of our proved reserves
on the basis of the rules and interpretation required by the 
US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On this basis,
our RRR was 78%, excluding equity-accounted entities, and
89%, including equity-accounted entities. The differences from
our SORP-based estimates arise mainly from the use of year-
end pricing, as required by the SEC. All our proved reserves
replacement ratios are based on discoveries, extensions,
revisions and improved recovery and exclude the effects of
acquisitions and disposals. BP has a robust internal process 
to control the quality of its reserve bookings, which forms 
part of a holistic and integrated system of internal control.
Details of that process and the applicable rules are described
on pages 87-88 of BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004. 
Refining and Marketing
Strong refining margins, combined with robust operating
performance, led to a result of $5,603 million in 2004, a 
78% improvement from 2003. The relative weakening of 
the US dollar compared with the euro and sterling negatively
affected results. 
In our marketing businesses, strongly competitive sales
growth was maintained. This resulted both from our
investment to increase the quality of our portfolio and from 
our focus on operational excellence. Owing to increased crude
product and base oil prices, margins overall declined slightly
against those of 2003. We continued to strengthen our
competitive position in all our operations through improved 
site operating models and the development of distinctive 
offers for customers. 
Our investment in China deepened through two new joint
ventures with PetroChina and Sinopec. We continued to 
review our portfolio, resulting in the disposal of our refining,
retail and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) businesses in
Singapore, while further retail network asset disposals were
completed in 2004. From 1 January 2005, the Aromatics and
Acetyls businesses will join the segment and the Lavéra and
Grangemouth refineries will be included in the Olefins and
Derivatives business. 
A record performance for the refining business was
underpinned by strong product demand and good availability,
which averaged 95.4% in 2004. We concentrated on 
optimizing our assets and taking advantage of our global 
scale and presence. Focus on supply optimization, feedstock
selection and product value maximization helped us to 
capture high margins. BP’s Global Indicator Refining Margin
was $6.08 a barrel, up from $3.88 in 2003. Total global 
refining throughput was down by about 4% as a result 
of planned disposals. 
In our retail business, the number of sites carrying the 
BP helios expanded to 19,828 worldwide during 2004.
We launched Ultimate gasoline and diesel fuels in Australia,
Austria, France, Germany, Poland and Portugal. These enhanced
products deliver improved performance with fewer emissions
than standard fuel grades, and have received positive
responses from customers.
In our lubricants business, we focused on pursuing key
Strategy
• Focus on refining locations where scale, configuration and
operational excellence earn distinctive returns.
• Focus on retail fuel and convenience markets where supply
advantage and distinctive offer can capture market share.
• Leverage our brand and technology with a key focus on
automotive-related lubricants markets.
• Build strong strategic relationships in the business-to-
business sector.
• Enhance our existing strength in selected emerging 
markets, particularly China.
Focus 
Our marketing businesses, underpinned by world-class
manufacturing, generate customer value by providing quality
products and offers. Our retail, lubricants and business-to-
business sectors reach about 13 million customers a day. 
Our retail strategy provides differentiated fuel and convenience
offers to some of the most attractive global markets. Our
lubricants brands offer customers benefits through technology
and relationships. We have deep business-to-business customer
relationships and strategic partnerships. We seek to improve
the quality of our manufacturing portfolio and our products.

customer segments and markets where we believe we have 
a premium position. Our brands continued to experience
above-market volume growth, supported by new marketing
initiatives. Growth was particularly strong in Asia, with Castrol
BikeZone successfully launched in India and Vietnam. New
product launches took place across the world, including 
Castrol GTX Start Up in the US and Castrol GTX High Mileage
in Europe. 
2004 was also a good year for business-to-business fuels
marketing activity in both margin and volume, particularly in the
marine and aviation sectors. This was partially offset by margin
squeeze and price lag in the lubricants and LPG businesses,
although volume demand remained robust. We also successfully
launched the innovative new BP Gaslight composite LPG
cylinder and Castrol TLX Plus in marine lubricants.
Petrochemicals
Petrochemicals’ result was a loss of $900 million in 2004.
Record sales and production volumes, underpinned by 
strong demand and by increased utilization and reliability 
at manufacturing sites, were more than offset by higher
exceptional and non-operating charges. 
Focus on commercial and operational excellence, together
with generally improved market conditions, accelerated
performance. Margin expansion was achieved despite high 
and volatile prices for energy and feedstocks.
The segment continued to upgrade its portfolio, focusing on
areas with competitive advantage. As a consequence, several
businesses that did not meet our strategic and financial criteria
were sold, together with the announced closure of several
manufacturing units. Substantial progress was made in
constructing the SECCO chemicals complex near Shanghai 
(BP 50%) and expanding the Chocolate Bayou olefins operation
in Texas. Output from these investments is expected in 2005.
In 2004, we announced that, from 1 January 2005, the
Olefins and Derivatives (O&D) business would operate on 
a standalone basis within the BP group. We plan to divest the
O&D business, possibly starting with an Initial Public Offering
in the second half of 2005, subject to market conditions and
the receipt of necessary approvals. The O&D business markets
a wide range of petrochemicals, manufactured in more than 
20 locations worldwide. 
During 2004, several initiatives were announced, designed 
to strengthen the competitive standing of the O&D business.
The Grangemouth and Lavéra refineries will be incorporated
into O&D, so preserving the opportunity to enhance further 
the benefits of site integration with their neighbouring
petrochemicals operations. BP also agreed to acquire 
Solvay’s interests in the two BP Solvay high-density
polyethylene ventures for inclusion in O&D. Finally, Nova
Chemicals and O&D agreed in principle to combine their
respective styrene polymer interests in a joint venture, 
creating a major European polystyrene operation. Subject 
to regulatory approval, the joint venture is expected to 
start in mid-2005.
BP will retain the Aromatics and Acetyls (A&A) operations 
as an important part of its customer-facing activities. The A&A
businesses have among the largest global market shares and
advanced technologies in these high-growth sectors. BP aims
to grow the A&A businesses and several ongoing expansion
projects in Asia will start up in 2005. 
With the announced changes, the Petrochemicals segment
ceased to report separately as from 1 January 2005. The 
A&A operations will be included within the Refining and
Marketing segment; the O&D business will report within 
Other businesses and corporate. The new structure is 
designed to offer the greatest opportunity for further
improvement in overall performance and financial returns.
Strategy
• Separate the portfolio, enabling the individual parts to
develop strategic paths that deliver distinctive returns. We
plan to divest the Olefins and Derivatives business, possibly
starting with an Initial Public Offering in the second half of
2005, subject to market conditions and necessary approvals.
• Integrate the Aromatics and Acetyls businesses within the
Refining and Marketing segment, gaining operational and
organizational synergies. Maintain leading market shares and
technology in these high-growth businesses, with a strong
presence in Asia. 
• Focus the overall portfolio on areas with competitive
advantage and restructure other assets. 
Focus 
Our petrochemicals businesses have significant global market
positions, underpinned by leading proprietary technology and
strong manufacturing capabilities. Our activities focus on those
areas with a distinctive and significant competitive position.
Our products are ultimately used to service a wide range 
of consumer applications, increasingly in the fast-growing
markets of Asia Pacific and China in particular.

Gas, Power and Renewables
Gas, Power and Renewables
The result for the year was $943 million, an increase of 65%
over 2003 and underpinned by record sales volumes achieved
across all four principal business areas of LNG, NGLs, gas
marketing and solar. The NGLs business benefited from a firm
market environment by increasing sales by 14% and achieving
high levels of availability. Sales of natural gas increased by 
4%, while volumes of gas supplied into liquefaction plants 
rose by 11%. The solar business grew sales by 38% and
delivered a full-year operating profit for the first time. 
We took a number of important steps to access major
growth markets for the group’s equity gas. In Asia Pacific,
agreements for the supply of LNG from the proposed Tangguh
development in Indonesia (BP 37.16%) were signed with
POSCO and K Power for supply to South Korea and with
Sempra for supply to Mexico and US markets. Together 
with an earlier agreement to supply LNG to China, more 
than seven million tonnes a year of Tangguh LNG have been
secured. This was a significant factor in the decision to sanction
the development in early 2005. 
In the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions, significant
progress was also made in creating opportunities to supply
LNG to North American and European gas markets. In Egypt,
we signed agreements to supply gas to the Damietta LNG
plant and to purchase 1.45 billion cubic metres per year of 
LNG for supply to world markets. Agreements finalized with
NGT Transco will make BP and Sonatrach of Algeria the first
companies since the 1980s to import LNG into the UK market
from 2005. 
Plans for the development of new LNG import terminals on
the US East and Gulf coasts made good progress. These new
access points to market, together with existing capacity rights
at Cove Point in Maryland, US, Bilbao in Spain and Isle of Grain,
UK, should provide important opportunities to maximize the
value of the group’s gas supplies from Trinidad, Egypt 
and elsewhere. 
In the NGLs business, we maintained our position in North
America as one of the largest marketers and producers in
terms of production and sales volumes. There we had a very
strong year, benefiting from the high prices of NGLs seen
during 2004 and the wide differences between natural gas
feedstocks and liquids prices, which give higher earnings. 
In Egypt, a new NGLs extraction plant (BP 33.33%) began 
gas processing at Port Said.
Our gas marketing and trading business had a good year,
with an operating result ahead of 2003’s record performance.
In North America, we are the largest gas marketer in volumes
sold to end-use and wholesale markets and have a growing
power marketing and trading business. Our marketing and
trading scale and scope provide exemplary market access 
for the group’s North American equity gas production and 
LNG imports. We secured long-term capacity in several new
western US pipeline projects to support expected Rockies
production growth and avoid capacity constraints seen in the
past. We continued to expand our market presence in North
America by acquiring two gas marketing companies and
extending two key energy alliance agreements. 
Our solar business saw a record year, with strong sales
growth, a positive operating result and positive cash flow. 
The business benefited from the restructuring undertaken 
in 2003, which reduced the cost of supply, and also from
strong industry demand, which is supporting higher 
revenues. We reduced product lines and distributors and
improved customer focus and brand loyalty. Our global ‘lean
manufacturing’ initiative delivered major improvements in
productivity, and production from our main operating facilities
in Madrid, Spain, and Frederick, US, was stepped up to supply
the higher sales.
Strategy
• Capture distinctive world-scale market positions ahead 
of supply.
• Expand gross margin by providing distinctive products to
selected customer segments and optimizing the gas and
power value chains.
• Build a sustainable solar business and continue to 
assess the application of renewable and alternative 
energy sources.
Focus 
In line with changing demand patterns for cleaner fuels, 
BP seeks to participate at scale in the fast-growing markets 
for natural gas, gas liquids and solar energy. We currently hold
some of the largest market shares in volumes sold in North
American gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) and significant
strength in both the liquefied natural gas (LNG) and solar global
markets. We are expanding our LNG business by accessing
import terminals in Asia Pacific, North America and Europe.

Our fundamental purpose, as defined by BP’s board, is to
maximize shareholder value on a long-term basis by providing
constantly improving goods and services in a strongly

BP: our business
The way we work is guided by values – integrity, honest dealing,
treating everyone with respect and dignity, striving for mutual
advantage, transparency and contributing to human progress.
These values are enshrined in practical policies and standards
that govern areas of our activity, including health, safety,
security, environment, ethical conduct and business
relationships.
We use a system of risk management to assess the impact 
of our activities on the environment, local economies and
communities. Where appropriate, accountability for managing
environmental and social impacts is part of managers’
performance contracts, with specific objectives and milestones.
People’s safety is of the highest priority. Managers are
accountable for ensuring that safety risks are properly
addressed, staff are trained and facilities are well maintained.
We closely monitor our safety performance. 
In 2004, the number of injury cases (resulting in our
employees or contractors being away from work for a day or
more) was 0.08 per 200,000 hours worked, compared with
0.09 in 2003. This performance is approaching the best in our
industry and also within our target set at 0.09 for 2004.
Despite meeting this important target and reducing overall
injury rates, we deeply regret the 11 workforce fatalities in 2004.
This compares with 20 in 2003 and 13 in 2002. 
As a global organization, we believe our workforce, leadership
and recruitment should reflect the diverse communities in
which we operate. We are continuing to focus on employing
and developing local staff and leaders in our operations
worldwide. Programmes in countries including China, Angola
and Azerbaijan are ensuring that we continue to increase the
number of local employees. 
Our policy is to ensure equal opportunity in recruitment,
career development, promotion, training and reward for all
employees, including those with disabilities. All applicants and
employees are assessed against clear criteria related to job
requirements. Where existing employees become disabled, 
our policy is to provide continuing employment and training
wherever practicable.
Our People Assurance Survey (PAS), completed by 74% of 
our employees in 2004, showed a 4% improvement in overall
employee satisfaction. 
BP values the diversity of its leadership. At the end of 2004,
15% of our top 610 leaders were female and 19% were of
nationalities other than the UK or US. Our employee surveys
show that an inclusive culture is spreading. In 2004, 70% 
of BP employees who responded to the PAS believed the
company had created an environment where people with
diverse backgrounds could succeed, up from 67% in 2003 
and 60% in 2000. We strive to build an environment in which
everyone can feel part of a meritocratic organization.
During 2004, we made further progress in learning and
development opportunities for employees. Around 5,000 people
undertook the First Level Leaders programme, which provides
training for the first tier of management. More than 1,800 of 
our 6,000 senior leaders took part in the Senior Level Leaders
programme, designed to develop their leadership capabilities. 
BP’s fourth Global Graduate Forum was attended by around
300 graduates who joined in 2002, while around 250 people
attended the Discover BP programme, launched to help senior
experienced recruits integrate rapidly into BP .
We continue to support employee share ownership. Through
our award-winning ShareMatch plan, run in 75 countries, we
match BP shares purchased by employees. 
Communications with employees include global and local
magazines, intranet sites, DVDs, targeted e-mails and face-
to-face communication. Team meetings are the core of our
employee consultation, complemented by formal processes
through works councils in parts of Europe. This communication,
along with training programmes, raises awareness of the
financial, economic, social and environmental factors affecting
BP’s performance and contributes to employee development
and motivation.
We continue to emphasize the importance of doing business
with high standards of ethical conduct. To enhance our focus 
on compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies and
standards, we developed a new centralized compliance and
ethics function during 2004.
We promote our global employee concerns programme –
OpenTalk – to give our staff the opportunity to report possible
breaches of law or company policy without fear of retaliation.
OpenTalk can be contacted via telephone, letter, e-mail or fax
and provides a translation service. Matters raised are held in
strict confidence and are referred for investigation via regional
ombudsmen within BP for resolution. During 2004, 343 reports
were received from 44 countries and, where appropriate, action
was taken.
Staff in positions of responsibility review with their teams all
compliance and ethical issues arising during the year. They then

Days away from work case frequency (DAFWCF) is the annual frequency (per

certify to their manager that their personal actions and those 
of their teams have complied with the law and with company
policy, disclosing any areas of possible non-compliance. 
On completion of the process, the group chief executive
prepares his personal certificate on behalf of BP . In future 
years, these reports will be prepared against the requirements
outlined in our new code of conduct.
We continue to apply our strong anti-corruption policy,
including prohibiting facilitation payments and identifying and
correcting any areas of non-compliance. We take disciplinary
measures where appropriate. In 2004, this included the
dismissal of 252 people for unethical behaviour, including 
fraud, theft and dishonesty.
BP does not make corporate political contributions anywhere
in the world and specifically made no donations to UK or other
EU political parties or organizations in 2004.
Promoting health awareness among our employees,
contractors and local communities provides long-term benefits
to our people and our business. In many areas of the world 
we face significant health issues, such as HIV/AIDS. During
2004, we increased our capability to assess health risks and
implemented local initiatives. 
BP and the environment 
BP was the first major oil company to state publicly that the
risks of climate change were serious and that precautionary
action was justified. While uncertainties remain, we believe
business planning and long-term strategy should be based 
on the need to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases.
In 2001, BP had succeeded in lowering operational
emissions by 10% from 1990 levels. We now aim to offset
growth in our emissions by 2012, with reductions achieved
partly from operational efficiency projects and partly from 
the supply of products that are cleaner or offer improved 
fuel efficiency. 
Our 2004 operational emissions of 81.7 million tonnes 
(Mte) were similar to those of 2003 (83.4Mte). Our emissions
would have been higher but for planned improvements in
operational efficiencies and divestments. The efficiencies
resulted in more than 1Mte of sustainable reductions, which
now total about 4Mte since 2001. 
BP recognizes the need to protect and conserve sensitive
areas that house the rich biodiversity of our planet. We will 
only work within sensitive areas if we believe we can properly
manage any risks to the environment. 
We have made a commitment to publish the results of 
risk assessments relating to any new activities in World
Conservation Union (IUCN) designated sites. In 2004, no
decisions were taken to go into such areas. Our website
details all known IUCN category I to VI areas where we have
facilities. During 2004, further work was undertaken to ensure
that our approach when entering areas for exploration and
production is consistent and transparent.
By the end of 2004, 100% of our major operations had 
been independently certified to the ISO 14001 international
standard on environmental management. This system drives
continuous performance improvement at our sites to reduce 
air emissions, water discharges and accidental releases,
including oil spills to sea or land.
Our shipping fleet transports significant volumes of oil and
gas around the world. In 2004, BP continued its strategy of
increasing its fleet in order to control the risk of a major oil 
spill more effectively. Our owned and operated fleet has 
grown from 36 ships in 2003 to 42 ships in December 2004,
38 of which are double-hulled. Most of these vessels are
leased, an approach that enables the group to renew the 
fleet periodically. We also charter additional vessels, which 
are vetted to ensure they meet our rigorous standards.
In the area of renewable and alternative energies, BP’s
research and development focus has been on photovoltaics
and hydrogen. We are pursuing initiatives aimed at improving
the efficiency and cost of solar cells as well as the
development of new silicon sources and alternative wafer
fabrication techniques. In hydrogen, we use our international
portfolio of practical demonstration projects to test new
technologies and foster innovation.
BP in society
We try to ensure that our relationships with non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), customers, suppliers, communities and
governments are founded on the basis of mutual advantage.
Our relationships develop over many years by seeking to
understand the needs and aspirations of all with whom we 
do business.
We made further progress on some concerns related 
to the construction of the BTC pipeline, a project that has
attracted some NGO opposition, particularly over human 
rights issues. The pipeline is being constructed to transport 
oil from the Caspian to the Mediterranean, so avoiding 
shipping through the Bosporus, and will help meet growing
world demand. 
We believe that open and thriving societies create the 
best environment for business. During 2004, we contributed 
to international discussions on the issue of transparency. 
The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is an
important programme that provides guidelines for disclosing
the amount of revenue governments receive from energy
companies, so demonstrating the scale of the funds available
for public spending. Towards the end of 2004, a Memorandum
of Understanding was signed in Baku, Azerbaijan, by the
government, state and foreign oil companies, setting out
clearly the process for implementation of the EITI in 
Azerbaijan. BP is committed to encouraging the acceleration 
of this process and will be supporting it with the publication 
of relevant data and information. 
Our business activities affect – and benefit – people
worldwide. We seek to extend these benefits as broadly 
as possible. During 2004, we reviewed our strategy of 
social investment and intend to focus on education, on 
the development of thriving local enterprise and on 
providing access to energy in remote locations. We continue 
to support many initiatives in the communities in which 
we operate. 32

Notes
1 Presentation of the accounts
These summarized financial statements represent an abridged version of the financial statements in BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004. 
For 2004, the group has changed the method of accounting for pensions and other post-retirement benefits and the method of accounting 
for BP shares held by the group for the purposes of Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) to comply with new UK accounting
pronouncements. Comparative figures have been restated to reflect these changes in accounting policy, and also to reflect the transfer of 
natural gas liquids (NGLs) operations from the Exploration and Production segment to Gas, Power and Renewables.
2 Replacement cost profit
Replacement cost profits reflect the current cost of supplies. The replacement cost profit is arrived at by excluding stock holding gains and losses
from the historical cost profit.

7 Earnings per ordinary share
The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, i.e. profit for the year less
preference dividends, related to the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. The profit attributable to ordinary
shareholders is $15,729 million ($10,480 million). The average number of shares outstanding excludes the shares held by the Employee Share
Ownership Plans. 36
Notes
7 Earnings per ordinary share continued
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, adjusted for the unwinding of the discount on
the deferred consideration for the acquisition of our interest in TNK-BP , of $15,793 million ($10,504 million). The number of shares outstanding is
adjusted to show the potential dilution if employee share options are converted into ordinary shares, and for the ordinary shares issuable, in two
further annual tranches, in respect of the TNK-BP joint venture.
In addition to basic earnings per share based on the historical cost profit for the year, a further measure, based on replacement cost profit before
exceptional items, is provided as it is considered that this measure gives an indication of underlying performance.

Good governance is often defined in terms of the presence or absence
of particular practices without reference to the underlying purpose of
governance processes. We believe that governance is a more powerful
concept. Governance is not an exercise in compliance nor is it a higher
form of management. 
Governance is the system by which the company’s owners and 
their representatives on the board ensure that it pursues, does not
deviate from and only allocates resources to its defined purpose.
The board’s role is focused on those tasks which are unique to 
it as the representative of our owners – those activities which are
necessary for the effective promotion of their interests. Governance
lies at the heart of all the board does, ensuring the pursuit of the
company’s purpose. 
As a company, we recognize the importance of good governance
and that it is a discrete task from management, requiring distinct skills
and processes. Clarity of roles is key to our approach. Policies and
processes depend upon the people who operate them. In the context
of BP , governance is overseen by our board while management is
delegated to the group chief executive by means of the board
governance policies. 
These board governance policies use a coherent, principles-based
approach. Our policies anticipated many developments in UK
governance practice and have proved robust in the evolving regulatory
climate. They ensure that our board and management operate within 
a clear and effective governance framework, which goes beyond
regulatory compliance and places shareholder interest at the heart 
of all we do. 
Accountability to shareholders
Our board is required to be proactive in obtaining an understanding 
of shareholder preferences and to evaluate systematically the
economic, social, environmental and ethical matters that may influence
or affect the interest of our shareholders. In carrying out its work in
policy-making and monitoring and in its active consideration of group
strategy, our board exercises judgement on how best to further
shareholder interest. The board seeks to do so by maximizing the
expected value of shareholders’ interest in the company, not by
eliminating the possibility of any adverse outcomes.
Our board is accountable to shareholders for the performance 
and activities of the entire BP group. It embeds shareholder 
interest in the goals established for the company.
Directors are required to stand for re-election each year. New
directors are subject to election at the first opportunity following 
their appointment. All names submitted to shareholders for election
are accompanied by detailed biographies.
A number of formal communication channels are used to account 
to shareholders for the performance of the company. These include 
the Annual Report and Accounts, the Annual Review, the Annual
Report on Form 20-F , quarterly Forms 6-K and announcements made
through stock exchanges on which BP shares are listed, as well as
through the annual general meeting (AGM). Presentations given at
appropriate intervals to representatives of the investment community
are available via internet broadcast or open conference call. Less 
formal processes include contacts with institutional shareholders by
the chairman and other non-executive directors. This is supported by
the dialogue with shareholders concerning the governance and
operation of the group maintained by the company secretary’s office,
investor relations and other BP teams. 
Given the size and geographical diversity of our shareholder base,
the opportunities for shareholder interaction at the AGM are limited.
However, the chairman and all board committee chairmen were
present at the 2004 AGM to answer shareholders’ questions and 
hear their views during the meeting. Members of the board met
informally with shareholders afterwards. All votes at shareholder
meetings, whether by proxy or in person, are counted since all votes,
except on procedural issues, are taken by way of a poll. We have
pioneered the use of electronic communications and continue to
promote the use of electronic voting through our registrar’s website
and through CREST . 
How our board governs the company
The board’s governance policies regulate its relationship with
shareholders, the conduct of board affairs and the board’s relationship
with the group chief executive. The policies recognize the board’s
separate and unique role as the link in the chain of authority between
the shareholders and the group chief executive. It is this unique task
which gives the board its central role in governance.
The dual role played by the group chief executive and executive
directors as both members of the board and leaders of the executive
management is also recognized and addressed. The policies therefore
require a majority of the board to be composed of independent non-
executive directors, who oversee the relationship between the board
and the group chief executive, particularly through the work of the
board committees they populate. 
Recognizing that as a group its capacity is limited, our board reserves
to itself the making of broad policy decisions. It delegates more detailed
considerations involved in meeting its stated requirements either to
board committees and officers (in the case of its own processes) or 
to the group chief executive (in the case of the management of the
company’s business activities). 
To discharge its governance function in the most effective manner,
our board has laid down rules for its own activities in a board process
policy. The board-executive linkage policy sets out how the board
delegates authority to the group chief executive and the extent 
of that authority. In its goals policy, the board states the long-term
outcome and required results it expects the group chief executive 
to deliver. The restrictions on the manner in which the group chief
executive may achieve the required results are set out in the executive
limitations policy, which addresses internal control, risk preferences,
financing, ethical behaviour, health, safety, the environment, treatment

of employees and political considerations. Through the goals and
executive limitations policies, the board shapes BP’s values and
standards. On all these matters the board’s role is to set general 
policy and to monitor its observance by the group chief executive
throughout BP .
Accountability in our business
Our group chief executive outlines how he intends to deliver the
required outcome in annual and medium-term plans. The group chief
executive is obliged through dialogue and systematic review to discuss
with our board all material matters currently or prospectively affecting
the company and its performance. 
The board recognizes that, in the multitude of changing
circumstances, judgement is always involved. Governance and 
control systems are therefore designed to manage, rather than 
to eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve the board goals policy 
or observe the executive limitations policy. They provide reasonable,
not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Who is on the board?
The efficiency and effectiveness of the board are paramount. 
The board is composed of the chairman, 12 non-executive and 
six executive directors. In total, five nationalities are represented 
on the board. Directors’ biographies are set out on page 44. 
Governance policies and processes depend upon the quality 
and commitment of the people who operate them.
The qualification for board membership includes a requirement that all
non-executive directors be free from any relationship with the executive
management of the company that could materially interfere with the
exercise of their independent judgement. In the board’s view, all our
non-executive directors fulfil this requirement.
Serving as a director: induction, training and evaluation
Directors receive induction on their appointment covering matters such as
the operation and activities of the group (including key financial, business,
social and environmental risks to the group’s activities), the role of the
board and the matters reserved for its decision, the tasks and membership
of the principal board committees, and the latest financial information
about the group. Directors are updated on BP’s business, the environment
in which it operates and other matters throughout their period in office. 
Executive directors are permitted to take up an external board
appointment, subject to the agreement of our board. Non-executive
directors may serve on a number of outside boards, always provided
they continue to demonstrate the requisite commitment to discharge
effectively their duties to BP . 
Regular evaluation of board effectiveness underpins our confidence
in BP’s governance policies and processes and affords opportunity
for their development.
During 2004, our board continued its ongoing evaluation processes
to assess its performance and identify areas in which its effectiveness,
policies or processes might be enhanced. 
The chairman and senior independent director 
Between board meetings the chairman has responsibility for ensuring
the integrity and effectiveness of the board/executive relationship. Our
board governance policies require the chairman and deputy chairman 
to be non-executive directors; throughout 2004 the posts were held by
Mr Sutherland and Sir Ian Prosser respectively. Sir Ian also acts as our
senior independent director. The company secretary reports to the
chairman and is not part of the executive management. 
Board committees 
The board process policy allocates the tasks of monitoring executive
actions and assessing performance to certain board committees.
These tasks, which are summarized in the table below, prescribe 
the role and authority of the board committees. The company
secretary’s office provides advice and support to the board and 
all board committees, ensuring their processes are demonstrably
independent of the executive management.
Board and committee meetings 
In addition to the AGM, the board met eight times during 2004, 
five times in the UK, twice in the US and once in continental Europe.
Two of these meetings were two-day strategy discussions. 2004 
saw an increased number of committee meetings. The board requires
all members to devote sufficient time to the work of the board to
discharge the office of director and to use their best endeavours 
to attend meetings.

This is a summary of the directors’ remuneration report which is set out on pages 116-125 of BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004, a copy of
which shareholders may obtain, free of charge (see page 45).
Part 1 – Executive directors’ remuneration
Dear Shareholder 
2004 was a good year. Company results, as explained elsewhere, were excellent and the remuneration committee’s priority on relating pay to
performance is reflected in the annual bonus payments commensurate with this high level of achievement. These and all other aspects of the
executive directors’ remuneration during the year are set out in detail in the committee’s report that follows.
The committee also undertook a comprehensive and independent review of remuneration policy for the executive directors during 2004, 
prior to seeking your approval for the renewal of the long-term incentive plan at this year’s AGM (resolution 23). As part of this review, we
commissioned significant and wide-ranging academic research and sought the views of major shareholders in an effort to consider the fundamental
bases underlying our remuneration policies and practices. The depth and extensive nature of this review have meant that our policy and practices
are underpinned by a strong set of principles, which guide the committee’s deliberations. Full details of these are set out in the report.
Measures of performance lie at the heart of any performance-based system and we have, with extensive advice and considerable time,
examined different approaches. While there is no perfect measure, we believe the selected quantitative and qualitative measures are the most
appropriate for BP . Given the inherent imperfections of any measure of performance, we also see the use of our judgement as an integral part 
of the process. We recognize that our relationship with you is built on trust, and we are clear that it is important for us to be transparent in our
explanations to you of how we have reached decisions and exercised our discretion.
We have an excellent team of world-class executive directors leading the company. The remuneration decisions we have taken for 2004
appropriately reflect the high level of performance achieved during the year. The policy we have set out for the future should continue to align 
their remuneration with shareholders’ interests as well as to engage them in pursuing long-term shareholder value.
Sir Robin Nicholson Dr D S Julius
Chairman, Remuneration Committee Chairman elect, Remuneration Committee

The remuneration committee
Tasks include:
• Determining the terms of engagement and remuneration of the
group chief executive and the executive directors and reporting 
on those to the shareholders.
• Determining on behalf of the board matters of policy over which 
the company has authority relating to the establishment or operation
of the company’s pension scheme of which the executive directors
are members.
• Nominating on behalf of the board any trustees of such scheme.
• Monitoring the policies being applied by the group chief executive 
in remunerating senior executives other than executive directors.
Constitution and operation The committee members are all non-
executive directors. Sir Robin Nicholson (chairman), Mr Davis, Dr Julius,
Mr Knight and Sir Ian Prosser were members throughout the year, 
with Sir Tom McKillop and Mr Bryan joining them in November 2004. 
Sir Robin Nicholson and Mr Knight will both be retiring at the 2005
AGM and Dr Julius will become the committee chairman. Each
member is now subject to annual re-election as a director of the
company. The board considers all the members of the committee 
to be independent. 
Advice The committee receives independent advice from the company
secretary’s office, which is independent of executive management 
and reports to the chairman of the board. Mr Aronson, an independent
consultant, is the committee’s secretary and special adviser. The
committee also appoints other independent advisers to provide
additional specialist advice on particular matters.
Policy on executive directors’ remuneration
A key priority for the committee in 2004 has been its comprehensive
and independent review of all elements of remuneration policy for
executive directors prior to seeking specific shareholder approval for
renewal of the Executive Directors’ Incentive Plan, which expires in
2005. As part of this review, the committee developed the following
key principles to guide its policy:
• Policy for the remuneration of executive directors shall be determined
and regularly reviewed independently of executive management 
and will set the tone for the remuneration of other senior executives.
• The remuneration structure shall support and reflect BP’s stated
purpose to maximize long-term shareholder value.
• The remuneration structure shall reflect a just system of rewards 
for the participants.
• The overall quantum of all potential remuneration components 
Summary directors’ remuneration report BP Annual Review 2004
41
shall be determined by the exercise of informed judgement of 
the independent remuneration committee, taking into account 
the success of BP and the competitive global market.
• The majority of the remuneration shall be linked to the achievement
of demanding performance targets that are independently set and
reflect the creation of long-term shareholder value.
• Assessment of performance shall be quantitative and qualitative 
and shall include exercise of informed judgement by the committee
within a framework that takes account of sector characteristics 
and is approved by shareholders.
• The committee shall be proactive in obtaining an understanding 
of shareholder preferences.
• Remuneration policy and practices shall be as transparent as
possible both for participants and shareholders.
Key policy decisions The committee reviewed the existing
remuneration policies and plans against these principles, and the
following are some of its key policy decisions:
• The overall quantum of remuneration and the general balance
between short-term and long-term elements are to be maintained.
• Salary levels will continue to be reviewed regularly by reference 
to those in Europe-based top global companies and the US oil 
and gas sector, applying the committee’s judgement. 
• The long-term incentives framework of the existing Executive
Directors’ Incentive Plan (EDIP) remains sound, although some
changes to policy and application are now appropriate. Specific
shareholder approval is being sought for renewal of the EDIP 
for a further five years. Full details are contained in the further
information to resolution 23 in the notice of the 2005 AGM.
• The share element of the EDIP will provide the long-term
performance-based component of the executive directors’
remuneration package. There is no current intention to make 
further share options grants.
• The majority of the value previously attributed to share options 
is to be redistributed to the share element, with the remainder 
going to the annual bonus.
• The measure of long-term performance for the share element 
will be relative total shareholder return (TSR), compared with 
the other oil majors over three-year periods, with underlying 
relative performance also being assessed by the committee.
• A proportion of the share element for the current group chief
executive will be based on long-term personal leadership measures. 
• Maintain the shareholding requirement of 5 x directors’ base salary. 
Elements of remuneration The executive directors’ total remuneration
will continue to consist of salary, annual bonus, long-term incentives,
pensions and other benefits. In 2005, over three-quarters of executive
directors’ potential direct remuneration will again be performance-
related (see illustrative chart below).
This chart reflects on-target values for annual bonus and share element.
On-target remuneration elements
Base salary
Performance-related annual bonus
Performance-related share element
Salary The committee expects to review salaries in 2005. In doing 
so, the committee considers both Europe-based top global companies 
and the US oil and gas sector. 
Annual bonus Each executive director is eligible to participate in an
annual performance-based bonus scheme. The committee reviews 
and sets bonus targets and levels of eligibility annually.
The 2005 target level will be 120% of base salary (130% for 
the group chief executive). In normal circumstances, the maximum
payment level for substantially exceeding targets will continue 
to be 150% (165% for the group chief executive) of base salary. 
In exceptional circumstances, outstanding performance may be
recognized by bonus payments moderately in excess of the 150%
(165%) levels, at the discretion of the committee. Similarly, bonuses
may be reduced where the committee considers that this is warranted
and, in exceptional circumstances, bonuses can be reduced to zero.
The committee will explain any significant exercise of discretion in 
the subsequent directors’ remuneration report.
For 2005, the annual bonuses will be based on a mix of demanding
financial targets based on the company’s annual plan and leadership
objectives established at the beginning of the year. In addition to
strategic metrics and milestones, they include areas such as people,
safety, environment, technology and organization, as well as an
individual performance component.
Long-term incentives Long-term incentives will continue to be
provided under the EDIP . Each executive director participates in this
plan. The committee’s policy, subject to unforeseen circumstances, 
is that this should continue until the EDIP expires or is renewed in
2010. The committee’s policy that each executive director should 
hold shares equivalent in value to 5 x the director’s base salary is
reflected in the terms of the EDIP . It continues to have within its
framework three elements: a share element, a share option element
and a cash element. The committee does not currently intend to 
use either the share option or cash elements but, in exceptional
circumstances, may do so. 
Under the share element, the committee may make conditional
share awards (performance shares) to executive directors, which only
vest to the extent that, at the end of a three-year performance period,
a demanding performance condition is met. The maximum value that
may be awarded will be determined by the committee, and in any 
one year will not normally exceed 5.5 x base salary and, in the case of
the group chief executive, 7.5 x base salary. Shares awarded are then
held in trust for three years before they are released to the individual.
This gives the executive directors a six-year incentive structure. 
For share element awards in 2005 the performance condition will
relate to BP’s TSR against the other oil majors (ExxonMobil, Shell, 
Total and ChevronTexaco) over a three-year period. The committee
considers this to be the best measure of performance for the long-
term incentives for executive directors as it best reflects the creation

of long-term shareholder value. Shares under the award will vest as 
to 100%, 70% and 35% if BP achieves first, second or third place
respectively; no shares will vest if BP achieves fourth or fifth place. 
The committee will have the ability to exercise discretion in a
reasonable and informed manner to adjust (upwards or downwards) 
the vesting level derived from the ranking if it considers that the ranking
does not fairly reflect BP’s underlying business performance relative to
the comparator group. The exercise of this discretion would be made
after a broad analysis of the underlying health of BP’s business relative
to competitors, as shown by a range of other measures including, but
not limited to, return on average capital employed, earnings per share
growth, reserves replacement and cash flow. In line with its policy 
on transparency, the committee will explain any adjustment to the
relative TSR ranking in the next directors’ remuneration report 
following the vesting.
The committee reviews and approves annually the performance
measures and the comparator companies. A portion of the share
element for the group chief executive (up to 2 x base salary) will 
be based on long-term personal leadership measures, focusing 
on sustaining BP’s financial, strategic and organizational health. 
Pensions Executive directors are eligible to participate in the
appropriate pension schemes applying in their home countries.
UK directors are members of the BP Pension Scheme. The scheme 
offers Inland Revenue-approved retirement benefits based on final
salary. The committee will review the impact of the new proposals 
on pensions by the UK government and report further on the 
outcome next year. Lord Browne remains eligible for consideration 
for a payment from the company of an ex-gratia lump-sum
superannuation payment equal to one year’s base salary following 
his retirement. Further details are set out in BP Annual Report and
Accounts 2004. Dr Grote, as a US director, participates in the US BP
Retirement Accumulation Plan (US Plan), which features a cash balance
formula, and in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefit, which 
is a non-qualified top-up arrangement. 
Service contracts  The committee’s policy on executive directors’
service contracts is for them to contain a maximum notice period 
of one year. This policy has now been fully implemented.

Salary Base salaries for Lord Browne, Dr Allen, Dr Hayward and 
Mr Manzoni were increased by 5% per annum with effect from 
1 July 2004. Dr Grote’s salary was increased by approximately 15%
with effect from 1 July 2004 to reflect his expanded role, following 
the retirement of Mr Olver. 
Annual bonus The annual bonus awards for 2004 are based on 
a mix of financial targets and leadership objectives established 
at the beginning of the year. 2004 was an extremely good year.
Assessment of all the results produced an award of 150% of 
salary for the executive directors and 165% of salary for the group 
chief executive. All calculations have been reviewed by the auditors.
Share element of EDIP and Long T erm Performance Plans (LTPPs)
For the 2002-2004 share element of the EDIP and the LTPPs, BP’s
performance was assessed in terms of BP’s shareholder return 
against the market (SHRAM), return on average capital employed
(ROACE) and earnings per share (EPS) growth. BP’s SHRAM was
measured against the companies in the FTSE All World Oil & Gas
Index; BP’s ROACE and EPS growth relative to that of ExxonMobil,
Shell, Total and ChevronTexaco. Based on a performance assessment
of 75 points out of 200 (0 for SHRAM, 50 for ROACE and 25 for 
EPS growth), the committee expects to make awards of shares to
executive directors in 2005 as highlighted in the table on page 42.
Further details of share options and all long-term awards are set 
out in BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004.

constituent of both indices.
Part 2 – Non-executive directors’ remuneration
Non-executive directors’ remuneration (including that of the chairman)
is set by the board within limits approved from time to time by the
shareholders. An increase in this limit was approved at the 2004 AGM.
In setting the level and structure of remuneration within that limit, 
the board is guided by the need to attract and retain world-class 
non-executive directors, and to ensure that their reward is proportional
to their contribution to the company.
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment, which recognize
that, subject to the Articles of Association, their service is at the
discretion of shareholders. Their remuneration is in the form of cash fees,
paid monthly, with increments for positions of additional responsibility,
reflecting additional workload and consequent potential liability.
Non-executive directors are encouraged to establish a holding in 
BP shares broadly related to one year’s base fee. No share options 
are granted to non-executive directors.
Non-executive directors’ fee structure 
The current fee structure for non-executive directors, last revised
during 2002, is set out in the table below. All fees are fixed and paid 
in sterling.

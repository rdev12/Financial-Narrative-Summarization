ClearSpeed’s programmable processors have
been designed to meet the requirements 
of the world’s most compute-intensive
applications, enabling “supercomputing”
capabilities on affordable platforms
including clusters and workstations.
The CSX600 is designed as a co-processor 
to be used alongside general purpose
processors in HPC (high-performance
computer) applications. The technology
addresses the problem of power consumption
and heat generation within the processors.
This is acknowledged to be an increasingly
significant problem in creating high-
performance systems. Reducing processor
power can also reduce total cost of ownership
compared with current solutions.
The CSX600 can also provide a cost-effective
upgrade for existing systems.

Markets
High-performance computing 
Growth in demand for high-performance computers (HPC) is being driven 
by a combination of factors, two of which are particularly important. 
Firstly, HPC systems are no longer required just by government and academic
research laboratories, they are now also a critical tool in key industries which we
see as the wider commercial space for HPC and include important sectors such as: 
• Life Sciences & Biotechnology 
• Energy, Oil & Gas 
• Scientific Computing 
• Digital Content Creation 
• Financial Analysis & Modelling 
Secondly, while specialised systems such as IBM’s Blue Gene, or those from 
Cray, NEC and SGI, meet the need for special purpose systems at the very high
end, in the wider commercial space for HPC a fundamental change has occurred.
Here the use of standard processors, those that have delivered so much in terms
of the cost and capability of PC’s and servers, has come to dominate – for example,
in the year 2000, there were 4 Intel processor-based systems in the TOP500
supercomputer list, whereas in 2005 this had grown to 333.
As in other spaces, the use of these Central Processing Units (CPUs) has brought
HPC systems to a price point where they can be increasingly widely adopted by
these important industries. This has been made possible because companies such
as Intel and AMD have been so successful in exploiting “Moore’s Law” to deliver
CPUs in which performance has doubled approximately every two years. 
Applications
Life sciences & biotechnology
This is a rapidly growing market due to the need
to accelerate the testing of new drug candidates
based on the information made available by
sequencing the human genome. ClearSpeed 
is working with a number of organisations to
accelerate their applications. As part of the 
Tokyo Institute of Technology project, we are
porting amber – a package of molecular
simulation programmes.
Energy, oil & gas
When it costs over $5 million to drill 10,000 feet
below the earth’s surface, high-fidelity seismic
imaging is critical to minimise the risks.
ClearSpeed is committed to help solve the
computational challenges of high-resolution
seismic imaging. ClearSpeed’s roadmap for
delivering high-performance, low-power
streaming co-processors is an ideal enabler 
to the rapid adoption of industry-standard 
CPU-based systems.
In practice
“This is a significant
achievement by ClearSpeed.
We are very pleased that 
the company has chosen 
to demonstrate the potential
of the CSX600 on our
IntelliStation at Heidelberg.”
Dave Turek
Vice President of Deep Computing 
IBM
“We see ClearSpeed as
delivering a key technology
for the next wave of cluster
development and are
delighted that the value 
of this within Sun’s solutions
was immediately validated 
by the Tokyo Institute 
of Technology win.”

Scientific computing
Research institutions that depend on 
high-performance computing can use
ClearSpeed’s co-processors to accelerate 
existing clusters or workstations. ClearSpeed 
is developing maths libraries such as BLAS,
LAPACK, and FFT.
Digital content creation
With the need to render more complex models
using more sophisticated algorithms, the
processing requirements for visualisation are
increasing continuously. ClearSpeed’s processors
can accelerate these applications, bringing the
performance of a render farm to the desktop.
Applications include animation, physics
modelling, rendering and non-linear editing.
Financial analysis & modelling
Financial companies need to get accurate results
fast to minimise their risk. By accelerating the
analysis and processing of data, ClearSpeed’s
processors can speed the generation of results
and allow more sophisticated models to be used.
The requirement for performance that exceeds the rules of Moore’s Law has been
achieved by increasing the number of CPUs employed in a system. 
In HPC, while adding CPUs is the best solution for many users, there are costs in
terms of power consumption, cooling and space which, for other customers, drive
the need for a new class of processor. Such a processor, termed a “co-processor”
because it would be designed to run alongside and complement those general
purpose CPUs, enables the CPU to continue to do all of the mainstream
processing but off-load the particularly compute-intensive floating point
operations in which HPC performance is measured. 
ClearSpeed is focused on providing this new class of co-processor to a growing
market need, and is becoming increasingly recognised as a leader in the market. 
Embedded systems 
Although ClearSpeed designs its processors primarily to meet the needs of the
HPC market, it has also seen interest within Embedded Systems markets. These
are markets in which systems are not designed as conventional computers but
have intense processing requirements; for example those used in medical
imaging systems.
“Intel’s leading processor-
based HPC platforms are 
the most widely deployed
across high-performance
computing. We see
ClearSpeed’s CSX600 
as a complementary
architecture enhancing
solutions for industries 
such as engineering design,
bio-sciences and research.”
Ben Bennett
Manager of Intel’s world wide 
HPC Program Office
“ClearSpeed’s CSX600
delivers impressive
computational performance
per watt… Combined 
with industry-standard
processors, users can create
accelerated systems with

ClearSpeed Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Chairman’s statement
Introduction
ClearSpeed made considerable 
progress during 2005, achieving a
number of significant milestones in 
its markets and product development
whilst at the same time containing
costs. These included delivering the
world’s highest performance processor
for 64-bit floating point operations, 
and culminated in December in both
the group’s first commercial product 
– the Advance
™
Board – becoming
available, and a successful fundraising
which has placed the group in the
position of being well funded to 
address a potentially substantial 
market opportunity. 
Financial results
The group was successful in controlling
both its costs and cash, while at the
same time undertaking a substantial
product development programme and
achieving the steady building-out of the
other capabilities needed to support
the increasing level of commercial
activities. The year finished in line with
group expectations: the retained loss
was £6,412,000 and the cash outflow
from operations was £6,824,000.
Turnover increased to £439,000 for the
year, compared to £247,000 for the
previous year. The growth in revenues
principally occurred towards the end 
of the year when the group’s first
commercial product began to ship 
to customers. The revenue for the
second half of the year was £293,000.
The group finished the year with a
significantly strengthened balance sheet
following the raising of approximately
£20,070,000 (net of expenses) by way
of a placing. 
Technical progress
Since ClearSpeed floated on AIM 
in July 2004, the group has made
considerable progress in achieving 
its technical goals.
During 2005, a key focus was the
continued development of the group’s
first commercial products: the CSX600
processor and the Advance
™
Board
which has two CSX600 processors. 
The CSX600 was demonstrated for 
the first time at the International
Supercomputer Conference at
Heidelberg in June, and is both the
world’s highest performance 64-bit
floating point processor and the world’s
most power-efficient processor for
these performance levels. 
Commercial progress
Following the important milestone 
at Heidelberg in June, in August the
group was invited by Intel to co-present
at the Intel Developer Forum in San
Francisco on the use of the CSX600
with Intel processors running Intel’s
Math Kernel Library. In November, 
the group demonstrated the Advance
™
Board at the Supercomputing
Conference in Seattle and was very
pleased that demonstrations of this
board was also given on the stands of
AMD, IBM, Intel and Sun Microsystems.
“The order from Sun Microsystems for the Tokyo 
Institute of Technology is a significant milestone 
in the group’s development.”
Chairman’s
statement ClearSpeed Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Chairman’s statement
05
On 15 November 2005, the first day 
of that conference, the Tokyo Institute
of Technology announced that
ClearSpeed, as part of a consortium 
led by NEC and Sun Microsystems, had
been selected to deliver Japan’s highest
performance supercomputer. Sun has
announced that, in its first phase, this
computer will use 360 ClearSpeed
Advance
™
Boards. 
Offering power-efficient performance
and using 96 cores in its CSX600
processor, the group was also pleased
that 2005 was the year in which
performance per watt was identified 
as “the new metric” for the industry, 
and that multicore processing became
established as a dominant trend in the
continued development of processors
for the computing industry.
Board
During 2005 the board made two 
key appointments. In September 
Paul Webb, who has extensive
experience in technology companies,
was appointed chief financial officer.
Also in September, Shanker Trivedi was
appointed as a non-executive director.
Shanker has recently joined Callidus
Software as vice-president and chief
marketing officer, and previously was
vice-president of datacentre solutions
for Sun Microsystems Inc. and before
that vice-president and managing
director of Sun Microsystems in 
the UK.
Outlook
I am pleased to report that since 
the end of 2005 the group has
continued to make valuable progress.
The order from Sun Microsystems for
the Tokyo Institute of Technology has
been shipped, which is a significant
milestone in the group’s development.
At the same time, discussions with
other customers are progressing
satisfactorily. 
As a result of the recent fundraising, 
the successful development and
demonstration of the CSX600 processor,
and the increasing commercial activity,
the board believes that ClearSpeed 
is well placed to make further
substantial progress.

Chief Executive Officer’s review
Overview
The strategic priority for ClearSpeed 
as it entered 2005 was to commence
the transition from its technology
development phase to beginning 
to build out a fully-fledged business.
Throughout the year the group made
considerable progress in achieving 
this goal. 
ClearSpeed made significant progress 
in its technical development and won
its first high-performance computing
system customer. It launched and
commenced shipping its first commercial
product: the Advance
™
Board containing
two CSX600 processors. The group
believes that an increased awareness 
of and interest in its technology from
potential partners and customers is
confirmation that it is potentially well
placed to exploit major trends within 
the industry. 
Costs were contained and cash outflows
from operations were in line with group
expectations. The successful fundraising
will enable ClearSpeed to capitalise 
on and develop its position as the
designer and supplier of the world’s
fastest and most power-efficient
multicore processor for 64-bit floating
point operations.
Market opportunity
Growth in demand for high-performance
computers (HPC) is being driven by 
a combination of factors, two of which
are particularly important. 
Firstly, HPC systems are no longer
required just by government and
academic research laboratories, 
they are now also a critical tool in 
key industries which we see as the
wider commercial space for HPC and
include important sectors such as: 
• Aerospace and Automotive
• Life Sciences & Biotechnology 
• Energy, Oil & Gas 
• Scientific Computing 
• Digital Content Creation 
• Financial Analysis & Modelling 
Secondly, while specialised systems
such as IBM’s Blue Gene, or those from
Cray, NEC and SGI, meet the need for
special-purpose systems at the very
high end, in the wider commercial
space for HPC a fundamental change
has occurred. Here the use of standard
processors, those that have delivered 
so much in terms of the cost and
capability of PCs and servers, has come
to dominate. 
ClearSpeed’s strategy of supplying its
technology to the HPC market through
Advance
™
Boards requires no chip
integration and also allows for systems
upgrades to be easily accommodated,
both retrospectively and for new cluster
systems. In addition to the existing
installed base of HPC cluster systems,
analysts estimate that 150,000 HPC
cluster systems were delivered in 2004
and are forecast to rise to 220,000 HPC
cluster systems in 2007. Through
ClearSpeed’s channel partners in the US
and Far East, the directors are confident
that ClearSpeed’s technology will be
selected for other new HPC projects.

07
The group’s strategy of engaging 
with independent software vendors 
and suppliers to port code to the
ClearSpeed processor complements 
its “Plug and Play” strategy in removing
barriers to adoption. Workstation users
with compute-intensive requirements,
such as computer-aided design and
engineering, can access the group’s
technology using the group’s Advance
™
Board. The group has entered into
informal partnerships with various
independent software vendors, and at
the Supercomputing Conference in
Seattle in November 2005 demonstrated
its technology with Mathematica and
MATLAB
®
software packages. These
software packages alone are estimated
to have at least one million users, 
some of whom are expected to have
sufficiently intense computing needs 
to require the processing acceleration
delivered by ClearSpeed’s solutions.
Within the embedded systems market,
the group has also had some initial
commercial success. For example, 
a UK-based defence systems vendor 
has entered into ClearSpeed’s partner
programme for a project, which has 
the potential to result in orders for
thousands of processors.
Technical development
It was a major milestone for the group
that in June 2005 it demonstrated its
first commercial processor, the CSX600. 
Offering up to a sustained performance
of 25 billion 64-bit floating point
operations per second (25GFLOPS), 
the CSX600 is the world’s highest
performance processor for this type 
of compute-intensive work. Achieving
this performance level while consuming
less than 10 watts, the CSX600 is 
also the world’s most power-efficient
processor for this type of application
area. Delivering a processor of this
capability was a very significant
achievement of the whole team 
in 2005. 
The key benefit of such high levels 
of performance (when delivered so
power-efficiently and in a processor
which is complementary to the main
processors from companies such as
AMD, IBM and Intel) is that, by lowering
both the cost of purchase and the cost
of ownership of high-performance and
technical computing systems, the
CSX600 enables teams – in industries 
as diverse as aerospace, financials, 
and oil and gas – to achieve new levels
of accuracy in a much shorter time 
than might previously have been
economically affordable for them,
making a direct contribution to their
productivity, time to market and
competitive advantage.
Business development and build-out
The value proposition offered by the
CSX600 and the group’s Advance
™
Board, each of which contains two
CSX600 processors, was increasingly
recognised during 2005, and this 
led to the group having discussions 
and engagements with numerous
customers and channel partners
including Sun Microsystems and NEC.
The group was also pleased to find that
its pricing assumptions for such a value
proposition were also validated, and the
announcement on 15 November 2005
that ClearSpeed was selected by the
Tokyo Institute of Technology as part 
of a consortium, led by NEC and 
Sun Microsystems, to develop Japan’s
largest supercomputer was a further
major milestone. The order for boards
for this system was received by the
group in 2005 and was worth
approximately $2 million.
While keeping costs lower than
expected during the period, the 
group has continued to develop 
the capabilities needed to deliver 
its products to market. ClearSpeed 
has successfully developed a supply
chain with partners in the US, who 
all have the ability to handle volume
manufacturing. ClearSpeed 
has also strengthened its marketing 
and customer support capability. 
Team
It is through the talent and commitment
of the whole team that so much has
been achieved, both technically and
commercially, in 2005. The group
aspires to recruit and retain very
talented individuals throughout the
functions that it is developing, and to
be a rewarding place in which to work.
The group was therefore pleased that in
2005 it continued to be able to recruit
key individuals in both the USA and the
UK and that turnover within the team
continues to be very low.
Trading
The principal influences on the financial
performance of ClearSpeed during
2005 were the continued investment 
in research and development, 
a building-out of the business reflected 
in an increase in marketing and
administrative expenses and an
increase in working capital to support
the increasing sales activity. The
retained loss for 2005 was £6,412,000,
up from a loss of £3,753,000 for 2004.
Turnover for 2005 was £439,000, 
an increase of 78% on the 2004 
figure of £247,000. This increase is as 
a result of the sale of Advance
™
Boards,
following their release to market during
the fourth quarter. The gross margin for
2005 was 66% (2004: 58%), reflecting
both the sales price levels achieved at
low volumes and the manufacturing
costs associated with low throughput.  08
ClearSpeed Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Chief Executive Officer’s review
Chief 
Executive 
Officer’s 
review 
continued
“The group was successful in meeting most of its goals 
in 2005, and has created a platform from which to continue
this progress in 2006.”
Whilst administrative expenses
increased to £7,378,000 in 2005 from
£4,408,000 in 2004, the business
continued to operate with a lean model
throughout the period. Investment 
in the product roadmap continued,
resulting in research, design and
development expenses for 2005 
being £4,677,000. Marketing and
administrative expenses for 2005 were
£2,701,000, up by £919,000 on the
2004 expenses of £1,782,000. The
majority of the increase was incurred 
in the second half of 2005 when
expenses increased by 73% to reflect
the building-out of sales, marketing 
and customer support activities
following the commercial launch 
of the group’s first product.
Cash flow and fundraising
The continued investment in research
and development and the growth in
marketing and administrative expenses
were the principal reasons for the cash
outflow from operating activities being
£6,824,000 for 2005, up from
£4,238,000 for 2004. 
Purchase of tangible fixed assets 
in 2005 was £321,000 compared to
£84,000 in 2004. Office and computer
equipment with a cost of £216,000 
was purchased to support the new
headcount, which increased from an
average of 35 employees in 2004 to 
54 employees in 2005. Additionally,
with the launch to production of the
company’s first commercial product,
the Advance
™
Board, tooling costing
£105,000 was incurred.
During December 2005, ClearSpeed
raised approximately £20,070,000 
(net of expenses) by way of a placing.
The new funds will be used to: 
• Consolidate the group’s position 
as the designer and supplier of the
world’s fastest and most power-
efficient multicore microprocessor 
for 64-bit floating point performance
• Provide additional working capital 
to finance the commencement of
volume shipments of the group’s 
first products, the CSX600 processor
and Advance
™
Board
• Increase the rate of investment in the
group’s sales and marketing effort
• Increase investment in product
development
• Strengthen the group’s balance sheet
Working capital
The commencement of production of
the group’s first commercial products
resulted in an investment of £251,000
in stock at the end of 2005 (2004: nil).
Trade debtors increased to £173,000 at
the end of 2005, an increase of £89,000
on the balance at the end of 2004,
reflecting the increase in turnover.
The renewal of computer-aided design
licenses during December was the
principal reason for trade creditors
being £922,000 at the end of 2005, 
an increase of £628,000 over the
comparable figure for 2004. The
majority of this expenditure was 
carried forward as a prepayment 
at the end of 2005.
Taxation
Tax credits of £391,000 relating to
research and development activities
were received and credited to the 
profit and loss account during 2005
compared to £275,000 for the 
previous year.
At the end of 2005 the group had 
an unrecognised deferred tax asset 
of £11,400,000 (2004: £9,500,000)
resulting mainly from tax losses. This is
available indefinitely to offset against
future taxable profits of the same trade.
Accounting Standards developments
In June 2003, the Council of the
European Union adopted regulations
requiring listed companies in Member
States to prepare their consolidated
financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) from 2005. In 
2004 it was decided that AIM-listed
companies do not need to file their
accounts under IFRS until 2007. The
group has decided to adopt IFRS for
2007 reporting and accordingly the 
first financial results to be announced
prepared in accordance with IFRS 
will be for the first half of 2007.
Accounting standard FRS20, covering
the accounting and reporting of
employee stock options, is required to
be adopted for 2006, and as a result the
financial results for the first half of 2006
will be prepared on this basis.
Summary
Focused on commencing the transition
from its technology development phase
to beginning to build out a fully-fledged
business, the group was successful in
meeting the majority of its goals in
2005, and there is good reason to
believe that this has created a platform
from which to continue this progress
during 2006.

ClearSpeed Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Directors’ report 
Directors’ report 
The directors present their report and the financial statements of the group and company for the year ended 
31 December 2005.
Principal activities and review of the business
The principal activity of the group during the year was that of the research, design and development of semiconductor
processors and Advance
™
Boards for multiple markets and the launch and sale of its first commercial product. On 
15 November 2005 ClearSpeed was selected by the Tokyo Institute of Technology as part of a consortium, led by NEC and 
Sun Microsystems, to develop Japan’s largest supercomputer, which resulted in an order being received for 360 Advance
™
Boards, for delivery in 2006.
Results and dividends
The trading results for the year, and the group’s and company’s financial position at the end of the year, are shown on 
pages 20 to 23. The directors’ report should be read in conjunction with the chairman’s statement on page 4 and the 
chief executive officer’s review on page 6 which include information about the group’s business performance during the
year and an indication of future prospects.
The directors have not recommended a dividend (2004: nil). The group has no plans to adopt a dividend policy in the
foreseeable future. It is the directors’ intention that all funds generated by the group will be invested in the development 
of the business, as is usual for a business in this industry sector and at this stage of development.
Research, design and development
The group is committed to the research, design and development of semiconductor processors for multiple markets. 
The costs relating to this are written off as incurred. In the year, such costs incurred amounted to £4,677,000 (2004: £2,626,000).
Additional funding
An Extraordinary General Meeting convened on 28 December 2005 approved the placing in aggregate of 10,097,560 new
ordinary shares of 1 pence each at a price of 205 pence. The placing raised £20,070,000 net of expenses. The placing shares
were equivalent to approximately 31.1% of the company’s existing share capital and represent approximately 23.7% of the
enlarged issued share capital.
Going concern
The board is satisfied that the group has adequate financial resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future 
and is financially sound. For this reason, the going concern basis is considered appropriate for the preparation of 
financial statements.

Corporate governance report
Corporate governance report
Compliance with the Combined Code 
As an AIM-listed company, there is no requirement to give a corporate governance report. However, the group recognises
the importance of good corporate governance. The principles and provisions of the Combined Code 2003 have been
considered by the board. The group does not comply with all aspects of the Combined Code, but has adopted it to the
extent the directors consider appropriate for a group of its size and nature. Accordingly, the group has established an audit
committee, a remuneration committee and a nominations committee.
Composition and operation of the board
The board is responsible for the direction and overall performance of the group with emphasis on policy matters, strategy,
financial performance and major operational issues. The board meets at least ten times per year and a meeting timetable is
agreed annually. The board currently comprises the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer and four non-executive
directors, of whom one, David Sebire, is the non-executive chairman.
Audit committee
The audit committee comprises the four non-executive directors (though not necessarily independent). This committee 
is chaired by David Sebire. It is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the group is properly reported 
on and monitored, and for reviewing the auditors’ reports relating to accounts and internal control systems.
Remuneration and nominations committees
The remuneration and nominations committees also comprised the four non-executive directors (though not necessarily
independent) and were chaired by David Sebire. On 9 March 2006, David Sebire resigned from the remuneration committee
and John Hart became its chairman. The remuneration committee is responsible for the review and recommendation of the
scale and structure of remuneration for executive directors including the award of share options. Additionally the committee is
also consulted on and reviews the remuneration proposals for senior management positions. The nominations committee
will consider any future appointments to the board.
Internal control/risk management
The directors are responsible for the group’s internal controls, and have established a framework intended to provide
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material financial misstatement or loss.
Relationships with shareholders
The chief executive officer and chief financial officer meet on a regular basis with representatives of institutional shareholders
to discuss their views and to ensure that the strategies and objectives of the group are well understood. Issues discussed
with institutional shareholders include the group’s performance and the impact of any major developments. The group 
also has a website which provides information on the group’s aims, and includes a separate investor information section on
which financial data and other significant announcements are published. The website can be found at www.clearspeed.com.

Remuneration committee report (unaudited)
Remuneration committee 
The remuneration and emoluments of executive directors are determined by the remuneration committee, which
comprised the four non-executive directors chaired by David Sebire. On 9 March 2006, David Sebire resigned from this
committee and John Hart became its chairman. The remuneration committee performs its duties under formal terms of
reference, which include determining, on behalf of the board, the group’s broad policy for executive remuneration and the
individual remuneration packages (including pension rights, annual bonus plans and share option grants) of each of the
executive directors. No director or manager is involved in any decision as to his or her own remuneration. The committee 
is also consulted on and notified of all senior management appointments and related remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The group’s policy on directors’ remuneration is that the overall remuneration package should be sufficiently competitive 
to attract, retain and motivate high-quality executives capable of achieving the group’s objectives and thereby enhancing
shareholder value. The package consists of basic salary, benefits, share options, performance-related bonuses and pensions,
with a proportion based on performance and dependent upon the achievement of demanding targets. 
The group has adopted a share-dealing code for directors and relevant employees in accordance with the AIM rules and will
take proper steps to ensure compliance by the directors and those employees.
Incentive arrangements
It is expected that ClearSpeed will continue to grow its team and that the granting of further options over ordinary shares
will be an important aspect of the group’s ability to attract, retain and incentivise key staff. Accordingly, the company has
authority to grant options to subscribe up to 10% of the company’s issued ordinary share capital in any rolling ten-year
period. Options are granted to directors and employees at the discretion of the remuneration committee and, where determined
as appropriate, such grants may be subject to performance criteria. More detailed information on the share option
schemes is given in Note 19 to the accounts. In addition, within its incentivisation arrangement, the company provides 
for performance-related bonus payments to certain employees, including those connected with the group’s business
development. As disclosed in the prospectus at the time of IPO, the chief executive officer has performance-related bonus
entitlements of up to 60% of annual salary as well as a grant of options over 1,623,503 shares (made in 2004) related to 
both share price performance and the achieving of business milestones.
Pensions
The group makes contributions equivalent to 10% of each of the executive directors’ annual basic salaries into personal
pension plans of the executive directors’ choice. For other employees the group operates a defined contribution pension
scheme to which it makes contributions of 7.5% of annual basic salary.

The Remuneration Committee will review the performance conditions at intervals to ensure they remain appropriate. As a result of any such review 
the Committee may amend or waive the conditions if events occur which cause the Committee to reasonably consider that it would be a fairer 
measure of performance to amend or waive the conditions to ensure they achieve the original purpose.
(2) There have been no changes in directors’ options since 31 December 2005.
(3) No directors have exercised any options during the year.
(4) The non-executive directors are valuable individuals and the share options are granted in recognition of their contribution to the business.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
in relation to the financial statements
Company law requires the directors to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the company and group at the end of the year and of the profit or loss for the year then ended.
In preparing those accounts, the directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies, and then apply them consistently
•make judgements and estimates that are prudent and reasonable
•state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements
•prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue 
in business
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the company and the group and to enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies
Act 1985. The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and the group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. ClearSpeed Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Independent auditors’ report 
19
Independent auditors’ report 
to the members of ClearSpeed Technology Plc
We have audited the group and parent company’s financial statements of ClearSpeed Technology plc for the year ended 
31 December 2005 which comprise the group profit and loss account, group balance sheet, company balance sheet, 
group cash flow statement, group statement of total recognised gains and losses and the related notes 1 to 26. These
financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, including the financial statements which are required to be
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom law and applicable United Kingdom accounting standards as set out in the
statement of directors’ responsibilities in relation to the financial statements.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent
with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and transactions with the group is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. This other information comprises the directors’ report, chairman’s statement, chief executive officer’s review,
remuneration committee’s report and corporate governance statement. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted
accounting practice, of the state of affairs of the company and of the group as at 31 December 2005 and the loss of the
group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the financial statements
Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2005
1. Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis under the historical cost convention and in
accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
ClearSpeed Technology Plc (“Technology”) was incorporated on 21 June 2004 for the purpose of achieving admission to
trading on AIM of the existing business of ClearSpeed Solutions Limited (“Solutions”). This was effected by a share-for-share
exchange on 1 July 2004 between the shareholders of these two companies. On the same day the business and assets of Solutions
were purchased by Technology for a consideration of £13,678,641. On 21 July 2004 the company raised approximately
£10.2 million via the issue of shares, net of expenses, and was admitted to trading on AIM. 
The transaction qualified as a group reconstruction within the meaning of FRS6 “Acquisitions and Mergers”, and has been
accounted for using the merger accounting method. 
The consolidated accounts incorporate the accounts of the company and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 
31 December 2005. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts on the date from which control passes.
The group has adopted FRS21 “Events after the balance sheet date”, FRS22 “Earnings per share”, FRS25 “Financial instruments:
disclosure and presentation” and FRS28 “Corresponding amounts” during the year.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption in S230 (3) of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own profit
and loss account.
2. Accounting policies
Turnover
The turnover shown in the profit and loss account represents revenue recognised during the year, excluding VAT. Revenue
from the sale of computer processors and boards is recognised when delivery has occurred. Revenue on any associated
software licence fees is recognised when delivery of the software has occurred, provided that a signed agreement is in place,
the licence fee is fixed and determinable, no specific modification of the software is required, and that the collection of the
fee is probable. Revenues from support agreements are recognised over the term of the contract.
Intangible assets and amortisation
Purchased patents and external costs of the group’s own patent applications are capitalised at cost. Amortisation is calculated
so as to write off the cost of an intangible fixed asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that
asset, which is estimated at 5 years, on a straight-line basis.
The carrying value of intangible assets is regularly reviewed and any provision for impairment in value is charged to the
profit and loss account.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are capitalised at purchase cost plus incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of a tangible fixed asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful
economic life of that asset as follows:
Plant and machinery – 3 years straight line
Computer equipment – 3 years straight line
Office equipment – 5 years straight line
The carrying value of tangible fixed assets is reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying
value may not be recoverable.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment in value. ClearSpeed Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Notes to the financial statements
25
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor
are charged against profits on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
Pension costs
The group provides a defined contribution Group Personal Pension scheme, with a choice between five providers. Pension
costs are charged to the profit and loss account on the basis of the amount of contributions payable to these schemes in
respect of the accounting year. 
Taxation
Corporation tax is recognised at amounts expected to be paid/recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Tax credits arising on R&D activities are recognised when 
it is virtually certain that a refund will be made, being the earlier of receipt of the cash or notification of the credit.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet
date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay les s
or to receive more, tax, with the following exceptions:
• provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets, or gains
on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet
date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis
of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into
replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold
• deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there
will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted
• deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance
sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future has
been entered into by the subsidiary
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Stock
Stock is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Provision is made for slow-moving, obsolete or defective items
where appropriate. Stock is valued on a FIFO basis.
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date 
of the transaction. Exchange differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result.
The accounts of ClearSpeed Technology Inc. are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
The exchange difference arising on the retranslation of opening net assets is taken directly to reserves. The profit and loss
account is translated at the average rate of exchange for the year, with any exchange differences arising being treated 
as a movement on reserves on consolidation. All other translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Research, design and development expenditure 
Research, design and development expenditure is written off in the accounting period of expenditure.
Grant income
Grant income is credited to the profit and loss account when it is virtually certain that the income will be received, being the
earlier of receipt of the cash and notification of the credit. 26

9. Tax 
(a) Tax on loss on ordinary activities
The tax credit is made up as follows:
2005 2004
£000 £000
Current tax:
Credit in respect of previous year – R&D tax credit (391) (275)
Tax on loss on ordinary activities (391) (275)
(b) Factors affecting current tax credit
The tax assessed on the loss on ordinary activities for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 
of 30% (2004: 30%). The differences are reconciled below:
2005 2004
£000 £000
Loss on ordinary activities before tax (6,803) (4,028)
Loss on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate 
of corporation tax in the UK of 30% (2004: 30%) (2,041) (1,209)
Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 2 39
Decelerated capital allowances 32 21
Short-term timing differences 34 18
Losses arising in the year not relievable 1,973 1,131
Credit in respect of previous year (391) (275)
Total current tax (see note 9(a)) (391) (275)
(c) Factors that may affect future tax charges
The group has a deferred tax asset at the balance sheet date of £11.4 million (2004: £9.5 million) which consists mainly 
of unrelieved tax losses (see note 16). The deferred tax asset has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence that
there will be suitable profits against which the underlying timing differences can be offset.

The deferred tax asset has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence that there will be suitable profits against
which the underlying timing differences can be offset.
17. Financial instruments
The group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources and these are used to finance the group’s
operations. The group’s objectives in using financial instruments are to maximise the returns on funds held on deposit, 
to minimise exchange rate risk where appropriate, and to generate additional cash resources through the issue of shares
when appropriate.
It is the group’s policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the following disclosures, other than currency risk disclosures, 
as permitted by FRS13 “Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures”.
Foreign currency risk
The group has foreign currency exposures, which consist of the monetary assets and liabilities of the group, including those
with Clearspeed Technology Inc. in the US.
As at 31 December these currency exposures are as follows:
US$ Euro Total
£000 £000 £000
2005
Sterling (204) 8 (196)
2004
Sterling (124) – (124)
Interest rate risk and liquidity risk of the group’s financial assets
The group is principally funded with equity and invests its funds in short-term bank deposits, with access to these deposits
at a maximum of 30 days’ notice. The group’s policy is to minimise the risk by placing funds in low-risk cash deposits but 
to also maximise the return on funds placed on deposit.
Interest rate profile of the group’s financial assets
The only financial asset of the group is cash. Interest rates on overnight cash deposits are at a variable rate connected 
to LIBOR.
Interest rate risk profile of the group’s financial liabilities
The group had no financial liabilities at 31 December 2005 (2004: nil).
Borrowing facilities
The group had no borrowing facilities at 31 December 2005 (2004: nil). 32

17. Financial instruments (continued)
Fair values
The directors consider there to be no material difference between the fair value and the carrying values of the financial
instruments at the balance sheet dates.
Market price risk
The principal market price risk comprises interest rate exposure. Funds are invested in money market cash deposits with the
objective of maintaining a balance between accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return. The group’s exposure to
any rise in interest rates is not significant, as the group has no financial liabilities that would be affected by such a rise.
18. Commitments
The group had purchase commitments at 31 December 2005 of £1,830,000 (2004: nil).
The group and company had annual commitments under non-cancellable operating leases as set out below.

19. Share capital (continued)
On 1 July 2004, 652,363,881 ordinary shares were issued to the former shareholders of ClearSpeed Solutions Limited to
acquire the entire issued share capital of ClearSpeed Solutions Limited.
On 15 July 2004, of each holding of 40 ordinary shares, 39 ordinary shares were converted and redesignated as 1p deferred
shares. The company purchased the 636,054,779 1p deferred shares for an aggregate consideration of 1p, funded from 
the proceeds of the issue of one ordinary share at par. The authorised but unissued deferred shares were converted into
authorised but unissued ordinary shares. 640,000,000 of the authorised but unissued ordinary shares were then cancelled.
11,554,428 new ordinary shares were issued for £10.2m, net of share issue costs, in July 2004 in relation to the successful
application for admission to AIM. 10,418 new ordinary shares were issued to employees in the placing at 96p per share.
4,606,537 new ordinary shares were issued to the ClearSpeed Technology Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) in July 2004 at par.
Share option schemes
The Enterprise Management Incentive Plan (EMI Plan) was used for the grant of options prior to Admission. This plan
complies with the provision of Schedule 5 Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. Following admission, no further
grants will be made under it. Options, which were granted under the EMI Plan, were exchanged for new equivalent options
over the company’s ordinary shares on Admission.
Since Admission to AIM, option grants have been made under a new plan known as the ClearSpeed Technology Plc Share
Option Plan. This plan provides for the grant of EMI options, unapproved options and tax-approved incentive stock options
for US employees.
The EMI Plan
The exercise price is determined by the board but, in the case of options to subscribe, must be not less than the nominal
value of a share. The date and conditions of exercise of the options are set out in the individual participant’s option
agreement. Unexercised options lapse on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
The exercise of options may be subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions as determined by the board from time
to time.
The EMI plan will terminate on 30 May 2012, or earlier if the board so resolves.
The ClearSpeed Technology plc Share Option Plan
The Plan has three parts. The first part complies with the provisions of Schedule 5 Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act
2003 relating to Enterprise Management Incentive Options (EMI). The second part is designed to grant options on similar
terms, but is unapproved and accordingly is not subject to EMI requirements and does not benefit from the tax advantages
associated with EMI. The third part enables Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) to be granted to US tax-resident employees on
similar terms, subject to any modifications required to take account of US tax, exchange control or regulatory requirements.
The arrangements for distributing share options and the exercise of those options are the same as those for the EMI plan. 34

19. Share capital (continued)
The ClearSpeed Technology Employee Benefit Trust (EBT)
On 29 June 2004 the ClearSpeed Technology Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) was created. The sponsoring company was
ClearSpeed Solutions Limited. The EBT was set up to assist ClearSpeed Solutions Limited to satisfy its obligations in respect
of options issued to employees.
The obligations of ClearSpeed Solutions Limited in respect of the previously issued options were transferred to ClearSpeed
Technology plc as part of the hive-up of assets and liabilities on 1 July 2004. ClearSpeed Technology plc became the
sponsoring company of the EBT at this time. On Admission to AIM, the EBT subscribed £46,065 to purchase 4,606,537
ordinary shares in ClearSpeed Technology plc at 1p per share. The issue of new shares to the EBT was facilitated by a loan
provided by Clearspeed Technology plc. The market value of these ordinary shares on Admission was 96p. The EBT will
continue to be used to hold the purchased shares to satisfy the obligations of ClearSpeed Technology plc as employees
exercise the options over the vesting period. The EBT is administered by a professional trustee company based in Jersey.
At 31 December 2005 the EBT held 4,440,831 (2004: 4,563,257) ordinary shares with a market value of £2.64 (2004: £2.165)
per share. These shares include 1,517,944 (2004: 2,008,750), with a market value of £4,007,372 (2004: £4,348,944), which
have not yet vested unconditionally with employees.
Included in the profit and loss reserve is a debit of £44,508 (2004: £45,633) representing the cost of the 4,440,831 
(2004: 4,563,257) shares held by the EBT at year-end.

income from this grant amounting to £27,000 (2004: £129,000). The terms of the grant are such that it is repayable in full in
the event that the company fails to meet certain conditions for a period of five years following the end of the project which is
the subject of the grant. Accordingly there is a contingent liability of £156,000 (2004: £129,000) in respect of this amount. ClearSpeed Annual Report and Accounts 2005

ClearSpeed’s programmable processors have
been designed to meet the requirements 
of the world’s most compute-intensive
applications, enabling “supercomputing”
capabilities on affordable platforms
including clusters and workstations.
The CSX600 is designed as a co-processor 
to be used alongside general purpose
processors in HPC (high-performance
computer) applications. The technology
addresses the problem of power consumption
and heat generation within the processors.
This is acknowledged to be an increasingly
significant problem in creating high-
performance systems. Reducing processor
power can also reduce total cost of ownership
compared with current solutions.
The CSX600 can also provide a cost-effective
upgrade for existing systems.

Chairman’s report
Chairman’s report
Despite a challenging
business climate, the 
Group reported a profit in 
line with market forecasts
and a balance sheet
strengthened with strong
cash generation.
strong
relationships
The Group reports a profit before tax and net exceptional
income of £1.5m (2001: £1.5m on continuing operations);
this is in line with market forecasts. Lower garment sales
prices and reduced lace sales were responsible for the
slightly reduced turnover at £40.1m (2001: £41.4m on
continuing operations). The balance sheet strengthened
with year end cash resources of £3.8m (£0.4m net of debt
at the start of the year). 
Following the Group’s capital re-organisation scheme
approved by shareholders on 20 May 2002, the Board is
recommending a dividend of 0.25 pence per ordinary share,
to be paid on 2 June 2003 subject to shareholder approval.
The results have been achieved despite a challenging
business climate, characterised by intense retail competition
and consequent retailer pressure to reduce garment
supplier prices, together with a further fall in lace sales. 
The Group has responded to the price challenge in
partnership with its suppliers and customers, and has
broadly maintained its margins.
The Directors were pleased to announce the appointment
of Carol Duncumb as Group Chief Executive in November
2002. Carol brings with her a considerable knowledge 
of the clothing industry and is already having a positive 
impact on operations with a high level of energy and
enthusiasm. The Group’s staff have responded
magnificently to this welcome and necessary change of
style and culture. Further management changes have 
been made strengthening the Group’s design and
commercial resources in areas of growth potential.
Carol’s appointment followed the dismissal of the Group’s
former Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive, Michael
Basford, on 25 September 2002. He left with immediate
effect and no compensation of any sort was involved.  Sherwood Group plc
03
Annual report and accounts 2002
Chairman’s report
Mr Basford has not pursued any claim against the Group 
in respect of the circumstances surrounding his departure.
The Group is currently investigating a claim for damages 
as a result of Mr Basford’s actions in the Group’s Halle
division where he spent the majority of his time. Whilst in
executive control of the Group for the period before Carol
joined, I spent a great deal of time in the final quarter, 
and together with Carol after she arrived, in recovering the
situation, restoring customer confidence and establishing
new successful supply routes.
The Group is disappointed to report a further deterioration
in the deficit within the Company’s defined benefit pension
scheme, now standing at £6.8m, before related deferred
tax asset, under FRS17 at 31 December 2002 and 91% 
of Minimum Funding Requirement at 1 March 2003. The
scheme has been closed to new members. The Directors
of the Group and the trustees of the fund are seeking
advice on how to tackle this problem, common to many 
UK companies. 
The Board expects 2003 to be a year of consolidation 
in Garments and of strategic change in Textiles.

creativity
and style
I was delighted to be offered the position of Group Chief
Executive and to re establish my partnership with Noel
Jervis having worked with him first at Courtaulds Textiles
plc and subsequently at Wolsey Ltd. Starting in mid
November 2002 my early days were spent assessing the
management structure within the Garment business and
recovering speedily the situation caused by management
disruption at Halle and the associated breakdown of the
relationship with its main supplier. 
I am pleased to report that much of the damage has now
been repaired. However, the Group’s profit before tax and 
net exceptional income of £1.5m in 2002 was achieved
after incurring £0.45m of one-off airfreight costs and
customer compensation payments in respect of the Halle
business. Furthermore, a fall in sales, albeit perhaps only
temporary, is likely to be experienced in 2003 as a result 
of a rival business set up by some of the division’s former 
employees and the supplier. 
My assessment of the management structure within the
Garment business identified a number of gaps. Each
operating activity now has a Managing or Commercial
Director, soon to be strengthened by the appointment of 
a Sourcing Director who will bring with him substantial
global sourcing experience. I now believe the Group has 
a very strong team supporting the Board’s future objectives.
The Garment operations achieved similar volumes to the
previous year but sales were reduced by continued price
deflation. More intense retailer competition, fuelled partly 
by the success of discount clothing retailers and the
supermarket chains increasing their clothing offer, remain
key factors. To this end, price negotiations are a key feature
of any buyer discussions and this puts the Group under
further pressure to source more competitively. Despite this,
the Group’s design and product innovation, quality and
reliability keeps us at the forefront of retail buyer decisions.

Chief Executive’s statement
Halle (nightwear) proved resilient and increased sales
despite management disruption. This growth was
supported by the popularity of its character-inspired offering
(Disney and Snoopy) whilst retaining a strong handwriting 
in traditional garments. In 2003 the product offering is
broader, facilitated by a move to sourcing from China. 
In addition this will enable an expansion of the customer
base, shorten lead times and improve competitiveness.
Debfor (swimwear) enjoyed a healthy summer season 
with sales in line with expectations. In 2003 swimwear
accessories will be added to the product portfolio in the
development of a ‘holiday shop’ concept. In the short-term
however the current Middle East conflict may be expected
to curtail Spring 2003 sales and a difficult period ahead 
is forecast. 
Sherwood (lingerie) has been in decline over a number of
years but is now already benefiting from a comprehensive
management restructuring. Together with the appointment
of a new Commercial Director, progress has been made 
to strengthen all other functions including design,
merchandising and new sourcing routes. It is expected 
that this re-energised team will, given time, recreate the
business that Sherwood once enjoyed in this product category. 
The Lepel intimate apparel and swimwear brand built on 
its success in 2001 to become a recognised value brand 
in High Street stores and leading independents. The new
swimwear ranges have been particularly successful and
further progress is expected in 2003 with the development
of an additional customer base.
In the Textile operations, Birkin International’s failure to win
the major Marks and Spencer lace contract in each of the
last two years had an adverse impact on lace sales and 
the associated dyeing and finishing activities. In addition 
the intimate apparel customers’ manufacturing base has
continued to migrate to lower cost countries, as a 
response to the demand for lower prices and as the textile
infrastructure in these developing countries permits more
local self-sufficiency. This has led to lower sales which 
when combined with increasingly uneconomical production
runs has meant that manufacturing capacity was not fully
utilised during the year and a trading loss was incurred. 
The Group is still actively seeking a strategic solution to
these problems. Meanwhile the Textile activities continue 
to generate a positive cash flow.
I recognise that there continues to be a climate of change
within the retail garment industry. It is the Board’s aim to
create an environment within the Sherwood Group that 
is able to respond to the ever-increasing demands upon 
the Group’s resources. I plan to spend a great deal of my
time with the Group’s customers. 
I look forward immensely to the opportunities which lie
ahead and thank all the Group’s staff for the initial support
they have provided.

and lower overheads.
efficient 
systems
Overview
Group sales on a continuing basis fell from £41.4m in 2001
to £40.1m reflecting the pressure on prices faced by the
Group in all of its markets together with a further fall in lace
sales. Included in the overall 2001 result were two months
of trading of Brunet International, a former French lace
subsidiary, prior to its sale to management in March 2001.
The Group reported a profit before tax and net exceptional
income of £1.5m (2001: profit before tax of £1.5m on
continuing operations). The Group experienced considerable
disruption in Halle resulting in one-off airfreight charges and
customer compensation payments totalling £0.45m; 
in the absence of these costs the Group’s profit could have
been much higher.
Following the restructuring programme over recent years,
the Group reaped the benefit of a full year of operating 
from fewer sites and lower overheads during 2002. This,
combined with tight cost control, helped to mitigate the
pressure on margins. Having completed the restructuring
programme at less than the original cost budget, the 
Group has been able to release certain provisions held
against subsidiaries disposed of in prior years, amounting
to £0.9m, to the profit & loss account as an exceptional 
credit. Including this release, and an impairment charge
in relation to a Textile property, the Group reports a profit
before tax of £2m (2001: loss of £9.8m including
discontinued operations).
The Group benefited from net interest receivable of £39,000
following a return to a positive cash balance throughout 
the year.
Earnings per share before net exceptional income were
1.1p (2001: 0.9p pre restructuring, and a loss of 8.9p
including discontinued operations). Sherwood Group plc

Financial review
Fixed assets
Capital expenditure was minimal in 2002. The Group’s
freehold premises were professionally revalued resulting 
in the property at Borrowash being valued at below net
book value. Utilising this valuation as part of an impairment 
review on the Group’s textile activities, a charge of £0.3m
has been made to the profit and loss account. The values 
of the other sites were in line with book values. 
Cash flow
The Group sustained its strong cash flow throughout 2002,
generating £3.5m from operating activities. The sale of a
surplus property in Leek yielded a further £0.5m, which
after capital expenditure of £0.6m, resulted in a closing
cash balance of £3.8m (2001: £0.4m net of debt). 
Taxation
The 2002 accounts include a deferred tax charge of £0.6m,
in line with the requirements of FRS 19 – ‘Deferred Tax’.
The Group was able to utilise brought-forward operating 
tax losses so that no tax is payable in respect of 2002. 
In 2003, the Group expects to pay tax on its profits now
that the remaining brought-forward operating tax losses
have been largely utilised (see notes 7 and 18). 
Pensions
The financial position of the defined benefit pension 
scheme has continued to be affected by the fall in the 
value of equity markets during 2002. The valuation under
FRS 17 – ‘Retirement Benefits’, shows a deficit of £6.8m,
before related deferred tax asset, at 31 December 2002
(2001: £4.2m) (see note 21). 
The Directors have monitored the position closely
throughout the year. An unscheduled Minimum Funding
Requirement calculation at 1 March 2003 revealed 
a funding level of 91%. 
Treasury activities and policies
With the exception of a small number of non-trading 
entities remaining in Europe, all of the Group’s investments
are located within the UK and consequently the Group’s
exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has been
considerably reduced. Forward currency contracts are
executed wherever appropriate.
Share capital re-organisation and dividend
On 12 June 2002 the High Court approved a share capital
re-organisation scheme incorporating a reduction in share
capital and share premium accounts. The objective was to
eliminate historic negative reserves from the balance sheet
and facilitate a possible resumption of dividend payments.
Based on a satisfactory performance in 2002 the Board is
recommending a dividend of 0.25 pence per ordinary share
to be paid, subject to shareholder approval, on 2 June
2003 to shareholders on the register on 22 April 2003.

The meeting will be held on 28 May 2003 at Risley Hall, 
Derby Road, Risley, Derbyshire, DE72 3SS at 10.30am.

Corporate governance report
There is a commitment to high standards of corporate governance throughout the Group. The Board confirms that the Company has,
during the whole of the year ended 31 December 2002, complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code 
(as appended to the Stock Exchange listing rules) except that the Audit Committee comprised two Non Executive Directors rather 
than three during the first two months of the year and the Group does not have a Nomination Committee. The Board is of the opinion
that the arrangement for the Audit Committee was appropriate given the size of the Company and that a Nomination Committee 
will be formed should a need arise.
The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good governance and the statement set out below describes how 
the principles identified in the Combined Code are applied by the Company.
Directors
The Board consists of two Executive and three Non Executive Directors and meets regularly throughout the year. Two Non Executive
Directors, Mr N Jervis and Mr B J Martin, are considered by the Board to be independent of management and free from any relationship
which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. The third Non Executive Director, Mr P Newbold 
is a former Finance Director of the Group and would not be considered independent in accordance with the Higgs Review. However 
the Board do not consider this to materially effect the overall independence of the Non Executive Directors. Each receive a fixed fee 
for their services; none has a material interest in the shares of the Company. The senior independent Non Executive Director is 
Mr N Jervis and concerns relating to the executive and non executive management of the Company can be raised with him.
Details of the Board members appear on page 10.
The Board meets at least eight times each year and more frequently where business needs require. A formal schedule of matters
reserved for the decision of the Board covers key areas of the Group’s affairs. This is communicated throughout the senior
management of the Group. Procedures have been established to enable Directors to obtain independent professional advice, where
necessary, at the Company’s expense. In addition, every Director has access to the Company Secretary, who is charged by the Board
with ensuring that Board procedures are followed.
To enable the Board to function effectively and allow Directors to discharge their responsibilities, full and timely access is given to all
relevant information. In the case of Board meetings, this consists of a comprehensive set of papers, including regular operating and
progress reports and discussion documents regarding specific matters.
Appointments to the Board
Appointments to the Board of Executive and Non Executive Directors are considered by the full Board of Directors.
Any Director appointed during the year is required, under the provisions of the Company’s articles of association, to retire and seek
election by the shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting. The articles also require that one third of the Directors retire by
rotation each year and seek re-election at the Annual General Meeting, with the exception of the Group’s Chairman. 
On appointment to the Board, there are procedures to allow for appropriate training in respect of the role and duties as a public
Company Director.
Details of the Directors’ service contracts are given in the Board’s report on Directors’ remuneration on page 13.
Committees of the Board
The Board has two standing committees, each of which has terms of reference setting out their authority and duties, including 
the following:
The Audit Committee comprises Mr B J Martin as Chairman, Mr N Jervis and Mr P Newbold. The Audit Committee meets as required,
but not less than twice each year, and considers reports from senior management and the external auditors. In addition to reviewing
the report and accounts and the interim statement (including the Board’s statement on internal control in the annual report) prior 
to their submission to the Board for approval, it keeps the scope, cost-effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the external
auditors under review; this includes monitoring the level of non-audit fees. These are disclosed on page 24 and in the opinion of the
Audit Committee do not affect either independence or objectivity.
Although the Group’s Finance Director attends the Audit Committee meetings, the Committee can meet for private discussion with 
the external auditors, who attend its meetings, as required. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Remuneration Committee comprises Mr N Jervis as Chairman, Mr B J Martin and Mr P Newbold. The Board’s Report 
on Directors’ remuneration, which includes details of the Remuneration Committee, is set out on pages 13 to 15.

Audit and internal control
The respective responsibilities of the Directors and the auditors in connection with the financial statements are explained on pages 16
and 17.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group,
which complies with the guidance “Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code”. This process was in place
throughout the year and is regularly reviewed by the Board.
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and place considerable importance on
maintaining a strong control environment. It should be noted that internal control can only provide reasonable assurance and not
absolute certainty against material errors, losses or fraud.
The key procedures that the Directors have established to ensure internal controls are effective are as follows:
• Risk identification: The Board has undertaken a review of the risks affecting the Group. The review resulted in the identification 
of the Group’s significant risks. 
• Risk committees: Two sub committees consisting of senior operational managers from each of the Group’s two principal Divisions
have been established. In addition to considering the significant risks identified by the Board they review the risk management 
and control process in their area of business and consider whether the control systems are appropriate. They consult with experts
on environmental, insurance, legal and health and safety compliance. The committees report to the Board at six monthly intervals. 
The Board has reviewed the need for an internal audit function but, given the reduction in size of the Group, does not consider that 
it is appropriate at this time.
Going concern
The Group had cash resources at 31 December 2002 of £3.8m and was not utilising any of its negotiated facilities. After making
enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the going concern basis has been adopted in preparing the accounts.
Communication
The Company places a great deal of importance on communication with its shareholders. The Board maintains a dialogue with
individual institutional shareholders as well as general presentations after the interim and preliminary results. The Chairman of the Board,
Audit and Remuneration Committees attend the Annual General Meeting and all shareholders have the opportunity to ask questions.
Resolutions are proposed on each substantially separate issue. The Company indicates the level of proxies lodged on each resolution
and the balance for and against the resolution.
The policies in place comply with the provisions of the Combined Code on Internal Control in the course of the financial year ended 
31 December 2002. Sherwood Group plc

Board report on Directors’ remuneration
Consideration of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
The remuneration policy is set by the Board and is described below. Individual remuneration packages are determined by the
remuneration committee within the framework of this policy. 
Directors who were members of the remuneration committee during the year ending 31 December 2002 were Mr N Jervis, 
Mr B J Martin and Mr P Newbold, the Group’s three Non Executive Directors. Mr N Jervis assumed the Executive Chairman’s role
during the period 25 September 2002 to 31 December 2002.
The committee, under the chairmanship of Mr N Jervis makes recommendations to the Board on the broad policy framework 
and overall costs of the remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives and determines the pay, incentives and benefits 
of individual Directors.
The remuneration committee has access to independent advice where it considers it appropriate.
The committee is directly accountable to shareholders. As Chairman of the committee, Mr N Jervis will be available at the Annual
General Meeting to answer questions about the remuneration of Executive Directors.
Remuneration policy
The policy in respect of Directors’ remuneration for the forthcoming years is:
Executive Directors
The policy on remuneration is to provide a competitive level of reward relevant to the Group’s business and the individuals concerned.
The principal factors considered in applying the policy are the nature of responsibility carried, individual performance and relevant

Total shareholder return
The following graph charts the total cumulative shareholder return of the Group in comparison with the FTSE All Share Index from 
1 January 1998. The FTSE All Share Index was selected to enable Shareholders to view the returns achieveable against the wider market.
Changes in the Group’s business operations and significant restructuring over the last five years have led to an underperformance
when compared to the FTSE All Share Index. However, since 2000 the effects of management actions have led to improving returns
and a resilient position against falling equity markets.
The auditors are required to report on the financial information contained in the following sections of this report.

Statement of Directors’ responsibility
Statement of Directors’ responsibility
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and Group and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and
detect fraud and other irregularities. Sherwood Group plc

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Sherwood Group plc
We have audited the financial statements on pages 18 to 33. We have also audited the information in the Board report on Directors’
remuneration that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Directors’ remuneration report. As described on page 16, 
this includes responsibility for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards. Our responsibilities, as independent auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices
Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and by our profession’s ethical guidance. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and
the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed. 
We review whether the statement on pages 11 to 12 reflects the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, including the corporate governance statement and the unaudited part
of the Directors’ remuneration report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination,
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors 
in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration
report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 December 2002. 
and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended; and 
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the accounts
1. Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to 
the Group’s financial statements except as noted below. The Group has adopted FRS 19 ‘Deferred Tax’ in these financial statements. 
The comparative figures did not require restatement. The Group has followed the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 ‘Retirement
Benefits’ in these financial statements.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting
standards. 
(a) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts incorporate the accounts of Sherwood Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings.
Acquisitions are included from the date of acquisition. Goodwill, being the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the
underlying net assets in respect of acquisitions before 1 January 1998, when FRS 10 ‘Goodwill and Intangible Assets’ was adopted,
was eliminated against reserves on acquisition. Goodwill arising on any subsequent acquisitions is capitalised and amortised in
accordance with FRS 10: ‘Goodwill and Intangible Assets’.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Parent
Company only has not been presented.
(b) Turnover
Turnover, which is stated net of value added tax, represents amounts invoiced to third parties.
(c) Foreign currencies
Profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange prevailing 
during the year. Their net assets are translated at year-end rates, the difference on exchange being recorded as a reserve movement.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at year-end rates, the exchange differences
arising are taken to the profit and loss account.
(d) Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all tangible fixed assets except freehold land, over their
expected useful lives.
The lives of each major asset category are:
Freehold buildings – between 25 and 50 years
Plant and machinery – between 5 and 20 years
Fixtures and fittings – between 3 and 10 years
Motor vehicles – between 3 and 5 years
(e) Pension costs
The pension costs for defined contribution schemes are the contributions payable in the year.
For defined benefit schemes the costs are the amounts which, based on current actuarial assumptions, will provide for expected
pension costs over the service lives of the members at a level percentage of the pensionable payroll.
(f) Leasing
Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their expected useful lives. The interest
element is charged to the profit and loss account on a sum of digits basis over the term of the agreement.
Rentals in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement. Sherwood Group plc
23
Annual report and accounts 2002
Notes to the accounts
(g) Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are valued at cost, less any provision for impairment in value.
(h) Stock
Stock is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated as follows:
• Raw materials: cost of purchase on a first in, first out basis.
• Work in progress and finished goods: cost of raw materials and labour together with appropriate overheads. Net realisable value 
is based on estimated selling price, less further costs to completion and disposal.
(i) Deferred tax
The charge for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in
respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but 
not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are considered to be recoverable in the foreseeable future.
2. Segment analysis
(a) Business activity
Following the recent restructuring of the Group, the Directors believe that activities are now confined to one class of business -
the design and sale of lingerie, swimwear and nightwear and the design, manufacture and sale of textiles.

Group:
The Group expects to use the remaining tax losses in the main operating subsidiary during 2003.
These tax losses have reduced taxable profits to nil in recent years.
Company:
The tax losses carried forward in the Company of £5.5 million have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset as there is currently
insufficient evidence that there will be suitable taxable profits against which the losses can be relieved.

16 Financial Instruments 
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and various items such as trade debtors and trade creditors.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
As permitted by FRS 13 – ‘Derivatives and other Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, short-term debtors and creditors have been
excluded from all FRS 13 disclosures.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and currency risk. The Group’s policies in respect 
of the management of these risks is as follows:
Interest rate risk:
The Group finances its operations through retained profits. Financial assets are placed with banks at floating rates on periods ranging
from overnight to monthly depending on forecast cash flow requirements and earn interest at prevailing rates in the money market.
Currency risk:
Following the disposal of the Group’s overseas trading businesses, the Group’s currency exposure on the translation of profits and 
net assets of those businesses has been significantly reduced.
Currency exchange risk on trading transactions is not significant. 
(a) Interest rate and currency of cash balances
Financial assets of £3,810,000 (2001: £1,482,000) invested at floating rates comprise Sterling, Euro and US Dollar deposits. There are
no fixed rate financial assets.
(b) Interest rate and currency of cash borrowings
There were no cash borrowings in the year ended 31 December 2002. At 31 December 2001 the Group had Sterling floating
borrowings of £1,130,000. These floating rate financial liabilities comprised bank borrowings bearing interest rates based upon LIBOR
and EURIBOR.
(c) Currency exposure
The Group’s currency exposure, i.e. those exposures arising from transactions, being the net currency gains and losses that are
recognised in the profit and loss account, is not material.
(d) Fair values of financial instruments
Set out below is a year-end comparison of current and book values of all the Group’s financial instruments by category.

On 12 June 2002 the High Court approved a scheme for the reduction of share capital through the sub-division of every issued
Ordinary Share of 10p each into one New Ordinary Share of 5p each and one Deferred Share of 5p each. The Deferred Shares carried
no rights and were subsequently cancelled. The reserve created was applied, in line with Court approval, in eliminating a deficit on 
the profit and loss account. Sherwood Group plc

The share capital reorganisation scheme referred to above also included a reduction in the share premium account. The amount of 
the reduction was also partly applied, in line with Court approval, in eliminating the deficit on the profit and loss account. 
The special reserve was created, in line with the Court approval, by a reduction in the share premium account. The reserve is not
distributable but may be used to offset any future deficit on the profit and loss account.
At 31 December 2002 the cumulative amount of goodwill eliminated against the profit and loss account reserve in respect of continuing
operations was £7,829,000 (2001: £7,829,000).
The Company profit for the year was £525,000.
21 Pension schemes
The total pension cost for the Group was £290,000 (2001: £578,000) 
Within the UK the Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of all the Group schemes 
are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The cost for the defined contribution schemes represents contributions paid by the Group to the funds and amounted to £27,000
(2001: £83,000).
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme, the Sherwood Group plc Retirement Benefits Scheme. The pension cost relating 
to this service is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuation of the fund was carried out by independent qualified actuaries at 1 January 2001.
The market value of the funds’ assets at this date were £13.8 million. The present value of the scheme’s liabilities at this date were
£13.7 million, hence there was a surplus of £0.1 million.
The pension cost charge for the year in respect of this scheme was £263,000 (2001: £453,000).
The pension accrual at the year end was £150,000.
The method of calculating the employers’ contribution rate is known as the ‘Projected Unit Method’. The key feature of this method 
is that it requires that the average age of the workforce will remain constant if a stable contribution rate is to be achieved. Notes to the accounts continued

The following assumptions were made in reaching the valuation at 1 January 2001
Rate of inflation 2.5% per annum
Rate of return on investments 6.8% per annum
Rate of increase in salaries 3.7% per annum
Rate of increase in pensions nil% per annum
Additional FRS 17 Disclosures
Whilst the Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 ‘Accounting for Pension Costs’ , under FRS17
‘Retirement Benefits’, the following transitional disclosures are required.
In accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS 17, the actuaries have undertaken a valuation of the assets and liabilities 
of the Scheme at 31 December 2002. Pension scheme assets are measured using market values. Pension scheme liabilities are
measured using a projected unit method. The “present value of scheme liabilities” has been arrived at by projecting the results of 
the last full valuation as at 1 January 2001 forward to 31 December 2001 and 31 December 2002.
The following assumptions were made in reaching the valuation at 31 December: 
2002 2001
Rate of inflation 2.2% per annum 2.7% per annum
Rate of increase in salaries 2.5% per annum 4.7% per annum
Rate of increase in pensions 2.2% per annum 2.7% per annum
Rate used to discount scheme liabilities 5.8% per annum 5.7% per annum
The fair value of the scheme assets and the present value of the scheme liabilities at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001 were

conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2004 or on 31 July 2004 whichever is earlier, but so that
the Company may before such expiry make an offer or agreement which would or might require equity securities to be allotted
after such expiry, and the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of such offer or agreement as if the authority conferred
by this resolution had not expired.
8. THAT, subject to the passing of resolution 7 above, the Directors be empowered to allot equity securities of the Company, pursuant

in favour of the holders of those equity securities in accordance with the terms thereof, subject to such exclusions or other
arrangements as the Directors consider necessary or expedient in connection with shares representing fractional entitlements 
or on account of either legal or practical problems arising in connection with the laws of any territory or of the requirements 
of any relevant regulatory body or stock exchange in any territory;
(ii) (otherwise than under sub-paragraph 8(i) above) having an aggregate nominal value of £277,353 and such power shall expire
on the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2004 or on 31 July 2004, whichever is earlier,
but so that the Company may before such expiry make an offer or agreement which would or might require equity securities to
be allotted after such expiry, and the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of such offer or agreement as if the

Chairman’s Statement
Chairman Richard Fildes
The results for the group for the year ending 31 May 2008
reflect the difficult conditions prevailing in the UK property
market. Profits before tax on group companies, joint ventures
and associate company income were £2.3m (2007: £8.9m),
derived from turnover of £115.3m (2007: £116.6m). After
accounting for taxation charges in joint ventures of £0.5m, the
reported IFRS group profit before taxation is £1.8m 
(2007: £9.1m).
A final dividend of 3.0p is proposed which, combined with the
interim dividend of 3.0p (2007: 3.0p), will total 6.0p 
(2007: 9.25p) for the full year. The board regrets the need to
propose a reduced final dividend which it feels is appropriate
in the current general and specific economic circumstances. 
“Dramatic recent events in financial markets make
commenting on the group’s current prospects unusually
perilous”. This concern, expressed in last year’s Chairman’s
Statement, unfortunately has proved to be fully justified by the
wholesale reassessment of property values and prospects
which have occurred since last year’s annual report. 
This has been brought about by the abrupt change in both
the cost and availability of money. For many years, readily
available funding for property development and investment
has stimulated demand. Prices responded with investment
yields falling to well below the cost of money, encouraged by
the prospect of even higher prices. Money is the raw material
of the property industry and when its supply is savagely
curtailed, as is evident from the changed conditions in the
credit markets, demand from investors evaporates. Prices
begin to fall and confidence is destroyed. 
Thus we have seen in the last twelve months a substantial 
re-rating of the value of both commercial and residential
property. Such a marked adjustment naturally affects not only
the price of built stock but also development appraisal and
land values. To date stability has not yet returned with
investment yields still drifting outwards and the viability of all
forms of development remaining difficult to assess. 
In these troubled circumstances, Pochin’s has performed
creditably during the year. The Property division has again
New Craft Centre, Ruthin

Chairman’s Statement
made the main contribution before making necessary
provisions in the prevailing market conditions. The profitable
disposal of land for a supermarket at Ellesmere, Shropshire,
was a highlight, as was the exchange of contracts for the
£12m sale by Manchester Technopark Limited, our joint
venture with Manchester Science Park Limited, of Reynolds
House. Fortunately, the division’s investment portfolio is well
let with its £3.8m annual rental income so far proving resilient.
A reorganisation of the Contracting division was carried out
during the year. Taking the cost of this into account, its
performance was acceptable. Turnover was maintained, and
the re-invigorated management team is now winning valuable
new business despite the increasingly competitive
environment for contracting.
During the second half of the year the Construction Services
division was affected by weakening demand and sharply
increasing fuel prices. Since the year end there has been no
improvement in turnover with business in the Midlands and
the North showing the greatest decline. Steadier fuel prices
and sustained public sector activity are helping to alleviate this
situation.
The Residential division had an extremely difficult year, and it
is not possible to report any improvement since the year end.
Fortunately the modest size of the operation, and a realistic
approach to speculative building, will mean that the
continuing losses of the division are containable. 
Naturally, the group’s future prospects depend on more stable
conditions in financial markets. In addition, much rests on the
outcome of the struggle between the competing forces of
commodity price inflation and weakening global and domestic
demand, and the reaction of central bankers to it. The current
year requires careful cost control and due regard for the
importance of maintained liquidity. Fortunately the group
enjoys close relations with its bankers, notably The Royal
Bank of Scotland, who have demonstrated their strong
support with the renewal and extension of facilities sufficient
to sustain the group’s various activities during the current year
and beyond. The group’s prudent approach to speculative
development, and its strong balance sheet, will prove
increasingly important until improved market conditions begin
to be re-established. 
In addition to the unfortunate and painful damage it has
inflicted on shareholders, the sharp deterioration in all the
group’s markets has tested the morale and resilience of its
management and staff. To date such tests have been met
with great resolve, and I would take this opportunity to thank
and congratulate all those involved. I would also like to record
my thanks to Ross Murray and Richard Buck who have left
the board after serving the group for thirty years and twenty
years respectively. 
Pochin’s is a fine company with a well deserved reputation
among its clients, tenants, suppliers and employees. This will
sustain it through the current adverse circumstances enabling
it to benefit from the many opportunities which diligent and
hard work will identify as confidence and credit gradually
return to the property market.

Chief Executive’s Report
Chief Executive David Shaw
Overview
The Pochin Group operates in the construction and property
sectors through four complementary, but autonomous,
trading divisions:
• Property investment and development
• Contracting
• Construction Services
• Residential development
Our operations are primarily in the North West region and
have been affected this year by a particularly tough property
market, which has resulted in an inability to complete a
number of planned property disposals and has largely
curtailed residential sales activity. 
Contracting operations have remained largely unaffected to
date but the division has been restructured during the year
and management has been reorganised so that it is better
placed to operate, should it be affected by worsening market
conditions. 
Construction Services, through Pochin Concrete Pumping,
operates throughout the UK and has faced different
challenges, most notably the increasing cost of fuel, and
these have eroded margins in the second half.     
Residential sales suffered a severe downturn, with only 39
completions added to the 21 sales brought forward from the
previous year. 
Although the group has generated operating profits in the
second half of the year, a prudent and cautious approach has
been taken in the current climate and the values of
landholdings and investments in the commercial and
residential divisions have been reassessed and, where
appropriate, written down to reflect the general downturn in
the sector.   
Reported group profits before tax on company, subsidiaries,
joint ventures and associates, are therefore only slightly ahead
of those reported at the half year. Heald Green

Property investment and development 
The year has seen a general market adjustment to property
values, which has impacted on the assets and trading
operations of the division. Investment values have fallen and
development activity has suffered further due to the effects of
the credit crunch. A prudent and cautious approach has been
taken and, where appropriate, the values of commercial
landholdings and property investments have been written
down to reflect the general downturn in the sector.   
Although activity is reduced and property disposals have been
extremely difficult to achieve, two significant profitable
transactions have been completed in the year. 
At Ellesmere, Shropshire, 3 acres of land were sold to Tesco
Stores Limited, following completion of a new road and
associated infrastructure works. The downturn in the housing
market has, however, deferred the planned sale of a further 17
acres of land with residential planning permission. The
remainder of the land on this development has the benefit of
planning permission for health and leisure uses and disposals
of these parcels are being pursued.  
The group’s interest in remaining industrial units at Valley
Court and office units at Verity Court, both recent
developments on our Midpoint 18 Business Park in
Middlewich, has been sold to Lincoln House Properties
Limited.
Undeveloped land at Midpoint 18 now has the benefit of
outline planning consent for employment use, but market
conditions and infrastructure issues remain as significant
hurdles to its development. 
In Crewe, Emperor Court, an office development of circa
22,000 sq.ft., is reaching completion and is located alongside
the Ramada Hotel site, sold last year.
The benefit of rent reviews, particularly on investment property
at Ormskirk, has created additional value, which has helped
to partly counter the effects of write downs in respect of
general market adjustments. The group’s portfolio of
investment property currently has occupation levels (by area)
of circa 93%.
Demand for space at Keele Science and Business Park also
remains strong, again resulting in high levels of occupation.
Joint Ventures
Despite the generally challenging climate, Manchester
Technopark Limited has successfully exchanged contracts for
the disposal of Reynolds House for £12m and our share of the
resulting surplus has contributed significantly to this year’s
results.  
We have continued to work on our joint projects in Liverpool,
Manchester and North Wales in conjunction with UK Land &
Property Limited. 
At Exchange Flags, in the centre of Liverpool’s financial
district, the £15m refurbishment of Walker House, designed
to create 220,000 sq.ft. of quality office space, is currently
being carried out by our Contracting division. Fit out works for
the anchor tenant, the Ministry of Defence, are due to
commence in October of this year. Meanwhile, further lettings
have been secured at Horton House, where prime tenants
such as Brabners, Knight Frank and Deloittes have increased
occupied space to circa 80%.
Wolseley Distribution Centre, Chorley
  Page 7
Chief Executive’s Report
At Harwarden Business Park in North Wales, the 25,000 
sq.ft. unit developed last year has been let and a further
scheme of small business units, with a total area of 40,000
sq.ft., is now under way. At Heald Green near Manchester
Airport, the first phase of the office park is nearing completion
amounting to some 45,000 sq.ft. of quality office space in
small business units.
Our joint venture with Castlewood Developments Limited in
Birkenhead continues. Following the completion of a revised
development agreement with Wirral Borough Council to
deliver a 95,000 sq.ft. foodstore in the town centre, the joint
venture has secured an Agreement to Lease with ASDA
Stores Limited. Site enabling works continue in parallel with
the CPO process, which is required to complete site
assembly.  
The Midpoint Partnership, in which we have a 25% share,
continues to market the completed Unit 75, a substantial
distribution facility on Midpoint 18 Business Park, Middlewich.  
The Trinity Court Development Limited apartment scheme in
Holyhead on Anglesey, in which we also have a 25% share,
has seen a number of sales in the year, with just 7 units and
some ground floor retail space remaining.
Contracting
Turnover, including work on development projects for our
property division, has been maintained at £85m 
(2007: £85m), despite several embryonic projects being
cancelled by clients after successful tenders had been made.
A strong performance in the second half resulted in a
profitable outcome for the year as a whole, before accounting
for reorganisation costs.  
Following an independent business review in Spring 2008, a
new divisional managing director was appointed to oversee
the reorganisation of the division. The divisional board has
been restructured and a review of strategy is under way.
Operational and support management teams have also been
reorganised in order to focus on the key issues identified in
the review process, including further improvements to bid
management processes and an expansion of the business
development resource.  
A number of key projects were delivered in the year including
the Environmental Science building for Bangor University,
which received the LABC (Wales) award for Best Sustainable
Development 2008 and has been nominated to go forward to

the National Awards. We now have £55m of secured work for
the current year (2007: £64m) and there is an encouraging
level of enquiries in hand despite a noticeable decline in a
number of our traditional areas of activity. The education
sector, in particular, remains strong, evidenced by our recently
securing a £7m project to build a new Learning Zone building
for Mid-Cheshire College in Winsford. 
The focus will remain on delivering quality projects to clients’
satisfaction. Approximately 71% of revenue (2007: 77%) was
achieved as a result of negotiated or partnered contracts and
approximately 52% (2007: 50%) of our revenue came by way
of repeat business. Our surveys indicate that we have
maintained our customer satisfaction ratings at 92% (2007:
92%).
Construction Services
Concrete Pumping sales rose by some 7% to £15m (2007:
£14m), achieved from 21,206 jobs (2007: 20,795 jobs) at an
average price per job of £648 (2007: £621), with 1.44m cubic
metres of concrete pumped (2007: 1.38m cubic metres).
Utilisation averaged 77% (2007: 76%) and site reliability
remained in excess of 99%. 
After a solid first half, the second half started slowly and the
price of fuel became the most significant factor affecting
margin. Increasing fuel costs were initially absorbed but
surcharges are being applied from June 2008.
There has been a noticeable decline in activity in the Northern
and Midlands areas of England but the rest of the UK has not
been affected to the same degree, and there are a number of
public sector projects in the pipeline. 
Pumi operations were reduced in line with the policy set out
last year and the division is currently operating 12 machines.
Residential development
The housing market, particularly in our region, has suffered
from the well publicised combination of a collapse in
consumer confidence and an inability for first time buyers to
obtain satisfactory mortgages. The downturn in the market
has led to a review of the carrying value of land and work in
progress, with write downs in values being made where
appropriate. Trading losses have therefore been increased. 
The growth path of the division has been halted and the
number of sales completions was down on last year at 60
(2007: 69), achieved from 7 sites across the region. There are
just 4 reservations carried forward into the new financial year
(2007: 21 reservations), an exceptionally low level, indicating
the severity of current market conditions. 
The average selling price was £135,000, (2007: £159,000),
which is below the regional figure for new homes released by
the Halifax of £171,000 for the North West and below the
regional figure for all properties from the property website
Rightmove at £178,000. This decline reflects an increase in
the proportion of affordable homes allocated in planning
permissions for site development. 
The land bank stands at 104 plots (2007:136 plots) with full
planning permission, with a further 112 plots (2007: 66 plots)
secured and awaiting planning permission, excluding
strategic land held under option.

Group Results
Total group sales were £115.3m (2007: £116.6m) resulting in
a profit before tax of £2.3m (2007: £8.9m). After accounting
for taxation charges in joint ventures and associated
companies of £0.5m, the reported IFRS group profit before
taxation is £1.8m (2007: £9.1m). The trading result for 2008
includes a write down of investment carrying values and
residential land holding amounting to £9.2m, which reflects
the impact of the downturn in the property market in the wake
of the credit crunch.
The Contracting division recorded gross turnover of £84.8m
(2007: £84.9m), which included internal sales of £2.5m.
Despite the flat year on year activity, margins on contracts
completed in the year held up well, with underlying contract
profitability in line with the previous year. Profit before tax was
£0.3m (2007: £0.5m excluding a pension credit of £1.6m)
after charging one-off restructuring costs of £0.6m.
The Property division was the first to see a downturn in
market activity and values. As a consequence, the number
and the value of anticipated transactions were reduced and
investment activity curtailed to safeguard liquidity. However,
those transactions successfully completed included the sale
of part of the land at Ellesmere, Shropshire to Tesco Stores
Limited for retail development and the exchange of contracts
for the sale of Reynolds House at Manchester Technopark
Limited, a joint venture with Manchester Science Park
Limited. Gross rental income from investment properties
amounted to £4.1m (2007: £3.6m). Overall, the division,
including the group’s share of joint venture income, showed a
profit before tax of £4.9m (2007: £7.3m profit) after write
downs of £8.6m (2007: £1.5m).
The Construction Services division, providing specialist hire of
concrete pumps across the UK, generated sales of 
£14.7m (2007: £14.2m). Profit before tax was £0.3m 
Helios City, Chorley
  Page 13
Financial Review
(2007: £0.1m). Margins came under severe pressure in the
second half due to escalating fuel costs, which proved difficult
to pass on in the short term.
The Residential division was the hardest hit by the credit
crunch. Sales for the year were £8.1m (2007: £11.0m) from
seven operating sites. A downturn in values, consumer
confidence and mortgage availability combined to reduce
significantly the rate of private house sales in the second half
year. Following reappraisal of existing developments and write
down of land values, there was a loss for the division of £1.7m
(2007: £0.8m profit).
Earnings Per Share and Dividend
Diluted earnings per share were 12.7p (2007: 33.2p). 
Overall, the group benefited from a tax credit of £0.3m (2007:
£2.2m tax charge). The company and subsidiaries had a tax
credit of £0.8m (2007: £2.3m tax charge) on a loss of £0.5m
(2007: £8.8m profit), whilst joint ventures and associates
suffered a tax charge of £0.5m (2007: £0.1m tax credit) on
profits of £2.8m (2007: £0.3m). This favourable effective tax
rate reflects the utilisation of available tax losses in joint
ventures and associates, indexation allowances on
revaluation gains and the phasing out of industrial building
allowances.
Subject to approval at the AGM, a final dividend of 3.0p per
share (2007: 6.25p) will be paid on 31 October 2008, resulting
in a full year dividend of 6.0p (2007: 9.25p). This reduced
dividend reflects, in part, the group’s efforts to conserve cash
resources during challenging economic conditions.
The dividend is covered 2.1 times by earnings (2007: 3.6 times).

Balance Sheet
Net assets have increased to £53.1m (2007: £51.5m)
equivalent to 255p per share (2007: 248p).
The value of property non current assets grew in the year to
£48.0m (2007: £43.0m) with the addition of the completed
Ormskirk retail development. Due regard was made to
weakening property markets and the remainder of the group’s
property portfolio was accordingly written down by £0.9m.
Investment in joint ventures and associated companies
increased by £9.8m to £25.4m as a result of the group’s
participation in the acquisition of Walker House, Liverpool and
continued development of Birkenhead town centre retail
project.
Stocks and working progress have reduced by £3.5m,
following completion of the Ormskirk project and write down
of housing stock and residential land values.
In accordance with IAS19 there was a pension surplus of
£0.9m (2007: £0.6m deficit), which is shown in the group
balance sheet as a current asset.
Joint Ventures and Investments
The group has continued to support existing projects and
despite the lack of short-term opportunity, has maintained its
strategic relationship with partners to provide future business
when the market improves. Net investment in joint ventures
and associated companies has increased in the year by
£9.8m to £25.4m.
The group has traditionally taken a prudent view towards
recognising the full value of investments on the balance sheet,
especially those at an early stage of development or that are
speculative in nature. With the downturn in property yields
and hardening economic conditions in mind, joint venture
investments have been written down and the charge to profit
in the year was £7.7m (2007: £1.5m).
A full list of all group joint venture interests is provided in Note
14 to the accounts.
The group continues to have investment interests in
Manchester Science Park Limited (£1.5m) and UK Land &
Property Limited (£0.7m). Prosperity Court Partnership and
Keele Park Developments are treated as subsidiary
companies in these accounts and third party minority
interests are shown in the income statement.
Borrowings, Cashflow and 
Financing Risk
New borrowing facilities were arranged during the year with
The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) to provide appropriate
funding to support the financial obligations of the group and
sufficient liquidity during a period of economic uncertainty.
Total facilities of £47m are available from RBS, of which £10m
are unsecured. A further £13.5m facility is provided by Bank
of Scotland to fund Keele Park Developments Limited.
Net borrowings increased in the year to £42.9m (2007:
£31.0m), funding projects at Birkenhead, Walker House in
Liverpool and Ellesmere, Shropshire.
There was cash in hand at 31 May of £4.0m (2007: £0.2m).
Net cash movements in the year were:
2008 2007
Operating activities 2.2 5.2
Sale/(purchase) of assets 0.3 (1.1)
Investment in joint ventures (12.4) (3.2)
Interest and dividends (1.5) (1.3)
Taxation (0.5) (2.4)
Increase in borrowings (£m) (11.9) (2.8)
The group funds its operations through the use of cash, loans
and various liquid resources such as debtors and trade
creditors. Funding availability and the management of interest
rates and liquidity risks are the responsibility of the Finance
Committee, which is responsible to the main board for
implementing the group’s treasury policy.
The group has minimal fixed interest rate borrowings and
continually reviews the need to hedge against interest rate
movements. During the year the group entered into a 3 year
swap arrangement to fix its LIBOR exposure to 4.98% on
£15m of new debt. In addition, there continues to be an
interest rate hedge in respect of borrowings in Keele Park
Developments Limited. As at 31 May 2008, there was a
combined recognised gain on these financial instruments of
Hawarden Business Park
  Page 15
Financial Review
£0.5m (2007: £0.2m). The favourable movement in the year of
£0.3m has been recognised in the income statement of the
group in accordance with IFRS convention.
Certain associated companies are financed by long term
repayment loans to finance investment property assets and
other joint venture companies are financed by short and
medium term bank borrowings. The group regularly reviews
the risk of exposure to interest rate movements with its
partners and where appropriate, hedges against that risk on
a project by project basis.
The group continues to have minimal exposure to foreign
currency exchange risks and accordingly does not require a
policy to hedge such exposure.
Full disclosure of financial instruments, interest rate and
liquidity risks are shown in Note 23 to the accounts.
Pensions
The group operates a defined benefits (DB) scheme and a
defined contribution (DC) scheme for its employees. The DB
scheme, closed to new members since 31 December 2001,
undergoes its scheduled full triennial actuarial valuation in
2008. Following the last valuation in 2005, the group took
action to preserve the long term viability of the scheme,
making changes to members’ benefits and providing £1.2m
as a special contribution to the scheme.
Total contributions paid this year to the DB scheme were
£0.4m (2007: £1.2m). Payments to the DC scheme were
£0.2m (2007: £0.2m).
Under IAS19 the DB pension obligations are shown in the
balance sheet of the group and the movement in the year
reflected in the income statement and statement of
recognised income and expense. As a result of the action
taken by the group, referred to above, combined with
favourable movements in investment values and bond yields
during the year, a surplus for the DB Scheme of £0.9m (2007:
£0.6m deficit) is reported.
Full disclosure of all DB scheme assumptions are set out in
Note 7 to the accounts.
Financial Reporting
There have been no changes to accounting policies in 2008
and the group continues to report in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards.

Corporate Social Responsibility
The group endeavours to conduct its business in a manner
which ensures that the public, its clients and employees are
at all times protected from any potentially harmful impact of its
activities.
Health and Safety
All divisions report to the director responsible for health and
safety on a monthly basis to ensure that all matters are
properly addressed. Every effort is made to raise the profile
and importance of health and safety issues throughout the
group. 
Following the success of the Construction Services division,
the Contracting division received OHSAS 18001 registration
from the British Standards Institution (BSI). This is an
international occupational health and safety management
system specification and registration demonstrates that the
company has the necessary systems and procedures in place
to manage health and safety effectively. The division was also
successful in renewing its accreditation under the
Contractors’ Health and Safety Assessment Scheme and
National Britannia SAFEcontractor Scheme. 
Following the introduction of BS8476:2007 (Code of Practice
for the Safe Use of Concrete Pumps), the Construction
Services division distributed a circular to over 900 customers,
offering a training DVD and providing points of contact for
safety and technical queries.
Awareness is critical in matters relating to health and safety
and circulars and bulletins are regularly issued to employees.
Appropriate training is also provided to improve knowledge
and understanding. For example, over 3,400 safety rules and
guidance booklets were distributed to employees and
subcontractors, during the year.
The Contracting and Construction Services divisions issued
an updated induction film to present the group’s safety culture
to individuals who may not have worked with the group
before. The film is available in a number of languages as more
foreign workers are joining the industry.

Corporate Social Responsibility
It is pleasing to report that the group has achieved three
further awards this year:
ROSPA Silver – Pochin (Contractors) Limited
ROSPA Gold – Pochin Concrete Pumping Limited 
ROSPA Gold – Pochin Homes Limited
This brings the total to 23 awards in the last seven years.
The Property division ensures that the sites and buildings
under their control are regularly inspected to ensure that they
are in a safe and secure condition and regular reports are
submitted to the Health and Safety team. The Residential
division also submit regular reports regarding any issues
which arise on their sites.
Environmental
The group operates site waste management plans on all
construction sites in accordance with the Site Waste
Management Plans Regulations 2008. All senior managers
within the Contracting division have attended one or more
workshops which have been organised with the help of
government sponsorship over the last 12 months. 
The Carbon Trust carried out a survey of energy usage at
head office and the recommendations contained in their
report have either been actioned or are planned.
Good progress has been made throughout the group in
improving the accuracy of data collection for the reporting of
environmental key performance indicators. In the meantime,
awareness has been raised of the relevant issues and the
importance of energy saving, recycling and waste reduction in
all areas.
The group is becoming increasingly involved in the
construction of more energy efficient buildings and the use of
sustainable building products, and is currently working on an
environmental checklist for the use of design teams at the
Visage, Salford
outset of new projects. All construction sites are registered
with the Considerate Constructors Scheme and many
certificates of compliance have been achieved throughout the
year.
Awareness is again a critical factor in improving environmental
performance and the group has introduced appropriate
signage at the entrance to all construction sites so that it is
clearly visible alongside the traditional health and safety
guidance. Induction films also include specific guidance on
environmental matters to all users, including customers and
subcontractors.
The Residential division is taking active steps to meet new
standards in housing construction in advance of their
compulsory implementation.
People
The group currently employs over 350 people. They are the
interface with customers, the representatives of the group and
its culture, and one of its most important assets.
Throughout the year, the Contracting division was recognised
as an “Investor in People”. This involves a rigorous
assessment process which independently confirms that the
group’s culture of training, development, communication and
reward is properly and successfully implemented. Following a
survey of employees, the division reached the final of the
Contract Journal “Best Places to Work” awards.
The health of employees remains important to the group and
regular site visits are made by a qualified nurse who is
available privately to advise on any health issues.
The group continues to implement the policy that all
employees, or potential employees, receive fair and equal
treatment without discrimination.
  Page 19
Corporate Governance
Application of principles
The group is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and the board is accountable to the
shareholders for implementation of the principles underlying these standards. The steps taken throughout the group to maintain
good corporate governance are set out below.
Compliance
The board confirms that it is reporting in accordance with the requirements of the revised Combined Code ("the Code") except
that Mrs. S. E. Nicholson and Mr M Chadwick, who served throughout the year as non-executive directors, could not be
considered to be independent of the company’s management and shareholders in view of their shareholdings. Mr. R. Fildes,
who was appointed as an independent non-executive director in August 2006, could not be considered independent following
his appointment as chairman in January 2007. The company has not, therefore, complied with provisions A.3.1, A.3.2, A.4.1,
B.2.1 and C.3.1 of the Code. 
The board of directors
The company supports the concept of an effective board leading and controlling the group. The board is responsible for
approving overall group policy and strategy. It meets on at least six occasions in each calendar year and has a formal schedule
of matters reserved for its decision, including the approval of interim and preliminary announcements, approval of annual report
and accounts, approval of dividend policy, approval of major capital expenditure, treasury management, appointment of board
members and professional advisors and, in a supervisory capacity, formulation of the group’s risk management strategy and
health, safety and environmental policies. 
Management supplies the board with appropriate and timely information both informally and formally through a structured
reporting process of committees, including monthly executive and finance committees. A full and open debate is encouraged
on all matters relating to strategy, performance, resources, key appointments and standards of conduct at all meetings of the
board. The directors are also free to seek any further information they consider necessary to fulfill their duties. All directors have
access to the advice and services of the company secretary and, where appropriate, independent professionals at the expense
of the company. Training is available for new directors and ongoing training and education is provided to other directors as
necessary.
At the date of this report the board comprised four executive directors and four non-executive directors. The names and
biographical details of all the directors are shown on page 16.
The roles of chairman and chief executive are separated and clearly defined. Mr. R. Fildes served as chairman throughout the
year and Mr. D. Shaw served as chief executive throughout the year. The other executive directors who also served throughout
the year were Mr J. Edwards, finance director, Mr J. W. P. Nicholson, property development director and Mr D. D. R. Pochin,
construction services director. Mr R. G. Buck served on the board until his resignation on 31 October 2007 and Mr L. R. Murray
served on the board until his resignation on 31 May 2008. 
The non-executive directors also served as members of the audit, remuneration and nominations committees. The non-
executive directors have skills that complement those of the executive directors. Mr. R. Fildes served as chairman throughout
the year and Mr. N. R. L. Fry served as senior independent non-executive director throughout the year. Mr. M. Chadwick and
Mrs. S. E. Nicholson also served throughout the year.
All directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM following appointment and to re-election by shareholders
every three years thereafter in accordance with the Articles of Association of the company (“the Articles”). Mr J. Edwards, 
Mr N. R. L. Fry and Mr M. Chadwick will therefore be retiring at this year’s AGM and, being eligible, will offer themselves for 
re-election.
Accountability and audit
The board has formally constituted three sub-committees for audit, remuneration and nominations. Membership and a
summary of the terms of reference of these committees are detailed below. 
  Page 20
Corporate Governance
Audit committee
Throughout the year the audit committee comprised the following non-executive directors: Mr. N. R L. Fry (chairman), Mr. R.
Fildes and Mr. M. Chadwick.
The terms of reference of the committee include reviewing the group’s management of risk, internal financial and operating
controls, reviewing the scope and results of the audit, its cost effectiveness, the independence and objectivity of the auditors,
including fees in relation to, and in the nature of, non-audit services and, annually, the need for an internal audit function. The
committee meets at least three times a year and external auditors attend together with the executive directors as and when
required.
Remuneration committee
Throughout the year the remuneration committee comprised the following non-executive directors: Mr. N. R. L. Fry (chairman),
Mr. R. Fildes and Mr. M. Chadwick.
The committee has the responsibility for making recommendations to the board for the remuneration policy of the company
and also packages for individual directors. It carries out the policy on behalf of the board. In carrying out these responsibilities
the committee has had full regard to the requirements of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the Code.
Nominations committee
Throughout the year the nominations committee comprised the following non-executive directors: Mr. R. Fildes (chairman), 
Mrs. S. E. Nicholson, Mr. N. R. L. Fry and Mr. M. Chadwick. 
The committee makes recommendations to the board on all board appointments and takes advice from external consultants
when necessary.

Corporate Governance
Relations with shareholders
The company values the views of its shareholders and recognises their interest in the company’s strategy and performance,
board membership and quality of management. The board has dialogue with certain of its institutional and other shareholders
on numerous issues during the year and is pleased to promote the mutual understanding of objectives. In accordance with
section D1.2 of the Code the chairman ensures that the views of shareholders are communicated to the board as a whole.
The AGM is used to communicate with private investors and they are encouraged to participate. The company arranges for
Notice of the AGM and related papers to be sent to shareholders at least 21days before the meeting. The chairmen of the audit,
remuneration and nominations committees are available at the AGM to answer questions. Separate resolutions are proposed
on each issue and clear distinction is also drawn between ordinary and special resolutions to ensure they are given due
consideration. There are separate resolutions to approve the annual report and accounts and the remuneration report. The
company counts all proxy votes and indicates the level of proxies lodged on the resolutions after they have been dealt with by
a show of hands. The company also displays its interim and final announcements on the company website.
Internal control
The board has overall responsibility for the group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness on an ongoing
basis. The board confirms that, in accordance with the "Guidance on Internal Control" (the Turnbull Report), the group has taken
steps necessary to ensure compliance with principle C.2 of the Code. The board has overall responsibility for the management
of risk and has in place a full risk and control register of the group’s activities. This register is reviewed at least annually to monitor
and ensure the adequacy of its procedures for the management and control of risk. This process involves each of the subsidiary
company boards carrying out periodic reviews of the key risk areas within its own business, including a review of health and
safety (risks, measures and policies), response to changes in legislation and the identification of commercial risk. Each
subsidiary company reports this information to the board. This process enables the board to identify areas where procedures
need to be changed or implemented throughout the group and to initiate appropriate action plans. The board monitors progress
towards successful completion of these action plans and the identification of any new risks through a process of ongoing
review.
Although the group has the relevant systems and procedures in place, the board considers the management of risk to be an
ongoing process and to increase entrenchment of these procedures throughout the group, the board encourages the
management of its subsidiary companies to conduct reviews of risk management strategies and control measures at least
annually and also to report to the board on any changes in activity that may have a significant risk management impact. In the
light of the above, the board is of the view that the group has established procedures in place to identify, evaluate and manage
the significant risks faced by the group. Key elements of the group’s internal control procedures include: 
• well established budget and reporting functions that are regularly monitored throughout the year by the board;
• clear lines of authority between the management of the subsidiary companies and the board;
• well established procedures by which the management of the subsidiaries submit proposals for major capital
expenditure for approval by the board.
• an ongoing process of reviewing risks faced by the group, together with clear board responsibility for implementing
measures to manage and, where possible, reduce these risks. 
The board has also reviewed the operation and effectiveness of the group’s system of internal financial control for the financial
year and the period up to the date of approval of the financial statements. The systems that the company has in place for risk
management and financial control are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives
and can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The board has considered the
need for an internal audit function, but has decided that it is not justified in view of the current size of the company; a decision
which the audit committee reviews annually. 
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in
operation for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial
statements.  Page 22
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Section 1: Information not subject to audit 
Directors’ remuneration
In accordance with section 241A of the Companies Act 1985 the board presents the Directors’ Remuneration Report for
shareholder approval. The report, as set out below, will be put to shareholders as a separate resolution for approval at the AGM
and the chairman of the remuneration committee, Mr. N. R. L. Fry, will be available at the meeting to answer any questions on
the content of this report.
Remuneration committee
In accordance with provision B.2.1 of the Code the committee’s terms of reference are based on the guidance published by
the Institute of Chartered Secretaries & Administrators and these are available on request from the company secretary. The
committee has the responsibility for making recommendations to the board on the company’s general policy on remuneration
of senior management, including specific packages for individual directors. It carries out the policy on behalf of the board. The
members of the committee are listed on page 20. None of the members of the committee, other than as shareholders, has any
personal financial interest in the matters to be decided, potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships nor any
day to day involvement in running the business. In carrying out its responsibilities, the committee has had full regard to the
requirements of the Directors Remuneration Regulations 2002. The committee met on three occasions during the year.
Meetings of the committee are normally attended by the chairman and the chief executive, as appropriate, except where their
own remuneration is discussed. The committee consults the chairman of the company and the chief executive, and takes
professional advice from remuneration consultants, HayGroup, when necessary. 
Remuneration policy
The policy of the board is to provide terms of employment and remuneration packages for executive directors designed to
encourage the enhancement of the company’s performance and to ensure that remuneration packages offered are competitive
and will attract, motivate and retain executive directors of the right calibre, in line with appropriate market rates. 
As well as considering conditions in the group as a whole, the company positions remuneration by reference to the median paid
for comparable roles amongst companies of similar size.
Executive directors’ contracts
The company has contracts of service with its executive directors, Messrs Edwards, Nicholson, Pochin and Shaw. These
contracts provide for twelve months notice of termination.
Non-executive directors’ contracts
The company has no formal contracts of service with non–executive directors. Mrs. S. E. Nicholson has not been appointed
for a specific term of office. Mr. N. R. L. Fry and Mr. M. Chadwick were both appointed on 22 September 2005 for a three year
fixed term with provision for twelve months notice of termination. Mr. R. Fildes was appointed on 7 August 2006 for a three year
fixed term with provision for twelve months notice of termination.
Policy on executive directors’ remuneration
The main elements of executive directors’ remuneration are basic annual salary, annual car allowance, annual bonus payments
and share options awarded under the scheme approved by shareholders in 2001, and are detailed below:
Basic Salary
The committee reviews the basic salary of each executive director in July of each year. The committee reaches its decision on
remuneration of executive directors based on three principal factors:
• Level of responsibility
• External market competitiveness
• Individual performance in the role
Bonus
Annual bonus payments are linked to group, divisional and personal performance against pre-determined targets approved by
the committee. Section 1: Information not subject to audit (continued)
Share options
Under the terms of the share option scheme, Messrs Edwards, Nicholson, Pochin and Shaw are eligible for options to be
granted. There is no long-term incentive plan in operation. The committee has responsibility for supervising the scheme and the
grant of share options under its terms.
Other benefits
Executive directors are paid an annual car allowance and appropriate reimbursement of mileage undertaken on the company’s
business. The annual allowance is based upon the notional value of a company car appropriate to the executive director’s
position in the company. The principal benefit-in-kind is the provision of private health insurance cover. 
Policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration
Levels of remuneration for non-executive directors are set by the board and reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of
the role. Non-executive directors do not have a contract of service, are not eligible to join the company’s pension scheme and
cannot participate in the company’s share option scheme, however, they are reimbursed their reasonable expenses for
attendance at meetings.
Details of the emoluments of each director and non-executive director are set out on page 25.
Directors’ pension arrangements
Pension benefits for certain executive directors are derived from contributions paid by the company, and those directors, at
rates advised by the actuary to the Pochin’s & Associated Companies Retirement Benefits Plan, which is a defined benefit
scheme. No element of remuneration other than basic salary is pensionable. Normal retirement date is on reaching age 65, with
a pension 2/3 of final pensionable salary subject to completion of 25 years pensionable service. The defined benefit scheme
was closed to new members with effect from 1 January 2002 and, from that date, new employees are eligible to become
members of a defined contribution scheme within the Pochin’s & Associated Companies Retirement Benefits Plan. The pension
benefits for Mr. J. Edwards are derived from contributions paid by him and the company at pre-determined rates under the
defined contribution scheme. 
Performance graph
The following graph shows the company’s performance, measured
by the total shareholder return ("TSR"), compared with the
performance of the FTSE small cap index. This index was chosen as
the most suitable comparator group as it represents smaller
capitalised companies. TSR is defined as the percentage change
over the period in market price of shares assuming the reinvestment
of income and funding of liabilities of the theoretical holding.

Forward looking policy statement
Bonus
Messrs Edwards, Nicholson, Pochin and Shaw receive certain elements of remuneration that are performance related. All are
eligible for annual bonus payments that are linked to group, divisional and individual performance against pre-determined criteria
with a maximum award capped at 50% of salary. Each year the remuneration committee determine the appropriate level of
bonus for each executive director, which is dependent on both the above performance criteria and their wider contribution to
the group.
Share options
Messrs Edwards, Nicholson, Pochin and Shaw are eligible for the award of share options under the share option scheme. The
exercise of any such option is made conditional upon the satisfaction of performance conditions set by the board (acting
through the remuneration committee) at the date of grant. Under the scheme rules the remuneration committee has the power
to set appropriate performance criteria on an annual basis such that significant and sustained improvement in the underlying
financial performance of the group or any of its subsidiary companies is achieved. The remuneration committee also has the
power to review, amend or revise these criteria, having regard to market conditions prevailing at that time, to ensure these
targets or conditions are appropriate.
Contracts of service
It is the company’s policy to have in place contracts of service with its executive directors. Under the terms of these contracts
the executives’ employment with the group continues (subject to the terms of the contract) until determined by either party
giving to the other not less than 12 months written notice. If notice should be served by either party the group has the right to
terminate the executive’s employment by paying in lieu of notice, on the following terms: 
• payment will be the basic salary only of the director and no account shall be taken of any bonus, pension contributions
or any benefits in kind; and
• payment shall be subject to deductions for income tax and national insurance contributions; and
• the director does not have an automatic right to payment in lieu of notice.
General policy
The remuneration committee has a policy of keeping all of the above issues under annual review to ensure these policies and
provisions are appropriate. Page 25

Share options
The group intends to grant options periodically to key executives so as to provide an incentive to perform strongly over an
extended period and so align their interests with those of shareholders. Under the terms of the Pochin’s PLC Executive Share
Option Scheme, options granted can only be exercisable between three and ten years of the date of grant and only then if the
conditions for exercise, set by the Remuneration Committee, have been met. Options have been granted to eligible directors of
the company, as follows:

Directors’ Report
The directors have pleasure in presenting their annual report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 May
2008.
Principal activities of the group and business review
The group operates within the United Kingdom and continues to be principally engaged in building and civil engineering
contracting, property development and letting, house building and specialist plant hire. The directors have classified these
activities into four separate segments, contracting, property, residential and construction services. A review of existing activities
and future developments is contained in the Chairman’s Statement and the Chief Executive’s Report.
The information that fulfils the requirements of the business review can be found in the Chief Executive’s Report, the Financial
Review, Corporate Social Responsibility, Corporate Governance and in the notes to the financial statements. These include the
key performance indicators (KPIs) of the group and the risks facing the group. The group monitors the KPIs in order to generate
value for shareholders and to improve business performance. They include, earnings per share, net assets per share, the
number and price of contracts, forward sales, utilisation, landbank, average selling price and customer satisfaction.

2007). The directors recommend a final dividend of 3.0p (2007: 6.25p) per share amounting to £624,000 (2007: £1,300,000).
The total dividend is 6.0p per share (2007: 9.25p), which amounts to £1,248,000 (2007: £1,924,000).
Donations
Charitable donations during the year amounted to £20,000 (2007: £24,000).
Acquisition of the company’s own shares
At the AGM held on 26 October 2007, the company passed a resolution giving the company the authority to enter into
contracts for the purchase of not more than 3,119,980 ordinary shares. The company has not entered into any contracts during
the year to purchase its own shares and has not entered into any to the date of this report. The authority expires at the
conclusion of this year’s AGM and the directors will seek to renew the authority for a further year at that meeting. Shares
purchased in accordance with the authority will either be cancelled or held in treasury to help the company meet its obligations
under the employee share trust.
Employee share trust
The company established an employee share trust ("the Trust") following approval by the shareholders at the AGM held on 16
November 2001. At 31 May 2008, the Trust owned 445,000 ordinary shares. Options of 60,254 were granted during the year
under the approved scheme and options of 38,246 were granted during the year under the unapproved scheme. A total of
4,500 options were exercised during the year, leaving a total of 399,000 options in issue.  
Transactions involving directors
No contracts significant to the group's business subsisted during the year in which any director of the company had a material
interest.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and regulations. Company law in the United Kingdom requires directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year,
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, which give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the company and the group, and of the profit or loss of the group for the year. In preparing those financial
statements, the directors confirm that they have:
• selected appropriate accounting policies and then applied them consistently.
• made judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
• followed applicable IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements. 
• prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis.
The directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records, for safeguarding the assets of the group and for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The directors are also responsible for the
preparation of the directors’ report and other information in the annual report. In so far as the directors are aware, there is no
relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware, and the directors have taken all steps that they ought
to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of this
information.  Page 29
Directors’ Report
To the best of the directors’ knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the management report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the
company and the undertaking included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal
risks and uncertainties that they face.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ indemnity
The company has purchased and maintained throughout the year directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect of its
directors. The directors also have the benefit of the indemnity provision contained in the Articles against liabilities incurred by
them in the course of carrying out their duties or the exercise of their powers.
Substantial shareholdings
The directors have been advised of the following individual interests and groups of interests, held by persons acting together,
and excluding directors’ shareholdings set out above, which at 31 May 2008 exceed 3% of the ordinary share capital of the
company.

Directors’ Report
Employees
Information about the group and factors affecting its performance is provided to employees through the house magazine,
Pochin Post and via Pochinet, the group’s corporate intranet. In addition, arrangements for consulting and involving employees
on matters affecting their interests at work, and informing them of the performance of their employing business and the group,
are developed in ways appropriate to each business. A variety of approaches are adopted, aimed at encouraging the
involvement of employees in effective communication and consultation, and the contribution of productive ideas at all levels.
This includes the formation of a communications group in addition to the several steering committees established to promote
and implement group strategy through improvements and innovation in working practices.
The establishment and maintenance of safe working practices are of the greatest importance to the group and special training
in health and safety is provided for employees. The group has produced health and safety policies to cover all aspects of its
activities and the executive management and subsidiary directors monitor adherence to these policies. Regular reports are fed
back to the board who have ultimate responsibility for health and safety throughout the group. A copy of the group health and
safety policies can be obtained from the company secretary or can be viewed electronically on the company web site.
The group’s employment policies do not discriminate between employees, or potential employees, on the grounds of gender,
age, ethnic origin, nationality, religious belief, race or sexual orientation. It is group policy to give full and fair consideration to
the employment of disabled persons where they have the necessary abilities and skills for the position, and wherever possible
the group continues to employ persons who become disabled whilst they are with the group. The group ensures that training,
career development, and promotion opportunities for disabled persons are, as far as possible, identical to those of other
employees who are not disabled.
Further details of important issues relating to our employees are set out on page 18.
Creditor payment policy
It is the policy of the company that each of the businesses in the group should agree appropriate terms and conditions for its
transactions with suppliers and sub-contractors (by means ranging from standard written terms to individually negotiated
contracts) and that payment should be made in accordance with those terms and conditions provided that the supplier has
also complied with them. At 31 May 2008, the group had 30 days purchases (2007: 32 days) outstanding in trade creditors.
Additional information for shareholders
Following implementation of the EU Transparency Directive in the UK, the half-yearly financial results and interim management
report need no longer be sent to shareholders. It is therefore proposed that the Interim Report for the half year ending 30
November 2008 and thereafter will be published on the company’s website. In addition to the environmental benefit associated
with the reduced use of paper, this proposal will also save printing and mailing costs.
Following implementation of the EU Takeover Directive in the UK, the following description provides the required relevant
information for shareholders where not already provided elsewhere in the financial statements. This description summarises
certain provisions of the current Articles and applicable English law concerning companies (the Companies Act 1985 (as
amended) and the Companies Act 2006, together the “Companies Acts”). This is a summary only and the relevant provisions
of the Companies Acts or the Articles should be consulted if further information is required.
Share capital
The company’s issued share capital comprises 20,800,000 ordinary shares of 25p each. As at 31 May 2008, the ordinary
shares represented 100% of the issued share capital of the company.  
Rights and obligations attaching to the shares
Subject to the Companies Acts and other shareholder rights, any share may be issued with such rights and restrictions as the
company may by special resolution decide or, if no resolution has been passed or so far as the resolution does not make
specific provision, as the board may decide. 
Voting
Under and subject to the provisions of the Articles and subject to any special rights or restrictions as to voting attached to
shares, on a show of hands every member present in person shall have one vote and on a poll every member who is present
in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he is the holder. Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to
exercise all or any of their rights to attend, speak and vote on their behalf at a general meeting. Page 31
Directors’ Report
Restrictions on voting
A member shall not be entitled to vote at any general meeting in respect of any shares held by him unless all calls and other
sums presently payable by him in respect of that share have been paid. None of the shares in issue contain any special control
rights. Full details of the deadlines for exercising voting rights in respect of the resolutions to be considered at the AGM, to be
held on 24 October 2008, are set out in the Notice of AGM.
Dividends and distributions
The company may, by ordinary resolution, declare a dividend to be paid to the members but no dividend shall exceed the
amount recommended by the board. In the opinion of the board, interim dividends may be paid whenever the financial position
of the company justifies it.
Winding up
Under the Articles, if the company is in liquidation, the liquidator may, with the sanction of an extraordinary resolution of the
company and any other authority required by statute:
• divide among the members in specie any part of the assets of the company; or 
• vest any part of the assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of members or any of them as the resolution shall
provide.
Transfer of shares
All the ordinary shares rank equally and subject to the restrictions in the Articles, any member may transfer all or any of his
shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual form or in any other form which the board may approve. The board may, in its
absolute discretion and without giving any reason, refuse to register any transfer of a share not fully paid up or any transfer of
a share on which the company has a lien. 
Repurchase of shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the Company may purchase its shares.
Amendment of Articles of Association
The Articles may be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting.
Appointment and replacement of directors
The directors shall not, unless otherwise determined by an ordinary resolution of the company, be less than three nor more than
ten in number. Directors may be appointed by the board for such period (subject to statute) and on such terms as it may decide
and may revoke or terminate any such appointment. At each AGM, any director selected to retire by rotation shall retire from
office. The company may by extraordinary resolution of which special notice has been given in accordance with the Companies
Acts, remove any director before his period of office has expired notwithstanding anything in the Articles or in any agreement
between him and the company. The office of a director shall also be vacated if:
• he is prohibited by law from being a director; or
• he becomes bankrupt or makes any agreement or composition with his creditors; or
• he becomes of unsound mind; or
• for more than six months he is absent, without special leave of absence from the board, from meetings of the board held
during that period and the board resolves that his office be vacated; or
• he serves on the company notice of his wish to resign.
Powers of the directors
The business of the company shall be managed by the board which may exercise all the powers of the company, subject to
statute, the Articles and any ordinary resolution of the company. The board may exercise all the powers of the company to
borrow money and to mortgage or charge all or any part of its undertaking, property and assets and uncalled capital and to
issue debentures and other securities, subject to the provisions of the Articles.
Significant agreements
The directors acknowledge that a number of contracts could alter in the event of a change of control. None is considered to
be significant in terms of their potential impact on the group in this event.
  Page 32
Directors’ Report
Proposed changes to the company’s Articles of Association
As indicated in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts, a review of the Articles has been undertaken to reflect the introduction
of further provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”). The Act sets out directors’ general duties which largely codify the
existing law but with some changes. Under the Act, from 1 October 2008, a director must avoid a situation where he has, or
can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict with the company’s interests. The requirement is
very broad and could apply, for example, if a director becomes a director of another company or a trustee of another
organisation. The Act allows directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where appropriate,
where the articles of association contain a provision to this effect. The Act also allows the articles of association to contain other
provisions for dealing with directors’ conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty. It is therefore proposed to amend the Articles
to give the directors authority to approve such situations and to include other provisions to allow conflicts of interest to be dealt
with in a similar way to the current position. It is also proposed to amend the Articles to contain provisions relating to confidential
information, attendance at board meetings and availability of board papers to protect the director being in breach of duty if a
conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest arises. These provisions will only apply where the position giving rise to a
potential conflict has previously been authorised by the directors.
The consent of shareholders is required to any changes in the Articles and, accordingly, there is proposed as Special Business
in the Notice of AGM, the text of a special resolution which is being proposed to amend the Articles to this effect.
There are safeguards which will apply when the directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict. First, only
directors who have no interest in the matter being considered will be able to take the relevant decision, and secondly, in taking
the decision the directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the company’s success.
The directors will be able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they think this is appropriate.
The Notice of AGM containing details of this proposed special resolution is an important document and any shareholder who
is in any doubt as to what action to take in respect of it should consult appropriate independent advisors. In the event that
shareholders have sold or transferred shares in the capital of the company, they should pass the Notice of AGM to the person
through whom the sale or transfer was effected for transmission to the purchaser or transferee.
Information rights
Beneficial owners of shares who have been nominated by the registered holder of those shares to receive information rights
under the Act are required to direct all communication to the registered holder of their shares, rather than to the company’s
registrars, Capita Registrars, or to the company directly.
Auditors
Grant Thornton offer themselves for reappointment as independent auditors of the company and resolutions concerning their
re-appointment and fixing of their remuneration will be proposed at the AGM.

Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have
been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the group’s financial statements. IFRS 7
is a new accounting standard that has been adopted in the year. The impact of this standard has been to increase the disclosure
in relation to financial instruments.
Basis of preparation
These accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and with those
parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The accounts have been prepared under the
historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, the revaluation of certain financial assets and
liabilities, share based payments and the pension surplus.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on
management's best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates:
(i) assessment of stage of completion of contracts – in assessing the allocation of revenues and costs to accounting periods,
and the consequential assets and liabilities, the group reviews the stage of completion as assessed by the contract surveyor
and the forecast outturn of the project.
(ii) valuations of investment properties are based on current market conditions, tenant occupancy and quality of leases.
Impairments in relation to investment property are considered when assessing the valuation.
(iii) impairment reviews are completed based on value in use calculations determined using anticipated future cash flows and
discount rates. In assessing potential impairments required the group considers the forecast outcome of projects.
(iv) inflation and mortality assumptions, discount rates, rates of return on assets and rates of salary and pension increases
reflected in the IAS 19 pension charge.
(v) assumptions on the expected life of share options, volatility of shares, risk free yield to maturity, and expected dividend yield
on shares used in the IFRS 2 fair value of share options.
The following new standards and interpretations are those which are in issue but not yet effective and have not been
adopted early by the group.
• IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (revised 2007) – effective 1 January 2009
• IAS 23 Borrowing Costs (revised 2007) - effective 1 January 2009
• IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (revised 2008) - effective 1 January 2009
• Amendment to IFRS 2 and IAS 27 - effective 1 January 2009
• IFRS 8 Operating Segments - effective 1 January 2009
There is not expected to be a significant impact on the group financial statements as a result of the above standards
becoming effective.
Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements include the accounts of Pochin’ s PLC and subsidiaries controlled by the group. Control exists where
the company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits
from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are presently exercisable are taken into account. The financial
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the
date that control ceases. Acquisitions of subsidiaries are dealt with by the purchase method. The purchase method involves the
recognition at fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date,
regardless of whether or not they were recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition.
Business combinations completed prior to date of transition to IFRS
The group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations prior to date of
transition, which was at 1 June 2004.
Accordingly the classification of the combination (acquisition, reserve acquisition or merger) remains unchanged from that used
under UK GAAP. Asset and liabilities are recognised at date of transition if they would be recognised under IFRS, and are
measured using their UK GAAP carrying amount immediately post-acquisition as deemed cost under IFRS, unless IFRS
requires fair value measurement. Deferred tax and minority interest are adjusted for the impact of any consequential
adjustments after taking advantage of the transitional provisions.
The transitional provisions used for past business combinations apply equally to past acquisitions of interests in associates and
joint ventures. Page 40
Accounting policies
Joint ventures and associates
Entities whose economic activities are controlled jointly by the group and by other ventures independent of the group are
accounted for using the equity method.
Joint ventures are contractual arrangements whereby the group undertakes an economic activity which is subject to joint
control with third parties. The group’s interest in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method as des below for
associates.
Associates are those entities over which the group has significant influence but which are neither subsidiaries nor interests in
joint ventures. Investments in associates are recognised initially at cost and subsequently accounted for using the equity
method. Acquired investments in associates are also subject to purchase method accounting. However any goodwill or fair
value adjustment attributable to the share in the associate is included in the amount recognised as investment in associates.
All subsequent changes to the share of interest in the equity of the associate are recognised in the group’s carrying amount of
the investment. Changes resulting from the profit or loss generated by the associate are reported in “share of profits of
associates” in the consolidated income statement and therefore affect net results of the group. These changes include
subsequent depreciation, amortisation and impairment of the fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities.
Items that have been recognised directly in the associate’s equity are recognised in the consolidated equity of the group.
However, when the group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any
unsecured receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on
behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequently reports profits, the investor resumes recognising its share of those profits
only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in the
associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset
transferred. Amounts reported in the financial statements of associates have been adjusted where necessary to ensure
consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the group.
Investments
The parent company’s investment in its subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures is recorded at cost.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in respect of construction work executed during
the year (see below, Construction contracts), development revenue and other revenue and services as supplied, but excludes value
added tax. Development revenue is recognised on completion of contracts. Rental income, excluding value added tax, is
recognised on an accruals basis.
Goodwill
Goodwill representing the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the group’s share of the identifiable net assets
acquired, is capitalised and reviewed annually for impairment. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Negative goodwill is recognised immediately after the acquisition in the income statement.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to date of transition to IFRS remains in reserves. There is no re-instatement of goodwill
that was amortised prior to transition to IFRS. Goodwill previously written off to reserves is not written back to profit or loss on
subsequent disposal.
Intangible assets
Assets acquired as part of a business combination
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is deemed to have
a cost to the group of its fair value at the acquisition date. The fair value of the intangible asset reflects market expectations
about the probability that the future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the group. Where an intangible asset
might be separable, but only together with a related tangible or intangible asset, the group of assets is recognised as a single
asset separately from goodwill where the individual fair values of the assets in the group are not reliably measurable. Where the
individual fair value of the complimentary assets are reliably measurable, the group recognises them as a single asset provided
the individual assets have similar useful lives. Page 41
Accounting policies
Construction contracts
Contract revenue reflects the contract activity during the year and is measured at the fair value of consideration received or
receivable. When the outcome can be assessed reliably, contract revenue and associated costs are recognised as revenue and
expenses respectively by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. The stage of
completion of the contract at the balance sheet date is assessed by reference to work done, measured by qualified quantity
surveyors.
Where the outcome of a long term contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract
costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable, and contract costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which
they are incurred.
In the case of a fixed price contract, the outcome of a construction contract is deemed to be estimated reliably when all the
following conditions are satisfied:
• total contract revenue can be measured reliably
• it is probable that economic benefits associated with the contract will flow to the group
• both the contract costs to complete the contract and the stage of completion at the balance sheet date can be measured
reliably, and 
• the contract costs attributable to the contract can be clearly identified and measured reliably so that actual contract costs
incurred can be compared with prior estimates.
In the case of a cost plus contract, the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably when it is probable that
the economic benefits associated with the contract will flow to the group, and the contract costs attributable to the contract,
whether or not specifically reimbursable, can be clearly identified and measured reliably.
The gross amount due from customers for contract work is presented as an asset for all contracts in progress for which costs
incurred plus recognised profits (less recognised losses) exceeds progress billings. The gross amounts due to customers for
contract work is presented as a liability for all contracts in progress for which progress billings exceed costs incurred plus
recognised profits (less losses).
Full provision is made for losses on all contracts in the year in which the loss is first foreseen.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at acquisition cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on the original cost of assets, in equal instalments over the assets useful economic lives. 
The following terms are generally applicable:
• freehold buildings over 40 years
• leasehold buildings over 40 years or the term of the lease if less
• plant and machinery over 3 to 8 years
• vehicles over 4 to 5 years
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Material residual value estimates are updated as required.
Borrowing costs on property, plant and equipment under construction are capitalised during the period of construction based
on specific funds borrowed.
Investment properties
Investment properties are revalued annually and are included in the balance sheet at their open market value. The surplus or deficit
resulting from either a change in the fair value or the sale of an investment property is recognised immediately in the income
statement. Page 42
Accounting policies
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are deductible in different periods from those in which they are
recognised in the financial statements, or are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Such assets and
liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or other assets and liabilities
(other than in a business combination) in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and
interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or
credited in the income statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred
tax is also dealt with in equity.
Impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable
cash flows (cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at 
a cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of
the related business combination and represent the lowest level within the group at which management monitors the related
cash flows.
Goodwill, other individual assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill, other intangible assets with an indefinite useful
life, and those intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets
or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value
in use based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation. Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to which
goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the carrying amount of goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is charged
pro rata to the other assets in the cash generating unit. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed
for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist.
Leases
As Lessee
Leases are classified as finance leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value
of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the liability and finance charge to produce a constant
rate of interest on the finance lease balance outstanding. Assets capitalised under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter
of the useful life of the asset or the lease term and adjusted for impairment losses. The interest expense component is recognised
in the income statement.
Leases other than finance leases are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised as an
expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
As Lessor
Rentals receivable under operating leases are included in revenue on a straight line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are
spread over the term of the lease.
  Page 43
Accounting policies
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs of ordinarily interchangeable items are assigned using
the first in, first out formula.
Development work in progress includes development land and buildings and is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Borrowing costs are expensed to the income statement except in circumstances where the costs are directly attributable to a
specific development, when borrowing costs are carried forward as development work in progress.
Employee benefits
Defined benefit pension scheme
The group operates a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable salary. The assets of the scheme are held
separately from those of the group.
Pension scheme assets are measured using market values. Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method
and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability. 
The surplus recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit
obligation less the fair value of scheme assets at the balance sheet date.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the group’s defined benefit pension scheme expected to arise from employee
service in the period is charged to the profit from operations. The expected return on the scheme’s assets and the increase during
the period in the present value of the scheme’s liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in finance income or finance
costs respectively. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense. 
Defined contribution pension scheme
The pension costs charged against profits are the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Other employee benefits
Other employee obligations, such as holiday entitlement, are held in accurals at the undiscounted amount that the group expects
to pay as a result of the unused entitlement. 
Share based payments
For equity settled share options, the services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share
options. The fair value is calculated at grant date and recognised in the income statement, together with a corresponding increase
in shareholders’ equity, on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of options that will
eventually vest. Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
IFRS 2 has been applied, in accordance with IFRS 1, to equity settled share options granted on or after 7 November 2002 and
not vested at 1 January 2005.
Financial instruments
Financial Assets
Financial assets, other than hedging instruments, are divided into the following categories: loans and receivables, financial
assets at fair value through profit or loss, and available-for-sale financial assets. Financial assets are assigned to the different
categories by management on initial recognition, depending on the purpose for which the investments were acquired. 
The designation of financial assets is re-evaluated at every reporting date at which a choice of classification or accounting
treatment is available.
All financial assets are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial
assets are initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs, unless they are classified as at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value.
Derecognition of financial assets occurs when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments expire or are transferred
and substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. An assessment for impairment is undertaken
at least at each balance sheet date. Regular way purchases and sales are accounted for on settlement date. 
Interest and other cash flows resulting from holding financial assets are recognised in the income statement using the effective
interest method in accordance with IAS 39. Page 44
Accounting policies
Financial instruments (continued)
Available-for-sale financial assets include non-derivative financial assets that are either designated as such or do not qualify for
inclusion in any of the other categories of financial assets. All financial assets within this category are subsequently measured
at fair value, with changes in value recognised in equity, net of any effects arising from income taxes. Gains and losses arising
from securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in the income statement when they are sold or when the
investment is impaired.
In the case of impairment of available-for-sale assets, any loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the income
statement. Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income
statement. Impairment losses recognised previously on debt securities are reversed through the income statement when
appropriate.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They arise when the group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the
receivables. Loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less
provision for impairment. Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in the income
statement.
Provision against trade receivables is made when objective evidence is received that the group will not be able to collect all
amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as
the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows. 
Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial instruments and are recognised when the group becomes a
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All interest-related charges are recognised as an expense in “finance cost”
in the income statement. Bank loans are raised for support of long term funding of the group’s operations. They are recognised
initially at fair value (net of transaction costs) and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Finance
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, and direct issue costs are charged to the income statement
(where they are not capitalised in development work in progress or non current assets) on an accruals basis using the effective
interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in
which they arise.
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest
rate method.
Dividend distributions payable to the equity shareholders are included in “other short term financial liabilities” when the dividends
are approved in general meeting prior to the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swap
Derivative financial instruments are used by the group to manage its interest exposures. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair
value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are also subsequently carried at fair value. Changes in fair value of
derivatives are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the cashflow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise deposits with banks, bank and cash balances
and liquid investments net of bank overdrafts. In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are included in current borrowings.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost,
using the effective interest rate method. Any difference between the fair value on initial recognition (net of transaction costs) and
the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings.
Government grants
Government grants received on the construction of investment properties are reflected as deferred income and will be released to
the income statement on the eventual disposal of the properties.
Employee share trust
The assets and liabilities of the trust have been reflected in the group accounts with a deduction to equity in respect of own shares
held. Page 45
Notes to the financial statements
1. Segmental information
For management purposes, the group is currently organised into four operating business segments:
Contracting, Property, Residential and Construction Services.
As operations are carried out entirely within the UK, there is no secondary segmental information.
Inter segmental pricing is done on an arms length open market basis.
Segment information about these businesses is presented below.

During the year, five directors (2007: five directors) participated in the group’s defined benefit pension scheme. Retirement benefits
accruing to five directors at 31 May 2008 (2007: five directors) are set out in the directors’ remuneration report.
During the year, one director (2007: one director) participated in the group’s defined contribution scheme.
7. Pension costs
The company sponsors the Pochin’s and Associated Companies Retirement Benefits Plan which operates a defined benefit
scheme and a defined contribution scheme. The defined contribution scheme was established on 1 July 2002 and has been
available to new members from that date. 
The defined benefit scheme was closed to new members on 31 December 2001. The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme
was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 1 July 2005 and updated on an approximate basis to 31 May 2008.
The ordinary contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been equivalent to 16% of pensionable pay. 
These contributions total £403,000 (2007 £431,000) plus a special contribution of £nil (2007: £738,000). The ordinary contribution
rate of 16% is to continue until reviewed following the triennial valuation of the scheme due as at 1 July 2008.
It is the policy of the group to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur outside the Income Statement
and in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
For the year ending 31 May 2008, the group has allocated 14.0% of the total pension surplus to the company (2007: 14.5%).

Notes to the financial statements
7. Pension costs (continued)
The following disclosures are in respect of the group:
Assumptions 
The assets of the scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal
actuarial assumptions:
2008 2007
Inflation 3.6% p.a. 3.2% p.a.
Salary increases 3.6% p.a. 3.2% p.a.
Rate of discount 6.5% p.a. 5.7% p.a.
Pension in payment increases (post April 1997 benefits)* 3.5% p.a. 3.2% p.a.
Revaluation rate for deferred pensioners** 3.6% p.a. 3.2% p.a.
Expected return on plan assets 4.0% p.a. 15.6% p.a.
* no allowance has been made for future discretionary increases on pre April 1997 benefits.
** a number of benefit changes were introduced with effect from 1 November 2006. One of those changes was a limitation on
future increases to pensionable salary which can no longer exceed the rate of inflation.
The mortality assumptions adopted at 31 May 2008 imply the following life expectancies at age 65:
Male currently age 40 24.9 years
Female currently age 40 27.3 years
Male currently age 65 22.9 years
Female currently age 65 25.4 years
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are:
2008 2007
£’000 £’000
Assets 22,719 21,874
Liabilities (21,858) (22,451)
Surplus/(deficit) in scheme 861 (577)
The major categories of the schemes’ assets are as follows:
Equities 14,066 15,663
Bonds 7,400 4,863
Property 1,091 –
Cash 162 1,348
22,719 21,874
Expected long term rate of return
To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, the group considered market expectations at the
beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
2008 2007
Equities 8.4% p.a. 7.5% p.a.
Bonds 5.75% p.a. 5.2% p.a.
Property 8.4% p.a. –
Cash 5.0% p.a. 5.5% p.a.
The expected long term return on cash is equal to bank base rates at the balance sheet date. The expected return on bonds is
determined by reference to UK long dated gilt and bond yields at the balance sheet date. The expected rate of return on equities
and property have been determined by setting an appropriate risk premium above gilt/bond yields having regard to market
conditions at the balance sheet date. Page 51

Final paid 6.25p per share (2007: 6.0p) 1,300 1,248
1,911 1,872
The directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ending 31 May 2008 of 3.0p per share, amounting to
£624,000 in total. It will be paid on 31 October 2008 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 3 October 2008. The
final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 May 2008.
11. Earnings per share
The calculation of earnings per share (basic and diluted) is based on group profit after taxation and minority interests of £2,603,000
(2007: £6,775,000) and the 20,800,000 ordinary shares of 25p in issue at 31 May 2008 and 31 May 2007. The number of shares
used in the calculation has been reduced at 31 May 2008 for the 445,000, (2007: 449,500) shares held in the Employee Share
Trust. Basic earnings per share is 12.8p (2007: 33.4p). The assumed conversion of dilutive options increases the number of shares
by 95,000 (2007: 118,000) shares and so diluted earnings per share reduces to 12.7p (2007: 33.2p).

23. Financial instruments
As referred to in the Financial Review on page 14, the group only uses financial instruments comprising borrowings, cash, liquid
resources, an interest rate swap and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables, that arise directly from its
operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the group’s operations.
The main risks arising from the group financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The board reviews and
agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies have remained unchanged from
previous years.
The group does not have any material exposure to currency rate risks.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the group policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Interest rate risk
The group has followed its treasury policy and has funded its operations by utilising retained profits and by borrowing where appropriate.
The group’s general borrowing facilities are at floating rates of interest and during the year were broadly matched by cash 
and deposits (see note 18), effectively limiting the group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Specific short term borrowings to
finance development projects are at floating rates of interest and the group’s policy is not to seek to fix these rates in view of the
short term nature of the facilities.
The group’s long term borrowings are also at floating rates of interest but the board reviews the risk continually against costs and
benefits involved in taking measures to limit the exposure to increased rates of interest. The group has entered into variable pay
fixed interest rate swaps in respect of short and long term borrowings of £22,500,000 (2007: £7,500,000), which is the borrowing
value for which interest rate swaps are in place. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is £515,000 asset (2007: £253,000 asset).
The groups loans to joint ventures and associates are at floating rates of interest, which reflect the group’s external borrowings.
  Page 66

The interest exposure of the net financial liabilities of the group was:
Interest rate
Fixed Floating Total
£’000 £’000 £’000
At 31 May 2008 216 46,647 46,863
At 31 May 2007 289 30,945 31,234
The floating rate borrowings bear interest at rates based on UK clearing bank base lending rate and LIBOR.
The weighted average rate at which the group has secured its fixed rate borrowings is 5.2%. The weighted average period for
which the rates are fixed is 4.0 years.
The table below indicates the effect on profit before tax if interest rates on group borrowings changed by 50 basis points with all
other variables held constant.
2008 2007
£’000 £’000
Development loans 22 67
Acquisition loans 1 3
Total 23 70
The directors do not consider that there will be significant differences between movements in the fair value of interest rate swaps
and the fair value of related interest bearing loans, on the basis that these loans are relatively short term and any movements are
likely to result in an immaterial net impact.
Liquidity risk
The group seeks to achieve a balance between short and long term funding to maintain continuity and flexibility.
Short term borrowing facilities are used for property development projects. Certain short term project facilities continue to be
available until anticipated development sales are realised.
It is the group’s policy that investment in non current assets is funded from retained profits wherever possible.
Business acquisitions are funded by longer term borrowing, with repayments made out of the cash flow arising from the acquired
businesses.
The group holds bank deposits with a limited number of financial institutions and funding is sourced from a small number of
counterparties.
Credit risk
The group has no significant concentrations of credit risk arising from trade receivables. The group has implemented policies that
require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
Surplus funds held in the group are invested, in line with board-approved policy, in high quality, short term liquid instruments, usually
money market funds or bank deposits. Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate exposure to any one individual
counterparty, taking into account its credit rating. Such counterparty exposures are regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary.
Accordingly, the possibility of material loss arising in the event of non-performance by counterparties is considered to be unlikely.
However the group holds bank deposits with a limited number of financial institutions.
Borrowing facilities 
Details of group borrowings are detailed in note 22.
The group has various undrawn committed borrowing facilities. The facilities available at 31 May 2008 in respect of which all
conditions precedent had been met were as follows:
£’000
Expiring in one year or less 10,000
The facilities included above are subject to review by the providers of the facilities on 30 November 2008.
Fair values 
The difference between the fair values and the book values of the group’s financial assets and liabilities at 31 May 2008 is not
material. It is relevant, in particular, in relation to the loans with joint ventures and associates. Given the directors’ views on the
length of the investments, the interest rate charged and the relative standing of the group’s risk status in the market, this is
considered appropriate.

In completing the above analysis a number of assumptions have been made, which are explained as follows:
1. The Bank of England base rate is assumed to be 5% (2007:5.50%) based on the year end rate.
2. LIBOR is assumed to be 5.115% (2007: 5.61%) based on the year end rate.
3. The revolving credit facility and overdrafts are assumed to be repayable in 12 months based on the contractual terms.
4. Where loans do not have an agreed repayment date, management have made an assumption based on the terms of the
loan.
5. Interest has been included in the contractual maturities based on the applicable interest rate at the year end in relation to
variable rate loans, and accrued for the life of the loan.

32. Share based payments
The Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP) was introduced in 2002. Under the ESOP the remuneration committee can grant
options over shares in the company to employees of the company. Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the
market price of the shares under option of the date of grant. The contractual life of an option is 10 years. Awards under the
ESOP are generally reserved for employees at senior management level and above and 42 employees are currently eligible to
participate in this group. There are no reload features. The company has made annual grants in the final quarter each calendar
year since 2002. Options granted under the ESOP will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant. Exercise
of an option is subject to continued employment. Options were valued using the Binomial model. No performance conditions
were included in the fair value calculations. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are
as follows:
Grant Date 26/10/07 2/11/06
Share price at grant date £3.085 £3.3000
Exercise price £3.085 £3.2988
Number of employees 42 36
Shares under option 98,500 84,000
Vesting period (years) 33
Expected volatility 15% 15%
Option life (years) 10 10
Expected life (years) 33
Expected life (years) 55
Risk free rate (5 year expected life) 4.87% 4.84%
Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 2.70% 2.70%
Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 5% 5%
Expectations of meeting performance criteria 100% 100%
Fair value per option (5 year expected life) £0.53 £0.52
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the annualised standard deviation of daily continuously compounded
returns of the company’s share price over three years from the date of grant. The expected life used in the model has been
adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural
considerations. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the
assumed option life. A reconciliation of option movements over the year to 31 May 2008 is shown below:
2008 2007
Weighted Weighted

Outstanding at 1 June 326,000 £2.75 321,000 £2.39

Exercisable at 31 May 143,000 £1.97 49,500 £1.90
The weighted average share price during the period for options exercised over the year was £3.39 (2007: £3.39). The options
outstanding at 31 May 2008 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 7.7 years (2007: 8.0 years). The range of
exercise prices for outstanding share options is £1.21p to £3.72p. The total charge for the year relating to employee share
based payment plans was £46,000 (2007: £41,000), all of which related to equity settled share based payment transactions.
After deferred tax, the total charge was £32,000 (2007: £29,000).

36. Capital management policies and procedures
Pochin’s capital management objectives are:
• to ensure the group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and 
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders 
by investing in a range of associated market sectors and pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The group’s equity base is largely fixed and therefore capital is sourced through retained earnings, bank borrowings and asset
sales.
The group’s aim is to fund the working capital requirements of its trading activities through short term unsecured overdraft
facilities.
Investment in short to medium term property development activity is funded through a combination of retained earnings and
discrete development financing facilities. Each of these facilities has its own covenant obligations, which the group continually
monitors and operates within.
Long term investment activity is funded through the arrangement of appropriate long term borrowing and where covenant
obligations apply the group continually monitors these requirements and operates within them.
The group funds any speculative developments from retained earnings.
The board manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the
risk characteristics of the underlying assets. To maintain or adjust the capital structure the group may adjust the amount of
dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or sell assets to reduce debt.

Report of the Independent Auditors 
to the members of Pochin’s PLC
We have audited the group and parent company financial
statements (the “financial statements”) of Pochin’s PLC for the
year ended 31 May 2008 which comprise the principal
accounting policies, the group income statement, the group
and parent company balance sheets, the group and parent
company cash flow statements, the group and parent
company statement of recognised income and expense and
notes 1 to 36. These financial statements have been prepared
under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also
audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report
that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the company’s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and
auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report,
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted
by the European Union are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view, whether the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards
the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation
and whether the information given in the Directors’ Report is
consistent with the financial statements. The information
given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific
information presented in the Chairman’s Statement, and the
Chief Executive’s Report, that is cross-referenced from the
Principal Activities section of the Directors’ Report. We also
report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement
reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of
the 2006 Combined Code specified for our review by the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report
if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the
board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the
group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. The other information comprises only the
Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief
Executive’s Report and Financial Review, the Corporate
Governance Statement and the five year summary. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of
any apparent mis-statements or material inconsistencies with
the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to
any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made
by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
group’s and company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are
free from material mis-statement, whether caused by fraud or
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the group financial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
European Union, of the state of the group’s affairs as
at 31 May 2008 and of its profit for the year then
ended.
• the parent company financial statements give a true
and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by
the European Union as applied in accordance with
provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of
the parent company’s affairs as at 31 May 2008. Page 79

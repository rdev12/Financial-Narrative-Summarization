Our business drivers
Our markets have long-term growth potential as customers look 
to focus on their core businesses and outsource non-core and 
back-office functions. Technological developments, such as cloud 
computing and high-speed wireless access, will facilitate this trend.

Where we operate
We serve customers in 43 countries, from facilities in the UK, 
Germany, France, Italy, the USA, India, Singapore, Malaysia,

How we deliver
Our customers are predominantly large companies, with around 
95% of our revenue coming from the private sector. We offer them 
two primary ways to contract with us for processing services:
• 	 	 o u t s o u r c i n g , 	 w h e r e 	 w e 	 o f f e r 	 fi x e d - p r i c e , 	 c o s t - p e r - t r a n s a c t i o n ,	 
cost-plus or gainshare options for a defined scope and quality  
of service
•	 	 Enterprise 	 Partnerships, 	 wher e 	 we 	 form 	 a 	 joint 	 ventur e 	 with 	 our	
customer, who becomes our partner, and use that platform to 
provide them with services, generating savings for them and 
profits for us. We then generate further benefits for both parties 
by adding third party customers to the platform.

What we do
Business processing is at the heart of what we offer. We take on  
our customers’ non-core and back-office functions and perform

How we deliver
Business support and products
In addition to our processing services, we offer our customers  
a range of business support services and products.
Business support

insurance services, recruitment and corporate immigration. These 
services are provided on either a cost-per-project or a time and 
materials basis.

We measure our performance regularly, in great detail and in the 
same way across each of our processing centres around the world.

quantitative and qualitative outputs, such as customer satisfaction. 
We believe that our customers’ perceptions of our service are just  
as important as the actual results.
When our customers buy business processing 
services from us, we contract with them in  
one of two principal ways – outsourcing  
or an Enterprise Partnership.

we are able to meet our customers’ demands for efficiency and

house functions for the variable costs of our services.

where we and the customer share the benefits of cheaper buying.
2 Enterprise Partnerships
An Enterprise Partnership (EP) is a joint venture with our customer, 
through which we provide them with processing services. These 
customers are typically large organisations with significant 
processing needs. A typical EP contract is 10 to 12 years long.
The customer benefits from better processing and lower costs and 
also has the potential to earn profit, as we use the EP’s processing 
platform to offer services to third parties.

The key features of EPs
An EP is a new company, jointly owned by Xchanging and our 
partner. Both parties make board appointments to the EP , but we 
have shareholder and board control. We establish shareholder 
and service committees, with appointments from both us and our 
partner, to oversee shareholder and service matters.
Our partner transfers or licences to the EP the resources and assets  
it has previously used to provide the processing services in-house. 
The EP then provides these services on an outsourced basis. 
Xchanging invests in the EP , to enhance and standardise its 
processes and deliver efficiency and quality improvements. Typically, 
we invest 10% of the day-one revenue, spread over the first two 
years of the contract.
Once we have standardised the processes in the EP , we are able to 
add third-party outsourcing contracts to the platform and generate 
additional revenues. Our partner therefore has the potential to earn 
profits from a function which had previously been a cost to it. Some 
of the EPs give our partner agreed discounts to the day-one cost.
Xchanging receives an annual licence fee for providing our 
intellectual property to the EP , and performance fees. Some of 
the EPs pay out dividends on the bases set out in the respective 
individual shareholder agreements.
For some EPs, we and our partner have the ability to call or put 
each other’s shareholding, after agreed dates or events

ventures with large customers through which 
we provide services to both our partner and 
third parties.

Our people
Our people are fundamental to the delivery  
o f 	 o u r 	 v a l u e s 	 a n d 	 e x c e p t i o n a l 	 c u s t o m e r 	 s e r v i c e .	
T o become the global business processor of 
choice, we recognise that we need people with 
outstanding talent, energy and commitment. 
This means we are always looking at new 
ways to support and develop our people. 
Through this investment we can create and 
maintain a customer-focused, high-performance 
environment which enables our people to fulfil 
their potential.
Developing our people
All of our employees participate in a performance development 
review, which is integral to our business planning process. 
In 2010, we upgraded the performance development review system 
and, as part of these changes, we introduced a more rigorous 
approach to goal setting. The aim was to provide employees with a 
greater understanding of business goals as well as aligning personal 
objectives with these goals. 
We are identifying and assessing people with the potential to progress 
further in our organisation, a process which starts with our graduate 
intake. Our two-year graduate programme is designed to develop the 
n e x t 	 g e n e r a t i o n 	 o f 	 l e a d e r s 	 f o r 	 X c h a n g i n g 	 b y 	 e x p o s i n g 	 g r a d u a t e s 	 t o 	 a	
mix 	 of 	 industry , 	 geographical 	 and 	 functional 	 experience. 	 Thr oughout	
the programme, each graduate receives director-level mentoring and 
rotates through different placements and projects.
Looking after our employees
We have a duty of care to protect our employees’ wellbeing.
As a result, we have reviewed our global wellbeing practices. In the 
UK, we put in place a formal employee wellbeing project team and 
rolled out a number of initiatives, including a cycle-to-work scheme.
In India, we have started to develop a state-of-the-art processing 
centre in a new Special Economic Zone in Shimoga, Karnataka.  
The first phase is due for completion by the end of 2011.  
The construction is following an integrated approach, combining 
energy 	 efficiency 	 – 	 such 	 as 	 maximising 	 the 	 use 	 of 	 natural 	 ventilation 	
instead of air-conditioning – with the shaping of an ideal working 
environment for our employees.

Employee engagement
In 2010, we invited all of our employees to complete our first online 
engagement survey. This resulted in an overall response rate of 69%. 
The survey identified areas and initiatives which were working 
well, and areas for improvement. The survey action planning took 
place at a regional level and proposed actions were based on 
recommendations from employees and management.
We are committed to ensuring our people understand the business 
and the part they play in our success. This means we encourage 
open, two-way communication. In 2010, we launched a global 
intranet site to share information, as well as to inspire and motivate 
employees. We also regularly use channels such as webcasts and 
video broadcasts to reach employees in an imaginative and  
cost-effective way.

Outsourcing market trends
Market advisory firm Everest notes that the outsourcing industry has 
moved into a phase in which both buyers and providers know how 
to succeed
1
. 	 The 	 challenge 	 for 	 the 	 next 	 five 	 years 	 will 	 be 	 making 	
outsourcing work better. Outlined below are trends that strongly 
signal a move towards more effective outsourcing arrangements.
Cloud computing and 4G
Cloud computing is redefining the outsourcing marketplace,  
with industry commentators predicting an increasing shift towards 
c l o u d - b a s e d 	 s e r v i c e s 	 o v e r 	 t h e 	 n e x t 	 fi v e 	 y e a r s .	
There is also a trend towards commoditised IT services, through 
high-speed mobile communications such as 4G. 4G enables data 
transfer rates that are at least ten times higher than 3G, allowing 
ubiquitous wireless access.
These technologies have the potential to facilitate new sources 
of value in outsourcing, most importantly by enabling a global 
outsourcing model. This is a very appealing proposition for 
customers in a tight economy. For outsourcing providers, cloud 
computing and 4G provide an emerging growth opportunity  
across regions and industries. 
Market review
Global sourcing
Companies across the world increasingly see global sourcing  
as a key enabler of competitive advantage.
Global sourcing represents US$92-96 billion in revenues across IT 
and BPO services
2
. Whilst the US has traditionally been the largest 
sourcing market, Europe has grown faster over the past five years 
and now represents 30% of the total. This growth was driven 
by European-headquartered multinationals looking to remain 
competitive with their US and global counterparts. Growth is  
now driven by rising costs and competition, shortage of skills,  
global 	 expansion 	 of 	 firms, 	 and 	 the 	 incr easing 	 pr oof 	 of 	 concept 	
among peers.
Expanding 	 demand 	 for 	 global 	 sour cing 	 translates 	 into 	 a 	 market	
opportunity for outsourcing providers that have capability and 
scale in lower-cost offshore and nearshore centres. This increased 
receptiveness will also enable sustainable cost management for 
outsourcing providers.
Value-added services
As companies become more receptive to outsourcing,  
t h e y 	 a r e 	 e x p l o r i n g 	 w a y s 	 t o 	 g e t 	 f u r t h e r 	 v a l u e 	 f r o m 	 t h e i r 	 p r o v i d e r s .	
This means a growing demand for value-added services that help  
an organisation integrate and standardise processes, improve  
service levels, build stronger supplier and employee relationships  
and introduce best practices.
Sector developments
T h e 	 C h i e f 	 E x e c u t i v e 	 O f fi c e r ’ s 	 s t a t e m e n t 	 d e s c r i b e s 	 h o w 	 w e 	 a r e	
introducing a focus on global sectors to the way we manage our 
business. These are some of the key global trends in these sectors.
The global recession significantly affected 
buying patterns for outsourced services, causing 
customers to postpone both discretionary and 
structural spending. Discretionary spending is 
now returning in IT and process re-engineering 
as we move out of recession and into a  
slow-growth period.

Financial services
As in the insurance industry, the financial services industry is seeing 
significant changes in its operating environment, particularly in 
respect of stricter regulatory regimes. Again, industry-specific 
capabilities are competitive differentiators for outsourcers.
The financial services sector is adopting outsourcing to manage 
risk, reduce costs and comply with increasingly rigorous regulatory 
demands. According to a 2010 survey
3
, one in ten financial 
s e r v i c e s 	 fi r m s 	 e x p l o r e d 	 m o v i n g 	 i n t o 	 s o m e 	 f o r m 	 o f 	 i n d u s t r y - s p e c i fi c	
outsourcing for the first time. These were typically areas offering  
an immediate labour arbitrage opportunity, such as trade 
settlement transactions and mortgage processing. 
Insurance services
The insurance industry is undergoing a fundamental change in 
its operating environment. Customers are looking for partners 
who can help them address this challenge, which means that 
for outsourcers, industry-specific capabilities are competitive 
differentiators.
The sector is gravitating towards integrated, electronic placing 
and settlement of claims, both within the London market and 
globally. The forthcoming Solvency II regulations will require insurers 
to improve their data management capability, to underpin their 
r i s k 	 m a n a g e m e n t 	 a n d 	 c a p i t a l 	 a d e q u a c y . 	 T h i s 	 i s 	 e x p e c t e d 	 t o 	 d r i v e	
ongoing investment in technology services, particularly around 
processing capacity and advanced data analytics.
T echnology
Technology is a key competitive differentiator among outsourcing 
providers. It has become ubiquitous across business functions, 
fuelling demand for applications that help drive better productivity, 
are cheaper to run and faster to access. This has affected the 
outsourcing market in two principal ways. 
It has blurred the lines between BPO and IT outsourcing 
engagements. Outsourcers can provide consumption-based pricing 
models and sophisticated virtual resources without upfront capital 
investment. This is a compelling proposition for customers. 
It has also led to convergence of IT delivery models. Outsourcing 
contracts to provide technology as a managed service are gaining 
traction. These include managing software, infrastructure and 
platforms as a service. In the front office, such contracts help 
customers increase their speed to market with new products and 
enhance their adaptability to change. In the back office, they help 
optimise processes and thereby reduce overheads. The convergence 
of IT delivery models also sets the foundation for cloud-based 
services going forward. 
Procurement and HR
In the present slow recovery phase, outsourcing customers 
are seeking to capture more value from their HR outsourcing, 
allowing for more innovative deal terms and paving the way 
for cross-functional outsourcing. The inherent cost reductions 
from procurement and technology can be harnessed to support 
innovation in HR outsourcing. 
The procurement outsourcing marketplace is evolving, with more 
sophistication in pricing terms and the scope of contracts. There 
is a growing interest, particularly in Western Europe, the USA and 
Australasia, which will lead to significant market growth in 2011 
and beyond, with 20% year-on-year growth globally
4
. 
The primary driver of this growth is customers’ focus on their 
strategic activities and their lack of interest in investing in 
technology or talent to drive value from indirect procurement. 
Procurement outsourcing providers are able to leverage talent and 
technology across customers, as well as aggregate spend, to drive 
better value from supplier relationships.

Annual report and accounts 2010
2010 was a difficult year, characterised by performance issues with 
parts of the Cambridge business and a weak economic background 
in our principal markets. 
In 2010, revenue increased by 4%. Underlying operating profit 
was £67.3 million (FY 2009: £63.9 million), helped by contract 
settlements and consultancy income totalling £11.8 million  
( F Y 	 2 0 0 9 	 £ 8 . 0 	 m i l l i o n ) . 	 I n 	 a d d i t i o n , 	 e x c e p t i o n a l 	 i t e m s 	 t o t a l l i n g	
£112.5 million have been recorded, including an impairment 
provision against goodwill arising from the Cambridge acquisition. 
The operating cash flow of the year was similar to 2009 and the  
net cash balance of £24.8 million at the year end was slightly  
higher than at the end of 2009 (£22.1 million).
Cambridge
Cambridge was purchased at the beginning of 2009 and the results 
to date, particularly in the American workers’ compensation and  
ITO businesses, have been very disappointing. The business in India  
is performing well. The results from the Australian and the other

the future. The acquisition has been costly in terms of profitability, 
cash flow and management distraction. A plan is underway to 
resolve the major issues as quickly as possible.
Board changes
In October, Richard Houghton stood down from the Board and his 
role as Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and Ken Lever was appointed 
his successor. 
On 9 February, we announced that David Andrews had decided  
t o 	 s t e p 	 d o w n 	 f r o m 	 t h e 	 B o a r d 	 a n d 	 h i s 	 r o l e 	 a s 	 C h i e f 	 E x e c u t i v e	 
Officer (CEO) with immediate effect. As David was the founder  
and successful creator of Xchanging as a business, I am delighted  
he has agreed to take on a new role as Senior Adviser to me,  
to support Xchanging’s business development initiatives.
We have begun the search for David’s successor as CEO. Whilst 
this is ongoing, Ken Lever will be acting CEO in addition to his 
r esponsibilities 	 as 	 CFO, 	 and 	 I 	 will 	 support 	 him 	 as 	 Executive 	 Chairman.
Our people
It is in difficult circumstances that we recognise the strength  
and resolve of our people, our most valuable resource. The last  
few weeks have been challenging but I am confident that our

employees have the determination to meet these challenges  
and to put Xchanging back on the path to becoming the global 
business processor of choice.
Our customers
Xchanging’s strength is based on unrelenting attention to customer 
service. We have been reassured by the continued support of all 
of our customers and partners during 2010 and look forward to 
building on these relationships in 2011.
Liquidity
The Group’s liquidity and cash position remain sound and cash 
generation will be a primary focus in the coming year. 
Dividend
Shareholders will be disappointed by our decision not to declare a 
dividend in respect of 2010. However, we want to conserve our cash 
resources in the business for the changes we are effecting in 2011 
and to fund the growth opportunities we see. We will review this 
again at the end of the year. 
Action plan
We have developed a four-part action plan to overhaul our entire 
business, seeking value creation through regenerated profitable 
revenue growth and cash flow improvement. Where value is best 
created through disposal, we will pursue this option. The first part 
of our plan, a fundamental value assessment of our entire business, 
is complete, and we have already started taking specific action. We 
will report on progress at the half year. There will be costs associated 
with any such restructuring but we believe this will put the company 
in a better position to resume growth in 2012.

Annual report and accounts 2010
Overview 
In 2010, Xchanging’s revenue increased by 4.0% to £780.6 million, 
as new business of £73.7 million and acquisitions were partially 
o f f s e t 	 b y 	 l e a k a g e 	 f r o m 	 e x i s t i n g 	 c u s t o m e r s .	
Our underlying operating profit rose by 5.3% to £67.3 million, 
helped by acquisitions and by contract settlements and consultancy 
income. Although it is in the nature of our business to see such 
items each year, in the interests of clarity we believe it is helpful at 
this 	 time 	 to 	 identify 	 them. 	 Excluding 	 these 	 items, 	 adjusted 	 operating	
profit was 0.8% lower at £55.5 million. Net cash ended slightly up 
on the year at £24.8 million.
After amortisation of intangibles and a significant adjustment  
to goodwill related to the Cambridge business, it is disappointing  
to have to report a statutory loss for the year of £55.6 million. 
Whilst the problematic parts of the Cambridge business have been 
the focus of discussion in 2010, we have also made positive progress 
in other parts of the Group. We are now the largest independent 
investment account processor in Germany following further new

helped us maintain and strengthen our leadership position in the  
UK insurance market.
Cambridge 
Cambridge gives us a strategically significant presence in India, 
a d d i t i o n a l 	 t e c h n o l o g y 	 e x p e r t i s e 	 a n d 	 s o m e 	 i m p o r t a n t 	 i n t e r n a t i o n a l	
customers. However, it is clear that the cost of the acquisition in 
terms of profitability, cash flow and management distraction has 
been significant and it has set back Xchanging’s development. The 
business overall, which in 2010 accounted for 17.9% of our revenue 
and 3.2% of adjusted operating profit, underperformed during the 
y e a r 	 a n d 	 i t 	 i s 	 u n l i k e l y 	 t h a t 	 t h e 	 b e n e fi t s 	 w e 	 e x p e c t e d 	 a t 	 t h e 	 t i m e 	 o f	
the acquisition will be fully realised. The recession had a part to play, 
preventing customers placing new business due to pressures on 
discretionary spend. 
The Cambridge business in India has performed well, both 
operationally and financially, and has given us a significant 
low-cost production base. This supports our strategic aim to 
increase offshoring and reduce our structural cost base. However, 
the Australian business has been less successful and the US 
has significantly underperformed, with the ITO and workers’ 
compensation business lines, which are heavily dependent on the 
US economy, severely hit by volume reductions, price pressures and 
competition. 
One of our critical actions for 2011 is therefore to stem Cambridge’s 
losses and restrict its cash outflow. We have initiated a plan to 
address the issues around Cambridge, including the transfer of the 
pr ofitable 	 and 	 cash-generating 	 businesses 	 to 	 Xchanging 	 and 	 an 	 exit 	
from those areas that do not fit into our strategy. We will report on 
our progress during 2011. 
Whilst these actions will lead to performance improvement in time, 
we believe it right to recognise a reduction in the value of goodwill 
which arose on the acquisition. The goodwill impairment reflects 
Cambridge’s substantial deviation from the original business case. 
It is not generating sufficient cash flow to support the valuation 
nor, based on what we currently know, is it likely to do so in the 
foreseeable future.
Operational performance
Our business structure
Since 2009 we have managed our business along regional lines, in 
part 	 due 	 to 	 the 	 expansion 	 of 	 our 	 business 	 following 	 the 	 Cambridge	
acquisition. We are now introducing to our structure an increasing 
focus on four global sectors: Insurance services, Financial services, 
Technology, and Procurement and HR. In addition to presenting the 
financial information on a regional basis in note 4 to the accounts 
we have also reported the information for each sector and set out 
our performance review by business sector. 
In revenue terms, our Insurance services, Financial services and 
Procurement and HR sectors are relatively evenly balanced. Although 
smaller, our Technology business has been growing in both strategic 
importance and size and offers significant potential for the future. 
Sector performance
Insurance services 
Overall revenue decreased by 2.2% to £258.0 million (FY 2009: 
£263.8 million) and adjusted operating profit rose by 12.8% to 
£33.0 million (FY 2009: £29.3 million). Adjusted operating profit 
margins improved to 12.8% (FY 2009: 11.1%). 
The revenue decline was driven by the workers’ compensation 
businesses in the US and Australia, which underperformed due 
to volume declines. In the highly competitive US market, this 
underperformance was accentuated by customer losses, including 
the California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA), and in 
Australia by lower bonus revenue amounts. 
The majority of our insurance business is in the UK and this business 
performed strongly. Margins also improved, benefiting from 
the 2009 restructuring carried out in the UK, which generated 
productivity savings.
In Australia, the impact of a loss-making contract was offset  
by strong performances elsewhere.
We won new business in the year, adding a further contract  
with Aon Australia’s Risk Solutions business, initially for two years,

with Aon (see page 22).
We are restructuring the businesses in the US and Australia  
and will divert resources to those areas of the business where  
our competitive position is strongest. We will then build globally  
on the strengths of the UK business.  20 
Xchanging  
Annual report and accounts 2010
Financial services
Revenue from Financial services rose by 15.9% to £194.8 million  
(FY 2009: £168.0 million), and adjusted operating profit decreased 
by 25.5% to £11.3 million (FY 2009: £15.1 million). Adjusted 
operating margins fell to 5.8% (FY 2009: 9.0%).
The main drivers of the revenue growth in the year were twofold. 
We completed the migration of the FondsServiceBank accounts 
onto the Fondsdepot Bank (FDB) platform, driving additional volume 
through this Enterprise Partnership. We also added investment 
accounts from SEB Bank, SEB Asset Management, VERITAS 
INVESTMENT TRUST, Goethaer Versicherung and OnVista Bank.  
The second half of the year also saw a first contribution from the 
Kedrios Enterprise Partnership. 
Transaction volumes in securities processing and fund administration 
remained low compared to previous years following the global 
financial crisis. However, towards the end of the year the market 
saw some signs of revival with a higher number of Initial Public 
Offerings and corporate actions (such as rights issues).
There were two one-off contract settlement payments in the year. 
One was due to the acquisition of one customer by another. The 
second was due to modification of a customer’s contract terms. 
During the year we established a new Enterprise Partnership 
in Italy with the Kedrios subsidiary of SIA-SSB. This Enterprise 
P a r t n e r s h i p 	 c o m b i n e s 	 o u r 	 e x p e r t i s e 	 i n 	 s e c u r i t i e s 	 p r o c e s s i n g 	 a n d	
investment account administration with the Kedrios strength in fund 
administration in the Italian market. This business has, however, 
underperformed and platform migration is proving challenging.  
We will address these issues in 2011 but there will continue to be an 
adverse effect on financial performance in 2011, with an anticipated 
loss in the order of €4 million to €5 million. 
Technology
Technology sector revenues rose by 24.7% to £116.2 million  
(FY 2009: £93.2 million) and adjusted operating profit increased by 
25.1% to £17.4 million (FY 2009: £13.9 million). Adjusted operating 
margins were maintained at 15.0% (FY 2009: 14.9%).
Our Technology business overall performed well during the year 
with particularly strong growth in the UK. This was partly offset by 
a decline in discretionary IT spend in the US and Asia Pacific markets 
affecting ITO revenues. The outlook for the Asia Pacific region  
looks improved.
In June we acquired Data Integration (DI), one of the UK’s leading 
networking, security and communication technology providers.  
The acquisition has strengthened our technology capabilities and 
also brought an important UK customer base.
The new capabilities that came with DI were instrumental in 
securing two contracts with Gatwick Airport, launching a strong 
new strategic relationship. 
We delivered new technology services and systems to the London 
Metal 	 Exchange, 	 deepening 	 our 	 existing 	 r elationship 	 with 	 this	
important customer.
Illustrating the market trend to seek outsourcing in order to meet 
regulatory requirements, we launched, in partnership with hardware 
and software providers, a data management service that meets 
Solvency II regulations.
In the US, our ITO business continued to suffer from competitive 
pressures and declining revenues and profitability. This Cambridge 
business will be included in the strategic review of our US 
operations.
Procurement and HR
Procurement and HR revenue fell by 6.1% to £211.6 million  
(FY 2009: £225.2 million) and adjusted operating profit fell by 
34.4% to £11.1 million (FY 2009: £16.9 million). Adjusted operating 
margins fell to 5.2% (FY 2009: 7.5%).
The decline in the year was mainly attributable to two factors. 
Procurement revenues fell as government spending reductions 
affected key customers, leading to lower labour volumes. In HR 
services, revenues declined owing to contracts not being renewed in 
2009 and 2010. 
We won a five-year multinational contract with the pallet and

Action plan for 2011
We did not see the revenue growth we would have liked during 
2010 and our profit was helped by a number of non-recurring items. 
We recognise the need to achieve greater revenue growth in 2011 
and beyond, as well as to improve our operating margins through 
cost initiatives. Improving profitability will in turn increase our cash 
generation and value for our shareholders.
To achieve these improvements, we have developed a series of 
actions in four areas: strategic and intrinsic value review, operational 
improvements, revenue growth and cash flow and funding.  
A number of these actions are already under way.
Strategic and intrinsic value review
As the first part of our plan, we have conducted a root and 
branch review of our entire business portfolio. From this we have 
identified our businesses with unsatisfactory returns, including 
the underperforming parts of Cambridge and Kedrios. We also 
examined 	 the 	 value 	 cr eation 	 and 	 sharing 	 models 	 in 	 each 	 of 	 our	
Enterprise Partnerships to assess their attractiveness. 
This process has, in addition, enabled us to develop a clear view  
of the intrinsic value of each business and of the Group overall. 
We believe we can create value for shareholders by addressing 
our underperforming businesses, either through operational 
improvements or by changes in our portfolio of businesses  
which may result in some disposals. 
We also need to inculcate a culture of value creation and a focus  
on economic returns. Our operational improvement plans are 
designed to reflect this.

Operational improvements
The second part of our plan tackles the need to be a low cost 
producer if we are to compete effectively and deliver profitability 
for 	 shar eholders. 	 Our 	 infrastructur e 	 has 	 expanded 	 faster 	 than 	 our	
rate of business growth. Without jeopardising our capabilities 
or potential for future growth, we must now prune out non-
value-adding overheads and reduce our cost structure to a more 
proportionate size. To this end, we have embarked on a strategic 
cost management programme comprising a number of elements.
We will continue to transfer more of our production offshore  
to low cost areas. In pursuit of this strategic aim, the restructuring  
in Germany and the UK, which we started in 2009, was completed 
in 	 2010, 	 delivering 	 cost 	 savings 	 in 	 the 	 year 	 of 	 appr oximately	 
£ 9 . 5 	 m i l l i o n . 	 W e 	 e x p e c t 	 t o 	 s e e 	 f u r t h e r 	 o n g o i n g 	 s a v i n g s .	
We can make further progress in this direction and are targeting to 
achieve an increase in our workforce located in low cost countries. 
There will be costs in 2011 to achieve this with the full benefits 
flowing in 2012. Typically the payback period for offshoring is on 
average around one year. 
W e 	 w i l l 	 e x a m i n e 	 o p t i o n s 	 t o 	 r a t i o n a l i s e 	 o u r 	 s p a c e 	 r e q u i r e m e n t s 	 i n 	 t h e	
UK and we will reorganise the way we run our business to achieve 
both synergies and economies of scale. 
We are reducing our senior manager numbers by bringing  
together senior management teams, eliminating duplication and 
reducing the number of central function heads. This should lead  
to additional savings. 
At the same time we want to develop a performance culture with 
a focus on economic returns. To do this we are creating greater 
responsibility and accountability for performance throughout the 
company. This will be supported by the introduction of a revised 
incentive plan for management based on value creation. 
A more focused supplier management programme will contribute 
to improved competitiveness of cost inputs. This programme seeks 
annual savings of about £3 million to £5 million from 2012.
Revenue growth
The third part of our plan addresses our ability to generate  
revenue growth.
Current market trends are providing an environment offering 
the potential for us to grow. Chief amongst these are increasing 
demand for global sourcing; for value-added services and an 
innovative approach to methodologies and new processes; and 
for the increasing use of technology, especially cloud technology 
(see page 14). Companies are looking to outsourcing as a means 
of managing risk, reducing costs and complying with increasingly 
rigorous regulatory demands. For outsourcers, industry-specific 
e x p e r t i s e 	 a n d 	 c a p a b i l i t i e s 	 a n d 	 t e c h n o l o g y 	 a r e 	 p r o v i n g 	 t o 	 b e	
competitive differentiators.
To achieve profitable revenue growth, we have refocused our market 
strategy. Whilst establishing new Enterprise Partnerships offers the 
opportunity to gain step changes in levels of revenue generation,  
it is just one way to achieve growth. In recent years our new revenue 
has come primarily from straightforward outsourcing contracts, 
business support services and product sales. We will continue 
to pursue this approach and will also actively pursue partnering 
opportunities with other service providers.
Expanding 	 our 	 business 	 with 	 existing 	 customers, 	 either 	 with 	 additional	
s e r v i c e s 	 o r 	 b y 	 e x t e n d i n g 	 i n t o 	 o t h e r 	 g e o g r a p h i e s , 	 i s 	 a 	 s t r o n g 	 g r o w t h	
strategy. So we will continue to focus on our top 50 customers. There 
is 	 also 	 good 	 scope 	 to 	 expand 	 r elatively 	 small 	 existing 	 contracts 	 with	
the very large companies in our top 300 customer list. 
As part of our introduction of a greater focus on economic returns, 
we plan to improve the effectiveness of our sales force through 
greater accountability and closer links to targets. 
Cash flow and funding structure
The fourth part of our plan is to improve our cash flow and to 
ensure our funding arrangements are both adequate and efficient. 
We have now placed a keen focus on cash flow in all our businesses 
and need to improve conversion of operating profit into operating 
cash 	 flow . 	 Capital 	 expenditur e 	 will 	 now 	 have 	 clear 	 limitations 	 and 	
we are seeking improvements in our working capital management.
We have started to discuss ways of reconfiguring our funding 
arrangements. In particular we are looking at cash in the Enterprise 
Partnerships and the financial structure of Cambridge to see how 
we 	 can 	 intr oduce 	 mor e 	 flexibility 	 to 	 the 	 finances 	 of 	 these 	 businesses. 	
Such 	 flexibility 	 in 	 our 	 inter nal 	 funding 	 flows 	 will 	 facilitate 	 both 	 our 	
immediate restructuring plans and our future growth. 
Our current structure does not fully utilise the debt capacity of  
the 	 Gr oup 	 and, 	 even 	 at 	 the 	 lower 	 levels 	 of 	 pr ofitability 	 expected 	 for 	
2011, the Group EBITDA should comfortably support debt service  
at a higher level. 
Our bank facility is scheduled for renewal in October 2012. We are 
initiating renewal negotiations early to ensure we have the funding 
in place to support our plans and to provide comfort to shareholders. 
This process should be complete by the time of our half-year results.
Outlook
There is no doubt that 2011 is going to be a challenging year. An 
action plan to capture the good parts of our business and to address 
the poorly performing areas is underway. 
We believe our base revenue is secure. Our basic business is sound 
and 	 we 	 have 	 a 	 str ong 	 customer 	 base. 	 Our 	 experience 	 and 	 expertise,	
technology and global presence position us well to take advantage 
of the market trend towards greater outsourcing.
It will be a year of transition as we address and resolve some clearly 
defined problems. Based on the outcome of a detailed evaluation, 
we have a four-part plan to generate profitable revenue growth, 
to embed a focus on value creation, reduce cost and potentially 
reshape our business. Implementation of the plan has begun and

Insurance services
Developing our services
We continued to enhance the Insurers’ Market Repository (IMR) 
by adding innovative capabilities, such as the upgraded electronic 
claims file (ECF2) and e-Accounts. ECF2 provides faster access to 
easily searchable electronic files and better workflow management. 
e-Accounts enhances the electronic submission of accounting 
entries to us by brokers and insurers. Benefits to brokers and insurers 
include earlier settlement of cash items, increasing the flow of 
business to the London insurance market.

Group performance
Revenue growth
Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2010 was £780.6 million, 
an increase of 4.0% over the previous year (FY 2009: £750.4 million).
Organic revenue was £737.9 million, a decline of 1.5% on 2009 
revenues. The organic revenue decline excludes the impact of 
foreign exchange rate movements and acquisitions, therefore 
showing a like-for-like revenue movement. 
In 2010, organic revenues exclude revenues of £42.7 million from 
acquisitions made in the year including Data Integration and Kedrios 
and the FondsServiceBank (FSB) and SEB transactions. In addition, 
organic growth excludes adverse currency movements of 0.2%. 
The organic decline was driven primarily by lower procurement 
revenues, lower revenues in the US and Australian workers’ 
compensation businesses, reduced demand in the ITO businesses 
and lower securities processing volumes in Continental Europe. 
These are partly offset by strong hosting technology services 
revenues and additional revenues in the UK insurance businesses. 
Revenue visibility
Xchanging uses a revenue visibility measure that represents 
revenue we can reasonably expect to arise in the year from current 
customers with whom we have a contractual relationship. In light 
of the economic climate and our performance in 2010, we have 
undertaken a thorough review of our revenue visibility.
Our visible revenue going into 2010 was £684.0 million. Going  
into 2011, our revenue visibility is £648.0 million. The Group’s order 
book totals £1.6 billion. This represents the remaining contracted 
value of all existing customer relationships.
Whilst the Group has high visibility of revenue, these are to  
an extent volume dependent, with a number of our businesses 
generating revenue on a transactional or partially transactional basis. 
In most cases, volumes are highly predictable and certain as is  
the case in our insurance claims and premium processing businesses 
and funds administration business. Additionally, the services  
to which these volumes relate are subject to exclusive contracts.  
In considering revenue visibility, fixed and highly predictable  
volume-based revenue is treated as fixed revenue and constitutes 
84% of our visible revenue. 
In other cases, volumes are more sensitive to market conditions and 
competition. These are generally in our business support businesses 
such as global mobility services and recruitment. In these cases, 
when considering revenue visibility, highly volume-dependent 
revenue is determined based on a conservative view of the 
businesses performance, capability, and competitive position.  
This revenue is treated as volume dependant and constitutes  
16% of our visible revenue.
Operating profit 
Underlying operating profit (EBIT) increased 5.3% to £67.3 million 
(FY 2009: £63.9 million). On a like-for-like basis, underlying 
operating profit decreased 10.8%, excluding profit earned from 
acquisitions of Data Integration (£1.7 million), SEB (£5.0 million),  
FSB (£3.6 million), and the Kedrios Enterprise Partnership (loss of 
£0.9 million) and beneficial foreign exchange rate movements of 
1.3%. The beneficial foreign exchange movements are driven by 
favourable movements in the Indian Rupee and Australian Dollar, 
offsetting negative movements in the Euro.
Statutory operating profit decreased to a loss of £55.6 million  
(FY 2009: profit £23.7 million (as restated following amendments

Xchanging Investment Services GmbH (XISG), Data Integration (DI) 
and Kedrios (FY 2009: £1.0 million in respect of FSB). 
Xchanging’s share of underlying operating profit for the year 
increased by 2.8% to £37.3 million (FY 2009: £36.3 million).  
This represents a margin after excluding non-controlling interests  
of 4.8% (FY 2009: 4.8%). 
Quality of profit
It is in the nature of our business that there are one-off items 
included each year in reported underlying operating profit. In this 
respect, our reported underlying operating profit for 2010 included 
£6.9 million relating to contract settlements arising in the second 
half of the year (FY 2009: £3.2 million).
In addition, as previously indicated, our reported underlying 
operating profit includes consulting income from the Compagnie 
Pour Assistance Technique et Investissements S.A. (CATISA) 
arrangement of £4.9 million (FY 2009: £4.8 million).
Adjusted operating profit
In order to improve the understanding of our accounts, going 
forward, the Group will move from reporting underlying operating 
profit to adjusted operating profit. Adjusted operating profit will 
adjust the statutory operating profit for both favourable and 
unfavourable one-off items which are received in the normal course 
of our business and add back costs of acquisition and amortisation 
of intangibles previously amortised by an acquired entity. 26 
Xchanging  
Annual report and accounts 2010
The table below details the adjustments that have been made  
by Xchanging historically to determine underlying operating profit. 
The table further reconciles underlying operating profit to the 
adjusted number disclosing material transactions in the year which 
have had an impact on the Group’s results. 
During 2010, there were two contract settlements which arose as a 
result of the renegotiation of the contract terms and reconfiguration 
of the contracts following the acquisition of one customer by 
another. This amounted to £6.9 million. Similarly, in 2009 two 
contract settlements arose as a result of a service exit and contract 
renegotiation (£3.2 million).
In addition, in 2009 and 2010 the Group benefited from consulting 
income from the CATISA contract which will not recur in 2011.  
This was described in the 2009 Annual report and accounts.
Margins
Underlying EBIT margins for the Group increased by 11 basis points 
(bps) to 8.6% in 2010 (FY 2009: 8.5%). Adjusted operating profit 
margins (excluding one-off items, as noted above) decreased 
by 35 bps to 7.1% (FY 2009: 7.4%), driven by a decrease in 
adjusted operating profit margins in Continental Europe (due to 
financial services margin decline) and Asia Pacific (due to workers’ 
compensation and technology businesses margin decline), offset 
by an increase in margin in the UK region which showed a strong 
performance (technology and insurance services margins). In 
addition, a reduction in corporate costs, comprising unallocated 
central charges, also helped improve Group margins. Refer to the 
regional segmental and business sector analyses for further details.
Earnings per share
When considering earnings per share, the Group uses Xchanging’s 
share of underlying and adjusted profit for the year, to represent the 
performance of the business. 
Underlying basic earnings per share has grown by 1.3% to 15.60 
pence (2009: 15.40 pence). The improvement in earnings per share 
is driven by growth of 2.8% in Xchanging’s share of underlying profit 
after tax for the year. At a basic EPS level, this growth has been diluted 
by an increase in the average number of shares in issue by 1.5% to 
239.0 million shares (2009: 235.4 million). The increase in average 
number of shares in issue is due to the exercise of options resulting in 
the issue of 2.4 million shares (1.8 million on weighted average basis). 
Adjusted basic earnings per share has declined by 6.9% to 11.99 
pence (2009: 12.88 pence). The decline in adjusted earnings per 
share reflects a 5.6% decline in Xchanging’s share of adjusted profit 
after tax for the year. 
Exceptional items
The Group posted total exceptional items of £112.5 million during 
the year (FY 2009: £29.2 million). In 2010, these related to:

Impairments
Following a review of goodwill and other intangible and asset 
balances, impairment charges totalling £110.0 million have been 
recorded. These relate to:
• 	 	 I m p a i r m e n t 	 o f 	 A m e r i c a s 	 g o o d w i l l 	 t o t a l l i n g 	 £ 5 0 . 4 	 m i l l i o n , 	 r e l a t i n g	
to the Cambridge US business acquired in 2009, reflecting the 
underperformance of the US workers’ compensation business 
against the original business case expectations. £3.5 million of 
goodwill remains in relation to the Cambridge US Business Process 
Outsourcing (BPO) business.
•	 	 Impairment 	 of 	 Asia 	 Pacific 	 goodwill 	 totalling 	 £39.6 	 million, 	 r elating 	
to the Cambridge Australia business acquired in 2009, reflecting 
the decline in revenues from the Australian workers’ compensation 
business during 2010, and uncertainty over future revenues. 
Revenues from this contract are reliant upon a number of factors 
outside of the managing agents’ control including actuarial 
assessments of the performance of the State-wide injured workers’ 
fund schemes. £5.3 million of goodwill remains in relation to the 
Australia BPO businesses.

Acquisition revenues and operating profit relate to Data Integration, SEB, FSB and Kedrios. As FSB customer accounts have been fully integrated and subsumed onto the FDB 
platform, it is not possible to fully and separately identify costs directly relating to FSB for 2010. Therefore, an estimate of the profit impact from FSB has been made for the 
purposes of identifying the underlying growth rate for adjusted operating profit.  28 
Xchanging  
Annual report and accounts 2010
On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange 
and acquisitions, Group revenues declined by 1.5%, and adjusted 
operating profit declined by 19.2%.
Favourable movements in the Australian Dollar, Indian Rupee and  
US Dollar exchange rates were offset by unfavourable movements  
in the Euro. 
Excluding the impact of the contract settlements noted in the 
“Adjusted operating profit” section (page 25), 2010 external 
revenue for the Group was £768.8 million, a 3.6% decline from 
2009 (FY 2009: £742.5 million).
Segmental performance
In the full year 2009 financial accounts, the Americas region 
included our IT outsourcing and insurance software businesses. 
These businesses consist of a number of entities in various locations, 
primarily the USA, India and the Far East. During 2010, these 
businesses were managed and reported within the respective 
geographic regions, resulting in the businesses based in India and 
the Far East moving from the Americas region to the Asia Pacific 
region reporting segment.
In addition, the Global Procurement segment, which previously 
included all of our procurement businesses, was regionalised. 
As a result, Global Procurement no longer exists as an operating 
segment, with the respective businesses being managed and 
reported within the UK, Continental Europe, Asia Pacific and 
Americas regions. 
Segmental performance, based on the 2010 reporting structure,  
is discussed below. 
UK
External revenue for the UK region increased by 2.0% to  
£414.7 million, including the £9.0 million of revenue associated with 
the acquisition of Data Integration in 2010. On a like-for-like basis, 
excluding acquisitions, the UK region revenue decreased by 0.2%. 
Revenues grew strongly within the Technology business, driven 
by services provided to the London Metal Exchange, and within 
the Insurance businesses from development revenues associated 
with electronic claims processing initiatives within the London 
insurance market. Together these accounted for £14.4 million of 
growth. These are fully offset by a sharp decline in UK Procurement 
revenues due to lower volumes resulting from government spending 
cuts affecting our key customers, and a decline in HR services 
revenues following terminated contracts in 2009 and 2010. These 
terminated contracts related to recruitment and pensions services, 
and accounted for £15.4 million of revenue decline. Procurement 
and HR revenue decline was partially mitigated by expanding our 
relationship with BAE Systems. 
Adjusted operating profit increased by 14.0% to £53.9 million 
(FY 2009: £47.3 million), representing an adjusted operating 
profit margin of 12.8% (FY 2009: 11.4%). On a like-for-like basis, 
excluding £1.7 million of profit from Data Integration, adjusted 
operating profit increased by 10.4%. 
Profit growth is driven by revenue increases in the higher margin 
Technology and Insurance businesses combined with productivity 
improvements from the lean processor restructuring programme 
commenced in 2009. Overall £10.1 million of adjusted profit growth 
came from the UK Technology and Insurance businesses. These are 
offset by a £3.9 million decline in adjusted operating profit from 
lower revenues in the Procurement business and a £1.3 million 
decline in adjusted operating profit from HR businesses.

Annual report and accounts 2010
Americas
External revenue for the Americas region decreased by 3.7% to 
£125.5 million (FY 2009: £130.3 million), including a favourable 
foreign exchange impact of £1.4 million. On a like-for-like basis 
revenues declined by 4.8%. 
The decrease was driven by the workers’ compensation business, 
which has been adversely affected by volume declines and the  
full-year impact of customers lost during 2009. This was partially 
offset by increased case management vendor revenues resulting  
in an overall revenue decline of £3.9 million on a like-for-like basis. 
In addition, revenues from the IT outsourcing business declined  
due to lower levels of renewal and new sales. 
Adjusted operating profit increased to £2.1 million (FY 2009:  
£0.8 million), including £0.1 million benefit from foreign exchange, 
representing an increase in adjusted operating profit margins to 
1.7% (FY 2009: 0.6%). The profit impact of lower revenues in the 
workers’ compensation business was partially offset by productivity 
savings from the 2009 Cambridge integration programme. In 
addition, profit benefited from releases of onerous contract 
provisions (totalling approximately £1.0 million) following sublease 
and termination agreements established during 2010. Furthermore, 
in 2010 the workers’ compensation business received sales tax  
and other credits relating to prior years, totalling approximately  
£0.8 million. Profit from the Technology businesses in the Americas 
region declined by £1.6 million, primarily due to licence sales in 
2009 which were not renewed in 2010. 
The Americas revenue and underlying operating profit for the year 
also included £4.9 million of revenue from the contract for services 
with Compagnie Pour Assistance Technique et Investissements S.A 
(CATISA), which we have excluded in deriving adjusted operating 
profit (FY 2009: £4.8 million). 
Continental Europe
External revenue for the Continental Europe region increased  
by 15.9% to £194.6 million (FY 2009: £167.9 million), including 
unfavourable foreign exchange movements of £8.4 million and 
revenue from acquisitions in the year of £33.7 million. Acquisition 
revenues included Kedrios and the FSB and SEB transactions.  
On a like-for-like basis revenue for Continental Europe grew 
marginally by £1.4 million (0.8%). 
This increase includes £3.6 million of revenue from contract 
settlements within Xchanging Transaction Bank (XTB). Underlying 
revenues in Continental Europe therefore declined, primarily due to 
lower securities processing volumes within XTB and lower revenues 
from the German withholding tax services (Abgeltungssteuer), 
resulting in £6.3 million lower revenues on a like-for-like basis. These 
were partly offset by additional funds administration volumes within 
FDB where new third-party customers were added to the platform 
during 2010.
Continental Europe’s underlying operating profit for the year also 
included £6.9 million of one-time contract settlements, which have 
been excluded in deriving adjusted operating profit. 
Adjusted operating profit declined by 29.8% to £9.3 million  
(FY 2009: £13.2 million), representing an adjusted operating profit 
margin of 4.8% (FY 2009: 7.8%). This includes an unfavourable 
foreign exchange impact of £0.7 million, and an operating profit 
from acquisitions of £7.7 million.
On a like-for-like basis, therefore, Continental Europe adjusted 
operating profit declined by £10.9 million (82.7%). The decrease 
reflects significant cost pressures within the business and lower-
margin funds administration processing revenues within FDB 
replacing higher-margin securities processing and German 
withholding tax services (Abgeltungssteuer) revenues within XTB. 
In addition, operating costs increased in FDB due to additional 
discounts to the EP partner and additional costs associated with the 
transition of FSB and SEB. This offsets benefits from productivity 
improvements from the lean processor restructuring programme 
commenced in 2009. Furthermore, the Kedrios Enterprise 
Partnership reported operating losses of £0.9 million in 2010. 
Underperformance in 2010 and a challenging integration are 
expected to continue to adversely impact 2011 performance. 
Asia Pacific
External revenue for the Asia Pacific region increased by 1.2%  
to £45.8 million (FY 2009: £45.3 million). This includes favourable 
foreign exchange movements of £5.5 million due to the movement 
in the Australian Dollar and Indian Rupee exchange rates year-on-
year. Therefore, on a like-for-like basis, revenues decreased by  
£5.0 million (11.0%). 
The underlying decrease is driven by poor performance in the 
workers’ compensation businesses, which have been affected by 
lower bonus revenue amounts. These lower bonus revenues reflect 
the volatile nature of the performance bonus schemes on which 
managing agent remuneration is based. Australia BPO revenues 
declined by £3.6 million on a like-for-like basis. In addition, revenues 
from the IT outsourcing business in Asia Pacific declined by  
£1.6 million like-for-like, due to lower levels of spend on technology 
projects by key customers who operated at higher volumes in 2009. 
These impacts were partly mitigated by new advisory business won 
from Aon Australia’s Risk Solutions business and through strong 
performance in our Indian offshoring businesses.
Adjusted operating profit declined by 49.0% to £6.8 million  
(FY 2009: £13.2 million), representing an adjusted operating profit 
margin of 8.4% (FY 2009: 17.2%). Profit benefited from favourable 
foreign exchange movements by £1.6 million (2.5%), therefore 
on a like-for-like basis profit declined by £8.0 million (60.8%). This 
reflects the lower revenue levels, and a large proportion of bonus 
revenues decline in the workers’ compensation businesses dropping 
straight to the bottom line. Operating profit from the Australian 
workers’ compensation businesses declined by £5.2 million  
year-on-year on a like-for-like basis.  30 
Xchanging  
Annual report and accounts 2010
Corporate
Central costs, which include unallocated Corporate costs, declined 
by 10.8% to £16.6 million (FY 2009: £18.6 million). Central costs  
as a percentage of revenue reduced from 2.5% in 2009 to 2.1%  
in 2010. 
This decline includes a reduction in senior management costs from 
the lean processor restructuring programme, lower staff bonus 
levels as well as lower expatriate costs, partly offset by additional 
investment in business development costs during 2010. 
Analysis by sectors
Going forward, as the Group will be focusing on global business 
sectors to make better use of our expertise and resources, the 
Directors believe information by sector, as provided below, is also 
helpful to users of the financial statements in understanding the 
Group’s performance. 
The sectors represent the business lines operated by the Group, 
including profits generated from the Indian offshoring entities  
within each sector (within the segmental structure these profits  
are included solely within the Asia Pacific region).

Insurance services
External revenue for the Insurance services sector decreased by 
2.2% to £258.0 million (FY 2009: £263.8 million). This includes  
£5.1 million of foreign exchange benefit, primarily due to the 
movement of the Australian Dollar. On a like-for-like basis, revenues 
declined by 4.1% (£10.9 million). The decrease is driven by the 
US workers’ compensation businesses which have been adversely 
impacted by volume declines and the full year impact of customers 
lost during 2009 as well as lower bonus revenue amounts in 
Australia. Together the revenue decline on a like-for-like basis 
totalled £10.3 million. This has been partially offset by strong 
performance in the UK Insurance businesses which delivered higher 
revenues within the London insurance market from electronic claims 
processing initiatives and additional core claims processing. 
Adjusted operating profit increased by 12.8% to £33.0 million  
(FY 2009: £29.3 million), representing an adjusted operating profit 
margin of 12.8% (FY 2009: 11.1%), including a foreign exchange 
benefit of £1.3 million. On a like-for-like basis, adjusted operating 
profit increased by 8.4% (£2.4 million) despite the revenue  
decrease. This is driven by profit improvement in the UK Insurance 
businesses of £3.1 million from productivity savings and additional 
development and core processing revenues. In addition, despite 
the revenue decline in the US workers’ compensation business, 
profit was maintained partly through productivity savings from the 
Cambridge integration programme in 2009, and through releases  
of onerous contract provisions (totalling approximately £1.0 million)  
following sublease agreements and lease terminations agreed  
during 2010. Furthermore, in 2010 the US workers’ compensation 
business received sales tax and other credits totalling approximately 
£0.8 million. These were partly offset by operating profit from  
the Australian workers’ compensation businesses declining by  
£4.8 million year-on-year on a like-for-like basis, largely reflecting  
the impact of lower bonus revenues in 2010.
Financial services
External revenue for the Financial services sector increased by 15.9% 
to £194.8 million (FY 2009: £168.0 million), including unfavourable 
foreign exchange movements of £7.8 million and revenue from 
acquisitions in the year of £33.7 million. On a like-for-like basis 
Financial services revenues grew marginally by £0.9 million (0.5%). 
This increase has primarily been generated from additional  
funds administration volumes within FDB (representing growth  
of £31.1 million) including the FSB and SEB transactions completed 
during 2010 and new third-party customers added to the platform 
during 2010. A further £5.3 million of growth was attributable to 
the Enterprise Partnership with SIA-SSB during the second half of 
the year. This is partially offset by a decline in securities processing 
volumes in 2010 within XTB and lower revenues from the German 
withholding tax services (Abgeltungssteuer), delivering £6.3 million 
lower revenues on a like-for-like basis.
Adjusted operating profit declined by 25.5% to £11.3 million  
(FY 2009: £15.1 million), representing an adjusted operating profit 
margin of 5.8% (FY 2009: 9.0%). This includes an unfavourable 
foreign exchange impact of £0.8 million, and profit from acquisitions 
of £7.7 million. On a like-for-like basis, adjusted operating profit 
declined by £10.7 million (70.9%). 
The Financial services sector currently consists of businesses solely 
within the Continental Europe segmental region, but includes the 
associated offshore efforts within the Asia Pacific region. The drivers 
of Financial services sector performance during 2010 have been 
noted in the Continental Europe segmental commentary. 
Technology
External revenue for the Technology business increased by 24.7% to 
£116.2 million (FY 2009: £93.2 million), including foreign exchange 
benefit of £1.0 million and revenues from the Data Integration 
acquisition of £9.0 million. On a like-for-like basis, revenues 
increased by £13.0 million (13.9%). This movement reflects strong 
growth within the UK Technology business of £16.2 million, driven 
primarily by additional revenues from services provided to the 
London Metal Exchange. This growth is partly offset by a decline  
in IT outsourcing revenues within the US and Asia Pacific markets  
as a result of lower customer discretionary spend on IT projects 
during 2010 as compared to 2009.
Adjusted operating profit increased by 25.1% to £17.4 million  
(FY 2009: £13.9 million), representing an adjusted operating  
profit margin of 15.0% (FY 2009: 14.9%). This includes foreign 
exchange benefit of £0.4 million and profit from Data Integration 
of £1.7 million. On a like-for-like basis, adjusted operating profit 
increased by £1.4 million (10.0%). Profit growth in the UK 
Technology business of £3.7 million was offset by the impact of  
the revenue decline in the IT outsourcing businesses and a lower 
level of high-margin licence sales in the Insurance Software business 
in 2010, together reducing profit by £2.8 million. 
Procurement and HR
External revenue for the HR and Procurement businesses decreased 
by 6.1% to £211.6 million (FY 2009: £225.2 million), with marginal 
impact from foreign exchange rates. This movement reflects decline 
in UK Procurement revenues of £10.8 million year-on-year primarily 
due to the impact of lower labour volumes from government 
spending cuts in the UK impacting our key customers, as well 
as pricing pressures on existing business. In addition, HR services 
business revenues declined by £2.9 million following terminated 
contracts in 2009 (recruitment services) and 2010 (pension services). 
Revenue decline was partially mitigated by extending our service 
relationship with BAE Systems.
Adjusted operating profit declined by 34.4% to £11.1 million  
(FY 2009: £16.9 million), representing an adjusted operating profit 
margin of 5.2% (FY 2009: 7.5%). This decline reflects the reduced 
revenues within the sector and a resulting mix of a higher proportion 
of lower margin revenues, particularly within the Procurement and 
advisory businesses. 
Net finance cost
Net finance costs (pre exceptional items, imputed interest on 
put options and imputed interest on employee loans) decreased 
from £4.1 million in 2009 to £3.9 million in 2010. Although the 
aggregate balance of drawn debt increased during 2010, we 
benefited from a year-on-year reduction in the net finance cost 
attributable to the post-employment benefits liability to £1.3 million 
(FY 2009: £1.9 million). 
The component of the finance charge relating to external debt 
facilities and finance leases within the Cambridge entities was  
£0.6 million (FY 2009: £2.3 million). 32

Cash flow
Operating cash flow in 2010 was £31.0 million (FY 2009:  
£26.0 million).
Dividend payments to non-controlling interests were £8.5 million. 
Included in these payments was £2.0 million relating to a dividend 
declared by Ins-sure Holdings Limited (XIS) in 2009 but not paid until 
2010, due to the high level of capital investment within the business 
in 2009.
Equity free cash flow for the year was £14.7 million (FY 2009:  
£10.7 million), and £6.6 million of ordinary dividends were declared 
and paid in relation to 2009 (FY 2009: £5.5 million in relation  
to 2008).
Expenditure on acquisitions in the year was £16.5 million (FY 2009: 
£63.8 million), excluding acquired cash of £9.8 million. There were 
no disposals.
Cash generated from operations decreased by 1.8% to £61.8 million.
The poor trading performance and the impact of the onerous 
contracts and legacy lease liabilities has taken its toll on cash 
flow within Cambridge. Most of the cash outflow is funded by 
Xchanging as Cambridge has little access to external debt facilities. 
Cambridge is being funded by intra-group loans from Xchanging.  
In 2010 new loans to Cambridge from Xchanging totalled  
£12.7 million. The total amount Xchanging can extend by way of 
loans to Cambridge is capped at US$ 105 million and at the year 
end the balance was £56.0 million (US$ 86.6 million). 
Capital expenditure
Our net capital expenditure was £22.4 million (FY 2009:  
£32.6 million), representing 2.9% of revenue (FY 2009: 4.3%). 
In 2010 Xchanging invested in developing technology to support 
its network managed services offering, migration of fund 
administration processing platforms for the European financial 
markets and continued to develop its insurance application platform.

Funding, distribution policy and dividends
Funding for sustaining investment and organic growth is met initially 
from cash flow. Our equity free cash flow and available debt finance 
determine the funding available for acquisitions and distributions.
To ensure that we have sufficient cash to fund future growth,  
the Board has decided not to pay a dividend for 2010. The Board 
will keep payment of future dividends under review. 
Treasury management
All of our treasury activity takes place within a formal control 
framework, under policies approved by the Board. We monitor 
compliance with these policies and guidelines through regular 
reporting of treasury activities. 
The treasury function’s primary responsibilities are to procure  
our capital resources and manage our liquidity, foreign exchange 
and interest rate risks on a Group-wide basis.
Borrowing facilities
Our principal sources of debt finance are a £75 million multi-
currency revolving credit facility and a $58 million term loan.  
We make regular repayments against the term loan and at the  
end of 2010 the balance outstanding was $34 million (FY 2009:  
$50 million). At the year end, $45 million (FY 2009: nil) had been 
drawn under the revolving credit facility. Both facilities mature in 
October 2012. The Group also has a £10 million uncommitted 
overdraft facility. 
In addition, there are term loan and overdraft facilities provided 
to Cambridge in India. The total amount outstanding under the 
Cambridge Indian bank loan and working capital facilities at the  
year end was £5.1 million (FY 2009: £7.4 million). 
At the year end, we had £28.8 million of headroom under our 
committed debt facilities. 
We expect to be able to finance our current business plans from 
ongoing operations and our committed funding facilities.
Borrowing covenants
The Group is subject to covenants, representations and warranties 
commonly associated with corporate bank debt for its committed 
term loan and £75 million revolving credit facility.
There are three financial covenants within this facility:
• 	 	 t h e 	 r a t i o 	 o f 	 c o n s o l i d a t e d 	 b o r r o w i n g s 	 t o 	 X c h a n g i n g ’ s 	 s h a r e	 
of consolidated profit before depreciation and amortisation  
(pre exceptional items) must not exceed 2.0 times. As at  
31 December 2010, the ratio was 0.74 times
•	 	 the 	 ratio 	 of 	 Xchanging’ s 	 shar e 	 of 	 consolidated 	 pr ofit 	 befor e 	
depreciation and amortisation (pre exceptional items) to net 
consolidated finance charges must not be less than 6.0 times.  
As at 31 December 2010, the ratio was 35.4 times
•	 	 total 	 net 	 worth 	 must 	 exceed 	 £175 	 million 	 plus 	 an 	 adjustment 	 for	
retained earnings. As at 31 December 2010, the total net worth 
covenant headroom was £44.9 million.
As indicated above, we operated within these limits throughout 
2010 and expect to do so in 2011 and 2012.

Annual report and accounts 2010
Levels of borrowing and seasonality
Xchanging operates in a wide range of markets and locations and 
as a result the seasonality of our borrowing requirements is relatively 
low. Underlying cyclicality before capital expenditure is driven 
principally by the timing of our ordinary dividends, collections of 
dividends and royalties from Enterprise Partnerships and scheduled 
repayments under the term loan facilities. 
During 2010, the peak level of net debt was £7.0 million.
Cash balances
We invest surplus cash to maximise return, within liquidity and 
counterparty credit constraints that have been approved by the Board. 
The majority of our 100%-owned UK entities are included in a 
pooling arrangement, to optimise liquidity management. We review 
the efficiency of our other cash balances on a monthly basis.
Enterprise Partnerships operate on a 100% distribution policy, so 
the net equity in each partnership is maintained at a stable level. 
Additional cash payments are made to the Group on an annual 
or quarterly basis, as contractual performance or licence fees. 
Approximately £14.8 million of the cash balance in Enterprise 
Partnerships at the year end represented accrued but unpaid licence 
fees due to Xchanging and a further £11.0 million is expected to be 
repatriated to Xchanging as dividends in 2011. The remaining cash 
balance in the Enterprise Partnerships represents dividends due to 
non-controlling interests and working capital.
Foreign currency translation exposure
We do not hedge foreign currency profit and loss translation 
exposures and our reported results may therefore be affected  
by currency fluctuations.
Foreign currency transaction exposures
We are subject to foreign exchange transaction exposure in our 
Indian operations, where revenues are generated in Sterling, US 
Dollars and Euros and the cost base is primarily in Indian Rupees. The 
principal transaction exposures arising during 2010 included Sterling 
revenue of £22.3 million and US Dollar revenue of $22.7 million. 
Under our foreign exchange risk management policy, exposures 
may be hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts when the 
underlying cash flows are deemed certain. Typically, we will look to 
hedge revenue to protect operating cash flow and to support the 
planning cycle. No foreign exchange derivatives were outstanding  
at the year end but subsequently £3.6 million of Sterling revenue 
and $2.8 million of US Dollar revenue have been hedged against  
the Indian Rupee. 
Interest rate risk management
We review our interest rate exposure against acceptable risk profiles 
on a periodic basis. At the year end, all of our drawn debt was 
subject to floating rate interest.
Pensions
The Group has three funded Defined Benefit Schemes in the UK, all 
of which are closed to new members. The Group works closely with 
the Trustees of the schemes to manage risk in the schemes, and in 
2009 completed investment strategy reviews on all three, resulting 
in improved diversification of the underlying assets. All currency 
exposure in the assets is hedged. 
The cash contribution to the UK plans includes £1.4 million per year 
in respect of a recovery plan agreed with the Trustee on one UK Plan 
in 2008. Recovery plans are agreed on completion of the triennial 
actuarial valuations (which commenced in 2010) and therefore 
revised recovery plans for two UK schemes will be put in place 
during 2011 following discussions with Trustees. It is expected that 
contributions in respect of the UK defined benefit schemes during 
2011 will be £4.0 million (of which £1.6 million is expected to be 
funded from UK Enterprise Partnerships, and the remainder from 
wholly owned subsidiaries).

Annual report and accounts 2010
Around 70 UK employees are members of various BAE Systems 
defined benefit pension schemes; however, the contributions made 
by the Group to the BAE Systems schemes can only vary in respect 
of future service contributions and are therefore accounted for on  
a defined contribution basis. The Group has various indemnities  
in place with BAE Systems and therefore could only be exposed  
to deficits in the BAE Schemes in the event that BAE Systems  
were to become insolvent. 
In Continental Europe, the Group operates various unfunded 
defined benefit plans, the largest of which is supported by a 
Contractual Trust Arrangement (CTA). The CTA investment strategy 
adopted by the Group seeks to match asset movements to changes 
in the value of the liabilities. It is expected that contributions in 
respect of the Continental Europe defined benefit schemes during 
2011 will be £4.1 million (all of which is expected to be funded  
from Continental Europe Enterprise Partnerships). 
The Group works closely with the Trustees of all of the pension plans 
to manage the risks associated with the defined benefit pension 
provision. The factors that most affect the value of the liabilities are 
interest rate and mortality risk, and the Group’s sensitivity to these 
particular risks is shown in notes to the accounts. 
Capital structure
The Group seeks to maintain a strong credit profile to aid its ability 
to partner in business and will aim not to exceed consolidated 
borrowings of 2.0 times Xchanging’s share of consolidated profit 
before depreciation and amortisation. In order to achieve its desired 
capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends 
paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders and adjust asset 
holdings to reduce or increase debt.
As part of the normal course of business, refinancing of the  
Group’s debt facility will get underway in quarter two of 2011.  
As part of this exercise we will look at ways of optimising the 
funding structure to make full use of the Group’s cash resources  
in Enterprise Partnerships.
Regulatory capital
Xchanging operates in a number of regulatory regimes. The key 
businesses affected by regulatory requirements are XTB and FDB, 
which conduct securities processing and retail investment account 
management in Germany. They both maintain full banking licences 
and are regulated under the German Federal Financial Supervisory 
Authority (BaFin). Sufficient regulatory capital must be held in these 
entities to cover the operating and credit risks of the business. 
Regulatory capital requirement is based on market, operating and 
credit risk factors applied to asset classes. The regulatory capital 
in the business is calculated as total equity less total intangible 
assets. There is no obligation to set cash aside to meet regulatory 
capital requirements but funding may be required from the holding 
company if the required regulatory capital is less than the calculated 
regulatory capital.
During 2010, Xchanging contributed €17.5 million (£14.6 million)  
as capital to the German banking group to support regulatory 
capital adequacy requirements and to provide funding for the 
completion of the FSB acquisition.
Components of the insurance business are regulated in the United 
Kingdom by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). 
Weighted average cost of capital
The Group uses a weighted average cost of capital of 10%. 
Taxation
The Group’s underlying effective tax rate, before exceptional items, 
was 27.4% (FY 2009: 25.7%). The effective tax rate on adjusted 
operating profit is 29.8% (FY 2009: 28.0%).
The effective tax rate on Xchanging’s share of underlying operating 
profit for the year was 27.3% (FY 2009: 26.4%). The effective tax 
rate on Xchanging’s share of adjusted operating profit for the year 
was 29.4% (FY 2009: 28.6%). 
The effective tax rates for 2009 benefited from the recognition of 
tax losses in the central services entity.
Non-controlling interests
In 2010, the profit after tax attributable to non-controlling interests 
totalled £5.5 million (FY 2009: £5.6 million), despite the statutory 
loss reported. This is reflective of goodwill impairment charges not 
being allocated to non-controlling interests.
Non-controlling interest calculations for the Group’s Enterprise 
Partnerships (see page 12 for an overview of Enterprise Partnerships) 
are dependent upon the individual contractual terms. Some define 
adjustments in relation to certain items prior to calculating profit 
share based on the percentage share ownerships. These may 
include, for example, adjustments for differences between local and 
international accounting standards, adjustments for any discounts 
or fees payable between parties or adjustments for share-based 
payment charges for employees.
Major accounting judgements
Goodwill 
At 31 December 2010, the Group has goodwill balances remaining 
of £190.3 million (FY 2009: £259.6 million), following impairments 
to goodwill of £99.4 million, primarily in relation to the US and 
Australia BPO businesses acquired with Cambridge.
Goodwill carrying values are supported by future cash flow 
projections for each cash-generating unit, and therefore inherently 
involve estimations of future sales growth, operating costs and 
margin. In addition, consistent with consideration of strategic 
options, calculation of the recoverable amounts in relation to the 
US and Australia BPO goodwill impairment reviews include fair-
value less cost-to-sell assumptions with regard to underperforming 
elements of the businesses. The Directors have reviewed and 
approved the estimations supporting the carrying value of all 
goodwill remaining at 31 December 2010. 
However, it should be noted that calculation of recoverable  
amounts used to support certain goodwill balances are sensitive  
to material assumptions which may impact the future carrying  
values of goodwill. These assumptions include the timing of exits  
of underperforming businesses (potentially impacting £8.7 million  
of goodwill remaining). In addition, future contract renewals with 
longstanding key customers are a material assumption in relation  
to goodwill values, particularly in the Procurement and HR businesses.  36

Annual report and accounts 2010
Provisions
The Group holds provisions for future obligations where it is 
probable that there will be an outflow of economic benefit. 
Provisions by their nature may involve estimations of the expected 
outflows. The primary provisions held relate to onerous leases and 
contracts, restructuring, litigation and employee-related provisions.
The table above shows total provision movements in 2010.
The material provisions created during the year relate primarily to an 
onerous contract in our workers’ compensation business in Australia 
totalling £2.6 million and onerous leases (largely due to contract losses 
in the US workers’ compensation business) totalling £1.2 million.  
In addition, litigation provisions were created in the normal course  
of business totalling £0.8 million, primarily in the US. 
The material releases during the year relate to onerous lease 
provisions largely in the US where sublease agreements and lease 
terminations have been secured on previously vacant properties 
totalling £1.2 million. The remaining £2.0 million of releases consist 
of a number of specific operational and employee-related provisions 
where the potential liabilities are assessed as unlikely to crystallise. 
The utilisation of provisions during 2010 increased significantly  
on 2009, as they relate primarily to amounts paid against the lean 
processor restructuring provision created in 2009 (£12.5 million), 
settlement of litigation cases – in particular one specific US case  
in early 2010 (£4.2 million in total) – and the cash outflows against 
onerous lease liabilities mainly acquired with the Cambridge business 
(totalling £5.1 million). 
The remaining provision balances are considered sufficient to cover 
known and likely exposures and primarily consist of £12.0 million 
for onerous leases and contracts (including a £2.6 million onerous 
contract provision), £7.0 million for restructuring, £3.7 million for 
litigation and £8.4 million for employee-related and other provisions.
Capitalised costs and intangible assets
Intangible assets total £67.6 million at 31 December 2010 (FY 2009: 
£75.3 million). Intangible assets comprise development costs  
(£5.2 million), software costs (£40.5 million), customer relationships 
(£20.8 million) and assets in the course of development (£1.2 million).
Software costs include material technology assets developed  
and other software underpinning our processing operations. These 
include the Xchanging Insurance Application Platform (XIAP),  
a global insurance application platform developed during 2009 
and 2010, the Insurance Market Repository used for data storage 
within the London insurance market, and securities and fund 
administration processing platforms in our Financial Services 
businesses in Continental Europe. These are described in further 
detail in note 14 of the accounts.
Customer relationships primarily relate to business combinations, 
including FSB open architecture customers, Data Integration network 
managed services customers, funds administration customers and 
claims processing customers.
During 2010, additions to intangible assets totalled £15.2 million  
(FY 2009: £18.7 million), of which £8.9 million related to internal 
costs capitalised (FY 2009: £8.5 million). These primarily relate to  
the XIAP development during 2010 and FSB platform migration 
costs following the transition of the FSB business onto the FDB 
processing platform. 
Deferred income
At 31 December 2010, deferred income totalled £36.4 million  
(FY 2009: £43.3 million). Deferred revenue balances largely relate 
to workers’ compensation claims business (£20.6 million) primarily 
in the US where income is released in line with estimates of the 
cost to service claims over their life cycle based on actuarial tables. 
Deferred revenue of £12.1 million is held in relation to one material 
contract lost towards the end of 2010, with £2.4 million of revenue 
recognised in 2010 at a margin of 6.7%. In addition, software 
maintenance and licence fees received in advance are deferred  
and the income recognised in the period to which they relate  
(£5.6 million). Further deferred income details are provided  
in note 20 of the accounts.
During 2010, £25.8 million of revenue was recognised in the year, 
and £15.1 million deferred at the end of the year. This reflects the 
decline in the workers’ compensation business and lower revenue 
levels of revenue deferred in relation to insurance software  
product sales.

Delivering our business responsibly
Our approach to engaging with and developing our people  
is set out on page 13. The way we manage our environmental, 
community and marketplace responsibilities is set out below.
Environment
Our environment policy aims to integrate sound environmental 
practices into all of our operations, so that we have as little  
impact on the environment as possible. 
Xchanging’s most significant environmental impacts are:
• 	 a t m o s p h e r i c 	 e m i s s i o n s 	 a s 	 a 	 r e s u l t 	 o f 	 o u r 	 e l e c t r i c i t y 	 u s e

•	 the 	 envir onmental 	 impact 	 of 	 our 	 suppliers.
Our carbon footprint
We have published our carbon footprint each year since 2008.  
In 2010, our footprint increased by 96% to 29,521 tonnes of CO
2e, 
due to greater volumes of business travel and the inclusion of new 
locations, following the acquisition of Cambridge Solutions.

2009 Carbon Footprint excludes the employees we gained as a result of the 
acquisition of Cambridge Solutions.
Calculated using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard. Includes actual and estimated data for all offices operated by Xchanging. 
Excludes sites where employees are working on customer sites. Based on Scope one, 
two and three.
Scope 1 – Direct emissions resulting from activities within the 
organisation’s control. Includes on-site fuel combustion, refrigerant 
losses and company vehicles. 
Scope 2 – Indirect emissions from electricity purchased and used  
by the organisation. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is 
fundamental to the way we plan and run our 
business, and is closely aligned with our values. 
We divide CSR into four categories: people, 
environment, communities and marketplace.
Scope 3 – Indirect emissions other, including employee business 
travel, outsourced transportation, waste disposal, water usage  
and employee commuting. 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)
For the first time, Xchanging features in CDP’s Carbon Disclosure 
Leadership Index. This index is a key component of CDP’s annual 
FTSE 350 Report and highlights the companies which have displayed 
the most professional approach to corporate governance, in respect 
of climate change disclosure practices.
Xchanging Global Environment Week
This was the second year that Xchanging took part in a Global 
Environment Week, which coincided with the UN World 
Environment Day. It was an opportunity for the CSR teams across 
the Group to share our environmental successes and future plans.
Communities
We support the communities in which we operate, with an 
approach aligned to our values of being farsighted in relationships 
and releasing the entrepreneurial spirit of our people.
This means that we look to create long-term sustainable 
relationships with our communities, and focus on projects linked 
to youth and education. For example, our partnership with Vinoba 
Vidyalaya, a school in Shimoga, India, has a direct and positive 
impact on the Shimoga community.
Each of our sites supports local charities, as well as national partners, 
focused on youth and education. In the UK our relationship with 
our educational charity partner, Career Academies UK, continues 
to develop. This organisation works with schools and colleges to 
introduce students studying business, IT or finance-related A-levels 
or equivalents to the world of work. We provide Partners in 
Business, internships and ‘guru lectures’ across many of our sites. 
Our volunteering programme entitles employees to up to one day 
of paid leave per financial year, to take part in volunteering activities 
organised by the CSR Team. These activities are based around our 
commitment to youth and education, the local community and the 
environment. We believe that all of our employees have the skills 
and experience to make a real difference and that this is also an 
excellent opportunity for personal development. 38 
Xchanging  
Annual report and accounts 2010
Marketplace
We aim to achieve long-term sustainable relationships with all 
of our customers and suppliers. Our values and Ethical Code of 
Business Conduct support what we expect of our people and their 
interactions with our customers and suppliers. We aim to be honest, 
transparent and ethical in all our interactions.
Customers
We deliver our services to customers in 43 countries. Understanding 
our customers is critical to provide excellent service. Our aim is to 
transform our customers’ services, adding value to their operations 
and meeting the needs of their customers. Our Service professionals 
manage our relationships with our customers and we invest a 
considerable amount of time obtaining feedback on our service 
delivery. We track this feedback in a consistent and measured way. 
Many of our customers have sustainability agendas. They are keen to 
reduce their environmental impact and to ensure that their business 
operates in a sustainable and ethical manner. Xchanging has a part 
to play here. For example, cloud computing will increasingly provide 
opportunities to reduce wasted capacity and lower the energy 
consumed by powering and cooling each server.
Suppliers
We are committed to working with suppliers who respect our  
ethical and environmental standards. As a result, we rolled out  
an ethical supply programme in our UK and German operations.  
We invited our suppliers to complete an online survey and sign up  
to our supply policy. The programme is based on ethical principles, 
such as environmental protection, anti-corruption standards, and 
labour and human rights. 
Managing our responsibilities
Our CSR Committee is responsible for setting the strategy for 
our CSR programme and overseeing its performance. Further 
information on the CSR committee can be found on page 50.
In addition, each region has a CSR co-ordinator and each major 
location has a CSR champion. They are responsible for implementing 
our CSR programme and together they form our Group-wide  
CSR network.
FTSE4Good 
We are pleased that Xchanging remains part of the FTSE4Good 
Index Series for the third consecutive year. FTSE4Good has been 
designed to measure the performance of companies that meet 
globally recognised corporate responsibility standards. 
Social, ethical and environmental (SEE) risks
SEE risks are not priority risks for Xchanging but we consider them 
important in providing us with a balanced risk portfolio. The CSR 
Committee reviews our SEE risk register, to ensure we have the right 
plans in place to mitigate these risks.
Performance reporting
We monitor our CSR performance through our quality performance 
reports. The Xchanging Performance Committee reviews these 
reports regularly.
Corporate Social Responsibility continued 39 
Xchanging  
Annual report and accounts 2010
Principal risks and uncertainties
Xchanging maintains risk registers covering each 
significant operation, region and the Group. 
We review our whole risk hierarchy twice a year , 
which helps to ensure we have a consistent 
approach and focus on the right risks. The Board 
approves the Group risk register annually .
We analyse the nature and extent of risks and consider their 
likelihood and impact, both on an inherent and a residual basis,  
after taking into account mitigating controls. This allows us to 
determine how we should manage each risk in order to achieve  
our strategic objectives. 
A year of significant change has heightened certain key risks  
and uncertainties. During 2010 we experienced market conditions 
where it became extremely difficult to grow revenues and customers 
put us under increasing margin pressure. In addition the business 
performance issues within Kedrios and parts of our Cambridge 
acquisitions have required us to take decisive action in order to 
restore the value of the Group and to reduce the cash outflows 
being experienced.
The immediate challenges faced by the Group will be addressed  
by a Board-approved four-part plan, in particular: 
• 	 	 p e r f o r m i n g 	 a 	 s t r a t e g i c 	 a n d 	 i n t r i n s i c 	 v a l u e 	 r e v i e w 	 a n d 	 a d d r e s s i n g	
our underperforming businesses
•	 	 generating 	 operational 	 impr ovements 	 by 	 r educing 	 our	
infrastructure and central costs to match the size and scale  
of the business
•	 	 r e-focusing 	 our 	 market 	 strategy 	 to 	 gr ow 	 r evenue
•	 	 impr oving 	 our 	 cash 	 flow 	 and 	 ensuring 	 our 	 funding 	 arrangements 	
are adequate and efficient. 
The plan can only be achieved whilst having the continued 
confidence of our shareholders, customers and our people, and  
we are completely focused on delivering the steps necessary  
to achieve this.
How we manage risk
We divide our risks into strategic, commercial, operational and 
financial categories: 
•	 	 Strategic 	 risks 	 r eflect 	 the 	 potential 	 for 	 a 	 significant 	 strategic 	 action 	
to have a financial impact on the economic value of our business.
• 	 	 C o m m e r c i a l 	 r i s k s 	 a n d 	 c o n t r a c t i n g 	 r i s k s 	 r e fl e c t 	 t h e 	 p o t e n t i a l 	 t o 	 e n t e r

an adverse impact on the economic value of our business.
• 	 	 O p e r a t i o n a l 	 r i s k s 	 r e fl e c t 	 t h e 	 p o t e n t i a l 	 f o r 	 t h e 	 f a i l u r e 	 o f 	 a 	 c r i t i c a l

value of our business.

tax, pension valuations and liquidity. Failure to manage these risks 
could negatively impact the economic value of our business.  40

Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Strategic risks 
Key risk 
Successful and timely execution of the  
four-part plan is fundamental to achieving 
our long-term profitability and cash 
generation goals.
We must be able to anticipate and manage 
changes in the economic environment, 
including an inflating cost base in India. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commercial risks 
Key risk 
We may be exposed to complex and 
technical contractual terms with key 
customers. Breaching contracts could  
lead to customer relationship issues  
and potential financial penalties. 
In certain cases, partners have rights to 
‘put’ their shares to us, creating a cash 
requirement, or to ‘call’ our shares for  
little consideration.  
 
Operational risks 
Key risk 
Our reputation and ultimately our 
profitability are reliant on:
• 	 	 s u c c e s s f u l l y 	 i m p l e m e n t i n g 	 l a r g e - s c a l e	
partnerships and outsourcing contracts
• 	 	 i n t e g r a t i n g 	 n e w 	 b u s i n e s s e s 	 a n d 	 d i v e s t i n g

businesses to drive profitable and  
cash-generative growth and ultimately 
economic value. 
Commentary and mitigating plan
The four-part plan is fully explained in the CEO’s statement. 
•	 	 Execution 	 risk 	 will 	 be 	 addr essed 	 thr ough 	 str ong 	 central 	 oversight. 
Although there are some signs that the economic recession is

manage margin.

Commentary and mitigating plan
We have successfully completed the realignment of new operations 
in 2010, such as the new investment accounts in Germany. 
Following the issues faced by the Group due to the acquisitions  
of Cambridge and Kedrios, the Group is developing new investment 
criteria. No further acquisitions will be completed until these criteria 
have been approved by the Board.

of service to help them achieve their 
objectives and protect our reputation.

The Directors present their report and the audited financial 
statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2010.

industry-specific processing services to the banking and insurance 
industries as well as technology, human resources and procurement 
services across industries. The Company acts as the holding

review of the Group’s business and a description of the principal  
risks and uncertainties facing the Group. The information which 
fulfils these requirements is provided in the sections of the Annual

and uncertainties facing the Group, trends and economic factors 
impacting the business and likely future developments.

£78,817,000 (restated FY 2009: profit for the year attributable to

Independent auditors
A resolution will be proposed at the 2011 AGM to reappoint our

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
financial statements and auditors
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,  
the remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors have prepared 
t h e 	 G r o u p 	 fi n a n c i a l 	 s t a t e m e n t s 	 i n 	 a c c o r d a n c e 	 w i t h 	 I n t e r n a t i o n a l

Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of

unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them 
to ensure that the financial statements and the remuneration report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group

and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Transparency Rules

Board of Directors, on page 42, confirm that, to the best of each

taken 	 individually 	 as 	 a 	 Dir ector 	 in 	 or der 	 to 	 make 	 himself/herself	
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the liquidity position of the Group for 
the period ending 30 June 2012. The cash flows of the Group have 
been assessed against the Group’s available sources of finance on a 
monthly basis to determine the minimum and maximum expected 
levels of headroom. Based on this analysis and an assessment of 
the potential cash risks, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future.
The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held  
at 34 Leadenhall Street, London, EC3A 1AX at 10.00am on 
Wednesday 18 May 2011. The notice convening the meeting, 
together with details of the business to be considered and 
explanatory notes for each resolution, is distributed separately

Annual report and accounts 2010
During the year ending on 31 December 2010, the roles of the 
Chairman and the CEO were clearly segregated and the division  
of responsibilities between the two roles was set out in writing  
and approved by the Board. 
The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, and 
ensuring its effectiveness. The agenda is set by collaboration 
between the Chairman, the CEO and the Company Secretary.  
The 	 Chairman 	 and 	 the 	 Senior 	 Independent 	 Non-Executive	 
Director are available to shareholders, should they have concerns  
which contact through the usual channels has failed to resolve 
or is otherwise inappropriate. For further information about 
communication between the Board and shareholders, please refer  
to Communication with shareholders on page 52.
The CEO is responsible for running Xchanging’s business,  
and providing strategic leadership to the Xchanging Group,  
in consultation with the Board. On 9 February 2011, the CEO,  
David Andrews resigned from the Board. Whilst a successor is 
s o u g h t , 	 K e n 	 L e v e r 	 i s 	 u n d e r t a k i n g 	 t h e s e 	 d u t i e s 	 a s 	 t h e 	 C F O 	 a n d	 
acting CEO, and Nigel Rich is providing support to him as  
Executive Chairman. 
The Board reviewed the independence of all Non-Executive Directors 
at its meeting in December 2010, and determined that they all 
remain independent for the financial year commencing on 1 January 
2011, other than Johannes Maret and Stephen Brenninkmeijer. 
Johannes Maret has acted as a consultant to Xchanging GmbH,  
an Xchanging Group company, since June 2003, and therefore is 
not independent under the Combined Code. Nonetheless, the Board 
believe that Johannes Maret continues to contribute effectively to 
it, providing essential insight and advice on the German financial 
s e r v i c e s 	 i n d u s t r y . 	 I n 	 c o n s i d e r a t i o n 	 o f 	 h i s 	 t e n u r e , 	 t h e 	 B o a r d 	 h a s	
resolved that Johannes Maret’s role on the Board be renewed  
on an annual basis, to allow ongoing review of his position.
Stephen Brenninkmeijer has been a director of Xchanging’s  
parent company (first, Xchanging BV and then, from 27 April 2007, 
Xchanging plc) for more than ten years. Given the provisions of 
t h e 	 C o m b i n e d 	 C o d e 	 a n d 	 t h e 	 U K 	 C o r p o r a t e 	 G o v e r n a n c e 	 C o d e , 	 t h e	
Board has determined that Stephen Brenninkmeijer is no longer 
considered to be independent. 
The Board has greatly valued Stephen Brenninkmeijer’s knowledge 
and experience as well as his independence of mind. However, it has 
now determined that it is appropriate to look for a replacement in 
the future, and a search has commenced. 
Due to personal health reasons, Pat O’Driscoll was unable to attend 
a number of Board and Committee meetings in person between 
May and December 2010. During this time Stephen Brenninkmeijer 
undertook the role of Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
Pat O’Driscoll resumed her full responsibilities both as an 
Independent 	 Non-Executive 	 Dir ector 	 and 	 as 	 Chairman 	 of 	 the	
Remuneration Committee from 1 January 2011. 
Directors’ induction, training and development
The Board has a full induction programme for all new Directors, 
covering their duties and responsibilities as directors. Michel 
Paulin joined Xchanging in January 2010, and underwent a full 
Board induction programme, which included meetings with the

extensive range of briefings from key players in each of Xchanging’s 
businesses and regions. Further, during the final quarter of 2010 he 
attended meetings in the US and Continental European Xchanging 
offices, meeting the respective teams. He has also attended 
meetings with the management teams in Australia, Singapore, 
Malaysia 	 and 	 India 	 during 	 the 	 first 	 quarter 	 of 	 2011.
All Directors receive ongoing legal and regulatory updates to 
improve their knowledge and enable them to discharge their duties.

programme for the Board to visit all principal parts of the Xchanging 
Gr oup, 	 the 	 Dir ectors 	 attended 	 Boar d 	 meetings 	 in 	 the 	 US 	 and 	 the 	 UK	
during 	 2010. 	 In 	 September 	 2010 	 the 	 Boar d 	 met 	 in 	 the 	 Xchanging	
US offices in Chicago, engaging with the US regional management 
team and attending a Board workshop focusing on Xchanging’s 
strategy, and in December 2010 the Board met in the Xchanging 
offices in Leadenhall Street, London, where the Directors spent time 
w i t h 	 t h e 	 U K 	 r e g i o n 	 m a n a g e m e n t 	 t e a m .	
Formal papers are circulated to the Directors before each Board 
meeting, which enable them to make an informed decision on the 
issues 	 under 	 consideration. 	 In 	 addition 	 to 	 formal 	 Boar d 	 meetings,	
during 2010 the Chairman maintained regular contact with the CEO 
and CFO to discuss specific issues. The Company Secretary acts as an 
adviser to the Board on matters concerning governance and ensures 
Board procedures are complied with. All Directors have access to his 
advice and during 2010 this was sought from time-to-time. Directors 
may also take independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense. 	 In 	 the 	 event 	 that 	 any 	 Dir ector 	 has 	 concer ns 	 which 	 cannot	
be resolved within the Board forum about the running of the 
Company, or a proposed action, such concerns may be reflected  
in the Board minutes. Minutes of each Board meeting are circulated 
by the Company Secretary following the meeting to allow such 
comments to be raised. 
Directors’ interests
Under Xchanging’s Articles of Association, the Board may  
authorise any actual or potential conflicts of interest for Directors. 
Each Director provides the Company Secretary with information 
regarding any actual or potential interests that may conflict with 
those of Xchanging, such as other directorships, and any other 
potential interests that each thinks may cause a conflict requiring 
p r i o r 	 B o a r d 	 a u t h o r i s a t i o n 	 o n 	 a n 	 a n n u a l 	 b a s i s . 	 I f 	 t h e 	 c i r c u m s t a n c e s	 
of any of these disclosed interests change, the relevant Director  
is required to update the Company Secretary promptly.  48

relevant matter to remain authorised. The Company Secretary 
maintains a list of all authorisations granted to Directors, setting  
out the date of authorisation and its expiry, scope and any 
limitations imposed. 
Board performance evaluation
Each year the Board undertakes an evaluation process in respect  
of itself and its Committees, under the leadership of the Chairman.

Non-Executive Director, met separately on 1 February 2011 to 
evaluate the performance of Nigel Rich during 2010, who then 
joined them to evaluate the performance of David Andrews during 
2010. 	 Neither 	 David 	 Andr ews 	 nor 	 Ken 	 Lever 	 was 	 pr esent 	 at 	 this	
meeting. The performance of the Non-Executive Directors during 
2010 was reviewed by Nigel Rich, taking into account the views  
of the other Directors. 
Election and re-appointment of Directors
All Directors are subject to re-election at the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) at intervals of no more than three years. The following 
Directors will retire by rotation and seek re-election at the 2011 AGM: 
•	 Stephen 	 Br enninkmeijer
•	 Johannes 	 Mar et	
• 	 P a t 	 O ’ D r i s c o l l	
I n 	 a d d i t i o n , 	 K e n 	 L e v e r 	 w i l l 	 b e 	 p u t 	 f o r w a r d 	 f o r 	 h i s 	 i n i t i a l 	 e l e c t i o n	 
to the Board by the shareholders. The Board believes that each  
of the Directors named continues to make a valuable contribution 
to Xchanging, and supports their re-election in each case. Despite 
personal health reasons limiting Pat O’Driscoll’s contribution to the 
Board during 2010, the Chairman and the Board are confident that 
following her recovery she remains a key member of the Xchanging 
Board with a valuable contribution to make during 2011. 
The Board has asked the Nominations Committee to identify and 
recommend to the Board an appropriate candidate to be appointed 
a s 	 a n 	 I n d e p e n d e n t 	 N o n - E x e c u t i v e 	 D i r e c t o r 	 o f 	 t h e 	 C o m p a n y 	 d u r i n g	
2011. The Board intends to recruit Non-Executive Directors of a 
high calibre with broad commercial, international or other relevant 
experience. Non-Executive Directors are expected to bring an 
objectivity and independence of view to the Board’s discussions,  
and to help provide the Board with effective leadership in relation to 
the Company’s strategy, performance, risk and people management 
as well as ensuring high standards of financial probity and corporate 
governance. All Non-Executive Directors’ appointments may be 
terminated by either party upon three months’ written notice.  
The appointment of each of the Non-Executive Directors does  
not give rise to any entitlement to compensation in respect  
of their termination. 
Following their re-election at the 2010 AGM, Nigel Rich and Dennis 
Millard’s appointments with Xchanging were extended for a further 
three years, on the same terms and conditions. Pat O’Driscoll 
was 	 appointed 	 as 	 an 	 Independent 	 Non-Executive 	 Dir ector 	 of 	 the	
Company for a fixed term of three years from 3 November 2008, 
which was approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGM, and is being 
put forward for re-election at the 2011 AGM under the retirement 
by rotation provisions contained in the Articles of Association. 
Following shareholder approval at the 2010 AGM, Michel Paulin’s 
current term of appointment will expire in January 2013. Both 
Stephen Brenninkmeijer and Dennis Millard are appointed for  
12-month terms, subject to annual shareholder approval. 
Board committees
The Board has established Audit, Nominations, Remuneration 
and Corporate Social Responsibility Committees, each of which 
works from terms of reference which are reviewed annually and 
are available on the website: www.xchanging.com. The terms of 
reference for each Committee were last approved by the Board at 
its December 2010 meeting. The minutes of the Audit, Nominations 
and Remuneration Committee meetings are sent to all Directors and 
oral updates are given at Board meetings.

Internal control and risk management 
The Board is responsible for regularly reviewing the operation and 
effectiveness of the Group’ s internal controls. The internal control 
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable,  
and not absolute, assurance against material errors, losses or fraud. 
The Board is also responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems  
are in place to enable it to identify, assess and manage key risks. 
The financial reporting controls are monitored and maintained 
through the use of internal control frameworks which address key 
financial reporting risks, including risks arising from changes in the 
business or accounting standards. Effectiveness is assessed through 
self-certification and independent testing of the controls.
The Group’s key internal control and risk management procedures 
include the following:
•	 	 r eviews 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 strategy 	 and 	 the 	 performance 	 of 	 principal	
subsidiaries and EPs, through a comprehensive system of reporting 
based on variances to annual budgets, key performance indicators 
and regular forecasting

compliance with policies and procedures, legislation and the

of Quality reports to the regional managing director and attends, 
by invitation, the EP audit committees within their region.
The Group’s key risk management procedures have been in place 
throughout 2010 and up to the date of approval of this Annual 
Report, including the maintenance of a hierarchy of risk registers for 
each business and region, which are monitored on an ongoing basis 
within the relevant management teams. The Group risk register 
incorporates risks pervasive or material to the whole Group and is 
reviewed at least annually by the Board and the Audit Committee, 
with the last review occurring on 8 December 2010.
The Audit Committee has, on behalf of the Board, reviewed  
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems for 2010 
and the period prior to approval of this Annual Report. The Audit 
Committee reported its findings to the Board at the December

controls in accordance with the Turnbull guidance. 
One area of weakness regarding financial forecasting was identified 
during this review. Forecasting of profits and cash flows of the 
business units and the Group will be improved by moving to a 
quarterly 18-month rolling forecast process.
The internal control environment will continue to be monitored  
and reviewed by the Board and the Audit Committee which will, 
where necessary, ensure improvements are implemented.

Communication with shareholders
The Board places importance on communication with shareholders 
and gives them the opportunity to meet the Chairman and 
Directors as appropriate. Shareholders will continue to be given 
the opportunity to meet the Chairman and Directors in the coming 
12 months. Arrangements can be made for major shareholders to

The Company’s Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2011 will 
provide a valuable opportunity for the Board to communicate  
with private investors. We encourage shareholders to attend the 
meeting and to ask questions of any of the Directors following the 
conclusion of the formal part of the meeting. Details of proxy voting 
by shareholders, including votes withheld, will be made available  
on request and will be placed on the Company’s website following 
the meeting.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the liquidity position of the Group  
for the period ending 30 June 2012. The cash expenditure of the 
Group has been assessed against the Group’s available sources 
of finance on a monthly basis to determine the minimum and 
maximum expected levels of headroom. Based on this analysis  
and an assessment of the potential cash risks, the Directors have  
a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing its consolidated financial statements.

Foreword 
Introduction from the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee
2010 has been a year of significant change for Xchanging,  
as reported elsewhere in the Annual Report and Accounts.
The Remuneration Committee has responded to specific changes  
as well as ensuring ongoing alignment with developing governance 
requirements. Richard Houghton, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), 
stepped down from the Board in October 2010 and David Andrews 
announced he was standing down from the Board of Xchanging plc 
and from the role of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in February 2011.

current phase of the business.

Remuneration Committee Chairman during 2010 during my 
extended period of ill health. 
Pat O’Driscoll
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Pat O’Driscoll.  
Pat O’Driscoll was appointed on 22 July 2009 by the Board  
to succeed Stephen Brenninkmeijer, who remained a member 
of the Remuneration Committee. From May 2010 Stephen 
Brenninkmeijer fulfilled the role of acting Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee whilst Pat O’Driscoll recovered from 
illness. The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference can be 
found under the corporate governance section of the Xchanging 
website. The terms of reference were reviewed and revised by the 
Remuneration Committee to bring them in line with the provisions 
a n d 	 r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s 	 o f 	 t h e 	 U K 	 C o r p o r a t e 	 G o v e r n a n c e 	 C o d e	
and associated guidance. The current terms of reference became 
effective from 8 December 2010. 
The Remuneration Committee’s primary purpose is to review the 
ongoing appropriateness of the remuneration policy as it applies 
to the Executive Directors and key senior management, make 
recommendations on the framework for their remuneration and 
t o 	 d e t e r m i n e 	 t h e i r 	 s p e c i fi c 	 r e m u n e r a t i o n 	 p a c k a g e s . 	 I n 	 a d d i t i o n ,

Social and Governance (ESG) implications in making its decisions.

incentivised.
The Remuneration Committee consists of the following Non-
Executive Directors: Pat O’Driscoll, Stephen Brenninkmeijer and 
Dennis Millard. They were all deemed independent throughout 
2010. Stephen Brenninkmeijer has been deemed not to be 
independent for the year commencing 1 January 2011. The 
Company Secretary is Secretary to the Remuneration Committee. 
Only Remuneration Committee members and the Company 
Secretary (except when his own remuneration is being directly 
considered) are entitled to attend meetings of the Remuneration 
Committee. However, the Chairman of the Board, the CEO, the 
Global HR Director and others may attend by invitation of the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee met seven times in 2010. Stephen 
Brenninkmeijer and Dennis Millard were present for all meetings;  
Pat O’Driscoll was unable to attend three of those meetings due  
to her ill health.
The Remuneration Committee received advice from Towers 
Watson and Clifford Chance during 2010. Towers Watson 
provided advice on market data, market practice, governance and 
advice on long-term incentive schemes. Towers Watson has also 
provided remuneration advice more widely to the Company with 
the permission of the Remuneration Committee. Towers Watson 
has signed the Remuneration Consultants Code of Conduct and 
has made the code available to Xchanging. The Remuneration 
Committee annually reviews its consultants and after consideration 
approved the retention of Towers Watson as remuneration 
consultants for 2011. Clifford Chance provided legal advice on 
employment matters as well as providing legal advice more widely  
to the Company.

Xchanging  
Annual report and accounts 2010
Remuneration policy
Xchanging’s remuneration policy is to ensure that we attract  
and retain key talent in order to create value for shareholders. 
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that the remuneration 
philosophy will remain as follows for 2011:
•	 	 position 	 base 	 salaries 	 ar ound 	 the 	 r elevant 	 mid-market. 	 The 	 mid-
market base salary benchmark will be determined by reference  
to the local geographic market for the role and its scope
• 	 	 r e w a r d 	 i n d i v i d u a l s 	 f o r 	 b u s i n e s s 	 s u c c e s s 	 w i t h 	 a 	 s i g n i fi c a n t	
proportion of the reward opportunity for our senior employees 
linked to delivered performance in the form of variable 
compensation
 –  annual bonuses will reward individuals for their contribution  
to business performance. Performance measures will be based  
on a balanced set of key performance drivers
 –  long-term incentives will form part of a market competitive 
remuneration package. Making awards in the form of shares 
aligns the interests of our executives with those of shareholders.
A shareholding policy came into effect on 1 January 2010. The 
policy applies to the Executive Directors of Xchanging plc and 
requires them to build up over a period of five years, and hold, 
throughout their period of employment as an Executive Director  
of Xchanging plc, a minimum shareholding of one times base  
salary. The policy excludes Nigel Rich in his current role as  
Executive Chairman.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the remuneration policy 
is aligned to Xchanging’s business objectives and is in the interests 
of shareholders. The Remuneration Committee will continue to 
monitor performance against the total remuneration policy to ensure 
that it achieves its aim of attracting, motivating and retaining the 
senior management talent that is required to develop the Company 
and deliver shareholder value.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
Total remuneration is benchmarked against relevant FTSE 250 
companies (excluding financial services companies) taking 
into account the geographic reach of each role in determining 
competitive remuneration. Whilst Xchanging has experienced recent 
share price volatility the Remuneration Committee has determined 
that the FTSE 250 still remains the most appropriate market for its 
executive talent.
Remuneration packages for the Executive Directors consist of base 
salary, annual bonus, awards under long-term incentive schemes 
and other benefits. David Andrews and Richard Houghton did not 
participate in any of the Group’s pension schemes and formally 
waived 	 their 	 right 	 to 	 do 	 so. 	 Ken 	 Lever 	 is 	 eligible 	 for 	 a 	 cash 	 allowance	
of 10% of base salary per annum as an allowance in lieu of pension 
contributions. His cash allowance is non-bonusable. As a result a 
significant proportion of Executive Director remuneration is linked  
to corporate and individual performance.
Base salary
Salaries are reviewed annually at the start of each year by the 
Remuneration Committee. Salaries are set by reference to our 
market competitive remuneration philosophy described above, 
affordability, individual performance, and changes in responsibilities. 
No 	 incr ease 	 in 	 base 	 salary 	 will 	 be 	 pr ovided 	 to 	 Ken 	 Lever 	 as 	 the 	 acting	
CEO in 2011. His base salary will remain at £375,000 per annum. 
However, he will receive an allowance of £60,000 per annum  
(pro-rata) effective from 9 February 2011 in recognition of the 
additional responsibilities he will be undertaking as acting CEO.  
The allowance will cease one month following the start of the  
newly appointed CEO.
Annual bonus
The 2010 bonus structure had a bonus maximum of 150% for 
the Executive Directors. The bonus design was structured on a 
graduated scale linked to stretching profit before tax targets, with 
70% payable on achievement of stretch targets and 130% payable 
a s 	 a 	 m a x i m u m . 	 I f 	 r e v e n u e 	 t a r g e t s 	 w e r e 	 n o t 	 a c h i e v e d 	 t h e 	 b o n u s	
was adjusted downwards. Twenty percent of the bonus maximum 
was determined based on the achievement of measurable personal 
objectives. No bonus in respect of performance in 2010 was payable 
to the Executive Directors.
Long-term incentive plans
The Company established a number of equity-based share incentive 
plans 	 ar ound 	 the 	 time 	 of 	 the 	 initial 	 public 	 of fering 	 (IPO), 	 namely 	 an	
Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP) and 
a Performance Share Plan (PSP). Other share plans, namely the Share 
Purchase Plan and earlier Approved, Unapproved and Unapproved G 
S h a r e 	 O p t i o n s 	 P l a n s 	 w e r e 	 a l s o 	 i n 	 e x i s t e n c e 	 a t 	 t h e 	 I P O , 	 b u t 	 n o 	 f u r t h e r	
awar ds 	 will 	 be 	 made 	 under 	 the 	 pr e-IPO 	 Plans.	
Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP)
No awards under the ESOP were granted to the Executive Directors 
in 2010.
Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
The Remuneration Committee chose the PSP as the primary vehicle 
through which share-based long-term incentives were offered to 
Executive Directors and other senior executives in 2010. Under the 
PSP , conditional awards of shares (or phantom shares where tax and 
regulatory conditions made it more appropriate) were made for a 
value up to 150% of the recipient’s salary. Awards will vest three 
years after grant, depending upon the Company’s total shareholder 
return (TSR) performance when compared to the TSR performance 
of the constituents of the FTSE 250 index (excluding investment 
trusts) (the ‘Comparators’) and continuous employment over  
the vesting period.
The ‘basic award’ which will vest ranging from 25% if the 
Company’s TSR is equal to the median TSR of the Comparators, 
through to 100% if the Company’s TSR performance is at or above 
the upper quartile of the Comparators. The ‘stretch award’ will only 
begin to vest if the Company’s TSR performance is at least upper 
quartile of the Comparators, with full vesting of the stretch award 
o n l y 	 f o r 	 u p p e r 	 d e c i l e 	 p e r f o r m a n c e . 	 I n 	 a n y 	 e v e n t , 	 t h e 	 b a s i c 	 a n d	
stretch awards will vest only if the Company’s annual average  
EPS growth over the relevant three-year period is no less than  
the 	 UK 	 Retail 	 Price 	 Index 	 (RPI) 	 +3%.

‘basic award’ of PSP shares worth 100% of their 2010 base salaries 
and a ‘stretch award’ of PSP shares equal to 50% of their 2010  
base salaries.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the TSR-based 
performance conditions that apply to basic and stretch awards, 
together with the related EPS growth condition, ensure that the 
PSP participants are further incentivised to deliver outstanding 
returns to shareholders whilst also enhancing underlying financial 
performance. The extent to which the performance conditions 
are achieved will be determined by the Remuneration Committee, 
having received appropriate third-party advice.

Share Purchase Plan (SPP) 
At the start of 2007, prior to the listing of Xchanging plc, certain 
Directors, and members of senior management (excluding David 
Andrews) (the F Share Loan Participants), purchased class F common 
shares (in Xchanging BV), under the terms of the SPP , at the prevailing 
market 	 price. 	 Upon 	 IPO, 	 the 	 class 	 F 	 common 	 shar es 	 in 	 Xchanging 	 BV	
were split into shares in Xchanging plc on a one-for-four basis, with 
an equivalent value of £1.325 per share (the SPP shares). 
Under the terms of the SPP , the Xchanging BV 2007 Employee 
Benefit Trust provided non-interest-bearing loans to 12 F Share 
L o a n 	 P a r t i c i p a n t s , 	 w h o 	 w e r e 	 d e e m e d 	 k e y 	 t o 	 r e t a i n 	 f o l l o w i n g 	 I P O ,	
to enable them to fund the purchase of the class F common shares. 
As at 31 December 2010, there are six F Share Loan Participants to 
whom loans remain outstanding. The SPP shares were subject to an 
18-month lock-in period, which expired in August 2008. The SPP 
shares may now be sold on the condition that a pro-rata proportion 
of any loan from the Xchanging BV 2007 Employee Benefit Trust  
is repaid.
The non-interest-bearing loans provided to the F Share Loan 
Participants become repayable on the earliest of the F Share Loan 
Participants ceasing employment, the transferring or otherwise 
disposing of their shares (or attempting to do so), accepting another 
loan from a member of the Group to refinance the loan and the

the Share Purchase Plan in 2007 on or before 31 March 2012. A 
mortgage has been taken over his SPP shares by the Xchanging BV 
2007 Employee Benefit Trust to secure this loan.
Other benefits 
David Andrews and Richard Houghton did not participate in any of 
the Group’s pension schemes and formally waived their right to do 
so. 	 Ken 	 Lever 	 is 	 eligible 	 for 	 a 	 cash 	 allowance 	 of 	 10% 	 of 	 base 	 salary	
per annum as an allowance in lieu of pension contributions. His cash 
allowance is non-bonusable. The Executive Directors are eligible 
to receive other benefits including Life Assurance and Permanent 
Health 	 Insurance 	 (PHI), 	 and 	 ar e 	 also 	 eligible 	 to 	 join 	 Xchanging’ s

employees of Xchanging.

Service contracts 
Executive Directors have service contracts with notice periods of  
12 months from either the Director or the Company. This is in line  
with best practice for listed companies. The Company has the right  
to terminate the employment of the Executive Director without  
notice or with less than 12 months’ notice by making a payment  
in lieu of notice equal to the base salary the Executive Director  
would be entitled to receive during any unexpired period of the

to 31 December 2011, the Company has agreed to pay a bonus of 
no less than 60% and no more than 150% of base salary reduced 
pro-rata for the period of notice in line with current practice and 
policy. This is subject to Remuneration Committee discretion and 
dependent on personal and Company performance.

Leaving arrangements

Richard Houghton stepped down as CFO in October 2010.  
He will end his employment with the Company on 31 March 2011. 
The amount payable on departure is £582,570

, of which £220,781 
will have been paid as at 31 March 2011. 
Richard Houghton will participate in Xchanging’s Group Life 
Assurance, 	 Permanent 	 Health 	 Insurance 	 and 	 private 	 medical	
insurance 	 schemes 	 until 	 his 	 departur e. 	 In 	 addition 	 he 	 is 	 entitled	 
to benefit from outplacement consultancy services to a maximum  
of £40,000 within six months of 31 March 2011.
David Andrews
David Andrews’s employment with the Company will end on  
31 March 2011. The amount payable on departure is £505,685 
payable in 11 equal monthly instalments starting in April 2011.
Following his departure David Andrews has entered into a 
consultancy agreement with Xchanging plc until 28 February 2012,  
as a special adviser to the Chairman to support the Company’s 
business development initiatives. The agreement expires 
automatically on 28 February 2012 or by giving not less than  
30 days’ notice in writing by either party. Under the terms of the 
consultancy agreement, Xchanging shall pay David Andrews a 
monthly retainer of £8,500. 
Fees retained for non-executive directorships 
The policy in 2010 on non-executive directorships was that the 
CEO could hold up to two non-executive directorships and other 
Executive Directors could hold one position each. From 2011 
this policy will be amended so that Executive Directors (with the 
exception of the Executive Chairman) may only hold one non-
executive directorship. Directors may retain any fees payable to them 
with the consent of the Remuneration Committee, except in the 
case where the directorship is as a representative of the Company. 
Neither David Andrews nor Richard Houghton held external non-
executive 	 dir ector 	 appointments 	 in 	 2010. 	 Ken 	 Lever 	 continues 	 to 	 be	
a member of the Accounting Standards Board for which he receives 
no fees.
Non-Executive Directors 
The Board aims to recruit Non-Executive Directors of a high calibre 
with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience. 
Non-Executive Directors are expected to bring objectivity and 
independence of view to the Board’s discussions, and to help the 
Board with effective leadership in relation to the Company’s strategy, 
performance, risk and people management as well as ensuring high 
standards of financial probity and corporate governance.
The fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are reviewed regularly. 
I n 	 s e t t i n g 	 t h e 	 f e e s , 	 a 	 r e v i e w 	 o f 	 c u r r e n t 	 m a r k e t 	 p r a c t i c e 	 i s 	 u s e d	
which takes into account time commitment and responsibility. 
The fees payable to Non-Executive Directors are ratified by the 
Board, based on the recommendations of the Executive Directors 
and the Chairman. The Non-Executive Directors do not participate 
in the Company’s incentive or pension schemes, nor do they 
receive any employee benefits. The Company will reimburse all 
expenses reasonably incurred by the Non-Executive Directors in the 
performance of their duties. The Company has obtained appropriate 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.

income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated cash flow statement, the reconciliation of net 
cash flow to movement in net cash, the movement in net cash, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated statement of changes 
in equity, and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 45, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with chapter 3 of 
part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on the financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
•	 give 	 a 	 true 	 and 	 fair 	 view 	 of 	 the 	 state 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 af fairs 	 as 	 at 	 31 	 December 	 2010 	 and 	 its 	 loss 	 and 	 cash 	 flows 	 for 	 the 	 year 	 then 	 ended;
•	 have 	 been 	 pr operly 	 pr epar ed 	 in 	 accor dance 	 with 	 IFRS 	 as 	 adopted 	 by 	 the 	 Eur opean 	 Union; 	 and

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•	 	 the 	 information 	 given 	 in 	 the 	 Dir ectors’ 	 r eport 	 for 	 the 	 financial 	 year 	 for 	 which 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 financial 	 statements 	 ar e 	 pr epar ed 	 is 	 consistent 	
with the Group financial statements; and
•	 	 the 	 information 	 given 	 in 	 the 	 corporate 	 gover nance 	 statement 	 set 	 out 	 on 	 pages 	 46 	 to 	 52 	 with 	 r espect 	 to 	 inter nal 	 contr ol 	 and 	 risk	
management systems and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 certain 	 disclosur es 	 of 	 Dir ectors’ 	 r emuneration 	 specified 	 by 	 law 	 ar e 	 not 	 made; 	 or 	
•	 we 	 have 	 not 	 r eceived 	 all 	 the 	 information 	 and 	 explanations 	 we 	 r equir e 	 for 	 our 	 audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:

1 General information
Xchanging plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’) provide a range of industry-specific processing services to  
the banking and insurance industries as well as procurement, finance and accounting, human resources and technology services across 
industries. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are discussed further on pages 4 to 13.
Xchanging plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is 13 Hanover Square, 
London, W1S 1HN. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
2 Principal accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
(i) Basis of preparation of the financial statements
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the European Union (EU) endorsed International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available-for-
sale financial assets, other financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, in addition to the fair valuation of 
share-based payments. 
The results as presented for the year ended 31 December 2009 have been restated for the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised), “Business 
combinations”, 	 which 	 came 	 into 	 ef fect 	 for 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 fr om 	 1 	 January 	 2010. 	 As 	 a 	 r esult, 	 any 	 exter nal 	 acquisition-r elated 	 expenses, 	 such	
as advisers’ fees and stamp duty are to be charged to the income statement rather than capitalised as part of the costs of acquisition. 
Where acquisition-related expenses were being capitalised in 2009 in relation to business combinations that did not complete until 2010, 
these costs have been expensed through the income statement on transition to IFRS 3 (revised) through the restatement of the 2009 
comparatives. The impact of this restatement is:
•	 	 to 	 r educe 	 the 	 total 	 operating 	 pr ofit, 	 total 	 pr ofit 	 for 	 the 	 period, 	 and 	 the 	 total 	 pr ofit 	 for 	 the 	 period 	 attributable 	 to 	 equity 	 holders 	 of 	 the 	
Company as at 31 December 2009 by £1,023,000 and the related impact on earnings per share;
•	 to 	 r educe 	 the 	 balance 	 of 	 r etained 	 ear nings 	 and 	 trade 	 and 	 other 	 r eceivables 	 as 	 at 	 31 	 December 	 2009 	 by 	 £1,023,000.
The Directors consider it appropriate to exclude such acquisition-related expenses when considering the underlying performance of 
the business. As a result of this change the adjustments to derive the underlying numbers in the income statement also include such 
acquisition-related expenses in order to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with EU endorsed IFRS requires the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or 
actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. Note 3 of these financial statements sets out the areas where significant 
judgements, estimates and assumptions have been made.
(ii) Going concern
The 	 Dir ectors 	 have 	 r eviewed 	 the 	 liquidity 	 position 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 for 	 the 	 period 	 ending 	 30 	 June 	 2012. 	 The 	 cash 	 flows 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 has 	 been 	
assessed against the Group’s available sources of finance on a monthly basis to determine the minimum and maximum expected levels of 
headroom. Based on this analysis, and an assessment of the potential cash risks, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.

2 Principal accounting policies continued
(iii) Changes in accounting policy and disclosure
(a) New standards adopted by the Group
IFRS 3 (revised), “Business combinations”, and consequential amendments to IAS 27, “Consolidated and separate financial statements”, 
IAS 	 28, 	 “Investments 	 in 	 associates”, 	 and 	 IAS 	 31, 	 “Inter ests 	 in 	 joint 	 ventur es”, 	 ar e 	 ef fective 	 pr ospectively 	 to 	 business 	 combinations 	 for 	 which	
the 	 acquisition 	 date 	 is 	 on 	 or 	 after 	 the 	 beginning 	 of 	 the 	 first 	 annual 	 r eporting 	 period 	 beginning 	 on 	 or 	 after 	 1 	 July 	 2009.
IFRS 3 (revised) continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, but with some significant changes, for example, the 
change in the treatment of acquisition-related expenses discussed in the basis of preparation section. Further, any revisions to contingent 
cash consideration in the period following the acquisition will be recorded in the income statement. 
As the Group has adopted IFRS 3 (revised), it is also required to adopt IAS 27 (revised), “Consolidated and separate financial statements”. 
IAS 27 (revised) requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control. 
Such transactions will no longer result in either goodwill or in a gain or a loss being recognised. The standard also specifies the accounting 
when control is lost. Any remaining interest in the entity is re-measured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. 
(b) Amended standards and interpretations mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2010

(iv) Basis of consolidation 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each 
year and are based on consistent accounting policies. Accounting policies of acquired subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to 
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. Subsidiary undertakings are regarded as those companies in which the Company 
has the power of overall operational and financial control. This includes Enterprise Partnerships. The existence and effect of potential voting 
rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Interests acquired in subsidiary undertakings are consolidated from the date power to control passes to the Group. Transactions and 
balances, including unrealised profits and losses, between Group companies are eliminated. The non-controlling interests in the balance 
sheet are stated at the non-controlling interests’ proportion of the carrying values of the assets and liabilities recognised. 
(v) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting as set out in IFRS 3 (revised). A business combination 
is deemed to have occurred where the Group acquires a third party business, either in whole or in part, so that it obtains overall operational 
and financial control of that business. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at acquisition date. 
Any excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired, including intangibles and contingent 
liabilities, is recognised as goodwill. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets 
transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any 
asset or liability resulting from a deferred or contingent consideration arrangement. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the 
net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. Acquisition related costs are expenses as 
incurred.
The fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are initially stated on a provisional basis, but are finalised over a 12 month 
period, as permitted under IFRS 3 (revised).
The group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-
controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of 
the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity where there has been 
no loss of control. 
(vi) Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding value added tax, rebates and discounts.  
It comprises the value of services provided for human resources, finance and accounting services, procurement services, claims servicing, 
securities processing, software development services, customer administration services, business process services as well as maintenance 
contracts and software sales. The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that 
future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities described below:
Human resources / finance and accounting services
Revenue from the provision of human resources and finance and accounting services is recognised according to the period to which the 
service relates, net of guaranteed rebates to customers, when all obligations are fulfilled.
Procurement services
Revenue from the provision of procurement services is recognised on a gross basis where the Group is responsible for the whole supply 
chain process and associated business process from end-to-end. Where the Group acts as an agent, revenue is recognised on a net basis. 
Revenue is recognised, net of guaranteed rebates to customers, according to the period to which the service relates and only when all 
obligations are fulfilled.
Claims servicing
Revenue from the servicing of claims comprises claims processing and fees arising from the administration of programmes is recognised 
either in accordance with estimated claims closure ratios (primarily for life of claim contracts), or over the period of the underlying service 
contract where there is a defined service period. Revenue from incentive schemes associated with the provision of claims servicing is 
recognised on the basis of estimates of the amounts which are considered reasonably certain to be received.
Securities processing
Revenue from the provision of securities processing services is recognised according to the period to which the service relates,  
net of guaranteed rebates to customers. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 continued 71 
Xchanging  
Annual report and accounts 2010
2 Principal accounting policies continued
Software development services
Revenue from software development services is recognised as related services are performed when the contract is based on time and 
materials or under the percentage completion basis where work is performed under a fixed price contract. Revenue from maintenance 
contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the maintenance contract. Revenue from the sale of software licences  
is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are considered to have passed to the buyer and all obligations have  
been fulfilled; usually considered to occur on delivery of the licences to the buyer.
The Group provides administration services to the insurance market, from which there are three principal sources of revenue.  
These, together with the bases of revenue recognition, are set out below:
•	 Customer 	 administration 	 ser vices
  Revenue in respect of the provision of administration services comprises amounts receivable for subscription fees, a transaction charge 
for the provision of administration services and fees for other ad-hoc services. Subscription fees are recognised in the income statement 
according to the period to which they relate. Transactional revenue for these services is recognised in the period in which the transaction 
takes place. Ad-hoc revenue is recognised in the period in which the service is provided.
•	 Business 	 process 	 ser vices
  Revenue in respect of business process services contracts is divided into an implementation phase and a service provision phase. 
Revenue in respect of the implementation phase is accounted for on a long-term contract basis where it is separable from the provision 
of administration services. Revenue and attributable profit are recognised on a percentage completion basis representing the stage of 
completion of contractual obligations. Revenue in respect of the provision of post-implementation administration services to business 
process services customers is recognised in the period to which the service relates.
•	 Maintenance 	 contracts 	 and 	 software 	 sales
  Revenue in respect of the rental or maintenance of computer software programs is recognised as earned. Billings are included in trade 
receivables in accordance with the terms of the relevant rental or maintenance contract. To the extent that billings are recorded in advance 
of the relevant revenue, such advance billings are included in deferred income. The income arising from the sale of an initial licence is 
recognised upfront with implementation income being recognised over the period of implementation of the software. 
(vii) Deferred income
Deferred income relating to claims handling income received at claim inception in our workers compensation business is released in line 
with an estimate of the cost to service the claims based on actuarial table profiles. The profiles determine, for each class of claim that 
Xchanging processes, the estimated life cycle and work effort of a typical claim. The majority of this revenue is released over a two year 
period.
Deferred income relating to software maintenance and licence fees received in advance is predominantly in our insurance business.  
This income is released evenly over the year to which it relates.
(viii) Finance costs 
Finance costs are charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method. 
(ix) Borrowing costs
The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of 
the cost of that asset. The amount of borrowing costs to be capitalised will depend on whether directly attributable borrowings or general 
borrowings are used to finance the asset. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production  
of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss. 
(x) Finance income
Finance income is reported in the income statement as it arises through the application of the effective interest rate method.
(xi) Dividend distributions
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid. 72 
Xchanging  
Annual report and accounts 2010
2 Principal accounting policies continued
(xii) Foreign currency transactions 
(a) Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling,  
which is the Group’s presentation currency. 
(b) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates  
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement within 
‘finance income or cost’. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within ‘foreign exchange  
(loss)/gain’ in cost of sales or administrative expenses.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets such as equities classified as available-for-sale are included in the revaluation 
reserve in equity. 
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss are recognised 
in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. 
(c) Group companies 
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have  
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: 
•	 all 	 assets 	 and 	 liabilities 	 for 	 each 	 balance 	 sheet 	 pr esented 	 ar e 	 translated 	 at 	 the 	 closing 	 rate 	 at 	 the 	 date 	 of 	 that 	 balance 	 sheet	
• 	 i n c o m e 	 a n d 	 e x p e n s e s 	 f o r 	 e a c h 	 i n c o m e 	 s t a t e m e n t 	 a r e 	 t r a n s l a t e d 	 a t 	 m o n t h l y 	 a v e r a g e 	 e x c h a n g e 	 r a t e s 	 ( u n l e s s 	 t h i s 	 a v e r a g e 	 i s 	 n o t 	 a 	 r e a s o n a b l e	
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated  
at the rate on the dates of the transactions)
•	 all 	 r esulting 	 exchange 	 dif fer ences 	 ar e 	 r ecognised 	 as 	 a 	 separate 	 component 	 of 	 equity .	
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of long-term monetary items designated as part of the net investment 
in foreign operation are taken to shareholders’ equity. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity  
and translated at the closing rate.
(d) Hedging
The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting when it hedges exposure to variability in cash flows associated with a recognised asset  
or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and where the hedge is expected to be highly effective.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income, whilst any 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain  
or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the 
income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity  
is immediately transferred to the income statement.
(xiii) Goodwill 
Goodwill 	 r ecognised 	 under 	 UK 	 GAAP 	 prior 	 to 	 the 	 date 	 of 	 transition 	 to 	 IFRS, 	 1 	 January 	 2003, 	 is 	 stated 	 at 	 net 	 book 	 value 	 at 	 the 	 date	 
of transition. This goodwill had been amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life (being 10 years). 
Goodwill 	 r ecognised 	 subsequent 	 to 	 1 	 January 	 2003, 	 arising 	 fr om 	 the 	 pur chase 	 of 	 subsidiary 	 undertakings, 	 r epr esents 	 the 	 excess 	 of 	 the 	 fair	
value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets (including intangible assets) acquired. Goodwill is capitalised 
as a non-current asset. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Impairment reviews are performed at each 
balance sheet date where there is an identified indicator of impairment, or at least annually, to ensure that the present value of estimated 
future net income streams from the associated cash-generating units to which the goodwill has been allocated, discounted using discount 
rates specific to the Group, exceeds the goodwill capitalised. Any impairment losses identified are not reversed. Gains and losses on the 
disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.

(xiv) Intangible assets
(a) Development costs
Where development costs meet the criteria for capitalisation, these are stated at cost less a provision for amortisation and any provision  
for impairment. Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Costs incurred during the development period of new contracts, including the costs of process and system designs that substantially 
improve those processes and systems already installed in either the Enterprise Partnerships or recently acquired subsidiaries, are treated  
as development costs. Expenditure relating to these clearly defined and identifiable development projects is recognised as an intangible 
asset only where costs can be reliably measured and after the following criteria have been met:
•	 the 	 technical 	 feasibility 	 and 	 commer cial 	 viability 	 of 	 the 	 development 	 pr oject 	 have 	 been 	 demonstrated;
•	 the 	 availability 	 of 	 adequate 	 technical 	 and 	 financial 	 r esour ces 	 and 	 an 	 intention 	 to 	 complete 	 the 	 pr oject 	 have 	 been 	 confirmed;
•	 ther e 	 is 	 an 	 ability 	 to 	 use 	 or 	 sell 	 the 	 pr oject; 	 and
•	 futur e 	 economic 	 benefits 	 ar e 	 expected.
Costs that are capitalised comprise directly attributable incremental costs incurred during the development period, including wages and 
salaries of staff employed solely for the purpose of improving the processes and systems, and third party costs. Development costs do not 
include restructuring costs, (including redundancy, early termination penalties and such like), which are expensed to the income statement 
as they are incurred.
Amortisation of development costs occurs on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract to which they relate (between 6 and 12 years). 
This period represents the useful life of the intangible asset. 
(b) Software costs
Softwar e 	 costs 	 ar e 	 capitalised 	 wher e 	 they 	 meet 	 the 	 criteria 	 for 	 r ecognition 	 under 	 IAS 	 38. 	 Wher e 	 the 	 criteria 	 for 	 capitalisation 	 ar e 	 not 	 met,	
software development expenditure is expensed as incurred. 
Software development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis at an annual rate of 20% or over the life of the related contract, where 
appropriate, so as to write off the asset cost on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life. Purchased software is stated  
at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over three years.
(c) Assets in the course of development
Assets in the course of development are not amortised until the asset is brought into use.
Subsequent expenditure undertaken to ensure that an asset maintains its previously assessed standard of performance, for example, routine 
repairs and maintenance expenditure, is recognised in the income statement as it is incurred. Where subsequent expenditure significantly 
enhances an asset, this is capitalised.
(d) Contractual customer relationships
Contractual 	 customer 	 r elationships 	 ar e 	 capitalised 	 on 	 acquisition 	 wher e 	 they 	 meet 	 the 	 criteria 	 for 	 r ecognition 	 under 	 IFRS 	 3 	 and 	 IAS 	 38.	
Amortisation of customer contractual relationships is in line with the expected length of the customer relationship, which is between one 
and seven years. 
(xv) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of property, 
plant and equipment is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
All repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of the assets, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over  
the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
Leasehold improvements  over the period of the lease
Computer equipment  20-33% per annum
Fixtures and fittings  10-33% per annum
Motor vehicles   25% per annum
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within  
the income statement. 74 
Xchanging  
Annual report and accounts 2010
2 Principal accounting policies continued
(xvi) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets (including goodwill)
At each balance sheet date, management reviews its tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. Intangible assets are reviewed if a trigger event is deemed to have happened, unless the intangible asset 
has an indefinite useful life, then these assets are reviewed at least annually. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money. Future 
cash flows are adjusted to take account of any risks specific to an asset. Fair value less costs to sell is determined by reference to either the 
expected proceeds of sale or the expected discounted cash flows in respect of the asset, less any costs that is expected to be incurred to 
secure the sale. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount  
of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of  
an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
(xvii) Financial instruments
Financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the following categories: loans and receivables, available-for-sale and financial assets 
at fair value through profit or loss. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. The Group 
determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition: 
•	 	 loans 	 and 	 r eceivables 	 ar e 	 non-derivative 	 financial 	 assets 	 with 	 fixed 	 or 	 determinable 	 payments 	 that 	 ar e 	 not 	 quoted 	 in 	 an 	 active 	 market. 	
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified  
as non-current assets 
•	 	 available-for -sale 	 financial 	 assets 	 ar e 	 non-derivatives 	 that 	 ar e 	 either 	 designated 	 in 	 this 	 category 	 or 	 not 	 classified 	 in 	 any 	 of 	 the 	 other 	
categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the 
balance sheet date 
•	 	 financial 	 assets 	 at 	 fair 	 value 	 thr ough 	 pr ofit 	 or 	 loss 	 includes 	 r esidual 	 equities 	 pur chased 	 as 	 part 	 of 	 a 	 r equisitioned 	 trade 	 on 	 behalf 	 of 	 a 	 client 	
of the Continental Europe sector and are held at their fair value until the opportunity arises to sell the equity as part of a new requisitioned 
trade by a client. They are included within current assets and classified as held-for-trading assets within trade and other receivables in the 
balance sheet
•	 	 financial 	 assets 	 at 	 fair 	 value 	 thr ough 	 pr ofit 	 or 	 loss 	 also 	 include 	 warrants 	 pur chased 	 alongside 	 an 	 equity 	 investment 	 and 	 of fer 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 the 	
opportunity to purchase additional shares in an unquoted entity at a future date. They are carried at fair value in the balance sheet and 
classified as held-for-trading financial assets.

Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date – the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell 
the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit 
or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed  
in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or  
have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets  
are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.  
Held-for-trading assets are carried at fair value through profit and loss.
When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in other 
comprehensive income are included in the income statement as gains and losses from investment securities.
Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the income statement as part of finance income when the Group’s  
right to receive payments is established. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of other financial assets at fair value through 
profit and loss are presented within finance costs or income in the period in which they arise. Changes in the fair value of monetary and 
non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets  
is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security 
below its cost is considered to be an indicator that the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial 
assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss 
on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss – is removed from other comprehensive income and recognised in the income 
statement. Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement. 
If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale increases and the increase can be objectively 
related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed through the separate 
consolidated income statement.
(xviii) Put options granted to non-controlling shareholders
In accordance with IAS 32, when non-controlling interests hold put options that enable them to sell their investments to the Group,  
the net present value of the future payment is reflected as a financial liability in the consolidated balance sheet. At the end of each period, 
the valuation of the liability is reassessed with any changes recognised in the income statement for the period through finance costs. 
(xix) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Net realisable 
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. 
(xx) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for impairment.  
A provision for the impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor 
will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable 
is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through the use of an allowance account. Impaired debts are derecognised 
when they are assessed as uncollectible.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised 
impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Pre-contract costs comprise legal and other professional expenses and other directly attributable staff costs incurred in order to obtain 
specific customer contracts. Costs that are directly attributable to a contract are deferred when they are separately identifiable, can be 
reliably measured and it is probable that the contract will be awarded and the contract will result in future net cash inflows with a present 
value at least equal to all amounts recognised as an asset. 
Pre-contract costs are included within trade and other receivables and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, 
starting from the date when the contract commences. 76 
Xchanging  
Annual report and accounts 2010
2 Principal accounting policies continued
(xxi) Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, demand deposits and short-term highly liquid 
investments which are readily convertible to cash and are subject to minimal risk of changes in value. 
(xxii) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method.
(xxiii) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. 
Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over  
the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
(xxiv) Operating and finance leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives 
provided by lessors to the Group are amortised over the lease term together with any related costs of acquiring the lease.
Assets held under finance leases are initially reported at the lower of the fair value of the assets and the present value of minimum lease 
payments with an equivalent liability categorised as appropriate under current or non-current liabilities. The asset is depreciated over the 
shorter of the lease term and its useful economic life. Finance charges are allocated to accounting periods over the period of the lease  
to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance. 
(xxv) Taxation including deferred taxation 
Current and deferred tax is recognised at the amount expected to be paid to (or recovered from) the taxation authorities on the basis  
of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the company  
and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred tax is recognised under the liability method on an undiscounted basis in respect of all temporary differences that have originated 
but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less,  
tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date, with the following exceptions:
•	 	 wher e 	 the 	 temporary 	 dif fer ence 	 arises 	 fr om 	 the 	 initial 	 r ecognition 	 of 	 goodwill 	 or 	 of 	 an 	 asset 	 or 	 liability 	 in 	 a 	 transaction 	 that 	 is 	 not 	 a	
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss
•	 	 deferr ed 	 tax 	 assets 	 ar e 	 r egar ded 	 as 	 r ecoverable 	 and 	 ther efor e 	 r ecognised, 	 only 	 when, 	 on 	 the 	 basis 	 of 	 all 	 available 	 evidence, 	 the 	 Dir ectors	
consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary 
differences can be deducted. 
Income tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income  
or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
(xxvi) Employee benefit costs
(a) Pension obligations
The Group operates, or participates in, both defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes. All the pension schemes are 
accounted for in accordance with IAS 19.
Professional independent actuaries value the defined benefit schemes triennially and the valuations are updated at each year end using 
the projected unit credit method. Scheme assets are measured using closing market values at the balance sheet date. Pension scheme 
liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of 
equivalent term and currency to the liability. Variations between the scheme assets and liabilities identified as a result of these actuarial 
valuations (actuarial gains and losses) are recognised in full through the statement of comprehensive income (SOCI) in the period in which 
they arise. Current service costs, expected returns on plan assets and interest costs are charged to the income statement. Past-service costs 
are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a 
specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group participates in a number of defined benefit schemes which are multi-employer schemes and where insufficient information exists 
to be able to account for the schemes as defined benefit plans as there is no consistent and reliable basis for allocating the obligations, plan 
assets and costs to individual entities participating in these schemes. In accordance with IAS 19, such schemes are accounted for as defined 
contribution schemes and contributions are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Contributions to the Group’s defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.

(b) Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of an equity-settled transaction, for example options, is recognised as an expense over the periods in which the 
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the vesting date of the award. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period  
is determined by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions 
about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options 
that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity. Awards, where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not 
the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
When the options are exercised, the company issues new shares. The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, 
are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options are exercised.
The grant by the company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the group is treated as  
a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised in the 
Company accounts over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
(xxvii) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when a present obligation exists as the result of a past event and it is probable that this will result in an outflow 
of economic benefit, the amount of which can be reliably estimated. Where the provision is long-term, such as onerous contract provisions 
where the unavoidable costs of meeting obligations exceed any economic benefits expected to be received, the net cash flows are 
discounted using an appropriate risk-free rate. 
Restructuring provisions are only recognised if an obligation exists at the balance sheet date, i.e. a formal plan exists and those affected 
by that plan have a valid expectation that the restructuring will be carried out. Employee termination payments are included within 
restructuring provisions. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
(xxviii) Share capital
Share capital comprises the nominal value of all issued shares. On subscribing for shares any excess consideration over the nominal value  
of the shares issued less any issue costs is credited to the share premium account.
(xxix) Fair value estimation
The fair values of short-term loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values. 
For loans due in more than one year the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future 
contractual cash flows at the market interest rate available to the Group for similar financial instruments. The fair value for quoted available-
for-sale investments and held-for-trading equity securities is based on their quoted market price. The fair value of unquoted available-for-
sale investments and held-for-trading equity securities is estimated by reference to a discounted cash flow calculation.
(xxx) Exceptional items
Exceptional items are events or transactions that fall outside the ordinary activities of the Group, and which by virtue of their size  
or incidence, have been separately disclosed in order to improve a reader’s understanding of the financial statements. These include 
items relating to the restructuring of a significant part of the Group, impairment losses, expenditure relating to the integration and 
implementation of significant acquisitions and other one-off events or transactions.

3 Critical accounting estimations and judgements
The Group’s principal accounting policies are set out in note 2 of these financial statements. Management is required to exercise significant 
judgement and make use of estimates and assumptions in the application of these policies.
Areas which management believes require the most critical accounting judgements are:
(i) Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates a number of defined benefit plans. The retirement benefit obligations recorded are based on actuarial assumptions, 
including discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, inflation and mortality rates. These assumptions are based on 
current market conditions, historical information and consultation with, and input from, actuaries. Management reviews these assumptions 
annually. If they change, or if actual experience is different from the assumptions, the funding status of the plan will change and the 
retirement benefit obligation will be adjusted accordingly. The assumptions used are detailed in note 32.
The assumed discount rate and life expectancy have a significant effect on the measurement of pension liabilities. The following tables 
show the sensitivity of the valuation of the pension obligations, and of the 2010 income statement charge, to changes in these assumptions 
for the material UK and Continental Europe schemes at both the start and the end of the year:

1 	 year 	 incr ease 	 to 	 life 	 expectancy	 	 	 	 	 	 (851)	 	 (1)
Xchanging participates in various BAE Systems pension schemes. The terms on which Xchanging participates in these schemes give 
Xchanging protection against any requirement to fund future deficits that arise in the schemes, and against future exit debts that may arise 
on withdrawal from these schemes. However, in the event of BAE Systems becoming insolvent, there is a risk that Xchanging could become 
liable to fund the wider pension schemes of these companies, which would result in a significant exposure should these events occur. The 
Directors consider the risk of this event to be extremely remote and consequently the schemes are accounted for as defined contribution 
schemes as per note 32. 
(ii) Estimated impairment of goodwill
The Group tests at least annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated  
in note 2(xiii). The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use or fair value less costs  
to sell calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates (see note 13).
(iii) Exceptional items
The Directors consider exceptional items to be items of income or expense that fall outside the ordinary activities of the Group, and which 
by virtue of their size or incident, should be disclosed separately if the financial statements are to reflect a full understanding of the financial 
position and underlying financial performance of the Group on a comparable basis (see note 6). Consideration of what should be labelled 
as “exceptional” requires management judgement to be applied.

3 Critical accounting estimations and judgements continued
(iv) Calculation of pre-contract costs and appropriate amortisation period
The original cost of pre-contract costs includes project development costs (including appropriate direct internal costs) which are deferred 
from the point that it is virtually certain that the project will proceed to completion. The Directors consider that this point of virtual certainty 
is normally reached when the memorandum of understanding related to the contract is signed by all parties involved (see note 17). 
The amortisation of these pre-contract costs is charged so as to write down the value of the asset to its residual value over the life  
of the contract.
(v) Assumptions on put options
Three put options are accounted for as financial liabilities under paragraph 23 of IAS 32. These liabilities are carried at fair value through 
profit and loss and measured at the fair value of the future cash flows associated with them. The levels of these cash flows and the 
relevant discount rates used in the fair value calculations are based on future projections and incorporate a certain element of management 
judgement (see note 21). 
(vi) Income taxes
The 	 Gr oup 	 is 	 subject 	 to 	 income 	 taxes 	 in 	 numer ous 	 jurisdictions. 	 Judgement 	 is 	 r equir ed 	 in 	 determining 	 the 	 gr oup-wide 	 pr ovision 	 for 	 income	
taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities 
for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters 
is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
The Group is required to estimate the corporate tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This requires an estimation of the 
current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting and 
tax treatments. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included within the balance sheet. Deferred 
tax assets are not recognised where it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realised in the future. This evaluation requires 
judgements to be made, including the forecast of future taxable income.
(vii) Acquisitions
When acquiring a business, the Group has to make judgements and best estimates about the fair value allocation of the purchase price. 
The Group tests the valuation of goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount  
may not be recoverable. These tests require the use of estimates (see note 3 (ii)). 
(viii) Deferred revenue recognition
The Group applies judgement in determining the most appropriate method to use in estimating the amount of deferred revenue to  
be 	 r ecognised 	 in 	 a 	 financial 	 period. 	 Following 	 the 	 acquisition 	 of 	 Cambridge 	 Solutions 	 Limited 	 on 	 1 	 January 	 2009, 	 a 	 significant 	 amount 	 of 	
deferred revenue was recognised on acquisition arising on a number of claims service contracts. The amount of deferred revenue released 
in relation to these contracts is then estimated based on management’s estimation of the services performed to date against the total 
estimated cost to fulfil all obligations. 
(ix) Valuation of provisions
Due to the nature of provisions, an element of their determination is based on estimates and judgements, including assumptions regarding 
the future anticipated cash outflows required to settle obligations, and the period over which these outflows will arise. The actual outcome 
of these uncertain factors may differ from these estimations, giving rise to differences with the estimated provisions. Any such differences 
between actual outcomes and the provisions recorded may impact the Group’s results over the periods involved. The timing of the outflow 
of resources required to settle these obligations is subject to similar uncertain factors. See note 22 for discussion of critical estimates and 
judgements on specific provisions.

4 Segmental reporting
Following 	 the 	 adoption 	 of 	 IFRS 	 8 	 with 	 ef fect 	 fr om 	 1 	 January 	 2009, 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 identified 	 six 	 r eportable 	 operating 	 segments, 	 based 	 on 	 
the management organisational structure and which formed the basis of the segmental reporting notes in the financial statements for the 
period ended 31 December 2009. These were the UK, the Americas, Continental Europe, Asia Pacific, Global Procurement and Corporate. 
As 	 r equir ed 	 by 	 IFRS 	 8, 	 the 	 operating 	 segments 	 ar e 	 r eviewed 	 r egularly 	 by 	 the 	 Xchanging 	 Management 	 Boar d 	 (XMB), 	 the 	 chief 	 operating	
decision-maker, to ensure that they are still appropriate as components of the Group, based on the allocation of resources and being the 
basis on which performance is assessed. 
S i n c e 	 1 	 J a n u a r y 	 2 0 1 0 , 	 t h e r e 	 h a v e 	 b e e n 	 a 	 n u m b e r 	 o f 	 c h a n g e s 	 t o 	 t h e 	 m a n a g e m e n t 	 o r g a n i s a t i o n a l 	 s t r u c t u r e 	 a n d 	 m o n i t o r i n g 	 o f 	 p e r f o r m a n c e	
by the XMB. Global Procurement previously contained a number of entities which served different geographic locations. These procurement 
entities have subsequently been included within their respective geographic regions of the UK, the Americas, Asia Pacific and Continental 
Europe. Global Procurement as a separate operating segment therefore no longer exists. Further, the IT and Insurance Software divisions, 
previously included in their entirety within the Americas region, have been divided between those entities located in the USA (and which 
remain part of the Americas region) and those which are based in India, Singapore, Malaysia or Australia (and now included within the  
Asia Pacific region). All comparatives have been restated to reflect these changes to the segmental reporting structure.
A brief description of each segment follows:
• 	 	 U K 	 i s 	 a 	 c r o s s - i n d u s t r y 	 s e c t o r 	 p r o v i d i n g 	 i n s u r a n c e 	 B P O 	 s e r v i c e s , 	 p r o c u r e m e n t 	 s e r v i c e s 	 t o 	 a 	 r a n g e 	 o f 	 c u s t o m e r s 	 w i t h i n 	 t h e 	 U K , 	 h u m a n	
resources, finance and accounting, and technology primarily within the insurance industry;
•	 	 Services 	 pr ovided 	 in 	 the 	 Americas 	 segment 	 comprise 	 the 	 pr ovision 	 of 	 cr oss-industry 	 IT 	 pr oducts 	 and 	 services, 	 pr ocur ement 	 services,	 
and both workers’ compensation and other specialist insurance claims processing services for customers across the USA;
•	 	 Continental 	 Eur ope 	 pr ovides 	 BPO 	 services 	 to 	 Financial 	 services 	 customers 	 and 	 pr ocur ement 	 services 	 to 	 a 	 range 	 of 	 customers 	 acr oss	
industries;
•	 	 Asia 	 Pacific 	 contains 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 of fshor e 	 business 	 pr ocessing 	 services 	 function, 	 which 	 pr ovides 	 accounting, 	 pension 	 administration 	 and 	
broking services to a range of cross-industry customers. It also includes the Australian workers’ compensation claims processing services 
business, procurement services to a range of customers, and services relating to the provision of cross-industry IT products and services;
•	 	 Corporate 	 pr ovides 	 the 	 infrastructur e, 	 r esour ces 	 and 	 investment 	 to 	 sustain 	 and 	 gr ow 	 the 	 Gr oup, 	 including 	 sales 	 and 	 commer cial,	
performance management, implementation and business management functions.
Going forward, Xchanging will be introducing to its structure a focus on global business sectors to make better use of our expertise  
and resources. The four sectors will comprise:
•	 Insurance 	 Services 	 – 	 technology 	 infrastructur e 	 and 	 managed 	 services
•	 Pr ocur ement 	 and 	 Human 	 Resour ces 	 – 	 pr ocur ement 	 and 	 HR 	 r esour cing 	 and 	 administration
•	 Financial 	 Services 	 – 	 banking, 	 securities 	 pr ocessing 	 and 	 investment 	 account 	 management 	 and 	 fund 	 administration
•	 T echnology 	 – 	 technology 	 infrastructur e 	 and 	 managed 	 services
To aid the reader’s understanding of Xchanging’s business, disclosure of the performance by business sector has been included in the 
segmental reporting note.
Management used underlying operating profit as a measure of segment result for the financial year ending 31 December 2010. Underlying 
operating profit excludes the effects of non-recurring expenditure that falls outside of the ordinary activities of the Group from the 
operating 	 segments 	 such 	 as 	 r estructuring 	 costs 	 and 	 acquisition-r elated 	 expenses 	 following 	 the 	 adoption 	 of 	 IFRS 	 3 	 (r evised) 	 fr om 	 1 	 January	
2010. The measure also excludes the amortisation of intangible assets previously unrecognised by an acquired entity, and imputed interest 
on put options issued to non-controlling interests. Interest income and expenditure are not allocated to segments, as this type of activity  
is driven by the Group treasury function, which manages the cash position of the whole Group.
Management made regular use of the underlying operating profit measure to evaluate performance in the operating segments, both in 
absolute terms and comparatively from period to period, and to allocate resources among its operating segments. Management believed 
that this measure provided a better understanding, for both management and investors, of the operating results of its business segments 
for the period under review. 
Going forward, Xchanging will focus on adjusted operating profit as the primary profit measure to evaluate performance in the operating 
segments. Adjusted operating profit excludes all material non-recurring operating items and adds back acquisition-related expenses and 
amortisation of intangible assets previously unrecognised by an acquired entity. Adjusted operating profit is disclosed in the segmental 
reporting note for each segment and business sector. Underlying operating profit will not form part of the segmental disclosure note  
in future periods.

Cambridge US BPO business. More detail regarding this impairment is provided in note 13. 
An impairment charge of £39,600,000 has been recognised in respect of goodwill attributed to the Asia Pacific region relating to the

In 	 addition, 	 impairments 	 of 	 goodwill 	 associated 	 with 	 the 	 UK 	 and 	 Continental 	 Eur ope 	 r egion 	 totalling 	 £9,389,000 	 have 	 been 	 r ecognised.	
More detail regarding this impairment is provided in note 13. 
The impairment of other intangible assets of £7,401,000 relates to specific software and development assets within the Americas, Asia 
Pacific and Continental Europe regions that are deemed to be impaired based on the likelihood of insufficient future economic benefits 
deriving from those assets. More detail regarding this impairment is provided in note 14.
The impairment of available-for-sale assets and write down of held-for-trading equity securities totalling £3,226,000, relates to an 
investment held by Cambridge in Big E Real Estates Inc and rights and warrants purchased alongside this investment, which offer the  
Group the opportunity to purchase additional shares at a future date. Included in this amount is £1,213,000 relating to cumulative 
revaluation losses previously taken to other comprehensive income and recycled to the income statement on the impairment of the 
available-for-sale asset. 
The onerous contract provision totalling £2,627,000, relates to a contract deemed to be onerous in the Asia Pacific region, based on the 
likelihood of future revenues not being sufficient to cover the expected future operating costs. 
The gain of £146,000 relates to the acquisition of 51% of Kedrios S.p.A.. For further details on this amount refer to note 32 (d).
The Cambridge acquisition and integration costs incurred in 2009 of £16,734,000 related to specific costs incurred as a consequence of  
the acquisition of Cambridge Solutions Limited and its subsidiaries (Cambridge). These costs were incurred as a result of the implementation 
of significant restructuring efforts to integrate Cambridge into the Xchanging business. Key aspects of the implementation programme 
included the major restructuring of the US BPO business (included in the Americas segment), with the significant consolidation of existing 
sites into a few key locations. The charge consists of costs related to the restructuring of the US BPO business, including onerous lease 
provisions, asset impairments, severance pay and other costs associated with the management and implementation of the integration plan. 88

6 Exceptional items continued
As part of the Cambridge acquisition and integration costs, the consolidation of existing US sites into a few key locations has resulted in  
a number of vacant properties from which the Group has been unable to terminate its commitments. The onerous lease provisions created 
represent the remaining costs, primarily rent, associated with these vacant properties. The impairment of assets represents the accelerated 
depreciation on those assets associated with the vacant properties discussed above (refer note 22).
Lean processor strategy restructuring costs of £17,393,000 incurred in 2009 related to redundancy costs relating primarily to the UK  
and Germany. This reflects combining operations in the UK, further increasing offshoring activities to India, and streamlining operations  
in Germany.
An exceptional gain of £4,967,000 was recognised in 2009 from the release of the Phoenix provision. This provision was held against a 
potential liability arising from Fondsdepot Bank GmbH’s membership of the Entschädigungseinrichtung der Wertpapierhandelsunternehmen 
(EdW) 	 banking 	 gr oup 	 in 	 Germany . 	 Fondsdepot 	 Bank 	 GmbH 	 obtained 	 a 	 full 	 banking 	 licence 	 in 	 January 	 2010, 	 and 	 subsequently 	 left 	 the 	 EdW .	
Consequently its obligation to make any future payments was removed.
The tax credit arising in respect of exceptional items is £1,125,000 (2009: £4,979,000).

Factors that may affect future tax charges
Tax losses arising in the current and previous years and other temporary differences total an estimated carried forward amount of 
£11,853,000 	 in 	 the 	 UK 	 (2009: 	 £16,300,000), 	 and 	 losses 	 of 	 £90,714,000 	 in 	 the 	 US 	 (2009: 	 £65,300,000) 	 and 	 £6,104,000 	 (2009: 	 £2,280,000)	
in other tax jurisdictions. The US losses largely arise in Cambridge entities which were acquired in 2009.
A 	 number 	 of 	 changes 	 to 	 the 	 UK 	 Corporation 	 tax 	 system 	 wer e 	 announced 	 in 	 the 	 June 	 2010 	 Budget 	 Statement. 	 The 	 Finance 	 (No 	 2) 	 Act	
2010, 	 which 	 was 	 substantively 	 enacted 	 on 	 20 	 July 	 2010, 	 includes 	 legislation 	 r educing 	 the 	 main 	 rate 	 of 	 corporation 	 tax 	 fr om 	 28% 	 to 	 27%	
fr om 	 1 	 April 	 2011. 	 The 	 change 	 fr om 	 28% 	 to 	 27% 	 has 	 been 	 r eflected 	 in 	 the 	 deferr ed 	 tax 	 asset 	 included 	 in 	 these 	 financial 	 statements. 	 	
Proposed further reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per year to 24% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted 
separately each year. These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these 
financial statements. The annual impact of the 1% reduction in the tax rate is expected to reduce the deferred tax asset included in the 
financial statements at each year end by approximately £400,000.

11 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares of Xchanging plc. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in existence  
is adjusted to include all potential dilutive ordinary shares. The Group has two types of potential dilutive ordinary shares: share options,  
and share awards under the Performance Share Plan to the extent that the performance criteria for vesting of the awards are expected  
to be met.

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) identified according to operating business, this being the lowest level  
at which assets generate separately identifiable cash inflows independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets.

FVLCTS = Fair value less costs to sell.   
Where the recoverable amount of a CGU has been determined based on value-in-use, the value-in-use calculations use pre-tax cash flow  
projections based on budgets approved by the management of the CGU and the Board (which cover a one year period) as well as cash  
flows for years 2-5 using management’s expectations of sales growth, operating costs and margin based on past experience and 
expectations regarding future performance and profitability for each individual CGU. 
With the exception of Cambridge ITO (included within Americas Technology) and India BPO, a terminal value is then added using a nil 
growth rate assumption. For Cambridge ITO and India BPO CGUs, a terminal value has been calculated using a long term growth rate  
of 2.5% given the high growth profile of the markets in which these CGUs operate. The long-term growth rates used do not exceed  
the long-term average market growth rates in which the CGUs operate.
For the Australia BPO and US BPO CGUs, cash flows are monitored at a level lower than that used for goodwill impairment testing.  
In both of these CGUs, recoverable amount has been determined for part of the business based on fair value less costs to sell where past 
performance may indicate a need to consider strategic options because this results in a higher recoverable amount. The remainder of each 
CGU has been valued on a value in use basis. For goodwill impairment testing, cash flows are aggregated to determine the recoverable 
amount for the CGU as a whole.
For Australia BPO, fair value less costs to sell has been determined based on the expected cash flows in respect of the contract for 2011.
For US BPO, fair value less costs to sell has been determined based on an analysis of the potential proceeds that could be obtained from sale 
less expected costs of disposal, including operating cash flows to the point of expected sale. This was based on a comparison to businesses 
with similar characteristics operating in the same industry and market completed by a third party.
A discount rate ranging between 10.00%-11.00% (2009: 10.00%) is applied to cash flow projections. The discount rate is based on 
management’s estimate of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, with an appropriate risk adjustment depending on the CGU. 
Management believes it is appropriate to use rates within this range on the basis that cash flows are adjusted as considered appropriate  
to reflect any risks associated with operating within specific geographic or operational segments. The increase in discount rate applied  
to certain CGUs reflects the increased risk profile within the respected markets.

Impairment charges
All impairment charges have been recorded in the income statement within administrative expenses.
The impairment charge in the Americas segment relating to Cambridge US BPO arises due to the underperformance of certain elements 
within the workers compensation business and the requirement to assess strategic options in the future in relation to elements of 
underperformance. Notwithstanding this, the Group remains committed to developing a market presence and leveraging from the higher 
performing elements within the US BPO market which supports the remaining goodwill balance in the Cambridge US BPO CGU at  
31 December 2010 of £3,471,000.
The impairment charge in the Asia Pacific segment relating to Cambridge Australia BPO reflects significant underperformance in  
2010 within the injured workers processing business and future uncertainty in relation to likely compensation, a proportion of which  
is determined by factors outside the direct control of the business. However, the presence in the Asia Pacific (including Australian)  
market continues to provide opportunities to the Group which supports the remaining goodwill balance in the Australia BPO CGU  
at 31 December 2010 of £5,269,000.
The impairment charge in Continental Europe relates to the European procurement business, and in the UK it relates to Advisory services. 
Both impairments have arisen due to continued underperformance of these CGUs during 2010. The goodwill balances for both these  
CGUs have been impaired in full at 31 December 2010.
Sensitivity analysis
In relation to remaining goodwill balances across the Group, sensitivity analysis performed on the current base case assumptions fully 
supports the carrying value of the remaining goodwill. However, in some cases, a significant change in material key assumptions could 
cause the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to certain CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount. In particular non-renewal of material 
customer contracts in the future could impact the recoverable amount of goodwill within certain CGUs, particularly in the UK region, 
although this is not considered likely at this time.
There is residual goodwill of £3,471,000 and £5,269,000 in the US BPO and Australia BPO CGUs respectively after impairing the goodwill 
to its recoverable amount. An adverse change in assumptions under the fair value less costs to sell valuation, for example the timing of exit 
from underperforming businesses, would directly impact the residual carrying value and would lead to a further impairment. For the parts 
of the business valued using value in use, a 1% reduction in growth rate would reduce goodwill by £3,200,000 and £400,000 in US BPO 
and Australia BPO respectively.
For all other CGUs, a reasonably possible change to a key assumption is not anticipated to result in the carrying value of goodwill exceeding 
the recoverable amount.  96

Impairment losses
Software
During the year an impairment loss of £3,223,000 was recognised in respect in the Continental Europe reporting segment. The impairment 
arises due to lower revenues being derived from the service which the software supports. The recoverable amount of the asset has been 
determined based on value-in-use calculations using a discount rate of 10% (2009: 10%). 
Development costs
During 	 the 	 year 	 an 	 impairment 	 loss 	 of 	 £1,851,000 	 was 	 r ecognised 	 in 	 r espect 	 of 	 an 	 intangible 	 asset 	 r elating 	 to 	 the 	 workers’ 	 compensation	
process re-engineering which forms part of the Corporate reporting segment. Given the under performance of the US workers’ 
compensation business in 2010 and our strategic review of the business, the future economic benefit expected to be derived from the  
asset is not deemed to be sufficient to support its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of the asset has been determined based  
on value-in-use calculations using a discount rate of 11% (2009: 10%).
The remaining impairments of software and customer contractual relationships primarily relate to Asia Pacific workers’ compensation 
business which underperformed in 2010.

for impairment on a case-by-case basis to identify impairment taking into account the ageing of the debt, the likelihood of recoverability 
and other external factors. The ageing analysis of the trade receivables is as follows:

The Group holds deferred income relating to an onerous run off contract operated by Cambridge. This revenue is released against the 
ongoing 	 operating 	 costs 	 of 	 serving 	 the 	 contract, 	 primarily 	 labour 	 and 	 the 	 associated 	 overheads. 	 Revenue 	 of 	 £2,474,000 	 (2009: 	 £1,948,000)	
has been recognised at a margin of £161,000 (6.7%) (2009: £133,000 at 6.7% margin).
Included in deferred income is £5,912,000 (2009: £6,055,000) relating to a lease incentive which is being amortised over the lease term. 
The amount which is amortised is off-set against the lease expense in the income statement. 104

The fair values of the put options are based on cash flows discounted using a rate based on the year end effective interest rate of 4.00% 
for Sterling-denominated instruments and 4.00% for Euro-denominated instruments (2009: 3.75% for Sterling-denominated instruments 
and 3.75% for Euro-denominated instruments). The fair values of the bank loans and overdrafts are assumed to equal their carrying value 
as these are recent arm’s length transactions, and are subject to floating rate interest rates determined by movements in LIBOR.
The finance leases held by the Group relate to leased assets including computer equipment and other various items of office equipment.

         £’000  £’000

The Phoenix provision related to future payments which one of the Group companies, Fondsdepot Bank GmbH, may have had to make 
to the Entschädigungseinrichtung der Wertpapierhandelsunternehmen (EdW), a federal special fund aimed at protecting investors, as a 
result of a securities fraud committed by one of the EdW member companies. As Fondsdepot Bank GmbH has subsequently left the EdW 
following 	 it 	 obtaining 	 a 	 full 	 banking 	 licence 	 in 	 January 	 2010, 	 the 	 Phoenix 	 pr ovision 	 is 	 no 	 longer 	 r equir ed, 	 and 	 has 	 been 	 r eleased 	 in 	 full.
Included in the onerous leases and contracts provision are onerous leases relating to dilapidations and shortfalls between expected sub-
letting rents and future costs on a number of operating leases. These provisions were largely acquired by the Xchanging Group as part of 
the acquisition of Cambridge Solutions Limited and mostly arises within the Americas region. The onerous leases provided for have between 
one and six years left to run. Estimates have been made of the costs expected to be incurred in relation to onerous leases and the likelihood 
of income to be received from subtenants. Also included in the onerous leases and contracts provision is an onerous contract provision in 
the workers’ compensation business of £2,374,000. Estimates have been made of the future losses expected to be incurred with respect  
to this contract.
The restructuring provision recognised at the end of 31 December 2009 related to an estimate of the cost of the lean processor strategy 
restructuring of the Xchanging Group announced in 2009.The restructuring plans have now been completed and the remaining provision 
at 31 December 2010 reflects the expected cash outflows in 2011 remaining against those plans. An additional restructuring provision  
was acquired by the Xchanging Group as part of the Kedrios S.p.A. acquisition intended to be used as noted in note 31(d).
The operational risk provision comprises an estimated liability in respect of identified operating errors which had occurred in the ordinary 
course of business in the Continental Europe region up to 31 December 2010. This is an ongoing provision representative of the nature  
of the securities processing market.
The litigation provision relates to a number of ongoing claims arising primarily within the US BPO business. The utilisation of the litigation 
provision is dependent on the timing of the settlement of the underlying cases. The settlement is, to an extent, outside the Group’s control 
and there is therefore an element of uncertainty regarding the timing of the provision’s utilisation. Estimates have been made of the 
expected cash outflows in relation to future and current litigation.
The employee related provision primarily includes early and part-time retirement provisions as well as long service provisions. For long 
service awards, the awards take the form of either a payment or paid leave and has been based on actuarial valuations which are updated 
at each reporting date. The gratuity provisions as well as the early and part-time retirement provision both have an element of uncertainty 
surrounding the amount and timing of utilisation of these provisions and are all based on best estimates. 
The other provisions include provisions for profit sharing, retention bonuses, provisions for archiving required under banking regulations  
as well as technology and communications.

25 Share-based payment plans
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans as follows:
(i) Share options
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price at the date of grant. The contractual life of an option is 10 years. Awards are granted to 
Directors and employees on a merit basis, and are subject to continuous employment. Options granted become exercisable on the third 
anniversary of the date of grant, and are valued using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation  
to repurchase or settle the options in cash. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows:
General assumptions 
Vesting period (years)        3
Option life (years)        10
Expected life (years)        3.25
Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield (%)       1
Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting (%)       20
Risk-free interest rate (%)        3.62
        Year of grant   Year of grant 
       2010  2009
Weighted average share price at grant date (pence)     –	 	 198.00
Weighted average exercise price (pence) 
– approved options      –  190.00
– unapproved options      –  190.00
Weighted average fair value of options granted in the period (pence)
– approved options      –  52.00
– unapproved options      –  52.00
Expected volatility (%)      –  34
There were no grants of options over Approved, Unapproved or G shares during 2010.
The expected volatility is based on Xchanging’s historical volatility. The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.  
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life. 
The weighted average share price during the year for options exercised during the year was £2.03 per share (2009: £2.07). The total 
income statement impact for the year relating to employee share-based payments under the share option plans was a credit of £175,000 
(2009: charge £476,000), all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.  110

(ii) Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Awards have been granted under the Performance Share Plan to Executive Directors and certain members of Xchanging’s management 
group. Under the terms of the scheme, conditional awards of shares are granted, which will vest at the end of the three year performance 
period. Both basic and stretch awards have been granted, the proportion of each award that will vest is dependent on the performance of 
the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) as compared with the performance of its comparator group (defined as the constituents of the 
FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts) and on the attainment of an EPS growth underpin. 25% of the basic awards will vest if TSR is at 
a median position and 100% if TSR is in the upper quartile. In between these positions, the basic award will vest on a straight-line basis. The 
stretch award will also vest on a straight-line basis, with 0% vesting if TSR is at an upper quartile position, up to 100% if TSR is in the top 
decile. The EPS underpin is the UK RPI plus 3%. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the awards in cash.
Awards are granted to Directors and employees on a merit basis, and are subject to continuous employment over the length of the vesting 
period, or at the discretion of the Group if determined to be a ‘good leaver’ upon leaving. Awards granted vest three years from the date  
of the award and are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation model used for valuing PSP awards with  
a TSR performance condition requires additional assumptions. A single co-efficient assumption of 21% (2009: April award 22%, September 
award 26%) (based on historical analysis) has been used in the current year, representing the level of correlation of growth in TSR between 
the comparator companies simulated in the model. The three year historical volatility for each company in the comparator group at grant 
date has been analysed and this historical volatility has been used in the model to project TSR for each company. As limited historical 
volatility exists for Xchanging, the expected volatility for the Group is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies over the 
previous three years. The fair value per award granted and the assumptions used as inputs into the model are as follows:

(iii) Share Purchase Plan 2007 (SPP)
The Group adopted the SPP during 2007, in which Executive Directors and certain members of senior management were invited to 
participate. Under this scheme, set up in February 2007, an employee benefit trust loaned money to the participants in order to allow them 
to purchase class F shares in Xchanging BV at the market value at the time of £5.30 (Xchanging plc equivalent value £1.33). These loans are 
non-interest bearing and the terms and conditions are described further in note 34. Participants may not normally sell, transfer or otherwise

pro-rata proportion of any loan from the employee benefit trust is repaid. As the shares were granted at the fair market value at the time 
there is no share-based payment charge as a result of this scheme. 
(iv) Share Awards
During the year Xchanging share awards were granted to the new Chief Financial Officer who was appointed in October 2010.  
150,000 ordinary shares will vest in October 2011 and 150,000 ordinary shares will vest in October 2012. These awards are subject  
to the continuous employment within the Group up to October 2012.
26 Shareholders’ equity
Share capital
The balance classed as share capital is the nominal proceeds on issue of the Company’s equity share capital, comprising 5p ordinary shares.
Share premium
The amount paid to the Company by shareholders over and above the nominal value of the shares issued to them, less the direct costs  
of issuing the shares, is classified as share premium.
Merger reserve and reverse acquisition reserve
The merger and reverse acquisition reserves arise as a result of the share for share exchange undertaken in advance of the initial public 
offering. The merger reserve comprises the excess of the market value of the Xchanging plc shares issued to the Xchanging BV shareholders 
over 	 the 	 nominal 	 value 	 of 	 those 	 shar es 	 and 	 arises 	 as 	 a 	 r esult 	 of 	 the 	 application 	 of 	 merger 	 r elief 	 under 	 Section 	 131 	 of 	 the 	 Companies 	 Act 	 1985.	
The reverse acquisition reserve consists of the difference between the market value of the Xchanging plc shares issued to the Xchanging BV 
shareholders and the total share capital and share premium of the Xchanging BV shares.
Other reserves
Composition of the other reserves is described in note 27. 
Retained earnings
These represent the accumulation of the Group’s net profits retained within the business, after the payment of any dividends.
Non-controlling interests
These represent the non-controlling interests’ share in the assets and liabilities of both the Enterprise Partnerships and of Cambridge

Non-controlling interest calculations for the Group’s Enterprise Partnerships are dependent upon the individual contractual terms. Some 
define adjustments in relation to certain items prior to calculating profit share based on the percentage share ownerships. These may 
include, for example, adjustments for differences between local and international accounting standards, adjustments for any discounts  
or fees payable between parties or adjustments for share-based payment charges for employees. 114

31 Business combinations
(a) FondsServiceBank
On 13 May 2009, the Group entered into an agreement with DAB bank AG to acquire the trade and assets of their FondsServiceBank (FSB) 
business unit, an investment funds administration business. As a result of this agreement, on 3 April 2010, Xchanging migrated all contracts 
with distribution partners and customers relating to the safekeeping and administration of investment fund shares. This transaction 
meets the definition of a business combination under the principles of IFRS 3 (revised), “Business Combinations” and has therefore been 
accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, in accordance with IFRS 3 (revised).
The total cash paid in consideration for the acquisition was €21.6 million (£19.1 million based on the exchange rate prevailing on the date 
of acquisition), of which €9.95 million was paid in 2009.
The contracts migrated from DAB bank AG were subsumed onto the existing Fondsdepot Bank (FDB) investment account processing 
platform from 3 April 2010. This is consistent with the Group’s strategy to grow existing platforms and derive benefits from economies 
of scale, with overall performance being measured at the combined FDB business unit level. Consequently, revenues and profits or losses 
earned from investment account processing services in relation to the FSB contracts are not separately identifiable from the pre-existing FDB 
contracts. Therefore, it is impracticable to disclose the revenue and profit or loss in relation to FSB since the acquisition date included in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the period ended 31 December 2010 or for the current reporting period as though 
the 	 acquisition 	 date 	 had 	 been 	 on 	 1 	 January 	 2010. 116

share capital of SEB Investmentservice (SEB ISG), a B2B investment accounts business. This transaction completed with effect from  
12 March 2010. The results of SEB ISG have been consolidated by the Group from 1 March 2010 and has been renamed Xchanging 
Investmentservice GmbH.
The total consideration paid for the acquisition was €0.2 million (£0.2 million at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of control  
being assumed). €25,000 was paid on completion, with the remaining consideration payable over the period to 31 December 2010.

The adjustment to trade and other payables and trade and other receivables relates to the recognition of £465,000 deferred income as a 
result of bringing Data Integration’s accounting policies in line with the Xchanging Group policies. The adjustment to deferred tax liabilities 
relate to the valuation adjustments for intangible assets and is provisional, based on management’s best estimates.
Goodwill on acquisition represents the value of both sales and cost synergies expected to arise from combining and integrating DI’s

The fair value adjustments in respect of intangible assets are due to the impairment of £677,000 of software assets deemed to have 
no future economic benefits at date of acquisition. The adjustment to deferred tax assets relate to the write off of a deferred tax asset 
recognised under Italian GAAP which would not meet the criteria for recognition under IFRS due to uncertainty over future taxable profits. 
The adjustment to the pension liability is as a result of bringing Kedrios’ accounting policies in line with the Xchanging Group policies and 
IAS 19. The adjustment to provisions relates to the recognition of a restructuring plan provision under IFRS. This plan was announced in 
January 	 2010 	 and 	 was 	 being 	 implemented 	 prior 	 to 	 the 	 acquisition. 	 Management 	 will 	 continue 	 to 	 implement 	 the 	 plan 	 as 	 originally 	 intended

32 Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates a number of pension plans for its qualifying employees. The principal plans are three defined benefit schemes in the 
UK, four defined benefit schemes in Germany and one long-service obligation in Italy, which are presented together under the heading 
‘Continental Europe’. In the UK, the defined benefit schemes are funded and assets are held in separate trustee administered funds. In 
Continental Europe, only the largest scheme (the XTB Scheme) has assets held in a separate Contractual Trust Agreement (CTA). The 
remaining schemes do not have assets in a CTA and as a result, pension liabilities are fully recognised on the balance sheet as a retirement 
benefit obligation with pension assets being integrated with the business assets. The Group also participates in a number of multi-employer 
defined benefit schemes and operates a number of defined contribution schemes. 
(i) Defined benefit schemes
The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit plans in the UK and Continental Europe which are accounted for as defined 
benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19. The valuations used for the IAS 19 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuations 
undertaken by independent qualified actuaries and updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the funding 
position of the plans at 31 December each year. Plan assets are shown at the market value at 31 December each year.
Financial assumptions
The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the 
schemes, may not necessarily be borne out in practice. These assumptions are as follows:
       2010  2009

Expected return on plan assets     5.74-5.96 5.00	 6.14-6.58	 5.00
Following 	 a 	 gover nment 	 announcement 	 in 	 July 	 2010, 	 some 	 of 	 the 	 UK 	 schemes’ 	 benefits 	 ar e 	 linked 	 to 	 CPI 	 rather 	 than 	 RPI. 	 A 	 CPI 	 assumption 	
equivalent to RPI less 0.5% has been adopted as at 31 December 2010. This change has been allowed for in the financial statements as a 
change in the actuarial assumptions in the statement of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). The liabilities in the UK schemes have been 
reduced by £1,505 000 as a result of the change.
To develop the assumption around the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the Group considered the current level of expected 
returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes 
in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was 
then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the portfolio.  120

The post-retirement mortality tables used for the schemes are based on country specific mortality tables, namely the PA 00 series for the 
Rebus and XDBS schemes in the UK (based on year of birth with a scaling factor of 110%, allowance for medium cohort improvements 
and a 0.5% underpin to future improvements in mortality), the SAPS Light table for the LPC Scheme in the UK (rated up by one year and 
based on year of birth with an allowance for medium cohort improvements and a 0.5% underpin to future improvements in mortality), 
the Richtaffeln 2005 G, Heubeck-Richtaffeln GmbH, Koln 2005 table in Germany and the ISAT2002M&F table in Italy. The table below 
illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for current pensioners and future pensioners aged 45 for the UK schemes at the

It is expected that the contributions to the schemes during 2011 will be £3,995,000 for the UK schemes (of which £1,572,000 is funded 
from UK Enterprise Partnerships) and £4,063,000 for the Continental Europe schemes (all of which is funded from the Continental Europe 
Enterprise Partnerships).
(ii) BAE Systems defined benefit schemes
The Group also participates in a number of multi-employer defined benefit schemes run for the employees of BAE Systems.
The terms on which the Group participates in these schemes were set in commercial agreements reached with BAE Systems during 2006. 
Under the terms of these agreements, the contributions payable by the Group represent the cost of accrual of future service benefits and 
the Group’s share of the deficit contributions made by BAE Systems to the schemes only (not including any one-off contributions made by 
BAE Systems during 2006). The contributions are expressed as fixed percentages of pensionable payroll. The Group’s contribution rates to 
the schemes are contractually fixed and will only be affected by changes to the cost of accrual of future service benefits, as determined at 
the triennial valuations of the schemes. The Group’s contribution rates are not affected by any future changes in the past service position  
of the schemes, relating to past service of its own employees or other members of the scheme. 
It is not possible to identify the Group’s share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the schemes on a consistent and reasonable basis. 
Accordingly, the Group accounts for contributions to the schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes under IAS 19.
The 	 pension 	 cost 	 that 	 was 	 charged 	 in 	 the 	 income 	 statement 	 r elating 	 to 	 curr ent 	 year 	 contributions 	 was 	 £583,000 	 (2009: 	 £1,060,000).

33 Financial instruments
Financial risk management
The Group’s financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables and trade 
payables that arise directly from its operations. The Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring that financial and non-financial risks arising 
from financial instruments are monitored and managed within acceptable and known parameters. The Group’s treasury function acts as a 
service centre and all treasury activity takes place within a formal control framework under policies approved by the Board. Compliance with 
these policies and guidelines is monitored through regular reporting of treasury activities.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group may enter into derivative transactions to mitigate the exposure to these risks. It is the Group’s policy that no speculative 
transactions in financial instruments be undertaken.

Fair value estimations
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
•	 Quoted 	 prices 	 (unadjusted) 	 in 	 active 	 markets 	 for 	 identical 	 assets 	 or 	 liabilities 	 (level 	 1).
•	 	 Inputs 	 other 	 than 	 quoted 	 prices 	 included 	 within 	 level 	 1 	 that 	 ar e 	 observable 	 for 	 the 	 asset 	 or 	 liability , 	 either 	 dir ectly 	 (that 	 is, 	 as 	 prices)	 
or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2).
•	 Inputs 	 for 	 the 	 asset 	 or 	 liability 	 that 	 ar e 	 not 	 based 	 on 	 observable 	 market 	 data 	 (that 	 is, 	 unobservable 	 inputs) 	 (level 	 3).

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is 
regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or 
regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted 
market price used for financial assets held by the group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1. 
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation 
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all 
significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. If one or more of the significant 
inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
•	 Quoted 	 market 	 prices 	 or 	 dealer 	 quotes 	 for 	 similar 	 instruments.
•	 Other 	 techniques, 	 such 	 as 	 discounted 	 cash 	 flow 	 analysis, 	 ar e 	 used 	 to 	 determine 	 fair 	 value 	 for 	 the 	 r emaining 	 financial 	 instruments.

Credit facilities and liquidity management
The Group maintains committed credit facilities to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to maintain its ongoing operations. The Group’s 
principal 	 sour ces 	 of 	 debt 	 finance 	 ar e 	 a 	 £75,000,000 	 multi-curr ency 	 r evolving 	 cr edit 	 facility 	 and 	 a 	 $58,000,000 	 (£37,489,000) 	 term 	 loan 	 both 	
of which mature in October 2012. These committed facilities are subject to covenants, representations and warranties commonly associated 
with corporate bank debt.
As 	 at 	 31 	 December 	 2010, 	 $45,000,000 	 (£29,087,000) 	 (2009: 	 £nil) 	 had 	 been 	 drawn 	 as 	 cash 	 under 	 the 	 r evolving 	 cr edit 	 facility 	 and 	 a 	 further	
€20,000,000 (£17,131,000) (2009: € 20,000,000 	 (£18,000,000) 	 had 	 been 	 utilised 	 as 	 a 	 letter 	 of 	 cr edit 	 by 	 the 	 Gr oup.	
The Group makes regular repayments against the term loan and at the end of 2010 the balance outstanding was $34,000,000 
(£21,977,000) (2009: $50,000,000 (£31,400,000)). 
At 	 the 	 year 	 end 	 date 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 had 	 £28,800,000 	 (2009: 	 £57,000,000) 	 of 	 headr oom 	 under 	 its 	 committed 	 debt 	 facilities.	
The Group also has a £10,000,000 (2009: £10,000,000) uncommitted overdraft facility. 
In addition to these facilities there are bank loan and working capital facilities provided to Cambridge Solutions Limited in India. These 
include secured term loans of INR 71,250,000 (£1,011,000), bank overdrafts of INR 135,000,000 (£1,916,000), and an export credit facility 
of INR 220,000,000 (£3,122,000). The term loans, overdrafts and export credit facility are secured by way of a first pari passu charge on 
the current assets and moveable fixed assets of Cambridge Solutions Limited (the company), both present and future, and a corporate 
guarantee is provided by Xchanging (Mauritius) Limited. The term loans represent committed funding and are subject to scheduled 
repayments. The working capital facilities are uncommitted and renewed on an annual basis. 
The total amount outstanding under the Cambridge Solutions Limited bank loan and working capital facilities at the year end date was 
£5,115,000 (2009: £7,360,000). 
In France, Cambridge Solutions SARL makes use of a receivable purchase facility and € 186,000 	 (£159,000) 	 (2009: 	 € 220,000 	 (£198,000))

Liquidity risk
The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using a daily cash management process and through regular cash reporting. These 
processes consider the maturity of both the Group’s financial assets and liabilities and projected cash flows from operations. The Group’s 
policy is to ensure that all projected borrowing needs are covered by committed facilities, maintaining minimum funding headroom defined 
by the Board.
At 	 the 	 period 	 end 	 date 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 had 	 available 	 cash 	 of 	 £80.7 	 million 	 and 	 undrawn 	 committed 	 debt 	 facilities 	 of 	 £28.8 	 million

Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. 
The Group has a concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the nature and structure of the Enterprise Partnerships. 
An analysis of all debts which are past due is included in note 17. Credit risk assessments are performed when signing up to a new 
Enterprise Partnership and for new customers. Credit risk is mitigated to an extent by the profile of companies with whom the Group has 
entered into Enterprise Partnerships, being blue chip companies. Receivable purchase facilities are considered for specific operations where 
credit risk is considered higher.
The Group’s treasury function only transacts with counterparties that have a strong investment grade rating from a credit rating agency.  
It also ensures that no exposure to any one institution at any given time exceeds the Board approved exposure limit. 128

Interest rate risk
The Group reviews its interest rate exposure against acceptable risk profiles on a periodic basis. Currently all financial liabilities are subject  
to floating rate interest. 
The Group holds a Euro denominated financial asset which carries a fixed coupon. 
Working capital is generally held in variable rate operational accounts, with surplus cash placed on fixed rate short-term deposits.
The Group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated impact on the income statement and equity of a reasonably 
possible change in market interest rates for each class of financial instruments, with all other variables held constant. The sensitivity analysis 
is based on the following assumptions:
•	 changes 	 in 	 market 	 inter est 	 rates 	 af fect 	 inter est 	 income 	 or 	 expense 	 of 	 variable 	 inter est 	 financial 	 instruments
•	 	 changes 	 in 	 market 	 inter est 	 rates 	 only 	 af fect 	 inter est 	 income 	 or 	 expense 	 in 	 r elation 	 to 	 financial 	 instruments 	 with 	 fixed 	 inter est 	 rates 	 if 	 these 	
are recognised at their fair value.

interest rate to which it is exposed, with all other variables held constant:

Foreign exchange risk
The international nature of the Group’s operations expose the Group to a number of foreign currencies. The Group does not hedge foreign 
currency profit and loss translation exposures and the reported results may therefore be affected by currency fluctuations.
The Group is subject to foreign exchange transaction exposure in its Indian operations where revenues are generated in Sterling, US Dollars 
and Euros and the cost base is primarily in Indian Rupees. Under the Group’s foreign exchange risk management policy exposures may 
be hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts when the underlying cash flows are deemed certain. Typically the Group will look to 
hedge revenue to protect operating cash flow and to support the planning cycle. No foreign exchange derivatives were outstanding at the 
period end date but subsequently £3,600,000 of Sterling revenue and $2,750,000 of US Dollar revenue have been hedged against the 
Indian Rupee.
The Group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated impact on the income statement and equity of a 
reasonably possible change in foreign currency exchange rates for each class of financial instruments, with all other variables held constant. 
The sensitivity analysis is based on material non-functional currency financial instruments within each entity within the Group.
With a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all material currencies (Euro, US Dollar, Indian Rupee and Australian Dollar), 
pr ofit 	 befor e 	 tax 	 would 	 have 	 decr eased 	 by 	 appr oximately 	 £1,800,000 	 (2009: 	 £3,800,000) 	 or 	 incr eased 	 by 	 £2,200,000 	 (2009: 	 £4,700,000) 	
respectively, and equity would have decreased by approximately £2,632,000 (2009: £3,100,000) or increased by £3,217,000  
(2009: 	 £3,800,000) 	 r espectively .

Market risk and price risk
The Group holds listed investments, classified as available-for-sale financial assets, which expose the Group to equity securities price risk. 
These investments are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure their suitability according to the Group’s risk profile.
A 	 5% 	 incr ease 	 or 	 decr ease 	 in 	 the 	 market 	 value 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 investments 	 would 	 have 	 a 	 £1,228,000 	 impact 	 on 	 equity 	 (2009: 	 £1,285,000)	
and no impact on the income statement.
Capital risk management
The Group manages capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern whilst operating within the leverage constraints  
of its debt facilities.
The table below presents quantitative data for the components the Group manages as capital:

In order to maintain the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders 
and manage the Group’s assets to ensure an appropriate debt profile is maintained.
The Group seeks to maintain a strong credit profile to aid its ability to partner in business and will aim not to exceed net debt of 2.0 times 
Xchanging’s share of consolidated profit before depreciation and amortisation where net debt is defined as all financial indebtedness less 
cash. 	 The 	 Gr oup’ s 	 net 	 cash 	 position 	 at 	 year 	 end 	 was 	 £23.1 	 million 	 (2009: 	 £20.8 	 million).
Xchanging operates in a number of regulatory regimes. The securities processing and retail investment account management businesses in 
Germany, Xchanging Transaction Bank (XTB) and Fondsdepot Bank, maintain banking licences and are regulated under the German Federal 
Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). Components of the insurance businesses are regulated in the UK by the Financial Services Authority 
(FSA). The Group has complied with all the BaFin and FSA regulations during 2010.

During 2007, prior to the IPO, loans were provided by the Xchanging BV Employee Benefit Trust to a number of employees including 
Directors and key management personnel to enable them to purchase shares in Xchanging BV (these shares have been subsequently 
exchanged for shares in Xchanging plc). The loans are non-interest bearing and become repayable on the earlier of the cessation of 
employment, transfer or disposal of the shares, acceptance of another loan from the Group to refinance the shares and 31 December 2011.
Richard Houghton is required to repay his loan on or before 31 March 2012. A mortgage has been taken over his shares to secure this loan

Independent auditors’ report 
To the members of Xchanging plc on the parent company financial statements
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Xchanging plc for the year ended 31 December 2010 which comprise the 
Company balance sheet, the Company cash flow statement, reconciliation of operating loss to net cash inflow/(outflow) from operating 
activities, analysis of net funds and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 45, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Standards Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with chapter 3 of 
part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
•	 give 	 a 	 true 	 and 	 fair 	 view 	 of 	 the 	 state 	 of 	 the 	 Company’ s 	 af fairs 	 as 	 at 	 31 	 December 	 2010 	 and 	 of 	 its 	 cash 	 flows 	 for 	 the 	 year 	 then 	 ended;

•	 have 	 been 	 pr epar ed 	 in 	 accor dance 	 with 	 the 	 r equir ements 	 of 	 the 	 Companies 	 Act 	 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•	 the 	 part 	 of 	 the 	 r emuneration 	 r eport 	 to 	 be 	 audited 	 has 	 been 	 pr operly 	 pr epar ed 	 in 	 accor dance 	 with 	 the 	 Companies 	 Act 	 2006; 	 and
• 	 	 t h e 	 i n f o r m a t i o n 	 g i v e n 	 i n 	 t h e 	 D i r e c t o r s ’ 	 r e p o r t 	 f o r 	 t h e 	 fi n a n c i a l 	 y e a r 	 f o r 	 w h i c h 	 t h e 	 p a r e n t 	 c o m p a n y 	 fi n a n c i a l 	 s t a t e m e n t s 	 a r e 	 p r e p a r e d	 
is consistent with the parent company financial statements.

Notes to the Company financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2010
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and 
applicable Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom. A summary of the more important Company accounting policies, which have 
been applied consistently, is set out below.
No 	 pr ofit 	 and 	 loss 	 account 	 has 	 been 	 pr esented 	 by 	 the 	 Company 	 as 	 permitted 	 by 	 Section 	 408 	 of 	 the 	 Companies 	 Act 	 2006. 	 The 	 Company 	
has also taken advantage of the exemption available to parent companies under paragraph 2D(b) of FRS 29, “Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures” not to provide the information otherwise required by the standard, as the Group’s consolidated financial statements,  
in which the Company is included, provides equivalent disclosures under IFRS 7, “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”.
(i) Basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention modified for the fair values of share-based 
payments and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. 
(ii) Going concern
The Directors believe that preparing the financial statements on the going concern basis is appropriate based on projections for the 
foreseeable future.
(iii) Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. Impairment reviews are conducted at the end of the first full 
year following acquisition and thereafter where indicators of impairment are present. As permitted by the Companies Act 2006, cost is  
the aggregate of the nominal value of the relevant number of the Company’s shares and the fair value of any other consideration given  
to acquire the share capital of the subsidiary undertakings.
(iv) Financial instruments
The accounting policy for the Company for financial instruments is the same as that shown in the Group accounting policies. This policy  
is in accordance with FRS 26, “Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement”.
(v) Dividend income
Dividends receivable from the Company’s investments in subsidiary undertakings are recognised when the Company’s right to receive 
payment is established.
(vi) Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of an equity-settled transaction is recognised as an expense over the periods in which the performance conditions 
are fulfilled, ending on the vesting date of the award. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference 
to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Non-market vesting conditions are reflected in assumptions about the number of 
options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected 
to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment 
to equity. Awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market 
condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied. 
Equity-settled share-based compensation plans that are made available to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries are treated as increases 
in equity over the vesting period of the award, with a corresponding increase in the Company’s investments in subsidiaries, based on an 
estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised. 
(vii) Related party transactions

Disclosure of the Directors’ remuneration is contained in the remuneration report on pages 53 to 60 and in note 34 of the Group  
financial statements.
3 Auditors’ remuneration
The audit fees payable in relation to the audit of the financial statements of the Company are £129,000 (2009: £109,000). Fees paid  
to the auditors and their associates for non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the individual financial statements  
of the Company because Group financial statements are prepared which disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.

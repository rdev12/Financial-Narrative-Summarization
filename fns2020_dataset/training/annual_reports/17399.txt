Introduction
Performance
I am pleased to report that the Group 
delivered another year of good results  
in worldwide markets which continue to 
be challenging. The increasing diversity, 
breadth and depth of our geographic  
and sector reach continue to provide  
the Group with resilience and we are 
beginning to see growth opportunities 
return in the UK and internationally. It is 
our combination of technical excellence 
and outstanding regional and segmental 
capabilities that enable us to continue  
to deliver these results. 
We have also made good progress 
towards achieving our strategic priorities. 
We have continued the work to optimise 
our portfolio and during the year we 
reached agreement to sell our UK 
highways services business which will 
enable us to focus on higher growth, 
higher margin activities. 
People
Over the past 75 years our success has 
been due to the expertise, quality, hard 
work and dedication of our people.  
We have a technical heritage dating  
back to 1938 with deep rooted values  
that drive every aspect of our business: 
outstanding people; placing our clients  
at the centre of everything we do; 
working together; being innovative  
and delivering winning performance.  
As we celebrate our anniversary year,  
I would like to thank our people, past  
and present, for making Atkins what it  
is today. In particular, I would like to look 
back at last summer’s hugely successful 
London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
Games. The Games were the culmination 
of seven years’ work from Atkins 
colleagues. I commend them for playing 
their part in delivering a Games to be 
proud of and for inspiring the next 
generation of engineers as the world 
looked on in appreciation of the design 
and engineering work that was necessary 
to stage this event. I look forward to the 
next chapter in our history as we continue 
to influence, design, engineer and manage 
projects that are creating the future. 
Board of directors
As chairman of the Board, I am responsible 
for ensuring its effective management  
and processes. I have set out my 
commitment to excellence in governance 
in the Corporate Governance Report 
(pages 64 to 75). An important aspect of 
this governance is an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Board. During the year 
we carried out an external, independent 
review that, while recognising the progress 
we have made, also identified a number  
of opportunities for the Board to increase 
its effectiveness. We have created  
a detailed action plan which will be 
implemented throughout the coming year.
Last year, Dr Raj Rajagopal took over as 
chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
when Sir Peter Williams retired from the 
Board. I would like to thank him for his 
first full year in his new role.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 22.0p per ordinary share in 
respect of the year ended 31 March 2013, 
making the total dividend for the year 
32.0p (2012: 30.5p), an increase of  
4.9%. If approved at the Company’s 
annual general meeting, the dividend  
will be paid on 23 August 2013 to 
ordinary shareholders on the register  
on 19 July 2013. Further details regarding 
dividend payments can be found in 
Investor Information (page 164).
Outlook
The Group has maintained its resilience to 
challenging markets worldwide through 
the breadth and depth of its geographic 
and sector reach. This is reflected in the 
results we have reported for the year 
ended 31 March 2013. While we will 
continue to face challenges in some of  
our markets and sectors due to ongoing 
uncertain economic conditions and 
increased competition, we have made 
good progress towards our strategic 
priorities and expect this positive 
momentum to continue in the year ahead.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Introduction
Business position
I am pleased to report that the year  
to 31 March 2013 was another good year. 
While future market conditions remain 
uncertain, we are building positive 
momentum and are starting to see  
growth opportunities return. 
Our underlying profit before tax was 
£104.5m, an increase of 2.9% over last 
year’s profit of £101.6m, on turnover  
that was broadly unchanged at £1.7bn. 
We believe underlying profit is a more 
representative measure of performance, 
removing the items that may give a 
distorted view of performance. In the 
current year we have removed profits  
on disposals and costs associated with 
disposals of £4.5m (2012: £7.2m), 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
of £10.0m (2012: £4.2m), including the 
write down of intangible assets in our 
Peter Brown business in North America, 
together with one-off pension gains of 
£4.3m (2012: £30.9m) arising as we 
continue to actively manage our pension 
liabilities. The unadjusted reported profit 
before tax was £103.3m (2012: £135.5m).
The Group’s profit after tax for the year of 
£88.4m (2012: £106.8m) is shown in the 
Consolidated Income Statement (page 100).
Headcount grew steadily over the year 
closing at 17,899, a 2.7% increase on last 
year’s closing position.
The UK region had a good year, achieving 
our strategy to sell the UK highways 
services business, the completion of which 
is expected in the summer, allowing us  
to focus on higher margin businesses.  
We have achieved positive momentum 
across all our UK businesses, resulting  
in headcount growth in continuing 
operations. Workload in the rail business 
has strengthened and utilisation is much 
improved and our water business is 
performing well through the Asset 
Management Plan (AMP) cycle.
L Joe Boyer became CEO, North America 
in April to lead this business to growth. 
While this region’s consultancy business 
continues to experience soft market 
conditions, the highways and 
transportation business is operating  
well. Our Peter Brown construction 
management at risk business, which 
reported a loss in the year of £6.5m,  
has been focusing on closing out legacy 
contracts and building a pipeline of  
new business.
In the Middle East, protracted negotiations 
on contract variations and delays in 
contract awards had an impact on our 
financial performance and have suppressed 
headcount growth. Notwithstanding this, 
we see significant project opportunities in 
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the year ahead.
Our Asia Pacific and Europe businesses 
have continued to trade well, increasing 
the diversity of their client and skills base. 
In particular, the industrial client base of 
Faithful+Gould is providing balance and 
good growth opportunities. Asia Pacific 
remains a key area for investment for us 
and we aim to deliver focused growth  
in this region. In Europe, our largest 
operations are in Scandinavia which is  
a stable, well funded market in which  
we have performed well.
We delivered good organic growth in  
our Energy business where we are well 
positioned in the growth markets of  
oil and gas and nuclear. We have 
strengthened our service offering by 
continuing to team up and partner with 
companies offering complementary skills. 
We will continue to invest in this business 
to grow organically and through targeted 
acquisitions.
Priorities
Our commitment to safety in our 
workplace and on all of our project sites 
remains a priority. Over the past year we 
have maintained a positive safety culture 
through our worldwide Safe by Choice 
programme and our senior leadership 
teams received behavioural safety 
coaching to help us maintain a ‘natural’ 
state of safety consciousness within the 
Group. We have achieved a 17% increase 
in near miss reporting which demonstrates 
a more proactive approach to safety 
management. We were recognised by  
the Royal Society for the Prevention of 
Accidents (RoSPA) with the achievement  
of a Gold Award for Occupational Safety 
and a Diamond Jubilee Award in 
conjunction with the Olympic Delivery 
Authority for outstanding health and 
safety on the London 2012 Games project.
As a consultancy, we rely on our team of 
dedicated people throughout the world, 
who carry out their work quietly and 
brilliantly, whether they are client facing  
or in a functional support team. We trust 
our people to go beyond what is required 
and our clients trust them to excel. We  
are committed to ensuring that we are 
developing our people so that they can 
deliver the best solutions for clients as  
well as achieving fulfilling careers.
Our strategy remains clear: to drive 
shareholder value by focusing on growth, 
selectively increasing our geographic 
footprint through targeted international 
expansion while continuing to deliver 
improved financial performance in all  
our markets and geographies.
In the medium term, our goal remains  
to generate a margin above 8% across  
all of our businesses and regions. 
We will grow organically and through 
bolt-on acquisitions that add new skills  
or a regional presence.
Conclusion
These results could not have been 
achieved without the dedication of our 
people and the continued support of our 
clients. We are proud of our teamwork 
among colleagues and with our clients  
and stakeholders. I would like to thank  
all our stakeholders for their continued 
commitment to Atkins.
We have delivered another year of good 
results and made notable progress 
towards the implementation of our 
strategy over the past 12 months. We have 
continued to optimise our portfolio with 
the agreed sale of our UK highways 
services business and sustained positive 
momentum in our UK, Asia Pacific and 
Europe and Energy businesses. We remain 
focused on driving operational excellence 
throughout the Group to improve margins, 
optimise our portfolio and meet the 
evolving needs of our clients. Our strategy 
is clear and unchanged. I am confident  
we will achieve further underlying growth 
in the year ahead.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Profitable growth, shareholder value.
>
Our Strategy
We aim to be  
the world’s best 
infrastructure 
consultancy.
We define infrastructure as  
the systems that are vital for  
any nation or community’s 
productivity and development, 
including transportation, utilities, 
water, energy, large-scale built 
environments and information 
communications and defence 
and security systems. 
Our vision What we do
Plan
We plan every aspect of our clients’ projects, from cost 
and risk planning, feasibility studies and logistics to impact 
assessments and stakeholder engagement activity.
Design
Atkins designs intellectual capital such as management 
systems and business processes. We also design physical 
structures such as office towers, educational and medical 
facilities, transportation infrastructure and advanced 
technology systems such as biometric scanners and 
superfast broadband networks.
 E n abl e 
Our clients trust us with the management of projects, 
people and issues, relying on us to see that deadlines  
are met, costs are controlled and success is achieved.  Introduction 11
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Introduction
Our overall objective for 
shareholder value is simple:  
to generate a margin above 8% 
across all of our businesses and 
regions over the medium term.
Our strategy is to focus on 
growth and, selectively, to 
increase our geographic 
footprint through targeted 
international expansion, while 
continuing to deliver improved 
financial performance in all  
our markets and geographies. 
To deliver this we will continue 
to pursue vigorously operational 
excellence, portfolio optimisation 
and targeted sector, as well  
as regional, expansion.
Our strategy Our priorities
 1 . Operational excellence
We are driving operational performance across the Group. Our operational excellence 
programme is focused on improving operating margins and cash flow through, for 
example, increased staff utilisation and more efficient and effective billing and cash 
collection processes.
 2. Portfolio optimisation
We continue to focus the Group on higher growth, higher margin activities. Following 
the sale of our UK asset management business in 2011 we have signed an agreement 
to sell our UK highways services business and have completed the disposal of our 
non-controlling interest in RMPA Holdings Limited.
 3. Sector and regional focus
A number of our existing sectors and regions have attractive growth prospects. Those 
on which we place a particular focus evolve over time, but currently Energy remains  
a key area for investment, along with aerospace and defence and security. We have 
added regional focus to our strategy as we seek to expand our market facing offering 
in geographic areas where we already have a presence, for example in Asia Pacific.  
We will redirect and leverage resources and technical capabilities to address these 
areas. Acquisitions will be considered to supplement organic growth as we look to 
balance our client and sector mix. 12 Introduction
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Our Strategy
continued
Sector and regional focus
Energy
Our Energy business is an international provider of high end design 
and engineering for the oil and gas, nuclear and power sectors.
At Atkins we have been involved in the energy sector for four 
decades. We deliver unique engineering solutions to our clients 
which draws on this experience, blended with state of the art 
analysis and design techniques.
Aerospace
Aerospace is a technically dynamic, international sector. 
Environmental sustainability, ageing fleets, air traffic growth and 
safety are all challenges driving the sector to push the boundaries 
of aerospace engineering.
Atkins has been delivering high quality aerospace engineering 
solutions for over 15 years. We offer broad capability, extensive 
experience and technical excellence to clients that shape the 
aerospace industry.
Defence  
and Security
Atkins is a major supplier of services to the defence and security 
sector. We have a strong track record of delivering complex 
transformation programmes of national significance to defence  
and security clients.
Our consultancy services incorporate all aspects from 
masterplanning and concept design to defence and security 
strategies, full design capability and implementation support  
and assurance. 
Asia Pacific
We provide engineering, planning, urban design, architectural 
services and rail design in the Asia Pacific region.
Atkins’ experience in Hong Kong dates back to 1973. Today  
we have offices located across Hong Kong, China, Singapore, 
Malaysia, India and Australia.   Introduction 13
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Introduction
Segment position
A combination of our technical 
excellence and outstanding 
regional and segmental 
capabilities enables us to 
continue to deliver good  
results despite the challenging 
economic environment in  
a number of our markets.
UK 
As the market leader in the UK we expect 
to continue to make progress. The market 
remains relatively subdued but our 
capabilities in a number of areas and the 
pre-emptive positioning of our businesses 
to address ongoing market challenges 
should allow modest growth in the 
coming years.
North America 
In North America, there appear to be 
limited near term catalysts for market 
improvement. Our new leadership in  
the region should allow us to approach 
the current market issues with renewed 
vigour as we lay the foundations for 
longer term growth.
Middle East 
The Middle East offers significant project 
opportunities with our primary focus  
on areas of high essential infrastructure 
spend, mainly in the United Arab Emirates, 
Qatar and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Asia Pacific  
and Europe 
The Asia Pacific region has been identified 
for further investment and will gain 
additional focus as we move forward.  
In Europe we continue to have a good 
position in Scandinavia. 
Energy
In our Energy business, the markets 
remain buoyant and we will continue  
to invest for growth – both organically 
and by selected acquisitions.
Future performance
We have a well managed 
organisation and the right 
leadership to deliver our 
growth strategy.
We will capitalise on  
growing organically and 
through targeted acquisitions 
to drive our Group’s future 
performance.
We aim to deliver on our 
strategic objectives by focusing 
on operational excellence, 
portfolio optimisation and 
targeted sector and regional 
expansion

Business Review
Overview of the business and performance in the year
Our business
Our core business is helping our clients to 
plan, design and enable capital programmes 
that resolve complex challenges in the 
built and natural environment. We are able 
to plan all aspects of our clients’ projects, 
conducting feasibility studies and impact 
analyses covering technical, logistical, 
legal, environmental and financial 
considerations. We design systems, 
infrastructures, processes, buildings and 
civil structures. We also enable our clients’ 
complex programmes by optimising 
procurement methods and managing 
supply chains on their behalf to reduce 
timescales, cost and risk.
Atkins’ structure of five business segments 
reflects how we manage the business  
in different geographies and markets. 
Details of activities and results by business 
segment are shown in the segmental 
performance section which follows.
Key performance indicators 
The Group uses a range of performance 
measures to monitor and manage the 
business. Those that are particularly 
important in monitoring our progress in 
generating shareholder value are considered 
key performance indicators (KPIs).
Our KPIs measure past performance and 
also provide information and context to 
anticipate future events and, in conjunction 
with our detailed knowledge and 
experience of the segments in which we 
operate, allow us to act early and manage 
the business going forward. We track 
volume, profitability, efficiency, secured 
workload and capacity.
Revenue, operating profit and margin, 
earnings per share (EPS) and operating 
cash flow provide indications as to the 
volume and quality of work we have done. 
They measure both profitability and the 
efficiency with which we have turned 
operating profits into cash.
Work in hand measures our secured 
workload as a percentage of the budgeted 
revenue for the next year. Staff numbers 
and staff turnover are measures of 
capacity and show us how effective we 
have been in recruiting and retaining our 
key resource. 
Safety in the workplace and on our project 
sites is paramount and forms part of our 
commitment to quality and reliability and, 
as such, we track the accident incident 
rates and near misses across the Group. 
This is explained more fully on page 51.
KPIs for the year ended 31 March 2013 
are shown on page 15, along with prior 
year comparatives.
Review of the year
As outlined in the Chief Executive Officer’s 
Statement and in more detail in the 
Financial Performance section of the 
Business Review (pages 36-39), this  
has been another good year in terms of 
Atkins’ financial performance. 
Turnover was flat at £1.7bn (2012: £1.7bn). 
Reported profit before tax was £103.3m 
(2012: £135.5m), with 2012 distorted  
by a large pension curtailment gain of 
£30.9m. A more representative measure  
is underlying profit before tax, which was 
£104.5m (2012: £101.6m). Underlying 
profit adds back amortisation and 
impairment of acquired intangible assets 
of £10.0m (2012: £4.2m), profits on 
disposals of £4.5m (2012: £7.2m), along 
with a pension curtailment gain in 2013  
of £4.3m (2012: £30.9m). 
Reported operating profit was £104.1m 
(2012: £137.2m), at a margin of 6.1% 
(2012: 8.0%). The year on year decrease 
in margin was primarily due to the impact 
of the one-off pension gains. This year 
there was a £4.3m pension curtailment 
gain, whereas in 2012 there was a gain  
of £30.9m, as a result of steps taken  
to actively manage our pension liabilities. 
There was also amortisation and 
impairment of acquired intangible assets 
this year of £10.0m (2012: £4.2m). 
Adjusting for the effect of these provides 
a better view of the Group’s performance, 
showing underlying operating profit of 
£109.8m (2012: £110.5m) and an 
underlying margin of 6.4% (2012: 6.5%).
The aforementioned profit on disposal  
of £4.5m is explained in more detail on 
page 130 and comprises the profit on  
sale of a number of businesses (£7.8m), 
including RMPA Holdings Limited and  
UK Specialist Hospitals Limited, with  
a further £0.5m deferred consideration 
received during the year in relation to  
the sale of the UK asset management 
business, which took place in the prior 
year, together with transaction and 
restructuring costs of £3.8m associated 
with the disposal of our UK highways 
services business, which is due to 
complete in the summer. 
At 31 March 2013 the net book value in 
respect of acquired intangible assets of 
the Peter Brown business in Atkins North 
America was fully written down, resulting 
in a total amortisation and impairment of 
intangible assets on acquisition of £10.0m 
(2012: £4.2m). 
Headcount was 17,899 at the end of 
March 2013 (2012: 17,420), 479 ahead  
of the same time last year as a result  
of underlying organic growth.
Underlying diluted EPS increased by  
7.7p per share to 86.7p (2012: 79.0p),  
an increase of 9.7%. 
The Group pension schemes have a net 
liability of £285.2m, an increase year  
on year of £34.1m. The fair value of  
plan assets has increased to £1,209.2m  
(2012: £1,078.7m) and the liabilities  
have increased to £1,494.4m (2012: 
£1,329.8m).
Operating cash flow in the year was 
£82.9m (2012: £68.6m), representing 
75.5% (2012: 62.1%) of underlying 
operating profit. The Group’s liquidity 
remains strong with closing net funds  
of £143.0m (2012: £122.6m).
As at 31 March 2013, the Group had 
secured 55% (2012: 56%) of budgeted 
revenue for the coming financial year,  
this excludes in both periods the future 
workload of the UK highways services 
business, the disposal of which is 
expected in the summer. 
Segmental analyses of revenue, operating 
profit, work in hand and staff numbers 
follow. Staff turnover is discussed further

United Kingdom
Performance
Our UK regional performance has been 
strong across our businesses in the 
financial year to March 2013, delivering an 
improved margin of 6.3% (2012: 6.0%), 
which represents a second half margin of 
6.6%. Both revenue and operating profit 
are ahead of the 2011/12 financial year 
with steady headcount growth, closing  
at 9,374 at the end of March. The fall in 
average headcount is due to the prior year 
disposal of our UK asset management 
business. We see multiple opportunities 
for our broad multidisciplinary offering, 
with momentum building across a number 
of markets providing good growth 
potential. 
Business model
We are primarily focused on the UK 
market, where we plan, design and enable 
our clients’ capital programmes in and 
around the built environment. We are  
a technical consultancy, providing advice 
and engineering design together with 
project management skills for public and 
private sector clients. Our multidisciplinary 
skills allow us to draw on expertise across 
the business to deliver complex projects  
in the UK and to support other regional 
businesses.
Strategy
In February 2013, in line with our strategy 
of portfolio optimisation, we announced 
the proposed sale of our UK highways 
services business, which employs around 
1,200 staff, to Skanska. The disposal is 
expected to complete in the summer  
for an initial cash consideration of £16m, 
together with a further £2m subject to  
the future performance of the business. 
The exceptional gross profit on the 
disposal of this business, of around £15m, 
will be reported in the year to March 
2014. Related transaction and 
restructuring costs of £3.8m have been 
reported in the year to March 2013.
We are seeing good opportunities in  
UK infrastructure markets as the UK 
Government seeks to stimulate the 
economy with its commitment to 
infrastructure spend and through rail  
and water regulatory spend. We have  
an ongoing focus on driving operational 
efficiency through cost reductions  
and supplementing skills with niche 
acquisitions where appropriate. We  
will invest in developing our people, 
focusing on quality, technical excellence 
and innovation. 
In addition, our defence, security and 
aerospace markets are strong and provide 
good diversity to our infrastructure 
exposure.
Our programme of focusing on operational 
excellence has improved the underlying 
processes of the business, improving 
business efficiency and project delivery, 
ensuring increased time to focus on our 
clients’ needs. Our continued attention  
to leveraging skills and capability from a 
variety of industry sectors and professional 
disciplines provides a strong and unique 
selling proposition to our clients.
Business drivers 
The economic environment significantly 
affects the opportunities available to our 
business. Our diversified portfolio provides 
resilience to market fluctuations as does 
the fact that a number of our markets 
remain well funded. Added resilience is 
brought to our UK business by its ongoing 
support of projects in other regions, 
together with the increasing use of our 
Indian operations in Bangalore and Delhi 
to provide flexibility of delivery and access 
to high quality, lower cost resources.  
We assess risks across all our businesses 
and this is explained in more detail in  
the risk section of the Business Review  
on pages 40-43.
Operations
Rail
We have commenced work on the two rail 
signalling frameworks we were awarded in 
January 2012 for the Sussex/Wessex and 
Kent/Anglia areas. This is in addition  
to other awards in year, including the 
Wolverhampton, East Sussex and Farnham 
signalling schemes. We continue our work 
on the Cardiff Area re-signalling scheme 
and engineering design work on the 
Country South section of High Speed 2. 
The UK’s electrification programme  
is expected to present a substantial 
opportunity for our rail business. We have 
recently secured work in partnership with 
Parsons Brinckerhoff on the Great Western 
electrification and Cumbernauld section  
of Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement 
Programme alongside Carillion. 
In partnership with Network Rail, Laing 
O’Rourke and Volker Rail we have secured 
a position on Network Rail’s new flagship 
alliance, the Stratford Area Improvement 
Programme with a capital cost of 
approximately £230m over a four year 
period.
Our rail business has a strong work in hand 
position as we enter the new financial 
year, reflecting these recent contract wins.
Highways and transportation
In February 2013 we announced the 
proposed sale of our UK highways services 
business of around 1,200 staff. This 
disposal, which is in line with our strategy 
of optimising our portfolio of businesses, 
is expected to complete in the summer.
Our design consulting business, employing 
around 950 staff, is retained as a core  
part of our UK business, together with  
our activities within the M25 Connect  
Plus consortium providing operational 
maintenance and design for the upgrade 
of significant additional sections of the 
M25, London’s orbital motorway.  Reviews 19
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Reviews
Our consultancy business had a notable 
success with the award of the Wiltshire 
County Council consultancy contract, 
which commenced in December 2012. 
This supplements other framework wins 
already underway for the South Wales 
Trunk Road Agent and Surrey County 
Council.
Water and environment
Our water and environment business  
has performed well during the year. The 
five year regulatory Asset Management 
Plan (AMP5) framework contracts we 
have with a number of the UK water 
companies are providing strong workload 
volumes as their capital investment 
programmes progress. We are supporting 
a number of water companies as they 
prepare for the AMP6 regulatory 
investment period and have recently been 
appointed by Thames Water to its 12 year, 
capital delivery water framework contract 
which is expected to deliver £3bn of 
schemes during AMP6. This early 
contractor involvement provides greater 
continuity of workload between the  
AMP cycles. 
Our geotechnical, environmental and 
planning businesses continue to support 
large projects such as the environmental 
impact assessments for the Rural North 
section of High Speed 2.
Faithful+Gould
Faithful+Gould continues to perform well, 
with good growth in the energy sector, 
and we have been appointed by the local 
authority controlled Scape company as 
the lead professional consultant managing 
a national framework covering services 
including asset management, surveying 
and design services. 
Design and engineering
Building on our success on the London 
2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games,  
we are now overseeing the technical 
transformation of the Queen Elizabeth 
Olympic Park from Games venue into  
an exciting new visitor destination and 
community park.
Work in other targeted sectors sees us 
delivering innovative design solutions  
for a changing educational landscape; 
expanding our healthcare portfolio 
through specialist dementia care design; 
helping to develop plans for a multi 
runway hub airport in the South East;  
and continued involvement in Crossrail.
We are currently working alongside 
architects Pascall+Watson and Zaha  
Hadid Architects to undertake a feasibility  
study for a Thames island airport. 
Defence, aerospace and 
communications
Our defence, aerospace and 
communications business has had  
a good year.
The aerospace sector is seeing good 
growth in Europe, where we were 
appointed as a tier 1 supplier to Airbus/
EADS, and also in North America where 
we have recently opened an office in 
Seattle to focus on building a relationship 
with Boeing. We have a strong pipeline  
of aerospace work as we look into the 
new financial year.
We are currently evaluating our strategy  
in relation to the proposed Defence 
Acquisition Reform. Elsewhere in defence, 
our work at the AWE continues.
Security, cyber security and 
communications are an increasing focus 
for governments and private sector clients 
and we are well placed, in conjunction 
with our management consulting 
capabilities, to leverage our often unique 
skills and capabilities within both the  
UK and the Middle East.
Management consulting
Our management consulting business  
has performed well in the year. We have 
continued our security and intelligence 
work for central government, as well as 
supporting BAA’s IT outsourcing contract 
in partnership with Capgemini, leveraging 
our position in aviation. We continue to 
provide government and industry with 
excellent practical capability to run the full 
lifecycle of IT related project changes from 
specification and business case, through 
project and change management to 
assured benefit realisation.
Elsewhere in the UK, as reported in May 
2012, the Group completed the sale of its 
non-controlling interest in RMPA Holdings 
Limited (which delivered the Colchester 
Garrison PFI project) for a net consideration 
of £14.4m. The pre-tax profit on sale of 
£7.6m does not appear in the segmental 
operating profit in the preceding summary 
table. Also excluded is a pension 
curtailment gain arising in the Atkins 
section of the Railways Pension Scheme  
of £4.3m, more details of which can be 
found in note 30 on page 145.
Outlook
We expect the current momentum in our 
UK business to continue into the new 
financial year, recognising that the full 
year performance in terms of both 
headcount and revenue growth will be 
influenced by the sale of the UK highways 
services business, expected to complete  
in the summer. Secured work in hand of 
52.3% (2012: 55.8%) of next year’s 
budgeted revenue is lower than 2012 
reflecting the completion of our Olympics 
work. However, work in hand remains 
healthy and gives us confidence for the 
year ahead.
We are building positive 
momentum and starting  
to see growth opportunities

North America
Performance
Our North American business had a 
difficult year with a reduced profit of 
£15.3m (2012: £21.2m) as a consequence 
of ongoing losses on legacy contracts  
in our Peter Brown construction 
management at risk business, which 
reported a loss for the year of £6.5m. 
Aside from these losses our consultancy 
and Faithful+Gould businesses in North 
America reported a profit of £21.8m 
despite experiencing soft market 
conditions in the first half of the year  
and suffering a number of project delays 
and uncertainty as a consequence of  
the US presidential election. The second  
half of the year improved with a full  
year consultancy margin of 6.0%  
(2012: 6.6%). Overall headcount closed 
the year at 3,039 (2012: 3,255).
Business model 
We are primarily focused on the North 
American market where we plan,  
design and enable our clients’ capital 
programmes. We operate from over  
107 locations in 29 states plus Puerto 
Rico, Trinidad and Canada. This allows  
us to draw on expertise from across the 
region to deliver complex projects in 
North America and to provide specialist 
skills from within North America to 
strengthen the Group’s offering in  
other segments. 
We currently focus on multidisciplinary 
design and engineering consultancy 
services in highways and transportation, 
water and environment and infrastructure 
related projects. 
Strategy
Our strategy in the region is consistent 
with the Group’s strategy of combining 
technical excellence with regional 
multidisciplinary capability delivered 
through our network of local offices.  
We serve a range of public and private 
sector clients and expect to tighten our 
focus on the energy, water resources, 
transportation, federal facilities and cities 
markets while expanding our presence  
in Texas, California and the north eastern 
United States. We see tremendous 
opportunities to offer a wider suite of 
services to clients through synergies 
between the various Atkins businesses  
in North America.
In addition, our growth in the North 
American market will be supported by 
increasing the use of expert technical 
resources from across the Group.
Business drivers
The majority of North America’s projects 
are funded in part or in whole with 
federal funds, either through a state or 
local government agency or directly by 
federal agencies. Publicly funded projects 
provide greater stability than privately 
funded projects, which tend to have 
funding fluctuations directly correlating  
to financial market conditions. However, 
publicly funded projects tend to be 
awarded more slowly or are delayed due 
to protracted negotiations within the 
agencies and/or due to intense political 
scrutiny.
Aspects of our federal work, where  
we are contracted to assist with disaster 
response and emergency management, 
can be unpredictable in nature and 
timing, as these projects arise as a 
consequence of natural disasters.
Operations 
Consultancy
Highways and transportation
The highways and transportation business 
has performed well. In the latter part of 
the year, we won three new contracts to 
oversee transport solutions for highways 
authorities in Florida, California and Texas, 
underlining our status as one of the 
world’s leading consultants in this field. 
We have served as programme manager 
or engineering consultant for more than 
30 toll or public-sector highway agencies 
in the US, and over the years have 
provided toll related services for capital 
improvements exceeding £16bn. 
In California’s San Francisco Bay area,  
we will serve as the Metropolitan 
Transportation Commission’s (MTC) toll 
system manager for the Regional Express 
Lane Network electronic toll system.  
The five year contract requires us to 
provide strategic advice, develop system 
requirements and support the 
procurement of a system integrator.  
The first phase of the MTC Program  
will create 76 lane miles of new express 
toll lanes that are due to open to traffic  
in 2015. 
In Texas, Atkins has been awarded the 
General Engineering Consultant (GEC) 
contract to provide the North Texas 
Tollway Authority with annual asset 
inspection services, independent review 
and certifications of the engineering 
financial programme and construction 
fund payments. 
These appointments demonstrate Atkins’ 
scope of expertise and in depth 
knowledge of emerging trends in toll 
technology and toll operations including 
all-electronic tolling, video tolling, open 
road tolling, customer service centre 
operations and express/managed lanes.  Reviews 23
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Reviews
In aviation, we continue projects such  
as the planning of the new terminal at 
New Orleans Louis Armstrong International 
Airport. We are also expanding our 
aviation and rail and transit capabilities  
in North America by leveraging Group 
expertise to broaden our service offering, 
while at the same time continuing to 
support Group activities in other regions.
Infrastructure and environment
Our water and environment business had 
a poor first half and a challenging second 
half in 2012/13. However, we did see 
improvement in the water resources, 
energy and coastal markets during the 
year. Going forward, we see opportunities 
for market share growth in Texas and 
California.
Elsewhere our infrastructure business 
grew work in hand significantly towards 
the end of the year, due to a large year 
end distribution of federal funds to 
support planning, asset management and 
water related infrastructure projects for 
the US military.
Faithful+Gould
Our Faithful+Gould business of 550 staff 
which provides project management and 
cost control services has seen growth 
during the year following improvement  
in the private sector market. This is 
typified by our support to GSK on its 
relocation to a new SMART working site 
in Philadelphia’s Navy Yard.
Peter Brown
As previously reported, our Peter Brown 
construction management at risk business 
of 56 people is making steady progress on 
the close out of problem legacy contracts. 
However, there have been further costs  
in the second half of the year resulting  
in a full year loss of £6.5m. 
We have reviewed the carrying value of 
intangible assets held in relation to the 
Peter Brown business and have concluded 
these should be written down to zero. 
More details can be found in note 16  
on page 136.
Risks
There have been no developments with 
regard to the longstanding and previously 
reported Department of Justice and 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
enquiries relating to potential Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act violations by The 
PBSJ Corporation prior to its acquisition  
by the Group. We assess risks across all 
our businesses and this is explained in 
more detail in the risk section of the 
Business Review on pages 40-43.
Outlook
While some uncertainty surrounding the 
timing of infrastructure funding remains, 
the financial outlook for the North 
American business indicates the 
opportunity for slow, but continual 
improvement. Work in hand at the year 
end stands at 61.0% of next year’s 
budgeted revenue (2012: 59.5%).
There are tremendous 
opportunities to offer a wider 
suite of services through 
synergies between the  
various Atkins businesses

Business Review
Segmental performance
continued
Performance
The Middle East region had a mixed year, 
with revenue down 5.4% and operating 
profit lower by 30%.
This suppressed performance was due  
to delays to the start of a number of key 
opportunities and protracted negotiations 
on variations to major contracts in the 
region having an impact on our financial 
performance in terms of both profitability 
and cash flow. 
Headcount has remained flat year on  
year and is down 69 from the half year, 
reflecting the impact of delays in contract 
awards.
Business model
We have an established presence in  
six Gulf countries, through which we 
deliver our multidisciplinary design and 
engineering consultancy services. We 
continue to expand our services in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), where 
we have offices in Riyadh, Jeddah and  
Al Khobar. Our permanent establishment 
and local partnership allow us to deliver 
significant resources and expertise to the 
Kingdom to meet the demand for our 
services. We are also growing strongly  
in Qatar, adding to our well established 
businesses in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Oman, 
Bahrain and Kuwait. 
Strategy
Our strategy in the Middle East continues 
to be one of sector diversification and 
geographic expansion, primarily focused 
on KSA and Qatar as we develop a 
multidisciplinary business across the 
region. This strategy focuses on serving 
the broad infrastructure market, by 
securing work for key clients with major 
capital programmes in rail, property, 
urban development, defence, airports  
and, program cost management.  
In addition, local resources support our 
energy business in the region, which  
is reported within our Energy segment.
Our portfolio of successfully completed 
signature projects in the region, such as 
the Burj Al Arab, Dubai Metro and the 
Bahrain World Trade Center, means Atkins 
has a strong profile from which to develop 
into growth markets. This is reinforced by 
industry awards and recognition, such as 
our success in being named Construction 
Week’s General Construction Consultant 
– Consultant of the Year 2012.
Business drivers
The economic climate in the Middle East  
is primarily driven by the global price of 
oil, which affects demand for our services 
since regional spending ultimately flows 
through to infrastructure, where there is  
a clear view of well funded programmes. 
Additionally, the longer term need to 
develop infrastructure for growing 
economies and populations will drive 
demand for our services. Events such  
as the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar  
also create localised opportunities.
Our experience over the 40 years we  
have been operating in the Middle East 
indicates it is a region where there is an 
increased risk of payment delay and that 
certain countries within the region have 
greater potential for political instability, 
although we operate in countries which 
are generally more stable. We track risks 
across all of our businesses and the 
process is explained in more detail in the 
Principal risks and uncertainties section  
of the Business Review on pages 40-43.
Operations
Notwithstanding the contract negotiations 
referred to earlier, the business has 
maintained a well balanced workload 
across the region. 
Our most significant project in the region 
is the design of the King Abdulaziz 
International Airport in Jeddah, where  
we are the lead designer and programme 
manager for this new 30 million 
passenger per annum terminal as well  
as associated buildings and infrastructure. 
We are seeing encouraging demand for 
our defence, security and communications 
expertise in the Kingdom, having 
successfully delivered a contract to 
support the Ministry of Interior’s 
modernisation programme. The 
transportation, property and urban 
planning markets in KSA are seeing  
a notable upsurge in activity, with 
significant opportunities to support 
religious tourism in Mecca and its key 
gateway, Jeddah. We are also working  
for the Royal Commission of Jubail to 
support its major industrial development 
activity in the Eastern Province.

Our headcount in Qatar has grown to 
more than 400 locally-based staff. We 
continue to work with the government 
advising on infrastructure planning and 
design projects to meet its ambitious 
National 2030 Vision, while the 2022 FIFA 
World Cup has provided an immediate 
focus and sense of urgency for the 
development of essential infrastructure. 
Our key projects include the Central 
Planning Office, which is helping to 
coordinate Qatar’s major transport 
programmes on time and to budget,  
and a significant framework contract  
to upgrade Doha’s roads and drainage 
systems.
In the United Arab Emirates (UAE) we  
are working on the concept design of the 
1,300km Etihad Rail project to link the 
principal industrial and residential centres 
in the UAE, which adds to our portfolio  
of successful rail design projects in the 
region, notably the Dubai Metro, Lusail 
Light Rail in Qatar, the Kuwait Metro  
and Mecca Metro. There remains strong 
appetite for rail and metro projects across 
the region, with opportunities to work 
selectively for design and build contractors. 
The property design market has remained 
relatively quiet although we have been 
appointed to design the infrastructure  
for a new £1.3 billion, 42 km² residential 
community in Abu Dhabi and we are 
seeing developers restart suspended 
projects and investigating new 
opportunities as liquidity and confidence 
in the region’s commercial development 
returns. This trend is particularly strong in 
Dubai, a candidate city to host Expo 2020, 
where there are encouraging signs that 
confidence is returning. This is leading  
to masterplanning and visioning work, 
with an emphasis on projects which will 
support the wider economy by attracting 
tourist and visitor spending. 
The increasing maturity of our core Middle 
East markets is also supporting demand 
for project and programme management 
services, leading to headcount growth  
of 23% in our Faithful+Gould business  
in the region. 
Outlook 
We have a good order book which stands 
at 80.2% of next year’s budgeted  
revenue (2012: 73.8%). There are good 
opportunities for steady growth in our 
focus areas of Qatar and Saudi Arabia  
and we anticipate a return to headcount 
growth in the next financial year. The 
commercial environment remains 
challenging, with the robust management 
of our projects key to successful delivery.
 
Our portfolio of successfully 
completed signature projects 
means that we have a strong 
profile from which to develop

Performance
Our Asia Pacific and Europe businesses 
have performed well in the year to March 
2013. Turnover has remained relatively flat 
while the operating margin has improved 
to 8.4% (2012: 7.3%) and headcount 
continued to increase closing at 2,055 
(2012: 2,020).
Our smaller operations in Ireland and 
Portugal have performed in line with our 
expectations despite continued tough 
market conditions.
Business model
We operate through a network of offices 
in Asia Pacific and Europe. The segment 
comprises our design and engineering 
consultancy and Faithful+Gould 
businesses in Hong Kong, mainland China 
and Singapore, together with six countries 
across Europe: Denmark, Ireland, Norway, 
Poland, Portugal and Sweden. We have 
recently opened an office in Malaysia  
as we seek to increase our footprint in  
the Asia Pacific region.
Strategy
In China, we continue to invest to take 
advantage of opportunities as the market 
opens up, recognising that it could be 
several years before material growth  
is achieved. We have focused on the 
development of our architectural and 
urban masterplanning businesses, 
applying world class design and planning 
talent to take advantage of the market 
potential. Our architectural design 
capability strengthens our service offering 
and this, coupled with our Hong Kong 
infrastructure design skills, provides  
added value to our customers.
In Hong Kong, we are actively targeting 
expansion of our client base and our core 
competencies of rail design work (notably 
for the Mass Transit Rail Corporation 
(MTRC)) and civil, highway and bridge 
engineering. We have broadened our 
service offering and continue to leverage 
Group skills to augment our proposition  
to our local client base of government 
agencies, contractors and private sector 
developers. This is creating a greater 
platform for further revenue and margin 
growth.
Elsewhere in South East Asia, we are 
expanding our presence in Singapore  
and Malaysia.
We continue to develop our core 
Scandinavian businesses, particularly in 
Norway, broadening our skillbase through 
organic growth and targeted acquisitions.
In Poland, we remain focused on 
environmental services for the transport 
and energy markets.
Business drivers
We see good growth potential from  
Asia Pacific not only in our more 
established Hong Kong and mainland 
China businesses which continue to offer 
attractive growth, albeit at slightly lower 
than historical rates, but also from new 
areas. We will focus our initial efforts  
on increasing our exposure in Singapore 
and Malaysia.
The Scandinavian markets that we face 
continue to benefit from investment in 
critical infrastructure from the public and 
private sectors, providing stable market 
conditions. We seek to expand and 
differentiate our offering within the 
transportation market. While our 
operations have stabilised in Ireland  
and Portugal the government austerity 
measures in these countries will curtail  
any meaningful growth.
We assess risks across all our businesses 
and this is explained in more detail in the 
risk section of the Business Review on 
pages 40-43. Clearly, although our market 
exposure in Europe is limited, we do face 
the continuing risk of a further market 
downturn as austerity measures have an 
impact on available workload. In certain 
countries within our Asia Pacific region  
we also need to mitigate the risk of a lack 
of commercial transparency and political 
instability. We continually monitor markets 
and regions in which we trade and focus 
our efforts in geographies that have more 
stable trading environments.
Operations
Asia Pacific
In the Asia Pacific region we have 1,295 
staff (2012: 1,234). Our business in  
Hong Kong continues to work for MTRC 
and we have secured some good contract 
wins for the Hong Kong Airport Authority. 
The latest of these awards is as part of  
the engineering consultant team for the 
third runway infrastructure and concourse 
scheme design for constructing a new 
airport runway north of the existing 
runways. We are also the lead engineer 
on the Hong Kong Link Road project,  
a 12km link road which will connect the 
Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge to the 
international airport. We have recently 
secured detailed design work for the 
China State Construction Engineering 
Corporation on the Central Wan Chai 
Bypass in Hong Kong.
In mainland China, we designed the 
Skyworth Gongming mixed-use complex 
in Shenzhen, turning a historical industrial 
area into a landmark and the first 
eco-friendly development in the 
Guangming district. Furthermore, we 
were appointed design consultants for the 
largest landmark project in Zhengzhou, 
which includes three supertall towers,  
four office towers and hotels and a retail 
area. We have recently secured design

work on the two iconic tall towers 
forming a mixed-use development in 
Shenyang, the largest city in North East 
China. Our urban planning and landscape 
teams have been busy with 
masterplanning projects such as the 
advertising and creative arts zone in 
Beijing and the masterplan for ‘the world 
oil city’ in Karamay, which is our largest 
multidisciplinary project in mainland China 
involving landscaping, water engineering, 
highways and bridges, geotechnical, 
regional consultancy and tourism 
consultancy. Our close relationships  
with certain Chinese contractors continue 
to benefit our business.
Faithful+Gould, which has 199 staff 
(2012: 156) in the Asia Pacific region,  
is seeing stable market conditions with 
growth in the need for sustainability 
services, characterised by our appointment 
to support China Resources Land on its 
500m tall headquarters in Shenzhen.
 
Europe
Our Scandinavian businesses have around 
580 staff (2012: 580). Performance in  
the year has been good. Recent contract 
wins include the Skien rail project in 
Norway for the Norwegian National Rail 
Administration – Jernbaneverket. 
In Denmark we are working in a joint 
venture with Grontmij on the detailed 
design of the second track between 
Vamdrup and Vojens in the South of 
Jutland. In the year, our highways and 
transportation business secured design 
work on the Naestved bypass which 
includes the design of 22 new bridges 
including a 200m river crossing.
In Sweden we are working on several 
larger infrastructure projects such as 
Mälarbanan to Trafikverket and the 
Lidingö Tram Line.
In Poland our most significant project 
continues to be our role as the owner’s 
engineer for the Polish Liquefied Natural 
Gas (LNG) project.
Outlook
We have secured work in hand of 44.7% 
of our 2013/14 budgeted revenue (2012: 
49.8%) which puts us in a good position 
as we enter the new financial year. Asia 
Pacific remains a focus area for investment 
by the Group going forward.

Performance
Our Energy business continues to perform 
well in buoyant markets across all sectors. 
Revenue was up 18% year on year and 
staff numbers increased to 1,376, an 
increase of 16% over the year. Growth 
has been helped by successful integration 
of previous acquisitions and partnering 
arrangements. The margin of 9.1% 
reflects ongoing investment in the 
strategic growth of this sector through 
acquisitions and joint ventures.
Business model
The Energy business operates worldwide 
in several home markets, competing  
both in its own right and through several 
joint ventures, against a wide range of 
competition from large multinational 
engineering consultancies to specialist 
niche players. 
Strategy
We remain focused on nuclear, oil and 
gas, conventional power generation and 
renewables. In these industries we are 
applying our high end multidisciplinary 
engineering skills to assure the integrity 
and safety of existing operational facilities 
as well as in the design of new facilities.
We continue to look at investment 
opportunities, selectively expanding our 
geographic footprint and service offering 
through organic growth, as well as 
extending and creating new partnering 
arrangements and targeting acquisitions 
in our core disciplines in regions where  
we are underrepresented. 
Business drivers
Our business is underpinned by the global 
growth in energy requirements as many 
countries struggle with increasing demand 
and an imperative to decarbonise to 
mitigate the effects of climate change.
High oil prices drive the demand to  
keep existing energy production and 
distribution facilities operating longer, 
drawing on our safety and integrity 
services. At the same time, with the 
industry seeking to maximise more 
challenging oil reserves, such as marginal 
and deepwater fields, there is a continued 
increase in demand for our advanced 
engineering skills.
In nuclear we continue to see a similar 
focus on keeping existing facilities 
operating safely for longer, with an 
ongoing requirement for technical support 
around nuclear decommissioning. In 
addition, many countries around the 
world are still planning to build new 
nuclear power plants as part of their  
long term strategy for decarbonisation. 
Our skills are in high demand across the 
entire nuclear lifecycle. 
We assess risks across all of our businesses 
and this is explained in more detail in the 
risk section of the Business Review on 
pages 40-43. The risks identified as  
being most pertinent to this business  
are safety and environmental risks and  
the reputational risk associated with the 
highly regulated areas within which  
we operate. 
We have also identified that our plans  
for growth are potentially affected by  
the availability of skills. To mitigate this  
risk we continue to invest in our in-house 
training academy that now provides 
externally recognised courses. This year 
we welcomed more than 500 people  
on these courses. 
Operations 
Nuclear
Our nuclear business remains busy on 
existing nuclear generation, new build  
and decommissioning work, continuing  
to build on our 40 years of operational 
experience of UK nuclear facilities. 
In February we joined EDF Energy’s UK 
Strategic Supply Chain Partnership to 
provide additional expert engineering 
support as the company seeks to extend 
the life of its existing nuclear Advanced 
Gas-cooled Reactor fleet. This was  
a natural extension of our existing 
relationship which has seen us provide 
engineering, safety and environmental 
services on the existing UK fleet for over 
30 years. 
In September 2012 we announced the 
formation of a joint venture with AREVA, 
a global leader in nuclear energy, to 
compete for projects in the UK nuclear 
fuel management and decommissioning 
sector. 
The internationalisation of our nuclear 
business continues with the formation  
in November 2012 of a strategic alliance 
with US based Merrick & Company and 
Nuclear Safety Associates (NSA) to serve 
North America’s nuclear market. 
The continued success of our n.triple.a 
joint venture, addressing the international 
nuclear new build market with French 
engineering consultancy Assystem, is 
evidenced by ongoing workload in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and South 
Africa. We extended the alliance last year 
to support aspects of EDF Energy’s nuclear 
new build aspirations in the UK.
Our role as architect engineer, as part  
of the Engage consortium, continues on 
the €15bn International Thermonuclear 
Experimental Reactor (ITER) programme 
which is the next step in a global research 
and development programme to harness 
nuclear fusion as a commercially viable 
source of electricity.

Oil and gas
Our oil and gas business has shown 
continued growth in revenues and 
headcount. Progress in line with our 
strategy to secure long term framework 
agreements for both consultancy and 
design services is providing a solid base 
load of work and further cementing the 
strong relationships we enjoy with  
our clients.
In addition to our existing major 
framework agreements with BP, Chevron, 
Talisman and Apache we have established 
similar long term agreements with Nexen, 
Statoil and Maersk. In March we added  
a framework covering all of our service 
offerings to BP’s UK offshore assets. 
Significantly, we were recently selected to 
provide technical and safety engineering 
services to Shell’s onshore and offshore 
assets worldwide under a new four year 
Enterprise Framework Agreement (EFA). 
Atkins has worked with Shell in the North 
Sea, USA, Africa, Canada and Western 
Australia including safety assessments and 
risk management services on the ground 
breaking Prelude floating Liquefied 
Natural Gas (fLNG) project. 
We are securing an increasing volume  
of multidisciplinary design work. As 
examples, we continue to strengthen our 
long term relationships with Premier Oil 
with our work on the Solan project and 
with Apache in delivering the Front End 
Engineering Design (FEED) services to 
support the Varanus Island Compression 
Project in North West Australia.
A significant part of our focus has been 
on difficult or marginal field developments, 
where our strong technical skills have 
supported the development of new 
concepts in floating production, storage 
and offloading facilities. We successfully 
completed projects for the Chevron Alder 
high pressure, high temperature (HPHT) 
field and are delivering similar work  
for Maersk.
Underpinned by strong client relationships, 
in particular with BP and Shell, our 
Houston and Calgary operations continue 
to develop. In the Middle East there is a 
significant flow of engineering and design 
work for local clients. 
Our work on LNG projects in Singapore, 
Poland and Australia’s largest 
development, Ichthys, continues as well  
as our design contract for an onshore  
gas processing plant for Block 60 in the 
Sultanate of Oman. 
Power
In the UK our power business continues 
its work as lead technical provider to both 
the Drax and Eggborough power stations 
and has an increasing role in biomass 
projects. We continue our long term 
support of National Grid in its complex 
construction programme. 
In early 2013, Atkins was selected by 
Energos to help deliver a large-scale 
energy from waste (EfW) facility as part  
of Viridor and Glasgow City Council’s 
£146m Glasgow Recycling and Renewable 
Energy Centre (GRREC). This new contract 
adds to our portfolio of providing high 
end technical support to large-scale 
power generation projects.
We have recently been appointed by the 
UK Government Department of Energy 
and Climate Change (DECC) in three 
technical advisory roles, strengthening  
our position at the heart of emerging 
clean energy technologies. We are 
providing technical support to the DECC 
Energy Storage competition, developing  
a report into deep geothermal energy 
resource. We have also been appointed  
as technical advisor to the Carbon  
Capture and Storage commercialisation 
programme.
Marine renewables
We remain very active in the offshore 
renewables sector, supporting a number 
of framework contracts in the UK with a 
range of developers. We recently secured 
a further contract with DONG Energy  
to undertake the detailed design of the 
offshore substations for the extension  
to the Walney offshore wind farm in the 
UK’s Irish Sea. This project win cements 
our position as one of the leading British 
engineering and design consultancies in 
the offshore renewables sector. 
Outlook
The outlook for our Energy business 
remains very good. We are well positioned 
in growth markets and have work in hand 
ahead of last year at 33.4% of budgeted 
revenue (2012: 32.4%), which will 
underpin further headcount growth in  
the year ahead.

Financial performance
Performance summary
Turnover was flat at £1.71bn (2012: 
£1.71bn). Reported profit before tax was 
£103.3m (2012: £135.5m), with 2012 
distorted by a large pension curtailment 
gain of £30.9m. A more representative 
measure is underlying profit before tax, 
which was £104.5m (2012: £101.6m). 
Underlying profit removes amortisation 
and impairment of acquired intangible 
assets of £10.0m (2012: £4.2m), profits 
on disposals net of transaction costs  
of £4.5m (2012: £7.2m), along with  
a pension curtailment gain in 2013 of 
£4.3m (2012: £30.9m). 
Reported operating profit was £104.1m 
(2012: £137.2m), at a margin of 6.1% 
(2012: 8.0%). The year on year decrease 
in margin was primarily due to the impact 
of one-off pension gains. This year there 
was a £4.3m pension curtailment gain, 
whereas in 2012 there was a gain of 
£30.9m, as a result of steps taken to 
actively manage our pension liabilities. 
There was also amortisation and 
impairment of acquired intangible assets 
this year of £10.0m (2012: £4.2m). 
Adjusting for the effect of these provides 
a better view of the Group’s performance, 
showing underlying operating profit  
of £109.8m (2012: £110.5m) and an 
underlying margin of 6.4% (2012: 6.5%).
The aforementioned profit on disposal  
of £4.5m is explained in more detail on 
page 130 and comprises the profit on  
sale of a number of businesses (£7.8m), 
including RMPA Holdings Limited and UK 
Specialist Hospitals Limited, with a further 
£0.5m deferred consideration received 
during the year in relation to the sale  
of the UK asset management business, 
which took place in the prior year, 
together with transaction and 
restructuring costs of £3.8m associated 
with the disposal of our UK highways 
services business. 
At 31 March 2013 the net book value  
in respect of acquired intangible assets  
of the Peter Brown business within  
Atkins North America was written down, 
resulting in total amortisation and 
impairment of intangible assets on 
acquisition of £10.0m (2012: £4.2m). 
Headcount was 17,899 at the end of 
March 2013 (2012: 17,420), 479 ahead  
of the same time last year as a result  
of underlying organic growth.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs were £9.1m (2012: 
£10.8m). The year on year reduction  
was primarily the result of a reduction  
in net pension interest.
Tax
The Group’s income tax expense for the 
year was £14.9m (2012: £28.7m), giving 
an effective tax rate of 14.4% (2012: 
21.2%). The Group’s underlying effective 
tax rate was 17.4% (2012: 22.0%).  
This rate is lower than the UK statutory 
rate (24%) due to the regional profile of 
profit, continued benefits from research 
and development (R&D) tax credits,  
the utilisation of losses not previously 
recognised for tax and the impact of  
prior year adjustments.
The Group’s tax position will continue  
to be driven by our regional profile of 
profits and the benefit of R&D tax credits.
Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic EPS from continuing operations was 
91.0p (2012: 109.0p). Underlying diluted 
EPS on continuing operations was 86.7p 
(2012: 79.0p), an increase of 9.7%.
Pensions 
Funding
In the prior year, Atkins Limited undertook 
an enhanced transfer value (ETV)  
exercise for deferred members of the 
Atkins Pension Plan (the Plan). The 
exercise gave rise to a settlement gain 
under IAS 19 in respect of those members  
who transferred out their benefits. 
The Plan recognised a net settlement gain 
of £0.1m in respect of the ETV exercise  
for the year ended 31 March 2013. This  
is to allow for the difference between the 
expected impact of the exercise already 
included in the 31 March 2012 disclosures 
and the actual impact of the exercise. The 
settlement gain of £0.1m is based on the 
transfer out of the Plan of a further £1.3m 
of assets and corresponding liabilities of 
£1.4m in respect of those members.
The Railways Pension Scheme recognised 
a curtailment gain during the 2013 
financial year in respect of the two new 
benefit bases that came into effect for 
certain members from 1 January 2013.  
A curtailment gain arose for members 
moving from the existing uncapped salary 
category or RPI capped salary category  
to the new CPI capped category. The 
reduction in the past service liability for 
this curtailment is £4.3m and this has 
been recognised as a curtailment gain  
in the year ended 31 March 2013.
Cash contributions of £21.0m (2012: 
£26.0m) were made to the Plan during 
the year. The year on year reduction in 
cash contributions was due to the deficit 
benefit achieved through the ETV 
exercise, which the Trustee had agreed 
would be immediately reflected in the 
Plan’s funding. Under the latest agreed 
recovery plan the Group will contribute 
£32m for the following seven years 
ending 31 March 2020.
Charges
The Group accounts for pension costs 
under IAS 19, Employee benefits . The 
total charge to the Consolidated Income 
Statement in respect of defined benefit 
schemes was £5.2m (2012: credit of 
£19.1m), comprising service cost of £2.2m 
(2012: £3.3m), curtailment and settlement 
gains of £4.4m (2012: £33.3m) and  
net finance costs of £7.4m (2012: 
£10.9m). The charge relating to defined 
contribution schemes increased to  
£32.8m (2012: £31.0m).  Reviews 37

IAS 19 – valuation and accounting 
treatment
The Group determines pension scheme 
funding with reference to actuarial 
valuations, but for reporting purposes 
uses IAS 19. Under IAS 19 the Group 
recognised an increased retirement 
benefit liability of £285.2m at 31 March 
2013 (2012: £251.1m).
The assumptions used in the IAS 19 
valuation are detailed in note 30 to the 
Financial Statements (page 145).
Future changes to accounting 
standards
On 16 June 2011 the International 
Accounting Standards Board published  
a revised version of IAS 19 effective for 
reporting periods starting on or after  
1 January 2013. The standard will be 
applied to the Group Financial Statements 
for the first time for the year ending  
31 March 2014 and will require the 
comparatives for the year ended  
31 March 2013 to be restated.
The most significant impact for the Group 
is the introduction of net interest on the 
net defined benefit liability, removing  
the expected return on assets and instead 
applying the discount rate to the plan 
assets as well as to the plan liabilities.  
The estimated net effect of applying  
the standard to next year’s financial 
statements, based on current actuarial 
assumptions, is to increase the net finance 
costs by £8.8m.

Treasury policy and objectives
The Group’s treasury function manages 
and monitors external funding and 
investment requirements and financial 
risks in support of the Group’s corporate 
objectives. The Board reviews and agrees 
policies and authority levels for treasury 
activities.
The Group’s financial instruments, other 
than derivatives, comprise borrowings, 
cash and liquid resources and various 
items, such as trade receivables and trade 
payables, which arise directly from its 
operations. The main purpose of these 
financial instruments is to finance the 
Group’s activities. The Group also enters 
into derivative transactions, principally 
forward foreign currency contracts in 
order to manage foreign exchange risk  
on material commercial transactions 
undertaken in currencies other than the 
local functional currency.  38 Reviews

The main risks arising from the Group’s 
financial instruments are market risk 
(including foreign exchange risk, interest 
rate risk and price risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk, along with other risks arising 
from the financing of the Group’s 
activities in the Public Private Partnership 
(PPP) and Private Finance Initiative (PFI) 
sectors. The Group’s exposures to and 
management of each of the main risks, 
together with sensitivities and risk 
concentrations, are described in more 
detail in note 2 to the Financial 
Statements.
The Group funds its ongoing activities 
through cash generated from its 
operations and, where necessary,  
external borrowings and finance leases. 
The Group’s debt facilities are described  
in note 27 to the Financial Statements 
(page 143). Utilisation of the Group’s 
facilities is a consequence of prior year 
acquisitions. As at 31 March 2013 the 
Group had £113.3m of undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities available 
(2012: £35.4m).
There have been no significant changes  
to the Group’s treasury policies during  
the year.
Critical accounting policies
The Group’s principal accounting policies 
are described in note 1 to the Financial 
Statements (page 106). The Financial 
Statements for the year ended 31 March 
2013 have been prepared under 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU.
The preparation of Financial Statements  
in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the Financial Statements 
and the reported amounts of revenues 
and expenses during the reporting period. 
Although these estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge of the 
amount, event or actions, actual results 
ultimately may differ from those 
estimates. Material estimates applied 
across the Group’s businesses and joint 
ventures are reviewed to a common 
standard and adjusted where appropriate 
to ensure that consistent treatment of 
similar and related issues that require 
judgement is achieved upon consolidation. 
Any revisions to estimates are recognised 
prospectively.
The accounting policies and areas that 
require the most significant estimates and 
judgements to be used in the preparation 
of the Financial Statements are in relation 
to contract accounting, including 
recoverability of receivables, goodwill 
impairment and defined benefit pension 
schemes.
Contract accounting
The Group’s contract accounting policy is 
central to how the Group values the work 
it has carried out in each financial year.
This policy requires forecasts to be made 
on the projected outcomes of projects. 
These forecasts require assessments and 
judgements to be made on changes in 
work scopes, changes in costs and costs 
to completion, for example. While the 
assumptions made are based on 
professional judgements, subsequent 
events may mean that estimates 
calculated prove to be inaccurate, with  
a consequent effect on the reporting 
results.
Defined benefit pension schemes
Accounting for pensions involves 
judgement about uncertain events in  
the future such as inflation, salary levels  
at retirement, longevity rates, rates of 
return on plan assets and discount rates. 
Assumptions in respect of pensions and 
post-employment benefits are set after 
consultation with independent qualified 
actuaries. Management believes the 
assumptions are appropriate. However,  
a change in the assumptions used would 
have an impact on the Group’s results and 
net assets. Any differences between the 
assumptions and the actual outcome will 
affect results in future years. An estimate 
of the sensitivity to changes in key 
assumptions is disclosed in note 30 to the 
Financial Statements (page 145).  Reviews 39

Goodwill impairment
As set out in note 1 of the Financial 
Statements (page 106), goodwill is subject  
to impairment review both annually  
and when there are indications that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. 
The carrying value of goodwill is 
compared to the recoverable amount, 
which is the higher of value in use and  
fair value less costs to sell.
For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to a cash-
generating unit (CGU), or groups of  
CGUs that is expected to benefit from  
the synergies of the combination. Each 
CGU or group of CGUs to which the 
goodwill is allocated represents the lowest 
level within the entity at which goodwill  
is monitored for internal management 
purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the 
operating segment level.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired 
requires an estimation of the value in use 
of CGUs to which the goodwill has been 
allocated. The value in use calculation 
requires an estimate to be made of the 
timing and amount of future cash flows 
expected to arise from the CGU and the 
application of a suitable discount rate to 
calculate the present value. The discount 
rates used are based on the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital adjusted 
to reflect the specific economic 
environment of the relevant CGU.
Tax
The Group is subject to tax in a number  
of jurisdictions and judgement is required 
in determining the worldwide provision 
for income taxes. The Group provides  
for future liabilities in respect of uncertain 
tax positions where additional tax may 
become payable in future periods and 
such provisions are based on 
management’s assessment of exposures.
As set out in note 1 to the Financial 
Statements (page 106), deferred tax is 
accounted for on temporary differences 
using the liability method, with deferred 
tax liabilities being provided for in full and 
deferred tax assets being recognised only 
to the extent that it is judged probable 
that future taxable profit will arise against 
which the temporary differences can  
be utilised. 40 Reviews

The Group risk committee, chaired by  
the chief executive officer, oversees  
the operation of the Group’s risk 
management framework and provides 
support to the Board and the Audit 
Committee.
This risk management framework 
continues to support the Board’s risk 
appetite when assessing and determining 
the nature and extent of the significant 
risks it is willing to accept in achieving  
its strategic and operational objectives.
This framework and the associated risk 
management structure support the 
systematic identification, assessment, 
communication, reporting and 
management of risk at both strategic  
and operational levels, and seek to ensure 
that:
•	 t h e 	 p u b l i c , 	 e m p lo y ees 	 a n d 	 t h e	
environment are safe from potential 
hazards inherent in our operations
•	 t h e 	 po t e n t i a l 	 f or 	 d a m a ge 	 t o 	 o u r	
corporate reputation, or financial loss  
to shareholders and other stakeholders, 
is minimised.
The Board believes that for risk 
management to be successful, it must 
integrate the framework into all activities 
and develop a culture and behaviour 
within the organisation that ensures that:
•	 t h e 	 m a n a ge me n t 	 o f 	 r i sk 	 i s 	 c le a r ly 	 d r iv e n	
by business strategy and objectives
•	 G r o u p 	 f u n c t ion s 	 a ssi st 	 a n d 	 s u ppor t

early disclosure of issues or concerns,  
so that timely and appropriate action 
can be discussed, agreed and 
implemented as necessary.
It is intended that these principles and  
the risk management framework continue 
to be adopted throughout the Group, 
without exception, to achieve progressive 
improvement in the effectiveness of  
risk management processes. The risk 
management framework interfaces with 
the commercial framework which provides 
an integrated process for assessing the 
level of risk for operational projects and 
services, depending on scale and 
complexity, applying a consistent method 
of evaluating risk. This enables appropriate 
projects and services to be peer reviewed, 
evaluated and the risks categorised.
This integrated process supports our 
management in determining the 
appropriate level of risk for our operations. 
This in turn supports and enables the 
organisation to identify, evaluate,  
control and own appropriate risks at  
the appropriate level. This process also 
ensures that:
• 		 a 	 c ommon 	 a pp r oac h 	 t o 	 r i sk	
management continues to be adopted, 
reducing inefficiency
• 		 w e 	 ope r a t e 	 i n 	 a n 	 e n vi r on me n t 	 a n d	
culture where both technical and 
commercial risk remain a key focus of 
management at appropriate levels in  
the organisation.
The combination of both the risk 
framework and the commercial framework 
provides the organisation with an 
integrated risk management approach  
in the evaluation, control and monitoring 
of risks. 
We continue to manage a number of 
potential risks and uncertainties which 
could have a material impact on our long 
term performance. Many of these risks  
are common to other companies and  
we assess them to establish the principal 
risks for the Group. The following table 
outlines these principal risks and the 
mitigating activities we undertake in 
respect of each. We continue to assess 
these risks under two main categories  
of strategic risk and operational risk.
Effective risk management continues to be 
embedded in our governance framework, 
which is summarised in the Corporate 
Governance Report (pages 64 to 75). 42 Reviews

Economic outlook
Continuing and increased government 
austerity measures impact our trading 
performance as spending on public 
sector infrastructure is reduced.
Worsening economic conditions lead  
to reduced levels of private sector 
infrastructure spend and adversely 
impact our clients’ ability to pay for  
our services.
We have increased our sector and geographic 
diversification to provide resilience at a time when 
many of our markets still experience uncertainty.  
We have a clear strategic priority to focus on sectors 
which have attractive growth prospects with good 
levels of funding.
We actively seek to redeploy staff around the Group  
to meet demand in growth markets and sectors, 
frequently moving work to people and people to work.
We perform client credit checks and maintain regular 
management reviews of credit terms, trade debtors  
and work in progress.
We have already reshaped our business  
to target more than 50% of our revenue 
outside the UK. Our long term goal is to 
generate more than 75% of revenue from 
our non-UK and Energy businesses.
We continue to focus on funded markets 
in targeting growth and evaluating 
investment opportunities. 
We have added resilience to our UK 
business through its ongoing support  
to non-UK projects.
Financial
The deterioration of the Group’s 
financial position limits our ability to 
invest in growth.
Adverse movements in liability 
assumptions or asset values result in  
a significant increase in the Group’s 
defined benefit pension obligations, 
increasing the cash funding required to 
repay the deficit and reducing our ability 
to invest in further growth opportunities.
We review the Group’s trading and funding position  
on an ongoing basis.
We have made good progress in implementing our 
strategy to continue to de-risk our defined benefit 
pension schemes. We will continue to actively manage 
the assets and liabilities of our pension schemes.
In 2012 we announced the successful 
execution of the Group’s debut issue in the 
US private placement market which has 
broadened the Group’s sources of funding  
to support future growth.
During the year we completed an 
Enhanced Transfer Value (ETV) exercise for 
deferred members of the Atkins Pension 
Plan to reduce its ongoing liabilities and 
future volatility.
Geo-political
Political instability in the regions within  
which we operate has a negative impact  
on our ability to deliver contractual 
services, receive payment and endangers 
the safety of our staff.
We focus on geographies that have more stable  
trading environments.
We obtain the latest professional risk and security 
information before engaging in contracts in new 
geographies and continue to monitor the stability  
of the markets in which we trade.
Our strategy process includes evaluation  
of the political stability of the regions  
and territories we operate, or propose  
to operate in.
Market
Worsening economic conditions lead  
to changes in contracts resulting in 
increased risk transfer from clients as 
competitors accept more onerous 
contract terms to win work.
Reductions in the amount of available 
work increase pricing pressure and 
reduce our operating margins.
We have robust integrated review procedures, which 
include peer reviews, during the bidding and 
contracting stage of our projects.
We have focused our strategy on sectors with strong 
growth prospects, good levels of funding and high 
technical barriers to entry.
We have a strategic focus on operational excellence, 
winning and delivering work.
We continue to drive operational 
performance across the Group to improve  
our margins.
We continue to embed our integrated 
project review procedures across our 
management and markets. 
Initiatives such as our operational 
excellence programme, together with the 
increasing use of our Bangalore and Delhi 
operations, aim to deliver a competitive 
cost base. 
Regulatory/Legal
Legislation and regulations restrict our 
ability to operate in certain locations  
or perform certain activities leading  
to the need to exit these markets.
Breaches of regulation or legislation 
result in fines, imprisonment and 
reputational damage.
We seek ongoing external advice about new  
and/or changing trading restrictions, communicating 
these changes across our business.
We continue to invest in staff training and 
communication.

Physical and data security
Confidential client business and personal 
data is mishandled, resulting in breach

of commercially sensitive information  
or the loss of the personal information 
of our clients and/or employees.
Our business systems suffer an attack 
from hackers or viruses.
Political instability in the regions within 
which we operate threatens the safety 
of our employees.
We use appropriate physical security, secure networks 
and encryption in order to protect data.
We train staff on best practice in information assurance.
The Group security officer seeks to ensure best practice

We obtain independent professional risk and security 
information for countries we propose to operate in  
or travel to.
We continue to provide information 
assurance training modules for our UK  
and non-UK based staff.
Projects
Poor management of projects leads to 
client dissatisfaction, damage to our 
reputation for technical excellence and  
a deterioration in the Group’s financial 
performance.
We have augmented our Business Management 
Systems through the introduction of a new online 
project management system to drive consistently high 
standards across the Group.
We continue to invest in ongoing project management 
excellence training programmes for our staff.
We continue to improve project controls which include 
regular financial reviews of project performance.
We continue to invest in project 
management capabilities across the  
Group (people, processes and systems). 
Staff recruitment and retention
Failure to attract and retain the most 
talented, motivated professionals in their 
respective fields makes us unable to 
deliver on clients’ expectations and 
respond to the most technically 
challenging and time critical projects 
thereby eroding our market share and 
damaging our financial performance.
Regular management reports and business reviews 
evaluate a number of metrics including headcount, 
retention, vacancy levels and employee engagement.
Regular staff performance appraisals are performed 
identifying strengths, weaknesses, training needs and 
career development.
A new online platform (My Career) is being 
rolled out to all regions during 2013/14. 
This will support a consistent approach to 
staff performance reviews, training, career 
planning and development.
Engagement is essential in a people based 
business. We continue to use a variety of

Overview
As a professional services company, our 
people’s talent, energy and willingness  
to go above and beyond for our clients 
and our company are true differentiators 
for Atkins. Their individual talent and 
collective expertise help us to stand out 
from our competitors.
Making Atkins a great place to work  
is therefore central to our shareholder 
proposition. We must continue to attract 
and retain talented staff and provide  
them with opportunities for professional 
development and growth if we are  
to meet the infrastructure challenges  
of tomorrow.
To help us achieve this, our Human 
Resources performance is measured via  
a structured process of business reviews 
that evaluate metrics such as headcount, 
retention and employee engagement.  
This process also includes a broader 
review of the future skills and resourcing 
needed to address changing client and 
market requirements.
Headcount
Underlying headcount increased by 
approximately 500 people to 17,899 
during the year and is an encouraging 
measure of business performance. There 
was a rise in the UK and in Asia Pacific 
and Europe and we have been particularly 
encouraged by increases in our Energy 
business (+16%). This segment 
experienced impressive organic growth 
resulting from improved staff retention 
and extra recruitment activities. The 
increases in headcount were partly offset 
by a reduction in North America as the 
region continues to focus on operational 
efficiency and productivity.
Vacancy levels have remained relatively 
flat from the beginning of the year, with 
vacancies of just over 2,000 at the end  
of March 2013. Whilst annual vacancies 
have remained stable, monthly vacancy 
numbers have fluctuated in line with the 
phasing of projects.
We track our progress in filling vacancies 
across the Group. At year end, 19% of 
open positions were at offer stage, 54% 
had identified candidates and were at 
interview stage and the remaining 27% 
were at sourcing stage where we were 
seeking candidates.
In conjunction with growing our talent 
base in local markets, we have had  
a consistent number of international 
assignments across the Group, which 
supplement skills not available locally with 
specific technical knowledge or resource 
the delivery of large projects. We also 
recognise that international mobility is  
a stretching experience for our employees.
We want more young people to consider 
a career in engineering so we are 
targeting a graduate intake of 500 
worldwide for 2013. The significant 
number of places on offer reflects our 
continued confidence in our ability to 
offer talented graduates a rewarding 
career. We continue to be one of the 
biggest and most popular recruiters of 
newly graduated engineers in the UK and 
have again been voted the most popular 
graduate recruiter in the construction,  
civil engineering and surveying sector, 
based on a survey of 23,000 students.
We have also increased our intake of 
apprentices in the UK, recognising that 
this is an increasingly attractive entry route 
for young people. We are targeting  
a further 25% increase in new apprentices 
in 2013/14.

Retention
Staff retention remained stable during  
the year and staff turnover remains at 
relatively low levels in most regions. 
Turnover by region was:

15.9% 17.5%
Energy 14.3% 16.8%
Group total 10.6% 10.6%
The reduction in turnover in Asia Pacific 
and Europe is particularly encouraging,  
as is the decrease in turnover in our 
Energy business. The increase in turnover 
in the Middle East reflects growing 
demand in certain markets within the 
region, most notably Qatar.
We measure our retention of experienced 
employees using a stability index. This 
calculates the number of employees with 
one or more years’ service as a percentage 
of the number employed 12 months ago. 
The stability index for each region and for 
the Group was:

The Group index has risen to 82.9% 
(2012: 80.1%) and remains within our 
desired range of between 75% and 85%.
We also track feedback from colleagues 
who have left the Group in certain 
regions. Of those leavers who completed 
our questionnaire 86% stated that they 
would work for Atkins again. 86% of 
leavers also indicated that they would 
recommend Atkins as a place to work.
Engagement
It is essential that we maintain regular 
communication with staff and we do this 
by uploading organisational information, 
project features and success stories to our 
intranet, through regular chief executive 
officer letters to all staff and via online 
presentations and management briefings. 
Following the announcement of the 
Group’s full and half year results, we issue 
updates on the Group’s performance via 
presentations from our chief executive 
officer and Group finance director, which 
are posted on our intranet. They are also 
available in transcript form and as 
recorded telephone messages. In addition, 
the chief executive officer and Group 
finance director conduct pre and post 
results briefing teleconferences with  
our worldwide management team. Our 
Twitter feed and Facebook updates also 
offer instant access to news and events 
across Atkins.
During the year, our work on the London 
2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games was 
a huge source of pride for our people and 
our regular series of news articles, events 
and publications helped them feel 
engaged in the experience. We hope to 
create the same sense of pride as we hold 
our 75th anniversary celebrations this year.
To monitor employee engagement, each 
year we ask our staff around the world to 
complete our Viewpoint survey. Our 
2012/13 results were positive and showed 
improvement across a majority of areas. 
Our overall employee engagement score 
rose by 3% to 67%, which is well ahead 
of the professional services sector 
benchmark.

The engagement model measures our 
people’s alignment (relationship with 
management), involvement (relationship 
with their jobs) and loyalty (relationship 
with the organisation). The results against 
this model, with comparisons to the 
2011/12 survey, are shown below.
The Employee Engagement scorecard 
shows the percentage of respondents 
ticking ‘strongly agree/agree’ against  
a number of key engagement questions. 
These scores can also be measured against 
the Global Sector Norm shown in brackets 
alongside each engagement score.
 
The results show that our people care 
about the success of Atkins, feel proud  
to work for us and have a clear 
understanding of how their role 
contributes to meeting our clients’ needs.
The results also indicate where we need  
to improve to make Atkins an even better 
place to work.
Over the coming year, we will continue 
our commitment to increasing 
collaboration across the Group, improving 
our knowledge sharing and our approach 
to individual performance, development 
and careers.
As further recognition of the support  
we receive from our employees, we have 
reclaimed our place among The Sunday 
Times Top 25 Best Big Companies to Work 
For (we were ranked at 23), having missed 
out in the previous year. We will continue 
to use the feedback from this survey, 
alongside the Viewpoint results, to sustain 
an ongoing dialogue with our teams 
through which we can continuously 
improve our employee engagement.
Investment in people
To achieve our vision to be the world’s 
best infrastructure consultancy we  
need to develop the capabilities and 
performance of our people. The Group’s 
annual training spend of over £17m was 
up from the previous year, reflecting  
an increased investment in growth areas  
and in developing line management 
capabilities.
Technical development is also central to 
our learning and development strategy, 
representing around 65% of all training 
activity. We are using our Network Chairs 
to drive technical excellence across key 
skills areas. Through this network we 
introduced the Atkins design principles,  
a framework for delivering the best 
possible design solutions to our clients. 
These principles were explained via  
a series of webinars that employees from  
all parts of the Group participated in.
Making Atkins a great place  
to work is central to our 
shareholder proposition,  
and to our ability to meet  
the infrastructure challenges  
of tomorrow

In January 2013 we worked with the 
University of Oxford Saïd Business School 
to introduce a new Group leadership 
development programme. It aims to 
enhance strategic alignment, innovation 
and leadership through change. We also 
maintained our investment in a range of 
senior management development and 
career development programmes across 
the Group.
We are encouraging young people to 
consider a career in engineering and 
design through our support for a number 
of events. We attended the Big Bang Fair 
in London this year, which attracted over 
50,000 young people aged 7 to 19, 
engaging with them through our 
‘engineering in everyday life’ exhibition.
Over the coming year we are investing  
in My Career, a programme that focuses 
on the performance and development  
of our people. It will start with the 
implementation of an online performance 
and development review system, making 
it easier for staff to record their objectives, 
achievements and development activities. 
Overall, My Career aims to help our 
people make the most of their talent.
Reward
Pay levels remained flat in some of our 
markets. However, pay pressure in other 
sectors, and in relation to selected skill 
sets, means that we need to target salary 
increases to attract and retain staff and 
stay cost competitive. Wage inflation 
across the Group for the year was just 
above 3%, with significant variation  
by region.
To inform the salary review and other 
reward decisions, we conduct 
comprehensive annual benchmarking 
studies across our regions (UK, North 
America, Middle East, Asia Pacific and 
Europe). We use the data to improve  
the competitiveness of our remuneration 
packages and to help line managers  
with pay decisions.
Approximately 1,000 senior leaders 
worldwide participate in our executive 
bonus scheme (EBS). The EBS incentivises 
the delivery of above average financial 
results and exceptional individual 
performance by rewarding the 
achievement of stretching profit targets 
and personal objectives. Following a 
review of the scheme we have introduced 
a cash performance measure for our most 
senior participants. This reflects the 
strategic focus within the Group. Further 
details of this measure are provided in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report (page 83). 
A discretionary bonus scheme covers the 
wider Atkins population. We expect to 
pay a bonus to around one third of staff, 
recognising individual contribution and 
performance.
We have maintained our focus on the 
management of our historic defined 
benefit pension liabilities and we are 
giving equal priority to ensuring that 
members of our plans save appropriately 
for their retirement. In the UK, new 
investment platform for defined 
contribution members of the Atkins 
Pension Plan was launched in the summer 
of 2012. This supported the transition  
to a range of revised investment choices 
for members. Members were informed 
about the transition through a 
comprehensive communications 
campaign, which encouraged them to 
review their investments in the context  
of their personal circumstances and decide 
whether to make any changes to how 
their pension fund was invested. We were 
encouraged by the level of engagement 
that the campaign generated, with 54% 
of members actively making a decision 
about their investment choices.
A significant amount of work has  
also been done to prepare for the 
implementation of new pension legislation 
in the UK that requires employers to 
automatically enrol all workers into  
a qualifying pension scheme. This has 
affected approximately 1,000 employees 
and contractors who had previously 
chosen not to join the scheme.
Employee share ownership is encouraged 
across the Group to align the interests of 
our employees and our shareholders and 
to enable our employees to share in the 
success of the company. In the UK, we 
operate a share incentive plan (SIP) that 
provides a tax efficient mechanism for 
employees to become shareholders. 
Approximately 12% of eligible employees 
participate in the SIP. In 2012, we also 
secured approval from shareholders to 
broaden the availability of all employee 
share plans outside the UK and will be 
prioritising the jurisdictions where we 
have the greatest concentration of people 
and where share schemes are prevalent  
in the market.  Reviews 49

Diversity
We are committed to building a diverse 
organisation to maximise the skills 
available to us in the geographies and 
markets in which we operate. Policies 
have been adopted to ensure this 
commitment is implemented from the 
point of recruitment and continues 
throughout an individual’s employment 
with the Group. Employees are provided 
with the opportunity to develop to their 
full potential regardless of sex, race,  
age, religion or belief, disability, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, marriage  
and civil partner status, pregnancy, 
parental obligations or background, 
subject to the laws of the jurisdictions  
in which we work.
The Group encourages recruitment, 
training, career development and 
promotion on the basis of aptitude and 
ability, without regard to disability.  
We are also committed to retaining and 
retraining as necessary employees who 
become disabled during the course of 
their employment.
This year we have focused on gender 
diversity recognising that, in common  
with many engineering and science-based 
organisations, women are under-
represented, particularly in senior 
management positions. We have set  
a short term target of increasing female 
representation at a senior level (the top 
1,000 in the Group) to 15% by 31 March 
2015 as a first step towards our longer 
term aspiration of a more balanced 
organisation. Over the year, female 
representation at a senior level increased 
from 11.3% to 12.4%.
To help us achieve this aim, more than  
80 women have participated in our 
women’s career development programme 
and we have reaffirmed our commitment 
to providing further support during  
the coming year. Diversity training is  
now included in many of our leadership 
programmes and in nominating 
candidates for these programmes we 
ensure that a high proportion of female 
colleagues attend. We have also made 
significant changes to the operation  
of our selection and promotion panels, 
ensuring that we draw from the widest 
possible talent pool to select high  
calibre recruits.
Our women’s professional network in the 
UK, established last year, has continued  
to meet quarterly and debate issues such 
as career development and mentoring.  
In North America, a diversity leadership 
council has been established. Participants 
have developed an implementation plan 
to drive increased representation of 
women and minorities at senior levels.  
A worldwide women’s leadership council 
has also been established across Atkins  
so that the most senior women in the 
organisation can guide others and act  
as role models.
Over the year, female 
representaion at senior  
level increased from 11.3%

Our commitment
We are establishing more sustainable and 
responsible business practices across our 
worldwide operations and using our 
leadership position in our sector to raise 
industry safety standards and accelerate 
the move towards a low carbon society. 
Our achievements are summarised in this 
report.
Leadership
We believe we have a responsibility to our 
people and to the communities in which 
we operate and the last year has been a 
critical period in the development of the 
policies and processes that underpin this. 
We sought an independent evaluation of 
our Groupwide approach to corporate 
responsibility and sustainability, working 
closely with a member of the UK’s 
Department for Business, Innovation & 
Skills to complete a review of our existing 
measures. Following this work and an 
additional programme of stakeholder 
engagement within the Group, we have 
developed a draft set of guiding principles 
for sustainability. Our intention, in the 
current year, is to share the principles with 
the Atkins community and stakeholders. 
Following engagement, long term 
sustainability goals will be captured in  
a pathway model.
Throughout the year we have used our 
leadership position in our sector and  
our membership of industry safety and 
sustainability forums to influence 
international institutions and clients and  
to drive positive change. By working in 
partnership with the UK Government’s 
International Development Department 
and University College London, we 
produced a report examining the social, 
environmental and economic risks  
posed to a number of cities in light of 
accelerated urbanisation and climate 
change (http://www.futureproofingcities.
com). The report identifies practical policy 
options to help people living in these cities 
and urges residents, authorities and 
investors to take action now to future 
proof against the risks identified.
Improving safety standards through 
behavioural change has also been a focus 
for the Group in the past year. We are 
driving progress in the Middle East 
through our work with the Middle East 
Construction Safety Executives and 
Consultants and Major Programme Health 
and Safety Forum in Qatar. In Abu Dhabi, 
our site supervision team working on the 
Al Falah development was recognised, 
alongside contractors, for achieving  
50 million man hours of work in two years 
with no lost time injuries. Elsewhere we 
have been instrumental in establishing  
a Consultants’ Health and Safety Forum  
in the Asia Pacific region.
In the UK, as members of the Rail 
Infrastructure Safety Liaison Group and 
Sustainable Development Working Group, 
we are leading sustainability change in the 
rail industry.

Safety performance
Encouraging widespread identification 
and reporting of accidents and near 
misses is fundamental to the cultivation  
of a strong safety culture at Atkins.  
Our accident incident rate (AIR) measures 
our people’s and contractors’ accident 
performance. Our people’s AIR 
performance remains broadly in line with 
industry norms, as compiled by the UK’s 
Health and Safety Executive Labour Force 
Survey. There has been a decrease in 
major accidents and minor injuries in the 
UK. We continue to see an increase in 
near miss reporting and can attribute  
a 17% rise to our awareness programme. 
Next year we will broaden the scope of 
our safety performance statistics reporting 
to include worldwide operations.
Behavioural safety 
Each element of our behavioural safety 
model – Safe by Leadership, Safe by 
Design and Safe by Choice – addresses  
a different business risk. That is, 
operational activities, design work and 
decision-making. We continue to build  
on the strength of our worldwide Safe  
by Choice (SBC) programme that aims  
to make safety a natural part of our 
organisational culture. We are 
empowering our people to put safety  
at the heart of everything we do and  
to create widespread awareness of the 
concept of ‘natural safety’ through their 
effective leadership and behaviour. This 
includes the development of a red, amber, 
green (RAG) list to help designers working 
across the Group identify, prioritise and 
mitigate risk. Senior leadership teams in  
all regions have received behavioural 
safety coaching over the last year. The 
emphasis on behavioural safety will 
continue in the current year, with site  
visits and an expansion of the leadership 
programme to target middle managers 
who are in positions of influence. 
Our safety, health and environment 
culture survey reinforced the value of the 
SBC programme, with results showing  
an improvement in the understanding  
and application of health and safety 
worldwide. The survey also supported the 
need to carry out more leadership training 
for middle managers.
Safety awards and recognition
Atkins’ commitment to sustainable and 
responsible business practices is evidenced 
by the range of awards we won during 
the year.
In the UK, we were awarded a Royal 
Society for the Prevention of Accidents 
(RoSPA) Gold Award for Occupational 
Health and Safety. 
Additionally, the UK’s Olympic Delivery 
Authority supply chain, including Atkins, 
received the RoSPA Diamond Jubilee 
Award for outstanding health and  
safety performance during preparations 
for the London 2012 Olympic and 
Paralympic Games.

Carbon emission reduction
Our industry leading stance on reducing 
carbon emissions drives our commitment 
to design and develop carbon efficient 
solutions that will help in the transition  
to a low carbon economy.
Verification of greenhouse  
gas emissions
Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance 
(LRQA) Limited has provided limited 
assurance of our direct and indirect 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data 
for the financial year ended 31 March 
2013 in line with ISO 14064-1. This 
process covers our scope 1, 2 and 3 
(business travel) emissions in Asia Pacific 
and Europe, the Middle East and the 
UK. ‘Limited assurance’ means nothing 
has come to the auditor’s attention  
that would indicate that the data is  
not correct.
Carbon Disclosure Project 
The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is an 
international, not-for-profit organisation 
providing the only global system for 
companies to measure, disclose, manage 
and share vital carbon related information. 
The CDP showcases FTSE 350 companies 
with the most professional approach to 
corporate governance and information 
disclosure on climate change. Atkins  
has provided data to the CDP for the  
last four years and we have featured in 
performance and leadership indices during 
that time. Our latest score placed us in  
the top quartile of the CDP FTSE 350 
companies. Our objective is to continue to 
improve our score by further developing 
good practice in relation to supply chain 
issues and our North America operations.
UK Carbon Trust Standard and the 
Carbon Reduction Commitment  
(CRC) Energy Efficiency Scheme
Atkins has maintained certification to 
the UK’s Carbon Trust Standard for more 
than four years. During this time, the UK 
Government’s Department of Energy and 
Climate Change commenced its energy 
efficiency scheme – CRC. In a CRC league 
table released in January 2013 Atkins  
was the highest placed engineering 
consultancy.
Reporting greenhouse gas emissions
For the third year in a row the Group 
(excluding North America) has achieved 
certification to the ISO 14064 
international standard for the 
quantification and reporting of 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
We continue to report on gas, electricity 
and liquid fuel consumption for our 
businesses in Asia Pacific and Europe,  
the Middle East, the UK and North 
America. We also report on business 
travel emissions for all of our worldwide 
operations. Figure 3 shows the total 
emissions for each region and the split  
of emissions between scope 1, 2 and 3 as 
defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

Respect for the environment
Our commitment to environmental 
stewardship is reflected in our 
management of environmental impacts 
and in our approach to enhancing the 
environment through our ecological and 
biodiversity services.
Systems
Atkins’ safety, health and environmental 
culture survey indicated a rise in 
worldwide environmental interest, a trend 
supported by an increase in internal 
environmental minor incident reports.
Waste
Over the last three years we have 
expanded our recycling schemes.  
An indication of what has been learned 
during our participation in the Waste  
and Resources Action Programme, Halving 
Waste to Landfill initiative in the UK is 
demonstrated by one of our key projects, 
the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
Games Park, where we were able to 
recycle 95% of the materials. 
Our UK offices have reduced their paper, 
toner and energy use through the 
introduction of more efficient printing 
processes and technology. 
We have drawn on environmental 
expertise within our business to develop  
a good practice site booklet on waste 
management for worldwide use by  
Atkins employees. 
Our Asia Pacific business obtained 
Wastewi$e Label recognition for good 
waste related performance from the  
Hong Kong Awards for Environmental 
Excellence. 
Water
Our North American business has 
participated in the Everglades Restoration 
Program. This is the world’s largest 
environmental ecosystem restoration 
project, encompassing ecological 
rejuvenation, water storage and 
wastewater reuse, flood control and 
recreation. 
As part of a drive to reduce our water 
consumption, a series of site water audits 
were carried out in Australia and lessons 
learned will be shared across the Group.  
A good practice site booklet has been 
developed for worldwide use and a review 
of water use in offices will be undertaken 
next year. 
As a pilot project, the conventional urinals 
at a UK office have been replaced with 
waterless technology, saving 500,000 
litres of water per year. We will evaluate 
the success of this pilot project with a 
view to expanding the use of waterless 
urinals across our UK offices.
Ecology and biodiversity
We consider ecological impacts as an 
integral part of our design process. In the 
UK, we have developed a GrowBox that 
gives community groups in urban areas 
the products and advice they need to 
create or improve green spaces such as 
parks and allotments. This concept was 
shortlisted for the London Green 
Infrastructure competition, run by the 
Landscape Institute, the Mayor of London 
and the Garden Design Museum. 
Our work on Farringdon train station in 
London won an ecology and biodiversity 
CEEQUAL award, the UK’s sustainability 
assessment, rating and awards scheme for 
civil engineering, thanks to an integrated 
living roof design that was a first for UK 
rail operator Thameslink.
The Group also developed a framework 
for Korup National Park in Cameroon that 
is aimed at conserving the biodiversity of 
lowland tropical forests while promoting 
social and economic development and 
sustainable use of natural resources.  
The provision of social and physical 
infrastructure was a central element of  
the project to allow the resettlement  
of six villages within the park that were 
having a major impact on wildlife.
Regulatory activity
Following extraordinary weather 
conditions, there was a minor discharge  
of silt into a brook at the site of one of our 
projects. We self reported this issue and 
associated corrective actions to the UK’s 
Environment Agency which was happy 
with our response and issued us with its 
lowest level warning letter.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Directors’ Report
WS Atkins plc is the ultimate holding 
company of a group of companies  
that plans, designs and enables capital 
programmes that resolve complex 
challenges in the built and natural 
environment. 
The Companies Act 2006 (the Act) and 
the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules 
and Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
(the LRs and DTRs respectively) require  
the directors to set out in the annual 
management report that accompanies the 
Financial Statements and the independent 
auditor’s report (together the Annual 
Report) a fair review of the business  
of the Group during the financial year 
ended 31 March 2013. 
This review is required to include a full 
description of the Group’s principal 
activities, business, performance, 
significant contracts, likely future 
developments and principal risks and 
uncertainties (known as a Business 
Review).
The information that fulfils the Business 
Review requirements is incorporated  
into this report by reference and can  
be found in the following sections:

The Annual Report will be laid before 
shareholders at the annual general 
meeting (AGM) to be held at The Lincoln 
Centre, 18 Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London, 
WC2A 3ED at 1100 on Wednesday  
31 July 2013. Details of the business to be 
considered at the AGM, together with an 
explanation of each of the resolutions, are 
set out in the separate Notice of Meeting.
Directors
The names and biographies of those 
persons serving as directors of the 
Company as at the date of this report  
are incorporated into this report by 
reference and can be found in the Board 
of Directors section (pages 58 and 59). 
Under the Company’s articles of 
association all directors must retire at the 
first AGM following their appointment  
by the Board and may offer themselves  
for election by shareholders. In line with 
the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, which has applied  
to the Company since 1 April 2011,  
all directors will retire at the AGM and, 
being eligible, will offer themselves for 
re-election. The Board considers that the 
performance of each of the directors 
continues to be effective and that each of 
them demonstrates a strong commitment 
to their role.
Indemnification of and insurance 
cover for directors and officers
Directors and officers of the Company  
and its subsidiaries benefit from directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance cover in 
respect of legal actions brought against 
them. In addition, directors of the 
Company are indemnified in accordance 
with article 138 of the Company’s articles 
of association to the maximum extent 
permitted by law. Prior to the adoption of 
new articles of association by shareholders 
on 3 September 2008, all directors in 
appointment on that date had separate 
deeds of indemnity. These indemnities, 
which still remain in force, are available  
for inspection by shareholders at the 
Company’s registered office during 
normal business hours and will be 
available for inspection at the AGM.
Neither the insurance nor the indemnities 
provide cover where the relevant director 
or officer has acted fraudulently or 
dishonestly.
Articles of association
The Company’s articles of association  
set out the Company’s internal regulation 
and cover such matters as the rights  
of shareholders, the appointment and 
removal of directors, the power to issue 
and buy back shares and the conduct of 
Board and general meetings. A copy of 
the Company’s articles of association is 
available on the Group’s website or on 
request from the company secretary. 
Amendments to the articles of association 
must be approved by at least 75% of 
those voting in person or by proxy at  
a general meeting of the Company.
In accordance with the Company’s articles 
of association, directors can be appointed 
or removed by the Board or by 
shareholders in general meeting. Subject 
to the provisions of relevant legislation, 
the Company’s articles of association and 
any directions given by a special resolution 
of the shareholders, the Board of directors 
may exercise all the powers of the 
Company and may delegate authorities  
to committees and management as it sees 
fit. Details of the main committees of the 
Board are contained in the Corporate 
Governance Report (pages 64 to 75) and 
on the Group’s website.

association may be viewed at:

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Governance
Research and development
The Group develops and delivers 
innovative technical solutions to its clients, 
the costs of which are expensed to the 
income statement. The Group obtains 
enhanced tax relief for these costs in 
certain territories.
Suppliers
The Group’s policy is to agree terms and 
conditions for its business transactions 
with suppliers, to ensure that suppliers  
are made aware of the agreed terms  
and conditions and to endeavour to abide  
by these terms and conditions, subject  
to the supplier meeting its obligations.
No one supplier arrangement is 
considered to be essential to the business 
of the Group.
The Company, as a holding company,  
did not have any amounts owing to trade 
creditors as at 31 March 2013.
In the UK, the Group is now an approved 
signatory of the Prompt Payment Code. 
This evidences a commitment to pay 
suppliers on time and in line with the 
agreed terms, having clear processes  
in place for suppliers and resolving 
disputes as quickly as possible. More 
detailed information, including  
contact details, can be found on  
the Prompt Payment Code website:  
www.promptpaymentcode.org.uk.
Political donations and expenditure
The Group made no political donations 
and incurred no political expenditure  
in the UK or European Union during  
the year ended 31 March 2013  
(31 March 2012: nil).
On 1 October 2010 the Group completed 
the acquisition of The PBSJ Corporation 
and its subsidiaries (the acquired 
companies). On acquisition, the acquired 
companies had, in accordance with 
relevant US Federal and state election 
laws, historically made political donations 
in the US both directly and to affiliated  
US state and Federal political action 
committees (PACs).
From 1 April 2011 until 25 June 2011,  
the affiliated PACs were funded partly  
by contributions from the acquired 
companies and partly by employee 
contributions. Donations made via the 
PACs were the only donations made by 
the acquired companies in the financial 
year ended 31 March 2012. Since  
25 June 2011, the PACs have been  
funded solely by employee contributions.
From 1 April 2012, we introduced a policy 
of making corporate political donations 
only on the following basis:
•	 d i r ec t ly 	 t o 	 non - p a r t i s an 	 b a l lo t 	 i n i t i a t iv es	
supporting infrastructure development 
and maintenance
•	 t o 	 i n d ivi du a l 	 ca n d i d a t es 	 a n d 	 pol i t i ca l	
parties only via the affiliated PACs, 
funded entirely by employee 
contributions.
During the year ended 31 March 2013, 
corporate political donations in the  
US of $18,800 (£11,894) were made 
(2012: $4,320 (£2,837) restated). In 
addition, the affiliated PACs continued  
to make donations funded entirely  
by employee contributions.
Charitable donations
During the year, the Group made 
charitable donations of £139,311 (2012: 
£135,764 restated). The beneficiaries  
of these donations were local charities 
serving the communities in which the 
Group operates or charities working in 
areas relevant to the Group’s activities. 
The Group intends to continue its focus 
on supporting local charities in the current 
financial year.
Shares
Share capital
As at the date of this report, the 
Company’s share capital consists of 
104,451,799 issued and fully paid ordinary 
shares each with a nominal value of 0.5p, 
listed on the London Stock Exchange,  
and American Depositary Shares (ADSs). 
Shares may be held in certificated or 
uncertificated form. Further details of the 
Company’s authorised and issued share 
capital, including changes during the year, 
can be found in note 32 to the Financial 
Statements (page 152).
The rights and obligations attaching to the 
Company’s ordinary shares are contained 
in the Company’s articles of association.  
In summary, the ordinary shares and ADSs 
allow holders to receive dividends and to 
exercise one vote on a poll per ordinary 
share for every holder present in person  
or by proxy at general meetings of the 
Company. Shares held in treasury are  
not entitled to vote or receive dividends. 
There are no restrictions on the transfer  
or sale of ordinary shares or ADSs and  
no requirements for prior approval of  
any transfers, except as described below. 
Under the Company’s articles of 
association, the directors have the power 
to suspend voting rights and the right to 
receive dividends in respect of ordinary 
shares and to refuse to register a transfer 
of ordinary shares in circumstances where 
the holder of those shares fails to comply 
with a notice issued under section 793  
of the Act. The directors also have the 
power to refuse to register any transfer  
of certificated shares that does not satisfy 
the conditions set out in the articles of 
association.
Shares acquired through Atkins’ employee 
share schemes rank equally with all  
other ordinary shares in issue and have  
no special rights. The trustees of the 
Company’s employee benefit trusts (EBTs) 
have waived the rights of the EBTs to 
receive dividends on shares they hold, 
with one EBT fully waiving this right and 
another waiving the right to dividends in 
excess of 0.01p per share. In addition 
neither of the trustees of the EBTs 
exercises their right to vote in respect of 
such shares. Shares held in trust on behalf 
of participants in the Atkins Share 
Incentive Plan are voted by the trustee, 
Capita IRG Trustees Limited, as directed  
by plan participants. Details of share 
based payments, including information 
regarding the shares held by the EBTs,  
can be found in note 33 to the Financial 
Statements (page 153).
At the AGM held in 2012 shareholders 
granted authority for the directors to allot 
relevant securities up to approximately 
one third of the issued share capital and  
a further one third in connection with  
an offer by way of a rights issue. The 
directors intend to seek shareholder 
approval for an equivalent authority  
at this year’s AGM, details of which  
are contained in the Notice of Meeting. 62 Governance
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Directors’ Report
continued
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders that 
might result in the restriction of transfer  
or voting rights in relation to the shares 
held by such shareholders.
Share purchases
At the AGM held in 2012, the Company 
was granted authority by shareholders  
to purchase up to 10,011,000 ordinary 
shares, representing approximately 10% 
of the Company’s ordinary share capital  
as at 13 June 2012. No ordinary shares 
were purchased pursuant to this authority 
during the year ended 31 March 2013  
or to the date of this Annual Report. This 
authority will expire at the forthcoming 
AGM and the Company will seek 
shareholder approval for an equivalent 
authority (such authority being in 
accordance with current best practice)  
at this year’s AGM.
4,341,000 ordinary shares of 0.5p each, 
representing approximately 4.2% of the 
Company’s issued share capital, were  
held in treasury (the treasury shares) 
throughout the year and to the date of 
this Annual Report following a historic 
share buyback programme.
Significant shareholders
As at the year end and the date of this 
Annual Report, the Company had been 
notified of holdings of 3% or more of the 
total voting rights attaching to its issued 
share capital as detailed in table 1.
Change of control
No agreement with a director or 
employee of the Company provides  
for compensation for loss of office  
or employment (whether through 
resignation, purported redundancy  
or otherwise) that occurs as a result  
of a change of control.
All of the Company’s employee share 
schemes contain provisions relating  
to a change of control of the Company. 
Under these provisions, a change of 
control would normally be a vesting  
event, facilitating the exercise of options 
or transfer of allocations subject to any 
relevant performance conditions being 
satisfied.
The Company is not a party to any other 
significant agreements that take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of 
control other than its funding facilities, 
which provide that in such a situation the 
Company may be unable to draw down 
any further amounts under the facilities 
and/or that they may be cancelled.
Directors’ statement of responsibility
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the Remuneration 
Report and the Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. The directors have prepared 
the Group and Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law the 
directors must not approve the Financial 
Statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and the Group 
and of the profit or loss of the Company 
and the Group for that period.
In preparing the Financial Statements,  
the directors are required to:
•	 se lec t 	 s u i ta b le 	 ac c o u n t i ng 	 pol i c ies	 
and then apply them consistently
•	 m a k e 	 j u dge me n t s 	 a n d 	 ac c o u n t i ng	
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent
•	 sta t e 	 wh e t h e r 	 a pp l i ca b le 	 I F R S s 	 a s

inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue  
in business.

Governance
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose  
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and  
the Group and that enable them to ensure 
that the Financial Statements and the 
Remuneration Report comply with the  
Act and, as regards the Group Financial 
Statements, Article 4 of the International 
Accounting Standard Regulation. They  
are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group  
and hence for taking reasonable steps  
for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, whose names and 
functions are listed in this Annual Report 
(pages 58 and 59), confirms that, to the 
best of his/her knowledge:
•	 t h e 	 Di r ec t or s ’ 	 R epor t 	 c on ta i ned 	 i n 	 t h e	
Annual Report includes a fair review of 
the development and performance  
of the business and the position of the

have been prepared in accordance  
with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit or loss of the Group.
Going concern
The directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and  
the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for  
the foreseeable future and therefore 
continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Financial Statements.
Disclosure of audit information
The directors confirm that, as at the date 
this Annual Report was approved, so far 
as each director is aware there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware and that  
he or she has taken all the steps that he  
or she ought to have taken as a director  
in order to make himself or herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and  
to establish that the Company’s auditor  
is aware of that information.
Independent auditor
The Company’s independent auditor, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has 
expressed its willingness to continue  
in office and resolutions for its 
reappointment and to authorise the 
directors to determine its remuneration 
will be proposed at the forthcoming 
AGM.

Cautionary statement
Under the Companies Act 2006, a company’s 
directors’ report is required, among other matters,  
to contain a fair review by the directors of the 
company’s and, if applicable, group’s business 
through a balanced and comprehensive analysis  
of the development and performance of the business 
of the company and group and the position of the 
company and group at the year end, consistent with 
the size and complexity of the business.
The directors’ report set out above, including the 
Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s 
Statement, Our Strategy, the Business Review,  
the Human Resources Review, the Corporate 
Responsibility Review, the Corporate Governance 
Report, the Remuneration Report and certain notes 
to the accounts incorporated into it by reference 
(together, the Directors’ Report), has been prepared 
only for the shareholders of the Company as a whole 
and its sole purpose and use is to assist shareholders 
to exercise their governance rights. In particular, the 
Directors’ Report has not been audited or otherwise 
independently verified and no warranty is given as  
to its accuracy or completeness (other than any such 
warranty which is mandatorily implied by statute). 
The Company and its directors and the Group’s 
employees are not responsible for any other purpose 
or use or to any other person in relation to the 
Directors’ Report.
The Directors’ Report contains indications of likely 
future developments and other forward looking 
statements that are subject to risk factors associated 
with, among other things, the economic and business 
circumstances occurring from time to time in the 
countries, sectors and business segments in which 
the Group operates. These factors include, but are 
not limited to, those discussed under Principal risks 
and uncertainties (pages 40 to 43). These and other 
factors could adversely affect the Group’s results, 
strategy and prospects. Forward looking statements 
involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. They 
relate to events and/or depend on circumstances  
in the future which could cause actual results and 
outcomes to differ materially from those currently 
expected. No obligation is assumed to update any 
forward looking statements, whether as a result  
of new information, future events or otherwise. 64 Governance
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Corporate Governance Report
Letter from the chairman
Dear Shareholder
In my role as chairman of the Board I seek to create a highly effective working dynamic, encouraging debate 
and fostering the link between the independent non-executive directors and executive management. My aim 
is to ensure the Board fully engages with the business and understands the dynamics of the Group at all levels. 
An effective board, able to make well informed decisions, is critical to our success.
The Company benefits from having well informed, engaged and committed directors who participate in 
robust and challenging debate. 
Best practice
This year, as every year, the Board reviewed the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code) published by the Financial Reporting Council (the FRC) in 2010. This is the standard against 
which we were required to measure ourselves in the year ended 31 March 2013. Last year, a new edition of 
the Code was published (the 2012 Code) which applies to the Company from 1 April 2013. In line with our 
usual approach, we have sought, as far as possible, to comply with the 2012 Code before 1 April 2013.
Diversity 
Diversity, particularly gender diversity, remains an important priority for us, the public and our investors. The 
Board continues to aspire to a membership of at least one third women by 2015, without compromising its 
focus on diversity of thought and experience as key drivers of its effectiveness. Within our businesses, 
proactive steps are being taken to increase gender diversity, as discussed in greater detail in the Human 
Resources Review (page 49). 
We continue to monitor developments in best practice and regulation in this area, particularly in considering 
Board succession planning. I am pleased to report that the Company already meets the proposed European 
Union (EU) objective that 40% of non-executive directors on listed boards should be female by 2020.
Succession planning
Lord Boyce, our senior independent director, will retire from the Board at the conclusion of our annual general 
meeting (AGM) on 31 July 2013. He has served the Company for nine years and I would like to thank him for 
his contribution and support during that time. The Board and I are delighted that Fiona Clutterbuck, who has 
served as a non-executive director since March 2007, will take up the position of senior independent director 
on his retirement.
Shareholder engagement
Our engagement with investors continues to evolve. We have a programme of regular analyst presentations 
and breakfasts throughout the year. In addition, in the lead up to the 2012 AGM, there was a period  
of extensive engagement with institutional shareholders regarding the Company’s review of executive 
remuneration. The Board is grateful to shareholders for their involvement in this process and pleased that  
the proposals received their broad support.
Performance evaluation
This year the Board underwent an externally facilitated performance evaluation. Details of this exercise, 
including a description of the resulting actions, can be found later in this report. An update on the actions 
resulting from the 2011 Board evaluation, conducted by myself in accordance with the Code, is also provided.
Yours sincerely
Allan Cook
Chairman

Governance
Statement of compliance with the Code
Throughout the year ended 31 March 2013 the Company complied with the provisions of the Code, a copy of which is available on 
the FRC’s website: www.frc.org.uk. Compliance with the 2012 Code is required commencing from 1 April 2013. However, the Board 
accepts that it represents a statement of best practice and, as such, it has reviewed its practices relative to it and this is reflected  
in additional information included within this report.
The disclosures that follow mirror the five sections of the Code: Leadership, Effectiveness, Accountability, Remuneration and Relations 
with shareholders. 
Full details of the Group’s governance framework are available on the Group’s website: www.atkinsglobal.com/investors_governance.
Leadership
The Board is responsible for ensuring the long term success of the Company. It does so by determining the Company’s long term 
direction and strategic aims within a framework of appropriate and robust controls. A key principle of the framework is the 
delegation of operational management to the chief executive officer with a matrix of authorities setting out how this is further 
delegated through the organisation. This enables the efficient and effective day to day operation of the Group’s businesses.
Further details on the roles of the chairman, chief executive officer and senior independent director can be found on the Group’s 
website: www.atkinsglobal.com/investors_leadership. An overview of the role of the senior leadership team (SLT), through which  
the chief executive officer discharges his responsibilities, is also provided.
The Board has reserved a number of matters for its sole consideration. These include:
•	 c o n si de r a t ion 	 a n d 	 a pp r o v a l 	 o f 	 st r a t egy

While the Board has specific responsibility for the matters reserved for its consideration, in certain areas specific responsibility is 
delegated to committees of the Board within defined terms of reference. The activities of these committees are discussed in more 
detail later in this report and their terms of reference are available on the Group’s website or on request from the company secretary.
In addition the Board may delegate authority to a standing committee, consisting of any two directors, to provide final sign off for  
an agreed course of action within predefined parameters.

Directors’ conflicts of interest
Each director is required, in accordance with the Act, to declare any interests that may give rise to a conflict of interest with the 
Company on appointment and subsequently as they arise. Where such a conflict, or potential conflict, arises the Board is empowered 
under the Company’s articles of association to consider and authorise such conflicts as appropriate. In addition, the Company 
undertakes an annual review of all authorised conflicts to ensure such authorisation remains appropriate, the last such review having 
taken place in November 2012.

Succession planning
We are pleased that the Board benefits from a broad range of backgrounds and skills. The Board succession plan is framed with  
the aim of retaining appropriate diversity of thought and experience to enable the Company to implement its strategy. Considerable 
effort has also been put into developing talent below Board level, notably through the introduction of a Group leadership 
development programme.
The executive search firm Korn/Ferry Whitehead Mann has provided support on our most recent Board appointments. We are 
pleased that it has signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms, which promotes gender diversity and  
best practice for corporate board search processes.
Gender imbalance below Board level is widely recognised as a potential factor in gender imbalance at Board level. The Company  
has sought to address this through various initiatives, as set out in the Human Resources Review (page 49). As part of the succession 
planning exercise, a number of female employees have been identified as potential future leaders. It is hoped this will create a pipeline 
of senior female talent in both management and technical roles. 
Board and employee diversity
The Board is committed to gender diversity both within its own membership and within the Group. The topic of women’s 
representation on boards remains high on the agenda for governments and the public. In April 2013 Lord Davies of Abersoch 
published his second annual progress report on this matter. He has called for chief executive officers to set out the percentage  
of women they aim to have on their executive committees and in senior management levels within their organisation by 2015.  
We are pleased to confirm that we have set a short term target of increasing female representation in both the senior management 
population (the top 1,000 employees in the Group) and the SLT to 15% by 31 March 2015. At present, women account for 12.4%  
of the senior management population (2012: 11.3%) and 14.3% of the SLT.
Board diversity was further addressed as part of the externally facilitated Board evaluation, which is discussed in more detail later  
in this report. The Board’s current diversity is shown in table 2 below.

Performance evaluation 
The Board recognises the need to maintain its ongoing development to ensure its continued effectiveness and to continue to respond 
to evolving best practice. This involves a continuous process of:
•	 r eflec t i ng	 on 	 p a st 	 pe r f orm a n c e 	 a n d 	 t h e 	 i m p le me n ta t ion 	 o f 	 p a st 	 ac t ion s
•	 c o n si de r a t ion 	 o f 	 f u t u r e 	 t r a i n i ng , 	 sk i l l 	 a n d 	 d iv e r si t y 	 r equ i r e me n t s
•	 i de n t ifica t ion	 a n d 	 i m p le me n ta t ion 	 o f 	 ne w 	 ac t ion s 	 t o 	 i m p r o v e 	 pe r f orm a n c e .
The Board recognises that the process of improving its effectiveness requires continuous attention, particularly in respect of actions 
such as ensuring the correct Board balance (2011), succession planning (2010 and 2011) and Board focus (2010).
The Board undertakes a rigorous and formal evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and directors annually. The 
Board believes that an external evaluation every three years brings new insight into its processes and performance. The planned 2011 
external evaluation was postponed on account of Prof Dr Uwe Krueger’s recent appointment as chief executive officer. It was felt that 
delaying the external evaluation would enable his leadership of the business to be fully embedded and that, as a consequence, the 
review by a third party would be of greater value at a later date. Accordingly, the 2012 evaluation exercise was externally facilitated  
by Independent Board Evaluation, which has no other connection with the Company.
Independent Board Evaluation conducted interviews with each member of the Board, the company secretary, representatives from 
the senior management team, the independent auditor, the internal auditor and the Company’s broker. It also compared the Board’s 
composition and aspects of its governance with those of companies of a similar size, complexity and in a similar line of business.  
The Board requested that the following areas of its role and performance be explored in depth during the evaluation process:
•	 a c c o u n ta b i l i t y , 	 go v e rn a n c e 	 a n d 	 c u l t u r e

by management.
The Board received a written report and presentation from Independent Board Evaluation. The written report and presentation, 
which identified areas for improvement, was debated and discussed in detail. A clear action plan for the year ahead was then 
developed and approved.
The actions identified in the 2012 review build upon the actions identified in previous years and focus on the role of the Board,  
the diversity of the Board and communication with the Board. In particular, the continuing implementation of the actions to provide 
more timely and detailed management data (2011) and enhance the rolling 12 month agenda (2010) has improved the effectiveness 
of Board and Committee meetings. This led to a discussion on the wider remit of the Board and the proposal that Board members  
be encouraged to increase their input into the Company outside meetings to maximise the benefit of their experience and skills and 
provide them with a deeper knowledge of the Group.
The key findings of the 2012 performance review will be implemented in the current financial year and progress will be considered  
as part of the next performance evaluation.
Commitment
During the year all directors, including the non-executive directors, committed significant time to the Company, in line with the 
requirements stated in their letters of appointment and service contracts.
Development, business awareness and induction
Allan Cook regularly reviews training requirements with each director. The company secretary ensures suitable opportunities are 
identified. During the year the directors have undertaken training on topics including cyber security and the global economic outlook. 
The Board also receives regular updates from the company secretary on legal, regulatory and governance developments, which 
highlight any impact they may have on the Board and/or the Group.
On joining the Board, directors take part in a formal induction process. This includes the provision of past Board materials to provide 
background information on the Group, information on Board processes and governance, site visits and meetings with key employees. 
The induction is tailored to each new director’s specific needs.  70 Governance

Governance
The Group operates through a devolved and decentralised structure, which is considered key to its ability to deliver services to its 
clients and this is reflected in our governance framework. Under this structure the Board has delegated operational responsibility  
to the chief executive officer, who then delegates authority and control to the regional chief executive officers (who are all members  
of the SLT). Authority is further delegated from them to the managing directors of the principal businesses and then downward  
to business and project managers as appropriate. This approach is reflected in the revised governance framework as follows:

The governance framework is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve stated business objectives.  
It can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Joint ventures in which the Company does not have overall control are not covered by the Group’s governance framework. For these 
joint ventures, systems of internal control are applied as agreed between the joint venture parties but as far as possible we insist on 
compliance with our governance requirements as a minimum.
The Board monitored and reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s governance framework, including internal controls 
and risk management, on a continuous basis throughout the year ended 31 March 2013 and up to the date of approval of the Annual 
Report. Support was provided by the Group Risk Committee, the internal audit function and the Company’s independent auditor. 72 Governance

Audit Committee
Letter from the Audit Committee chairman
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Audit Committee’s annual report on its activities.
The role of the Committee has continued to grow in recent years in response to the increasing expectations  
of stakeholders. The continuing uncertainty of the global economic environment has resulted in increased 
scrutiny of all companies and their audit committees from regulators, investors and other stakeholders. I would 
like to thank my fellow Committee members for their continued dedication to the work of the Committee.
Internal auditor
Ernst & Young (EY) was appointed in 2010 to provide internal audit services to the Group. The Committee  
has been very satisfied with the development of the internal audit function since this appointment, particularly 
its use of best practice processes and its more balanced approach to both operational and financial audits. 
EY’s ability to scale resource and deploy specialists where necessary in support of this approach has led to  
a marked improvement in the internal audit service.
Independent auditor
During the year the Committee has kept under review future regulatory and best practice developments  
in connection with its role and responsibilities. In particular, it has considered the requirements under the  
2012 Code for the independent audit contract to be put out to tender every 10 years. In line with the FRC’s 
proposed transitional guidelines, it is currently proposed that the Company will consider this to coincide with 
the end of the tenure of the current lead audit partner. Any recommendation for the reappointment of the 
independent auditor will continue to be the subject of rigorous review each year.
This year, having considered the effectiveness and performance of the independent auditor, the Committee 
has recommended to the Board the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as independent 
auditor of the Company.
Yours sincerely
Joanne Curin
Audit Committee chairman

Independent auditor
The independent auditor is currently PwC, which has acted in this capacity since the Company listed on the London Stock Exchange 
in 1996. During the year the Committee conducted a review of the relationship with the independent auditor, as well as its 
qualification, expertise and resources and the effectiveness and quality of the audit. It concluded that PwC’s appointment continues 
to meet the Group’s needs and therefore recommended its reappointment as independent auditor to the Board.
The independence of the independent auditor is evidenced through its challenge to management. Its independence and objectivity 
are assured through the rotation of the audit partner on a regular basis, the last such rotation having taken place in 2012. 
Accordingly, the Committee has not considered it necessary to date to undertake a tender process for the audit work, although  
it has considered PwC’s tenure and appointment on an annual basis. There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company’s 
choice of independent auditor. 74 Governance

continued
The Committee understands that certain work of a non-audit nature may be best undertaken by the independent auditor as  
a result of its unique position and knowledge of key areas of the Company. Approval is required prior to the independent auditor 
commencing non-audit work in accordance with a Group policy, summarised in table 3. This policy is drafted with a view to 
preserving the independence and objectivity of the independent auditor and is approved annually by the Committee. The impact  
on independence, if any, of non-audit work performed by the independent auditor is also considered regularly by the Committee.  
The policy sets out safeguards to be considered when engaging the independent auditor for non-audit services. The appointment  
of former employees of the independent auditor to positions in the Group is also regulated by the Committee.

Approval

Executive management (via the Group finance director 
and company secretary) has delegated authority to use 
the independent auditor without prior consultation  
with the Committee (although the nature of, and fees 
associated with, that work will be regularly reported  
to the Committee).
The independent auditor’s audit partner also has to 
approve any such engagement before it can proceed.
Following a supplier review, if 
management does identify the 
independent auditor as being the best 
supplier in a specific field and also believes 
that such an assignment does not run the 
risk of prejudicing its independence, then 
an evaluated request will be made to the 
Committee to confirm the appointment.
Appointments for non-material fee levels 
may be approved by the Group finance 
director.
The independent auditor’s audit partner 
also has to approve any such engagement 
before it can proceed.

Note 5 to the Financial Statements (page 126) sets out the fees paid to the independent auditor for audit and non-audit work. The 
Committee concluded that the level of non-audit fees, which represent a value of 67% of the audit fees for the Group, did not have 
any impact upon PwC’s independence.  Governance 75

Remuneration
Details of the directors’ remuneration and the work of the Remuneration Committee can be found in the Remuneration Report 
(pages 76 to 96).
Relations with shareholders
The primary means used by the Board for communicating with all Company shareholders are the Annual Report, preliminary 
statement of annual results and half year results and the AGM. It also recognises the importance of the internet as a means  
of communicating widely, quickly and cost-effectively. An investor relations section is provided on the Group’s website:  
www.atkinsglobal.com/investors to facilitate communications with shareholders. This includes material shared with institutional 
investors, fund managers and analysts at meetings.
Shareholders play a vital role in the Group’s governance and their increasingly active engagement is welcomed. The investor relations 
director, alongside the chief executive officer, Group finance director and chairman, provides a focal point for communication with 
investors and we are always keen to engage with potential new investors. The Group’s strengthened approach to investor relations 
enables it to be more proactive in its engagement with both shareholders and non-shareholders. The chairman sent letters to all  
the Company’s major investors in March of this year inviting them to contact him or the senior independent director if they wished  
to discuss any elements of the Company’s governance, performance, strategy or other matters.
The chief executive officer and Group finance director present the preliminary statement of annual results and half year results to 
institutional investors and analysts. These are also available via webcast and teleconference. Analyst breakfasts are hosted regularly, 
last year’s having focused on UK growth opportunities and the US consultancy market. The chief executive officer, Group finance 
director and investor relations director regularly attend conferences and roadshows to give shareholders, and other potential 
investors, access to management.
Retail shareholders have the opportunity to attend our AGM, where all directors are expected to be available to answer questions. 
They are also able to submit questions in writing at any time. All of the directors in appointment at the time attended our AGM  
in August 2012 and were available to speak to shareholders.
We intend to call a poll for all resolutions to be considered at the 2013 AGM. This ensures the Company continues to follow best 
practice and allows all shareholders, present in person or by proxy, to vote on all resolutions in proportion to their shareholding. 
Details of the 2013 AGM are set out in the separate Notice of Meeting.

Remuneration Report
Letter from the Remuneration Committee chairman
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee’s annual report on directors’ remuneration.
I have now completed my first full year as chairman of the Committee and I would like to thank my fellow 
Committee members for their support during the year. We remain mindful of the continued attention the 
subject of executive remuneration is receiving and have continued to balance carefully shareholder 
requirements with appropriate incentivisation and motivation of executive management.
Reviewing the performance of the past year, the Group has delivered another year of good results in 
worldwide markets that continue to be challenging. In particular, it is pleasing to see the increase in our 
underlying profit before tax on revenue that was broadly the same as last year. Our success over the last  
75 years has been due to the expertise, hard work, dedication and quality of our people and appropriate 
remuneration plays a key role in ensuring we are able to recruit and retain these individuals at all levels  
of the organisation.
The Committee concluded a comprehensive review of remuneration during the year and implemented  
a new framework that sought to:
•	 i m p r o v e 	 st r a t eg i c 	 a l i g n me n t
•	 p r o vi de 	 t h e 	 r i g h t 	 b a l a n c e 	 be t w ee n 	 shor t 	 a n d 	 long 	 t e rm 	 i n c e n t iv es
•	 a l i g n 	 se n ior 	 m a n a ge me n t 	 r e m u ne r a t ion 	 wi t h 	 t h a t 	 o f 	 t h e 	 ex ec u t iv e 	 d i r ec t or s
•	 r ec og n i se 	 t h a t 	 w e 	 ope r a t e 	 a 	 peop le 	 b u si ness , 	 wh e r e 	 r e wa r d 	 a n d 	 i n c e n t iv e 	 st r u c t u r e 	 i s 	 c r i t i ca l 	 t o 	 o u r 	 s u c c ess
•	 a c h ie v e 	 t h i s 	 wh i l st 	 no t 	 i n c r e a si ng 	 qu a n t u m 	 f or 	 ex ec u t iv e 	 d i r ec t or s.
During the consultation exercise we undertook with shareholders following this review, we identified the 
pertinence of incorporating a cash flow measure into the annual bonus scheme, as this is a key indicator  
by which the Company and its shareholders measure the performance of the business. We have worked on 
this proposal over the last year and I am pleased to report that a cash conversion target has been included  
in the annual bonus for the executive directors and other senior management for 2013/14. Further details  
are available in this report (page 83) but, in summary, 25% of executive directors’ bonuses in 2013/14 will  
be based on the cash conversion measure.
The changes to the remuneration framework were explained in detail in last year’s report and so are not 
covered in the same level of detail this year. Instead, the report this year focuses on the implementation  
of the framework and how this achieves the stated objectives.
In June 2012 the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills (BIS) published draft remuneration reporting 
regulations (the Directors’ Remuneration Regulations). Consultation on the Directors’ Remuneration 
Regulations has continued throughout the year and a further draft was published in March 2013. The 
Committee had already taken significant steps last year to increase the transparency of its reporting, including:
•	 t h e 	 d i sc los u r e 	 o f 	 a 	 si ng le 	 fi gu r e	 f or 	 ex ec u t iv e 	 d i r ec t or 	 r e m u ne r a t ion ; 	 a n d
•	 a n 	 i l l u st r a t ion 	 o f 	 t h e 	 v a l ue 	 o f 	 ex ec u t iv e 	 d i r ec t or 	 p ac k a ges 	 u n de r 	 d i f f e r e n t 	 pe r f orm a n c e 	 sc e n a r ios.
The Committee continues to keep the disclosures required under the Directors’ Remuneration Regulations 
under review and has taken the decision this year to enhance disclosures in line with the anticipated content  
of the Directors’ Remuneration Regulations where considered appropriate and helpful to shareholders in 
understanding our remuneration structure.
In line with current requirements, we will put the remuneration report to an advisory shareholder vote at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting (AGM). Last year, we achieved a vote of 97.03% in favour of the report, 
2.97% against and 3,331,060 abstentions. I very much hope you will show the same support for this year’s 
report.

The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board. Its terms of reference are available on the Company’s website:  
www.atkinsglobal.com or on request from the company secretary. The Committee has responsibility for setting remuneration policy 
and structure for the Company’s chairman and executive directors. The Committee also has oversight of remuneration practice across  
the Group, including the senior leadership team.
Committee membership
The independent non-executive directors who served on the Committee during the year are shown in table 1.

Admiral the Lord Boyce 5 May 2004 To date
Fiona Clutterbuck 15 June 2009 To date

Rodney Slater 9 September 2011 To date
The Committee met six times during the year (2012: nine). Details of the attendance of members at meetings can be found in the 
Corporate Governance Report (page 67). The diversity of thought and perspective represented by members of the Committee, 
drawing on insights into both the public and the private sectors, is particularly valued by the Board.
Committee meetings are attended by the Group HR director, Alun Griffiths. The chairman of the Board and the chief executive officer 
also attend meetings at the discretion of the Committee chairman. The company secretary or deputy company secretary acts as 
secretary to the Committee. No director or other attendee, including the company secretary, participates in discussions regarding 
their own remuneration.
Advisors to the Committee
Last year, the Committee appointed Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) as the provider of advice on remuneration policy and structure, replacing 
New Bridge Street Consultants (NBSC). Deloitte subsequently supported the executive remuneration review that developed the 
remuneration framework implemented with effect from the start of the current financial year.
During the year, the Committee received independent advice from Deloitte on remuneration policy and structure. Deloitte also 
monitored the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) performance. Deloitte did not provide any other material services to the 
Group. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group (the RCG), which was formed in 2009 with the aim of the 
stewardship and development of a voluntary code of conduct (the RCG Code of Conduct) that clearly sets out the role of executive 
remuneration consultants and the professional standards by which they advise their clients, whether their clients be remuneration 
committees or executive management. Deloitte adheres to the RCG Code of Conduct and, as a member of the RCG, contributes  
to its periodic review.
Tapestry LLP (Tapestry) provided legal advice with respect to share plans. It did not provide any other material services to the Group. 
The Committee also consulted the chairman of the Board, the chief executive officer, the Group HR director and the company 
secretary regarding remuneration policy.
Committee activities
In addition to considering remuneration matters as they arise, such as the new Directors’ Remuneration Regulations currently being 
developed by BIS, the Committee uses a schedule of standing agenda items to help structure the agendas for its meetings. This 
schedule is aligned to the reward communication programme for all employees within the Group, which is in turn aligned with the 
Company’s financial year. It commences in April with the confirmation to employees of their remuneration for the year ahead. This  
is followed by notification of their bonuses for the prior financial year after the announcement of the Group’s preliminary results for 
that year in June. Remuneration policy and market practice are kept under review throughout the year. The key matters discussed 
during the year included:

Remuneration policy and structure
Alignment with our strategy
The remuneration framework was comprehensively reviewed in the previous financial year and a revised framework was implemented 
with effect from the current financial year. The principal aim of the review was to improve the alignment of remuneration with 
strategy. Our strategic direction continues to be to deliver long term shareholder value through a focus on core growth sectors in 
engineering and design. As set out in Our Strategy (pages 10 to 13), this strategy has three principal priorities over the medium term:
• 	 oper a ti o n a l 	 ex c e l l enc e
•	 por t f ol io 	 op t i m i s a t ion
•	 sec t or 	 a n d 	 r eg ion a l 	 f oc u s.
The overall objective of our strategy remains to create shareholder value through:
•	 d r ivi ng 	 m a r g i n s 	 a bo v e 	 8%
•	 r edu c i ng 	 depe n de n c e 	 on 	 t h e 	 UK 	 ( wi t h 	 o u r 	 long 	 t e rm 	 a s p i r a t ion 	 be i ng 	 t o 	 h a v e 	 mor e 	 t h a n 	 7 5 % 	 o f 	 o u r 	 b u si ness 	 o u t si de 	 t h e 	 UK )

Remuneration in the context of the wider Group
As a people business our reward and incentive structure is critical to the success of our business. The principles that underpin our 
executive remuneration philosophy also cascade throughout the organisation. Participation in the success of the Group, both through 
bonus arrangements and, for the senior leadership team, through long term share-based awards, is a cornerstone of our 
remuneration framework. In determining salary increases for the executive directors, the Committee looks at salary increases across 
the Group. It also oversees the remuneration of members of the senior leadership team.
The Committee does not formally consult with employees regarding executive remuneration but regularly reviews the remuneration 
of staff throughout the Group to ensure that it is attuned to general pay and conditions when considering the remuneration of 
executives.
For the year ending 31 March 2014, the average salary increase across the Group was just above 3% compared to 3% for the chief 
executive officer and 3.5% for the Group HR director. The Group finance director received a salary increase of 7.4% and the reasons 
for this increase are provided later in this report (page 81).
The executive remuneration framework set out in this report also applies to the senior leadership team below the executive directors 
to ensure our executive team is rewarded on a consistent basis.
The Committee also recognises the importance of having reward structures that create a sense of ownership and participation in the 
long term growth of our shares. Around 1,150 Group employees participate in some form of share-based incentive arrangement.  
In addition, we offer a Share Incentive Plan to UK employees and, at the 2013 AGM, we obtained approval for new all employee 
share plans in the UK, the US and other major jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Further details on these all employee plans 
are provided later in this report (page 93).

across the wider workforce, the individual’s role and the level of salary awards in the rest of the business
The executive directors’ salaries have been increased with effect from 1 April 2013. Uwe Krueger’s and Alun Griffiths’ salaries 
increased by 3% and 3.5% respectively, in line with the average salary increase across the Group of just above 3%.
Heath Drewett received a salary increase of 7.4%. This increase, which is above the average salary increase across the Group, reflects 
the expanded remit of his role, which now encompasses several areas traditionally carried out by a chief operating officer and 
includes delivery of operational improvement programmes and increased involvement in the development of strategy.
The Committee has not undertaken a detailed benchmarking exercise since that undertaken as part of last year’s review of the 
remuneration framework. Based on a high level update to this previous benchmarking exercise, it believes executive director salaries 
are in line with companies of a similar size and complexity. 82 Governance

The maximum Company contribution to the defined contribution pension of other UK based staff is 10% of salary, except for those 
affected by the removal of the link to final salary, as discussed further below. Heath Drewett and Uwe Krueger receive higher 
contributions reflecting their roles as executive directors.
Alun Griffiths retains an entitlement to a defined benefit pension on the same basis as other long serving UK employees. During 2011 
a consultation was held with staff with a defined benefit pension entitlement to remove the link to final salary via an amendment  
to their contracts of employment. From 1 February 2012 this final salary link was removed and transitional relief is being paid to all 
employees (including Alun Griffiths) affected by the contractual change. The transitional relief is 2% of salary until 2015 and a further 
3% from 2015 to 2018. This is in addition to the maximum Company contribution of 10% of salary.
The contributions made to a pension plan on behalf of the executive directors or, where applicable, taxable allowance in lieu of 
pension during the year ended 31 March 2013 are set out in table 16 (page 94). Alun Griffiths’ defined benefit pension entitlements 
are set out in table 17 (page 94).
Other fixed benefits
The Company provides a number of other fixed benefits to ensure that this element of the remuneration package of the executive 
directors is competitive with those provided by other organisations. Details of these benefits are shown in table 5.

For awards in respect of financial years ending on or after 31 March 2013, the deferred shares will be subject to malus provisions 
which allow the Committee to reduce deferred awards in certain circumstances, as described in more detail later in this report  
(page 89).
Bonus framework for 2013/14
For the financial year ending 31 March 2014, 50% of the bonus for executive directors will be based on Group profit after tax 
performance. 50% of the maximum will be paid for meeting the budgeted profit after tax target and 100% for meeting a stretch 
target. The stretch target is set annually by the Committee at a level which is considered to be very challenging. In reaching a decision 
on the stretch target, the Committee is also mindful of the need to deliver shareholder value after payment of bonuses.
As discussed with shareholders during the review of executive remuneration undertaken in 2012, from this year we are introducing  
a cash conversion measure on which 25% of the bonus will be based. We believe that cash conversion is a key measure of business 
performance. This measure will apply to the executive directors, the senior leadership team and the regional management teams  
(a team of the 50 most senior managers across the Group).
The profit after tax target and cash conversion targets are considered commercially sensitive so will not be disclosed, although the 
Committee’s assessment of performance against these targets will be confirmed in next year’s report.
The remaining 25% will be based on individual objectives aligned to areas which underpin our strategic priorities over the coming 
years. For the year ending 31 March 2014, objectives have been set in relation to the following key strategic areas which relate to  
the specific role of each executive director. 84 Governance

The above provides the headline strategic areas under which performance targets have been set. The performance targets that apply 
to these areas are measurable, challenging and subject to rigorous review by the Committee, both at the time they are set, during the 
year and at the year end when performance is assessed. Subject to commercial sensitivity, we intend to provide an overview of the 
Committee’s assessment of performance against the underlying targets in next year’s report.
Executive directors will only receive bonus payments in relation to the achievement of their individual objectives if the threshold 
Group financial performance target is also met.
Bonus assessment for 2012/13
The Committee’s assessment of performance in the financial year ended 31 March 2013 is shown in table 6.

Component Overview of performance in 2012/13
Group financial 
target (75%)
As explained in the chairman’s statement (pages 6 and 7), the Company has delivered another year of good 
results in worldwide markets that continue to be challenging and this is reflected in bonus payments.
The reported profit after tax of £88.4m was above budget and exceeded the stretch financial target resulting 
in full payment of this component of bonus. The Committee considered quality, safety and environmental 
performance when making the bonus awards and determined that no adjustment was necessary.
Individual 
performance (25%)
Heath Drewett
Payment of 95% achieved following the effective introduction of new and improved management reporting, 
controls and risk management processes, and the successful execution of the Group’s debut issue in the

Payment of 95% achieved for the successful recruitment of key personnel and improvements to recruitment 
systems and processes, and the development and implementation of a comprehensive senior management 
development programme including initiatives to increase gender diversity.
Uwe Krueger
Payment of 72% achieved as a result of the successful implementation of initiatives to increase the influence 
and recognition of the Company, the development and implementation of a comprehensive senior 
management development programme including initiatives to increase gender diversity, and good progress

1.  Uwe Krueger’s bonus opportunity was pro rated to reflect his appointment with effect from 14 June 2011. The percentage stated is of annualised salary, not salary 
paid.
2.  The increase in absolute bonus compares the pro rated bonus paid for the year ended 31 March 2012 with the full year bonus for the year ended 31 March 2013.  
The increase in annualised bonus compares the equivalent full year bonus paid for the year ended 31 March 2012 with the full year bonus for the year ended  
31 March 2013. 
Other senior management will receive a bonus payment through the EBS, reflecting achievement against a combination of targets 
comprising Group financial performance, business financial performance and personal objectives. These employees are also required 
to defer one third of this bonus into a share award granted under the terms of the DSP, in line with the requirement for executive 
directors. In addition, around 38% of other Group employees will receive a discretionary cash bonus based on individual 
performance, for which there is no deferral.
Long term incentives
As a result of the review of the remuneration framework, the Committee concluded that the long term incentive framework should 
provide an element of reward that acts as an incentive to management to deliver long term performance and that it should be built 
around two performance measures, both of which are simple in design and fundamentally aligned to the creation of shareholder 
value, as illustrated in figure 2:
•	Growth in EPS. This was identified as the primary metric for measuring the delivery of our growth objective over the medium  
to long term. It is incorporated into the long term incentive framework via the LTIP, which is described in more detail later in this 
report (page 86) and is our primary long term incentive vehicle, reflecting the importance of EPS growth to our strategy
•	Sustained growth in the share price. This ensures alignment between executive reward and sustained share price growth over 
the long term, representing the ultimate measure of performance for our shareholders, and is incorporated into the long term 
incentive framework via the LGU, which is described in more detail later in this report (page 88).

LTIP award policy for 2013/14
At the 2012 AGM, shareholders approved the terms of the LTIP, which were substantially unchanged from the previous LTIP and  
are in line with established best practice principles.
Under the LTIP, the maximum award which may be granted to an individual within any 12 month period is 150% of salary. However, 
this limit also takes into account any awards made under the LGU plan within the same 12 month period. If no LGU award is made, 
the LTIP limit will remain at 150% of salary. If the maximum LGU award of 50% of salary is made, then the maximum LTIP award  
that can be made is reduced to 125% of salary. This is to ensure we maintain a broadly equivalent value for the individual limit 
(recognising that the face value of LTIP and LGU awards, as a percentage of salary, is not a like-for-like comparison). For LGU awards 
between 0% and 50%, the LTIP limit varies from 150% to 125% on a straight line pro rata basis.
While the terms of the LTIP allow awards of up to 150% of salary, our stated policy is that each executive director will receive a  
LTIP award of 75% of salary. The Committee intends to continue to apply this award policy for the foreseeable future, including in 
2013/14. The vesting of these awards will be subject to the EPS targets described in table 9.

Governance
The Committee believes that these EPS targets are appropriate and stretching in the current environment. Performance against the 
EPS targets will be measured over the period 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2016.
The lack of a relative total shareholder return (TSR) measure within the long term incentive framework reflects the Committee’s view 
that this measure is not appropriate for our business given the difficulties in determining a fair and appropriate group of listed peers, 
and the arbitrary outcomes that can arise when using a broad index, due to cyclical factors.
As part of the 2012 review, the Committee also developed a number of additional safeguards which apply alongside the targets 
above. The Committee has discretion to adjust vesting to take account of any of the following:

LTIP awards made in 2012/13
During the financial year ended 31 March 2013, following shareholder approval of the LTIP and in line with the Committee’s stated 
policy, executive directors received LTIP awards of 75% of salary (as shown in table 18 (pages 95 and 96)). These awards were subject 
to the EPS targets described in table 9.
LTIP awards vesting in 2012/13
LTIP awards made to executive directors in 2010 were based on EPS and TSR growth in the three years to 31 March 2012, measured 
against the performance conditions shown in tables 10(a) and 10(b) below. The Committee has determined that neither of the 
performance targets were met and therefore this award will lapse in full.

While the LTIP focuses executives on achieving strong EPS growth over a three year period, the LGU was developed by the Committee 
to reflect its belief that it is important to have an element of the long term incentive that is directly linked to sustainable long term 
increases in share price. The terms of the LGU were approved by shareholders at the 2012 AGM. The key features of the LGU plan

The basic concept behind the LGU plan is simple: it delivers value based on the long term growth in Atkins’ share price. LGU awards 
provide no value if the share price does not increase on a sustained basis. Therefore it is directly aligned with the value delivered for 
our shareholders.
The awards are intended to create a sense of ownership and participation in the long term performance of our shares, as we seek to 
retain the people we need to deliver our strategy over the coming years. They therefore vest over a longer time period than the LTIP 
and most conventional long term incentive plans.
Vesting of each tranche will be subject to the Committee being satisfied that share price performance is suitably underpinned by 
appropriate financial performance. Prior to the vesting of each tranche, the Committee will explicitly consider the Group’s progress 
against its strategy which may include consideration of:
• 	 m ar gi n
•	 exp a n sion 	 o f 	 i n t e rn a t ion a l 	 r e v e n ues

LGU award policy for 2013/14
The terms of the LGU allow awards of up to 50% of salary and it is our stated policy that each executive director will receive the 
maximum LGU award possible. The Committee intends to apply this award policy for the foreseeable future, including in 2013/14.
LGU awards made in 2012/13
During the financial year ended 31 March 2013, following shareholder approval of the LGU and in line with the Committee’s stated 
policy, executive directors received the maximum LGU award of 50% of salary.
Malus provisions
As a result of the remuneration review, the Committee has determined that malus provisions will be included in the LTIP and LGU  
and will apply for awards made in 2012 onwards and to deferred bonus awards granted under the DSP in respect of the financial year 
ended 31 March 2013 onwards.
These provisions will allow the Committee to reduce the number of shares to which an award relates (including to zero) in 
circumstances in which the Committee considers such action is appropriate. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to:

The executive directors’ service agreements include provision for the Company to make phased payments in the event that the 
agreement is terminated on giving 12 months’ notice. They also include a duty for the executive director to mitigate loss where the 
agreement is terminated and any payment in lieu of notice may be reduced to take account of such mitigation. No service agreement 
provides for predetermined amounts of compensation in the event of early termination of service contracts or any change of control

The service agreements are terminable on giving 12 months’ notice. Copies of each director’s service agreement will be available

External appointments
The Board and the Committee recognise the benefit we can obtain if our executive directors serve as non-executive directors of other 
companies. Subject to review in each case, the Board’s general policy is that each executive director may accept one non-executive 
directorship with another FTSE 350 company from which any fees received may be retained. At present no executive director holds 
such an appointment with a FTSE 350 company, although Uwe Krueger and Alun Griffiths are currently non-executive directors  
of the companies listed in table 13 and retain the fees payable, as outlined in respect of these appointments.

Copies of the letters of appointment of the chairman and non-executive directors will be available for inspection prior to and during 
the AGM and are also available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours.
The remuneration of the chairman is determined by the Committee. The Committee reviewed the chairman’s remuneration during 
the year and awarded an increase of 3%, in line with the average salary increase across the Group of just above 3%.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is reviewed annually by the executive directors in line with the schedule for the 
review of the remuneration of the chairman, the executive directors and all employees in the Group. The executive directors’ 
recommendation is made in light of remuneration levels within the Group, independent advice and on the basis of periodic 
benchmarking of the level of fees paid to non-executive directors of comparator companies.
The Board, on the recommendation of the executive directors, approved the following, as disclosed in table 15 (page 92):

The fees for both the chairman and the UK based non-executive directors are inclusive of normal travel expenses for travelling to  
and from the Group’s Epsom or London offices. Expenses are payable on all travel and subsistence to offices outside these areas  
in accordance with the Group’s normal policy. 92 Governance

Policy • 	 One 	 t i mes 	 sa l a r y
During its review of executive remuneration, the Committee considered carefully the shareholding guidelines for executive directors. 
Previously each executive director was encouraged to hold shares in the Company (either directly or through share awards made  
in connection with annual bonuses) equivalent to the level of their annual salary, based on the value of such shares at the time of  
their acquisition (or award), or their current market value from time to time, whichever is the higher. With effect from 1 April 2012, 
executive directors are ordinarily expected to build up an interest in the Company’s shares equivalent to one times their salary, based 
on the value of such shares at the time of the acquisition or their current market value, whichever is the higher. Such an interest 
would normally be expected to be built up within a five year period following the adoption of this policy.
The interests of the directors and their families in the ordinary shares of 0.5p each in the Company as at 31 March 2013 are shown  
in table 19 (page 96). As the shareholding guideline only came into effect on 1 April 2012 and allows five years to build up an 
interest, it is not yet possible to determine whether or not it has been met, although it can be seen that all executive directors have 
increased their shareholdings during the year.
Details of the share options and long term incentives of each executive director as at 31 March 2013 are given in table 18  
(pages 95 and 96).
For each share under option that had not expired at the end of the financial year, the mid market price on 28 March 2013 (being
the last trading day before 31 March 2013) was 912p and the highest and lowest mid market prices during the financial year were 
940p and 628.5p respectively.  Governance 93

Performance graph
Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 requires the Company 
to provide a graph comparing a hypothetical holding of shares in the Company with a broad equity market index over a five year 
period. The Company’s performance, measured by TSR, can be compared with the performance of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding 
investment trusts) over the past five years. This index is considered the most appropriate index against which to measure performance 
as the Company has been a member of the FTSE 250 for the whole of the five-year period. This is illustrated in figure 4.
Figure 4: Total shareholder return
TSR is defined as the return shareholders would receive on a notional holding of shares including dividends received on those shares 
over a period of time. Assuming dividends are reinvested into the Company’s shares, it measures the percentage growth in the 
Company’s share price together with the value of any dividends paid.
All employee share plans
The Company operates a Share Incentive Plan, as approved by HM Revenue & Customs, which is offered to all eligible UK employees,
including the executive directors.
In addition, at the AGM held in August 2012, the Company obtained approval of all employee share plans in countries where the 
Group has a significant presence. These took the form of:
•	 a 	 Sa v e 	 A s 	 Y o u 	 Ea rn 	 ( SA Y E 	 or 	 Sh a r esa v e ) 	 p l a n 	 i n 	 t h e 	 UK
•	 a 	 ‘ 4 2 3 	 p l a n ’ , 	 a n 	 Ame r i ca n 	 tax - f a v o u r ed 	 e m p lo y ee 	 sh a r e 	 p l a n 	 (a l so 	 k no wn 	 a s 	 a 	 ta x - qu a l ified	 E m p lo y ee 	 S t oc k 	 Pu r c h a se 	 Pl a n ) 	 si m i l ar

•	 a 	 w or l dwi de 	 a l l 	 e m p lo y ee 	 p l a n 	 i n 	 o t h e r 	 j u r i sd i c t ion s 	 wh e r e 	 t h e 	 G r o u p 	 h a s 	 a 	 si g n ifica n t	 p r ese n c e 	 s u c h 	 a s 	 t h e 	 Mi dd le 	 Ea st 	 an d 	 A si a .
While there was no intention to implement these plans immediately upon approval, the Committee believed that it was in the best 
interests of the Company to have the flexibility to do so in the future. In consultation with executive management, it continues to 
keep under review plans to implement them in the future. As a result, work continues to obtain the necessary approvals (other than 
shareholder approval) to enable such plans to be put in place. The Committee will need to approve the launch of any proposed all 
employee share plan.
Dilution
DSP share awards can only be satisfied using market purchase shares held in the employee benefit trust (EBT). LTIP and LGU share 
awards can be satisfied using new issue shares, shares held in treasury or market purchase shares held in the EBT. The Committee 
reviews the hedging and dilution position of the Company at least bi-annually prior to making grants of share awards. Both the  
LTIP and LGU operate 5% in 10 years (executive schemes) and 10% in 10 years aggregate dilution limits in line with best practice.  
At 31 March 2013 the EBT held 2,614,972 shares to hedge outstanding awards over 4,050,737 shares and 209,768 units. Using an 
approximation of one unit to one share, at this date the EBT held shares to satisfy 61.4% of all outstanding awards. No new issue 
shares have been used to satisfy share awards since 2005 and, to date, no treasury shares have been used.
Remuneration paid to directors during the year
The remuneration of each director, excluding long term share based incentive awards, during the year ended 31 March 2013 
compared with 2012 is set out in table 16 (page 94).

2. Other benefits include such items as company cars or allowances, fuel and medical insurance for the executive directors and expenses chargeable to income tax.
3.  Heath Drewett, Alun Griffiths and Uwe Krueger are required to take a minimum of one third of their bonus payment in the form of a right to acquire shares under  
the DSP. Awards of shares to these values will be made following the announcement of the preliminary results pursuant to the rules of the DSP to Heath Drewett,  
Alun Griffiths and Uwe Krueger. These awards will be disclosed in the directors’ share options and long term incentives table in the 2014 Remuneration Report.
4. Keith Clarke retired as a director on 31 July 2011. This relates to his qualifying service as a director.
5.  Heath Drewett was entitled to receive a defined contribution pension or pension allowance equivalent to 25% of salary. He elected to receive a defined contribution 
pension until 31 December 2011 and then received a pension allowance as a taxable payment from 1 January 2012 to 31 March 2012. In the year ended  
31 March 2013 he received part of his entitlement as a defined contribution pension and part as a pension allowance received as a taxable payment.
6.  Alun Griffiths was entitled to receive a pension contribution or pension allowance equivalent to 10% of salary until 31 January 2012 and 12% of salary from  
1 February 2012, due to transitional relief in connection with the removal of the link to final salary for his defined benefit entitlement. He elected to receive a pension 
contribution until 31 December 2011 and then received a pension allowance as a taxable payment from 1 January 2012 to 31 March 2012. He received a pension 
allowance as a taxable payment for the whole of the year ended 31 March 2013. In the year ended 31 March 2012, in addition to the Company’s contributions of 
£18,670, the Company made additional contributions of £1,645 in respect of national insurance contributions the Company would have paid had Alun Griffiths not 
chosen to make his contributions via salary sacrifice.
7.  Alun Griffiths was entitled to a transitional payment of 2% of salary, on the same basis as other staff, following the removal of the link to final salary for his defined 
benefit pension entitlement. This also includes payments equal to the dividends declared on shares subject to awards made to Alun Griffiths under the terms of the 
Company’s share plans following the vesting and exercise of the underlying awards.
8.  Uwe Krueger receives an aggregate allowance for travel expenses incurred between his home and the UK during the first five years following appointment of  
£39,000 (a direct replacement for the rental allowance disclosed in 2011) and an allowance for the provision to him of professional advice.
9. Sir Peter Williams retired as a director on 8 September 2011.

1 February 2013. In light of changes in market conditions and views on longevity, the Trustee, after receiving actuarial advice, made changes that had the effect of 
increasing cash equivalent transfer values by 15%. In the case of Alun Griffiths, this means that the transfer value at 31 March 2013 would have been £302,669 lower 
(i.e. £2,017,794) had the change in basis not been made from 1 February 2013.

5.  In 2009 the Remuneration Committee considered the impact of the £7.0m tax benefit from the purchase of prior year consortium relief from the Metronet companies 
and concluded that the non-trading nature of this benefit was not a fair reflection of underlying earnings. Pursuant to the rules of the plan, the Remuneration 
Committee considered it was appropriate to remove the benefit of this item and that the EPS for the financial year ending immediately before the commencement  
of the performance period for the 2009 award was 76.4p. This lower EPS was also used to calculate the vesting of LTIP awards made in 2006.
6.  In 2010 the Remuneration Committee considered the impact of the expiry of a letter of credit in respect of the Metronet enterprise and the related provision giving  
rise to a one-off, non-cash pre-tax credit of £25m in the Group’s income statement for the year. It concluded that the non-trading nature of this benefit was not a fair 
reflection of underlying earnings. It was therefore excluded and the lower normalised basic EPS for the year ended 31 March 2010 of 79.4p was used to calculate the 
vesting of LTIP awards made in 2007 and was also used as the EPS for the financial year immediately before the commencement of the performance period for the 
2010 awards. 96 Governance

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of WS Atkins plc
We have audited the Financial Statements 
of WS Atkins plc for the year ended  
31 March 2013 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
and Company Balance Sheets, the 
Consolidated and Company Statements  
of Cash Flows, the Consolidated and 
Company Statements of Changes in 
Equity and the related notes. The financial 
reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the 
Company financial statements, as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Respective responsibilities of 
directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
statement of responsibility (page 62),  
the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Financial Statements 
and for being satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view. Our responsibility  
is to audit and express an opinion on the 
Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has 
been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16  
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no 
other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent  
in writing.
Scope of the audit of the Financial 
Statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in the 
Financial Statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the Financial 
Statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud  
or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and 
Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by 
the Directors; and the overall presentation 
of the Financial Statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited Financial Statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2013
1. Accounting policies
WS Atkins plc (the Company) is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled  
in England and Wales. The address of its registered office is Woodcote Grove, Ashley Road, Epsom, Surrey, KT18 5BW, England.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented, including the application of new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and 
interpretations, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements of WS Atkins plc have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
(EU), the Companies Act 2006 that applies to companies reporting under IFRS, and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations. 
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-
for-sale financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or 
actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. Material estimates applied across the Group’s businesses and joint ventures 
are reviewed to a common standard and adjusted where appropriate to ensure that consistent treatment of similar and related issues that 
require judgement is achieved upon consolidation. Any revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of 
applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and 
estimates are significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are disclosed under critical accounting policies and are incorporated by 
reference in the Business Review (page 38).
Going concern
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future and therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Income Statement and Balance Sheet include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings and its share of 
joint ventures. The results of the subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from 
the date of acquisition. The results of subsidiary undertakings disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement 
up to the date of disposal.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control exists where the Group has the power to govern  
the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the existence and effect of 
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less 
impairments. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or 
assumed at the date of exchange.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values 
at the acquisition date irrespective of any non-controlling interest. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. If the cost of the acquisition is lower than the fair value of net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the 
difference is recognised directly in the income statement. Goodwill is reviewed on finalisation of fair values and any adjustments required to 
the accounting are recorded within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Where subsidiaries adopt accounting policies that are different from the Group’s, their reported results are restated to comply with the 
Group’s accounting policies. Where subsidiaries do not adopt accounting periods that are coterminous with the Group’s, results and net 
assets are based upon unaudited accounts drawn up to the Group’s accounting reference date.  Financial Statements 107
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Financial Statements
Joint ventures
In accordance with IAS 31, Interests in joint ventures, the Group accounts for joint ventures under the equity method of accounting. The 
Group’s share of a joint venture’s profit after tax is included from the date on which the Group acquires joint control. Within the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, the investment is recorded at cost (classified as a non-current asset) and subsequently adjusted to reflect the 
Group’s share of the movements in the joint venture’s net assets post acquisition.
The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are stated in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Where joint ventures adopt 
accounting policies that are different from the Group’s, their reported results are restated to comply with the Group’s accounting policies.
Where joint ventures do not adopt accounting periods that are coterminous with the Group’s, results and net assets are based upon 
unaudited accounts drawn up to the Group’s accounting reference date.
Public private partnership (PPP)/Private finance initiative (PFI) concessions
Assets constructed by PPP/PFI concession companies are classified in the accounts of the joint ventures as financial assets or intangible assets, 
depending on whether the grantor or user has the primary responsibility to pay the operator for the concession services. To date, all of the 
Group’s PPP/PFI concession assets have been classed as financial assets.
The financial asset represents an interest-bearing, long term receivable. The cost of the financial asset at any one time is equal to the 
accumulated value of the service delivery plus accumulated interest charged to the financial asset less amounts received to date.
The financial asset is measured at fair value. Where it is classed as a loan receivable, any movement in fair value is taken to the income 
statement. Where it is classed as available-for-sale, any movement in fair value is taken to reserves.
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of 
value added tax, rebates and discounts. Revenue from contracting activities represents the value of work carried out during the year 
including amounts not yet invoiced. Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective 
interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset 
to that asset’s net carrying value.
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be measured reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date, as measured by the contract costs incurred. Where the outcome of a 
construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that contract costs 
incurred will be recovered.
When it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected resultant loss is recognised as an expense 
immediately.
Employee benefit trusts
The accounts of the employee benefit trusts (EBTs) are incorporated into the results of the Group as, although they are administered by 
independent trustees and their assets are held separately from those of the Group, in practice, the Group’s recommendations on how the 
assets are used for the benefit of employees are normally followed. The Group bears the major risks and rewards of the assets held by the 
EBTs until the shares vest unconditionally with the employees. Shares in WS Atkins plc held by the EBTs are shown as a reduction in retained 
earnings/accumulated losses. Other assets and liabilities held by the EBTs are consolidated with the assets of the Group.
Foreign currency transactions and translation
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling 
(£), which is the Company’s and Group’s presentation currency.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income, for example, as qualifying cash flow hedges. 108 Financial Statements

Notes to the Financial Statements

Group companies
The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional 
currency different from the Group’s presentation currency are translated into the Group’s presentation currency as follows:
•	assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet 
•	income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates
•	all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity  
and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM). 
The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the 
chief executive officer and the Group finance director.
The Group’s operating segments for management purposes reflect predominantly its key geographical markets. The segments are: United 
Kingdom (UK); North America; Middle East; Asia Pacific and Europe; and Energy. These segments form the basis for reporting the Group’s 
segment information as they are the main determinants of the Group’s risks and returns. The Group considers the UK to be its country  
of domicile. 
Intersegment transfers and transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available  
to unrelated third parties. 
Revenue
Revenue from long term contracts comprises the value of work performed during the period calculated in accordance with the Group’s 
policy for contract accounting set out below. Revenue from other contract activities represents fee income receivable in respect of services 
provided during the period.
Under certain services contracts, the Group manages customer expenditure and is obliged to purchase goods and services from third party 
contractors and recharge them to the customer at cost. The amounts charged by contractors and recharged to customers are excluded from 
revenue and cost of sales where the Group is acting solely as an agent. Receivables, payables and cash relating to these transactions are 
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Revenue recognition and contract accounting
The value of contract work in progress comprises the costs incurred on contracts plus an appropriate proportion of overheads and 
attributable profit. Fees invoiced on account are deducted from the value of work in progress and the balance is separately disclosed in trade 
and other receivables as amounts recoverable on contracts, unless such fees exceed the value of the work in progress on any contract in 
which case the excess is separately disclosed in trade and other payables as fees invoiced in advance. 
Revenue is recognised on the majority of the Group’s contracts on a percentage completion basis when the outcome of a contract or project 
can be reasonably foreseen. Under the percentage completion method, the percentage of the total forecast revenue reported at any point in 
time is calculated based upon the proportion of total costs incurred to date as a percentage of total forecast costs or, in some cases, based 
upon the estimated physical per cent complete of the total work to be performed under the contract. 
In some cases, a margin provision is then made, depending on how far progressed each project is and the risk profile of the project. Where 
contracts span two or more accounting periods, profit is not generally recognised until the contract is 50% complete. In addition, provision 
is made in full for estimated losses and, where the outcome of a contract cannot be reasonably foreseen, profit is taken on completion. 
Revenue recognition on outsourcing contracts is determined by reference to the proportion of the annual service delivered to date. Where 
the costs of obligations in relation to the non-renewal or termination of a contract are higher in the final period of the contract, a proportion 
of revenue is deferred each period to meet these anticipated costs. Full provision is made for losses on outsourcing contracts if the forecast 
costs of fulfilling the contract throughout the contract period exceed the forecast income receivable. In assessing the amount of the loss to 
provide on an outsourcing contract, account is taken of the Group’s share of the forecast results from any joint ventures which the contract  
is servicing.   Financial Statements 109
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Financial Statements
Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time apportionment basis using the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Group 
reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate 
of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loans is recognised using the 
original effective interest rate. 
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. 
Pre-contract costs
The Group accounts for all pre-contract costs in accordance with IAS 11, Construction contracts. Costs incurred before it becomes probable 
that a contract will be obtained are charged to expenses. Directly attributable costs incurred after that point are recognised in the balance 
sheet and charged to the income statement over the duration of the contract or, in the case of PPP/PFI concessions, over the same period  
as the Group’s interest in any special purpose company (SPC) charges the equivalent capitalised amounts to the income statement.
Bid recovery fees are deferred and credited to the income statement over the duration of the contract or, in the case of PPP/PFI concessions, 
over the same period as the Group’s interest in any SPC credits the equivalent capitalised amounts to the income statement. Where the 
Group’s interest in any SPC reduces, the deferred bid recovery fees are credited to the income statement in proportion to the reduction  
of the Group’s interest.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the 
financial performance of the Group. They are items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance of their 
nature or amount.
Exceptional items are also summarised by class in the segmental analyses, excluding those that relate to interest and tax.
Retirement benefit schemes
The Group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. 
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has  
no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits 
relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that typically defines an amount  
of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service  
and compensation.
For defined benefit schemes, regular valuations are prepared by independent professionally qualified actuaries to determine the level  
of contributions required to fund the benefits set out in the scheme rules.
The Group accounts for pensions in accordance with IAS 19, Employee benefits. The cost of defined benefit schemes is charged  
as follows:
•	the current service cost incurred during the period to provide retirement benefits to employees is charged to operating profit
•	gains or losses arising from settlements or curtailments not covered by actuarial assumptions are included in operating profit
•	a charge representing the expected increase in scheme liabilities is included in net finance costs. This is based on the present value  
of scheme liabilities at the beginning of the period
•	a credit representing the expected return on scheme assets is included within net finance costs. This is based on the market value  
of the assets of the schemes at the start of the period allowing for expected cash flows during the period.
Actuarial gains and losses (asset experience, liability experience and changes in actuarial assumptions) are charged or credited to equity in 
other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. The difference between the market value of scheme assets and the present 
value of scheme liabilities is recognised as a retirement benefit asset or liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. To the extent that it is 
recoverable, any related deferred tax asset or liability is included in the relevant category of receivable/payable. 
The Group has elected to recognise actuarial gains and losses in full as they arise through retained earnings/accumulated losses. 
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no further payment obligations once  
the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions 
are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or reduction in the future payments is available.      1 10 Financial Statements

Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity and cash settled share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) or cash (phantom allocations) of the Group.
In accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based payments, the cost of share-based payments awarded after 7 November 2002 is charged to the 
income statement over the performance and vesting periods of the instruments. The cost is based on the fair value of the awards made at 
the date of grant adjusted for the number of awards expected to vest. In accordance with the transitional provisions within IFRS 2, no charge 
is made in respect of instruments awarded before 7 November 2002. In the case of equity settled awards, the credits associated with the 
amounts charged to the income statement are included in retained earnings/accumulated losses until the awards are exercised. In the case of 
cash settled awards, the credits associated with the amounts charged to the income statement are held as a liability in the balance sheet until 
the awards are transferred, at which point a cash amount (based on the Company’s share price at the vesting date) is paid to the employee. 
Where awards are settled by the new issue of shares, any proceeds received in respect of share options are credited to share capital and 
share premium. Where awards are settled in shares held by the EBTs, any proceeds are credited to retained earnings/accumulated losses. 
Share awards are granted by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries. The Company charges to cost of investment in subsidiaries an 
amount equivalent to the equity settled element of the annual IFRS 2 charge, with an equivalent credit to reserves in accordance with  
IFRIC 11, Group and treasury share transactions.
Income tax
Current and deferred income tax are recognised in the income statement for the period except where the taxation arises as a result of a 
transaction or event that is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Income tax arising on transactions or events 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity is charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity 
respectively. 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the 
countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises 
from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the 
deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the 
taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle balances on a net basis.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures, except where it is known  
that the earnings will be distributed.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given for a business over  
the Company’s interest in the fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment. Prior to 1 April 2004, goodwill was amortised over its estimated useful economic life. 
Amortisation ceased on 1 April 2004 and the carrying value of existing goodwill was frozen at that date and is subject to impairment reviews.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business acquisition is allocated to each of the cash generating units (CGUs), 
or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is 
allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is 
monitored at the operating segment level.  Financial Statements 1 1 1
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Financial Statements
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and fair value less 
costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal  
of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill that arose prior to 1 April 1997 was written off to retained earnings/accumulated losses. Profit or loss on disposal of the underlying 
businesses to which this goodwill related will not include goodwill previously recorded as a deduction from equity.
Acquired customer relationships
Acquired customer relationships consist of intangible assets arising on the consolidation of recently acquired businesses, that are separable 
from goodwill, in accordance with IFRS 3, Business combinations, and IAS 38, Intangible assets, and do not fall within the Group’s other 
classes of intangible assets. These comprise principally existing customer relationships which may give rise to future orders (customer 
relationships), and existing order books (backlog orders). 
Acquired customer relationships are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and have a finite useful life. Amortisation of customer 
relationships is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of customer relationships over their estimated useful lives of 
between one and twenty years. Acquired customer relationships are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Backlog orders are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and amortised over their estimated useful lives of three years. Backlog 
orders are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Software licences
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. 
These costs are amortised using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the software licences over their useful lives of between  
two and five years. Software licences are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Corporate information systems
In accordance with IAS 38, Intangible assets, the Group’s corporate information systems are treated as an intangible asset. Costs included are 
those directly attributable to the design, construction and testing of new systems (including major enhancements and internally generated 
costs) from the point of inception to the point of satisfactory completion where the probable future economic benefits arising from the 
investment can be assessed with reasonable certainty at the time the costs are incurred. Maintenance and minor modifications are expensed 
in the income statement as incurred. The corporate information systems recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line method to 
allocate the cost of the corporate information systems over their estimated useful life of six years. Corporate information systems are stated 
at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Trade names and trademarks
Trade names and trademarks have arisen on the consolidation of recently acquired businesses and are recognised at fair value at the 
acquisition date. Where trade names and trademarks are considered to have a finite useful life, amortisation is calculated using the straight 
line method to allocate the cost of trade names and trademarks over their estimated useful lives. Where trade names and trademarks are 
considered to have an indefinite useful life, they are not subject to amortisation; they are tested annually for impairment and when there  
are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable, as detailed within the impairment of non-financial assets section below. Trade 
names and trademarks are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost comprises purchase price after 
discounts and rebates plus all directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable  
that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying 
amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial 
period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method to write off the cost less residual value  
of each asset over its estimated useful life, as follows:
Freehold buildings    – 10 to 50 years
Short term leasehold property  – over the life of the lease
Plant, machinery and vehicles   – 3 to 12 years
The assets’ useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.      1 12 Financial Statements
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Notes to the Financial Statements
continued
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated 
recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within administrative 
expenses in the income statement.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and when 
there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment 
wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised  
for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s  
fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there 
are separately identifiable cash flows (CGUs). 
Financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available-
for-sale. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification 
of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as 
hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are classified as 
non-current.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is 
regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or 
regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market 
price used for financial assets held by the Group is the mid market price. These instruments are included in Level 1, see note 2.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation 
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all 
significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2, see note 2.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  
They are included in current assets except where the maturity is greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date, in which case they  
are included as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents,  
and other receivables in the balance sheet. Other receivables include loan notes receivable.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other 
categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months 
of the end of the reporting period. 
Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date – the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell 
the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit 
or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in 
the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the investments has expired or has been 
transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Trade receivables are recognised at original invoice amount less provision for impairment which, due to their short term nature, approximates 
to their fair value. Other receivables include loan notes receivable in respect of disposals, which are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method less any provision for impairment. This valuation approximates to their fair value.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are presented in the income 
statement in the period in which they arise.   Financial Statements 1 13
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Financial Statements
Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in other comprehensive 
income.
When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included 
in the income statement.
Interest on available-for-sale financial assets calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement as part  
of finance income.
Impairment of financial assets 
Assets carried at amortised cost
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is 
impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence  
of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a loss event) and that loss event (or 
events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default 
or delinquency in payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
Any impairment is charged to the income statement. Impairment testing for trade receivables is described below in the accounting policy 
paragraph relating to trade receivables. For other receivables carried at amortised cost, impairment loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original 
effective interest rate.
Assets classified as available-for-sale
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is 
impaired. The Group uses the criteria referred to above. If any evidence of impairment exists, the cumulative loss – measured as the 
difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in 
profit or loss – is removed from equity and recognised in profit or loss. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified 
as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in 
profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed through the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at cost less impairment. Cost is determined using the first in, first out method. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in  
one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented  
as non-current assets. 
Trade receivables are recognised at original invoice amount. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, demand deposits and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible 
to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair 
value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if 
so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised 
asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk 
management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes 
in cash flows of hedged items. 1 14 Financial Statements
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Notes to the Financial Statements
continued
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 21. The full fair value of a hedging derivative 
is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset 
or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. 
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example, 
when the forecast cash flow that is hedged takes place).
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain  
or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast cash flow is ultimately recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. When a forecast cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported  
in equity is immediately transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Lease obligations
Finance leases
Lease arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee are treated as finance leases. Assets held 
under finance leases are capitalised within property, plant and equipment at the lease’s commencement and depreciated over the shorter  
of the lease term and the useful life of the asset. A liability is recognised for the present value of the minimum lease payments within current 
and/or non-current liabilities as appropriate. Rental payments are apportioned between capital and interest expense to achieve a constant 
rate of interest charge on the outstanding obligation.
Operating leases
Where the Group acts as lessee in an operating lease arrangement, the lease payments are charged as an expense to the income statement 
on a straight line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives received are also recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Where the Group acts as lessor in an operating lease arrangement, rental income from operating leases is accounted for on a straight line 
basis over the period of the lease. Lease incentives provided are also recognised over the lease term on a straight line basis.
Trade payables 
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business 
if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised at original invoice amount.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some  
or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that  
it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised 
over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown  
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.  Financial Statements 1 15
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Financial Statements
Provisions for other liabilities and charges
Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. 
Vacant property provisions are recognised when the Group has committed to a course of action that will result in the property becoming 
vacant. The provision is calculated based on projected discounted cash flows to the end of the lease, after making assumptions for void and 
rent free periods.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid. 
Disposal groups held for sale
Disposal groups are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and 
a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
Application of new IFRSs and interpretations
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
There are no new IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 April 2012 that would  
be expected to have a material impact on the Group. 
(b)  New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 April 2012 and 
not yet adopted
•	 Amendment to IAS 1, Financial statement presentation, regarding other comprehensive income (effective for financial years beginning  
on/after 1 July 2012)
•	IAS 19 (revised 2011), Employee benefits (effective for financial years beginning on/after 1 January 2013)
•	Amendment to IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, on asset and liability offsetting (effective for financial years beginning  
on/after 1 January 2013)
•	Amendments to IFRSs 10 and 12 on transition guidance (effective 1 January 2014)
•	Amendment to IFRS 11 on transition guidance (effective 1 January 2014)
•	Annual improvements 2011 (effective for financial years beginning on/after 1 January 2013)
•	Amendment to IAS 32, Financial instruments: Presentation, on asset and liability offsetting (effective 1 January 2014)
•	IFRS 9, Financial instruments (effective 1 January 2015)
•	IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements (effective 1 January 2014) 
•	IFRS 11, Joint arrangements (effective 1 January 2014)
•	IFRS 12, Disclosures of interests in other entities (effective 1 January 2014)
•	IFRS 13, Fair value measurement (effective for financial years beginning on/after 1 January 2013)
•	IAS 27 (revised 2011), Separate financial statements (effective 1 January 2014)
•	IAS 28 (revised 2011), Associates and joint ventures (effective 1 January 2014).
Of these, the amendment to IAS 19 is expected to have the most significant effect on the Group’s Financial Statements. 
IAS 19 was amended in June 2011. The impact on the Group will be as follows: to immediately recognise all past service costs; to amend  
the way in which administrative expenses are allowed for; and to replace interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest 
amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability. Adopting amendments to IAS 19 would have 
increased 2013 net finance costs by £5.2m, and would have reduced the defined benefit liability at 31 March 2013 by £3.2m. The estimated 
effect for 2014, based on current actuarial assumptions, is to increase net finance costs by £8.8m.  1 16 Financial Statements

2. Financial risk management 
Financial risk factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, fair value interest rate risk,  
cash flow interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the 
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group  
uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department (Group Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of directors. Group 
Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Group’s operating units. The Board provides written 
principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, 
credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
These policies are further described within the ‘Treasury policies and objectives’ section of the Business Review (page 37).
Where individual sensitivities are disclosed below, all other variables are held constant.
a) Market risk
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, debt investments, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The 
following foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk analyses, required by IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, are intended to illustrate 
the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being primarily the US dollar to sterling and euro to sterling exchange rates and UK interest 
rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analyses:
•	changes in the fair value of financial instruments designated as available-for-sale are recognised directly in other comprehensive income
•	changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the 
Consolidated Income Statement 
•	changes in the carrying value of other financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the Consolidated Income Statement.  
i) Foreign exchange risk 
The Group operates in a number of international territories. Each business undertakes a large proportion of its commercial transactions 
within its local market and in its local functional currency. Foreign exchange risk arises from a proportion of commercial transactions 
undertaken in currencies other than the local functional currency, from financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than 
the local functional currency and on the Group’s investments in foreign operations.
Group policy is for each business to undertake commercial transactions in its own functional currency whenever possible. When this is not 
possible, the Group manages its foreign exchange risk from future commercial transactions using appropriate derivative contracts arranged 
via Group Treasury. Cash flows are reviewed on a monthly basis throughout the duration of projects and the future cover amended as 
appropriate.
Trade receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency arise from commercial transactions and 
are therefore largely hedged as part of the process described above. Remaining financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies 
other than the local functional currency include bank accounts, loans and intercompany funding balances. These are generally unhedged, 
with the exception of balances that are themselves designated as hedging instruments used to hedge the Group’s investments in foreign 
operations.
The Group’s primary exposure to foreign exchange risk on unhedged financial instruments arises mainly in respect of movements between 
the US dollar (including dollar pegged currencies) and sterling and between the euro and sterling.       
     
At 31 March 2013, if sterling had strengthened by a reasonably possible change of 10% against the US dollar, post-tax profit for the year 
would have been lower by approximately £1.7m (2012: £1.9m lower) and equity would have been £1.7m lower (2012: £1.9m lower).  
If sterling had weakened by a reasonably possible change of 10% against the US dollar, post-tax profit for the year would have been higher 
by approximately £2.1m (2012: £2.4m higher) and equity would have been £2.1m higher (2012: £2.4m higher).    Financial Statements 1 17
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2013
Financial Statements
At 31 March 2013, if sterling had strengthened by a reasonably possible change of 10% against the euro, post-tax profit for the year would 
have been lower by approximately £0.3m (2012: £0.5m lower) and equity would have been £0.3m lower (2012: £0.5m lower). If sterling had 
weakened by a reasonably possible change of 10% against the euro, post-tax profit for the year would have been higher by approximately 
£0.4m (2012: £0.7m higher) and equity would have been £0.4m higher (2012: £0.7m higher).
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. 
ii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss which 
are all interest bearing, offset in part by interest bearing bank loans. The majority of these items are at floating rates of interest or fixed 
deposits for periods of less than six months; changes in the interest rate results in changes in interest-related cash flows. No interest hedging 
is currently undertaken by the Group or its subsidiaries. If interest rates for the year to 31 March 2013 had been 10 basis points higher/lower, 
post-tax profit for the year would have been approximately £0.1m (2012: £0.1m) higher/lower.
iii) Price risk
Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts the profitability of the Group.
The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk because of investments held by the Group and classified on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. To manage this risk, the Group diversifies its portfolio. Diversification of the 
portfolio is done in accordance with limits set by the Group. 
During the year, the Group was also exposed to price risk because of investments held by the Group in unlisted corporate bonds  
(available-for-sale financial assets). These investments were disposed of during the year, see note 20. At 31 March 2012 the fair value  
of these investments was £6.1m. 
Management monitors exposures to price risk on an ongoing basis. 
The Group is not materially exposed to commodity price risk. Certain longer term project and framework contracts include indexation clauses 
that are applied to unit rates to offset the effect of inflation on input costs over the duration of the agreement. The Group is exposed to 
price risk to the extent that inflation differs from the index used and forecast project outcomes that form the basis of revenue recognition 
include an estimate of this risk where it is present.
b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the Group will suffer financial loss as a result of counterparties defaulting on their contractual obligations. 
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, and 
investments in unlisted corporate bonds (available-for-sale financial assets), as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding 
receivables and committed transactions, with the maximum exposure to the risk equivalent to 100% of the carrying value disclosed in the 
Group’s balance sheet at 31 March. The Group does not hold any collateral as security. The Group’s policy is that cash and investments 
should not be concentrated with any one counterparty.
For trade and other receivables, concentration of credit risk is very limited due to the Group’s broad customer base. An assessment of  
credit quality of the customer is made where appropriate using a combination of external rating agencies, past experience and other factors. 
In circumstances where credit information is unavailable or poor, the risk is mitigated primarily by the use of advance payments resulting  
in positive cash flows. Exposure and payment performance are monitored closely both at individual project and client level, with a series  
of escalating debt recovery actions taken where necessary. In view of current economic circumstances, additional management attention 
remains focused on the recovery of debtors.

c) Liquidity risk 
The Group funds its activities through cash generated from its operations and, where necessary, borrowings and finance leases. The Group’s 
borrowing facilities include bank facilities and private placement debt. Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the 
Group and aggregated by a central finance department (Group Finance). Group Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity 
requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities (note 27) at all times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its 
borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group’s debt financing plans and covenant compliance.
Any surplus cash is invested by Group Treasury in interest bearing current accounts, term deposits and money market deposits, choosing 
instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide sufficient headroom as determined by the forecasts mentioned 
above.
The table below analyses the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period  
at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

sterling (£84.5m). 
Financial assets consist of loan notes; trade receivables (net); intercompany receivables (nil in consolidated accounts); amounts due from joint 
ventures; financial assets at fair values through profit or loss; financial assets designated as available-for-sale, and cash and cash equivalents.
Financial liabilities consist of trade payables; intercompany payables (nil in consolidated accounts); and borrowings.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group maintains or adjusts its capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders and through its borrowing facilities.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of its net debt plus defined benefit pension deficit net of total deferred tax to adjusted 
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). This policy is unchanged from the prior year. 120 Financial Statements

Fair value estimation
The table below analyses the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined 
as follows:
Level 1 financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is 
regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or 
regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market 
price used for financial assets held by the Group is the mid market price. 
Level 2 financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation 
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on estimates. The fair value of 
certificates of deposit is calculated as the present value of the future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate market rate of interest. The  
fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and yield curves 
derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the foreign exchange contracts.  Financial Statements 121

3. Segmental information
The CODM has been identified as the chief executive officer and the Group finance director. The chief executive officer and the Group 
finance director review the Group’s internal reporting to assess performance and allocate resources. Management has determined the 
operating segments based on these reports.
The chief executive officer and the Group finance director assess the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit 
before interest and tax. Information provided to the chief executive officer and the Group finance director is measured in a manner 
consistent with that in the Financial Statements.

During the year the Group reviewed the basis of allocating assets and liabilities to the operating segments. As a result, assets and liabilities 
are now allocated based on the operations of the segments and the physical location or territory of the asset or liability. The segment assets 
and liabilities at 31 March 2012 have been restated to reflect these revised allocations.
Group cash balances; derivative financial instruments; financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; centrally managed joint ventures; 
and corporate assets are not considered to be segment assets as they are managed centrally. Consequently they are shown within 
unallocated central items.
Post-employment benefit liabilities; bank loans and private placement debt; derivative financial instruments; central tax provisions; and 
corporate liabilities are not considered to be segment liabilities as they are managed centrally. Consequently they are shown within 
unallocated central items.
Capital expenditure includes additions to goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.  124 Financial Statements

13. Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue 
during the year, excluding shares held by the EBTs which have not unconditionally vested in the employees and shares held in treasury.
Diluted EPS is the basic EPS after allowing for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the number of options outstanding 
during the year. The options relate to discretionary employee share plans.

Impairment test for goodwill
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets, at least annually or more frequently 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. 
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGU, or group of CGUs, that management has identified in order to carry out impairment tests. The 
following is a summary of goodwill allocation by CGU or group of CGUs, summarised at the operating segment level:
Group
2013 
 £m 
 2012
 £m
UK 30.6  30.6
North America 141.8  136.4
Asia Pacific and Europe 14.9  14.3
Energy 24.1  23.7
Total 211.4  205.0
The impairment test involves comparing the carrying value of the CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated to their 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of all CGUs has been determined based on value in use calculations. An impairment loss  
is recognised immediately when the carrying value of those assets exceeds their recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount
Value in use calculations
Methodology
The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on the following financial year’s budget approved by the Board, which is  
based on past performance and management’s expectations of market developments. The key assumptions in the budget relate to revenue 
and profit margins. Budgeted revenue is based on management’s knowledge of actual results from prior years, along with the existing 
committed and contracted workload, as well as management’s future expectations of the level of work available within the market. Profit 
margins are based on current margins being achieved in conjunction with economic conditions in the market or country of operation. 
The cash flow projections from that budget are extrapolated for the next four years using an estimated growth rate and projected margin. 
Growth rates of between 1.5% and 3.3% are based on the economic environment for the country in which the CGU operates. As required 
by IAS 36, cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated based on the long term average growth rate for the primary country in 
which the CGU operates of between 1.7% and 3.3%. The growth rates are derived from the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic 
Outlook published Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates. Projected margins reflect the historical and budgeted performance of the 
CGU. The projections do not include the impact of future restructuring projects to which the Group is not yet committed.
The cash flows have been discounted using the CGUs specific pre-tax discount rates of between 7.7% to 15.2%. The discount rates have 
been calculated based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity 
and risks specific to the CGU. The discount rates are revised annually using updated market information.
Assumptions
The growth rate and discount rate assumptions used for the internal value in use calculations are as follows:
Group
2013  2012
Five year growth rate 1.5% - 3.3% 0% - 5%
Post five year growth rate 1.7% - 3.3% 0% - 5%
Pre-tax discount rate 7.7% - 15.2% 14%
Sensitivities
Goodwill of £141.8m (2012: £136.4m) allocated to the North America operating segment includes £134.4m of goodwill arising on the 
acquisition of PBSJ. This goodwill has been allocated to the Atkins North America group of CGUs and is considered significant in comparison 
with the Group’s total carrying amount of goodwill. The recoverable amount of this group of CGUs has been determined using an internal 
value in use calculation. The growth rate and discount rate assumptions used for this calculation are as follows:
2013 2012 
Five year growth rate 3.3% 3%
Post five year growth rate 3.3% 3%
Pre-tax discount rate 12.4% 12% 136 Financial Statements

The carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives allocated to the Atkins North America group of CGUs for the purposes  
of the impairment test is £nil (2012: £2.4m).
Given the materiality of goodwill allocated to the Atkins North America group of CGUs, together with the relative headroom derived by the 
calculations, sensitivity analysis has been performed on the key assumptions used in the value in use calculations. The two assumptions to 
which these calculations are most sensitive are the projected profit margin and the discount rate. Specific sensitivity analysis with regard  
to these assumptions shows that, with respect to profit margin, it would need to fall by 160 basis points before any impairment would be 
triggered, and similarly the pre-tax discount rate would need to increase from 12.4% to 14.9%. 
For the other CGUs, management has considered the level of headroom resulting from the impairment tests. Where appropriate, further 
sensitivity analysis has been performed by changing the base case assumptions applicable to each CGU. The analysis has indicated that no 
reasonably possible changes in any individual key assumption would cause the carrying amount of the business to exceed its recoverable 
amount. 
As at 31 March 2013 and 2012, based on these internal valuations, the recoverable value of goodwill required no impairment.

Following the March 2012 Budget Statement, the main rate of UK corporation tax was reduced to 24% from 1 April 2012. The Finance Act 
2012 also enacted a further reduction to the main rate of corporation tax to 23% from 1 April 2013. Further reductions to the main rate are 
proposed to lower the rate to 20% by 1 April 2015 but these later reductions had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date 
and, therefore, are not included in these Financial Statements.
The proposed reductions to the main rate of UK corporation tax to 20% by 1 April 2015 are expected to be enacted separately each year. 
The overall effect of the further changes from 23% to 20%, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at 31 March 2013, would be to 
reduce the net deferred tax asset by approximately £10.4m (being £6.9m recognised in 2014 and £3.5m recognised in 2015).

At 31 March 2013, £100.1m (2012: £89.8m) of Group trade receivables were past due and aged up to six months from invoice date and 
carried a provision for impairment of £0.4m (2012: £1.0m). The remaining Group trade receivables of £99.7m (2012: £75.9m) which were 
past due and aged up to six months from invoice date but not impaired relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is  
no recent history of default. 
Group trade receivables aged beyond six months of invoice date totalled £42.7m (2012: £61.1m) and carried a provision for impairment  
of £23.9m (2012: £23.6m).

None of the financial assets that are fully performing were renegotiated during the year. The other classes within trade and other receivables 
do not contain impaired assets.
At 31 March 2013, £0.5m of the Company’s amounts due from subsidiary undertakings were fully provided against (2012: £9.5m), with an 
in year release of provisions of £9.0m (2012: £32.6m), see note 39.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above. The Group does 
not hold any collateral as security.
25. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
In accordance with IFRS 7, disclosure is required for financial instruments that are measured in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. 
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level.
The Group’s financial assets that are measured and recognised at fair value through profit or loss include certificates of deposit, fixed interest 
securities, life insurance policies, floating rate notes and UK treasury bills. The Group’s financial liabilities that are measured and recognised at 
fair value include derivative financial instruments.
The fair value of the Group’s derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 21.
The following table presents the Group’s financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss.

a) Retirement benefit liabilities
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The two main defined benefit schemes are the Atkins 
Pension Plan (the Plan) and the Railways Pension Scheme, both of which are funded final salary schemes. The assets of both schemes are 
held in separate trustee-administered funds. Other pension schemes include the Atkins McCarthy Pension Plan in the Republic of Ireland, 
which is a final salary funded defined benefit scheme, and a range of defined contribution schemes or equivalent.
The Plan is closed to the future accrual of benefit; all defined benefit members of the Plan were transferred to a defined contribution section 
for future service where it was clear they did not benefit from a statutory or contractual right to a final salary pension. 
In the prior year, Atkins Limited undertook an enhanced transfer value (ETV) exercise for deferred members of the Plan. The exercise gave rise 
to a settlement gain under IAS 19 in respect of those members who transferred out their benefits. The Plan recognised a net settlement gain 
of £0.1m in respect of the ETV exercise for the year ended 31 March 2013. This is to allow for the difference between the expected impact of 
the exercise already included in the 31 March 2012 disclosures and the actual impact of the exercise. The settlement gain of £0.1m is based 
on the transfer out of the plan of a further £1.3m of assets and corresponding liabilities of £1.4m in respect of those members.
Also in the prior year, on 1 February 2012 and following a consultation programme with employees who are members of the Plan, Atkins 
Limited (the Group’s principal UK employing company) removed the link between individual employees’ accrued pension and future increases 
in salary via contractual amendment. The reduction in the past service liability was £30.9m and this was recognised as a curtailment gain in 
the year ended 31 March 2012. 146 Financial Statements

The Railways Pension Scheme recognised a curtailment gain in the year ended 31 March 2013 in respect of the two new benefit bases that 
came into effect for certain members from 1 January 2013. The curtailment gain arose for members moving from the existing uncapped 
salary category or retail price index (RPI) capped salary category to the new consumer price index (CPI) capped category. The reduction in  
the past service liability for this curtailment is £4.3m and this has been recognised as a curtailment gain in the year ended 31 March 2013.
The Atkins McCarthy Pension Plan was closed to future accrual of benefits for members who do not benefit from a statutory or contractual 
right to a final salary pension on 31 March 2009. These members transferred to the Personal Retirement Savings Accounts – Ireland (PRSA 
– Irish Life) scheme with effect from 1 April 2009.
The defined benefit sections of all pension schemes are closed to new entrants, who are offered membership of the defined contribution 
section.

The actuarial tables used to calculate the retirement benefit liabilities for the Plan were the Self-Administered Pension Schemes (SAPS) tables, 
with medium cohort improvements from 2002 to 2009 and a scaling factor of 0.85/0.90 for males/females respectively. Future 
improvements are based on CMI improvements with a 1.5% per annum improvement trend, based on year of use application. The Railways 
Pension Scheme results have been adjusted on an approximate basis to be based on the same mortality tables.  Financial Statements 147

The Group expects employer contributions to be paid during the financial year to 31 March 2014 to be around £35.1m, of which £32.0m  
is in relation to the funding of the actuarial deficit, and employee contributions paid to be around £1.6m. Expected benefit payments made 
directly by the Group to pensioners in the financial year to 31 March 2014 are £nil.
The approximate effect on the liabilities from changes in the main assumptions used to value the liabilities are as follows: 
  Effect on plan liabilities
Change in assumption Atkins Pension Plan Railways Pension Scheme
Discount rate increase/decrease 0.5% decrease/increase 10.0% decrease/increase 8.0%
Inflation increase/decrease 0.5% increase/decrease 5.0% increase/decrease 8.0%
Real rate of increase in salaries increase/decrease 0.5% increase/decrease 2.0% increase/decrease 1.0%
Longevity increase 1 year increase 3.0% increase 2.0%
The effect of the change in inflation on liabilities assumes a corresponding change in salary increases and inflation-related pension increases. 
b) Other post-employment benefit liabilities
The Group operates unfunded schemes within certain of its non-UK businesses, including Gratuity schemes, Key Employee Supplemental 
Option Plans (KESOP) and post-retirement medical benefit schemes.
Members of the Gratuity schemes are entitled to receive a cash gratuity on leaving the business which is dependent on their length of 
employment and final salary. Valuation of the gratuity obligation is carried out in line with the principles of IAS 19, Employee benefits. 
The Group operates a KESOP providing some key officers and employees in its North American business (the business) with post-retirement 
benefits, known as the Supplemental Income Program (SIP). The SIP is an unfunded plan that provides participants with retirement income 
for a specified period of between 5 and 15 years upon retirement, death or disability. The plan fixes a minimum level for retirement benefits 
to be paid to participants based on the participant’s position in the business, their age and length of service at retirement. Additionally, 
certain executive agreements have been amended to provide post-retirement medical benefits to those employees and their spouses,  
at a level substantially similar to those medical and hospitalisation benefits paid and provided to senior executives currently employed by  
the business. The insurance benefits will be provided without any further or additional services from the employee to the business and they 
will be paid for and provided for as long as the employee and their spouse shall live. 152 Financial Statements

Long Term Incentive Plans
WS Atkins plc Long Term Growth Unit plan (LGU) August 2012 onwards
A share plan for senior executives where units are granted at a base price which is normally based on the six month average share price 
calculated at the date of grant. The vesting of units occurs in three equal tranches on the fourth, fifth and sixth anniversaries of the date  
of grant. Vesting is subject to a financial underpin which is considered by the Remuneration Committee. On exercise, the value of each unit  
is equal to the increase, if any, in the average share price of one notional Company share between the grant date and the exercise date.  
Any such increase will normally be calculated using the six month average share price. No more than 50% of a participant’s total number  
of units subject to a single award may be exercised in any 12 month rolling period. The increase will usually be delivered in the form of a nil 
cost option except in the US, where awards are granted as market value options and are scaled back on exercise to allow only the exercise  
of options equivalent to the gain that would have been made under a non-US award. The units will generally be settled in equity.
As a general rule, awards granted to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant leaves  
as a result of a qualifying reason, they receive a pro rated entitlement.
WS Atkins plc Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) August 2012 onwards
A share plan for senior executives used to grant awards that are settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, in cash. Subject to the 
Company’s real growth in absolute EPS over the performance period. The growth target requires the increase to be more than 12% per 
annum in the three year performance period to allow full vesting. If the increase is less than 5% per annum, there will be no vesting.  
If the increase is 5% per annum, vesting will be at 25%, and a sliding scale operates between 5% and 12% per annum.
As a general rule, awards granted to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant leaves  
as a result of a qualifying reason, they receive a pro rated entitlement.
Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared following grant, without interest. 
Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) September 2006 to July 2012
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to grant awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited 
circumstances, in cash. There are different performance targets for different categories of management. Grants made to executive directors 
and senior employees have 50% of the grant subject to the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) performance relative to the 
constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) at the start of the performance period. Full vesting of this portion of the 
grant will take place if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile and 30% vesting will be achieved with a median ranking, with pro rata 
vesting for intermediate performance. No vesting will occur for a ranking below median.
The remaining 50% of the grant made to executive directors and senior employees is subject to the Company’s real growth in underlying 
EPS over the performance period. For the 2006 and subsequent grants, the growth target requires the increase to be more than 10% per 
annum above the UK RPI in the three year performance period to allow full vesting. If the increase is less than 4% per annum above the  
UK RPI, then there will be no vesting. If the increase is 4% per annum above the UK RPI, vesting will be at 30%, and a sliding scale operates 
between 4% and 10% above the UK RPI.
Awards granted to other participants are subject solely to the EPS condition. As a general rule, awards granted to participants who leave 
employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying reason, they receive a pro rated 
entitlement.
Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared following grant without interest. 
Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) September 2003 to August 2006
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to grant awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited 
circumstances, in cash. The performance condition was TSR with an EPS growth underpin measured over three financial years starting with 
the financial year beginning immediately after the award was granted. Full vesting of any award took place for a TSR performance where  
the Company ranked in the top 20% in a group of up to 16 comparator companies, 30% vesting for median ranking and no vesting if  
TSR fell below the median. The EPS underpin was the UK RPI plus 2% per annum. As a general rule, awards granted to participants who  
left employment prior to vesting were forfeited. In the event a participant left as a result of a qualifying reason, they received a pro rated 
entitlement. All awards have now vested. 154 Financial Statements

Deferred Share Plans
Atkins Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to grant awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited 
circumstances, in cash. There is no performance condition but awards are restricted for at least three years from the date of grant.  
As a general rule, awards granted to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant leaves  
as a result of a qualifying reason, they will receive their award in full. Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit of 
dividends declared following grant without interest. All awards have now vested.
Atkins Deferred Share Plan (DSP) 
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to grant awards to employees that are settled in equity or in cash. There is no 
performance condition but awards are restricted for a set period from the date of grant, fixed by the Remuneration Committee at grant.  
As a general rule, awards granted to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant leaves  
as a result of a qualifying reason, they will receive their award in full. Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit of 
dividends declared following grant without interest. Awards granted to executive directors in relation to the executive bonus scheme are 
restricted for three years from the date of grant.

Atkins Long Term Incentive plan September 2006 to July 2012
The Monte Carlo model was used for the purposes of valuing LTIP awards with the TSR market performance condition which were granted in 
the prior year. The model calculated the fair value of the awards granted, upon which the share-based payments charge is based in the prior 
year, current year and through the future year(s) until vesting. The assumptions used in the model are as follows.
LTIP
2012
Exercise price £nil
Risk-free interest rate n/a
Discount in respect of dividend yield 0%
Volatility of share price 38.0%
Share price at grant date:
– 20/06/2011 760.0p
Expected term 3 years from
 grant date
No awards granted in the current year contained a TSR market performance condition.
Volatility was determined based on the movement in share price over a period prior to the grant date equal in length to the period over 
which the TSR condition applies, which equated to a three year share price history. The fair value of share plans involving market 
performance conditions takes into account market information.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, the Monte Carlo model simulates TSR for the Company and a comparator group. In 2012 the 
comparator group consisted of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts at the start of the performance period. The model takes into 
account historic dividends and share price volatilities for the Company and the comparator group to produce a predicted distribution of 
relative share performance.
Awards that do not contain market performance conditions are valued at market value at the date of award and discounted in the event that 
the award does not benefit from dividend equivalents during the vesting period.

36. Contingent liabilities
The Group has given indemnities in respect of performance and contractual-related bonds, as well as letters of credit issued on its behalf. 
The amount outstanding at 31 March 2013 includes £6.9m letters of credit issued as a result of the acquisition of PBSJ.
During the year ended 31 March 2011, the Group acquired PBSJ. Prior to the acquisition, the Audit Committee of the board of directors  
of PBSJ undertook an internal investigation to determine whether any laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), had been 
violated in connection with certain projects undertaken by PBS&J International, Inc. (one of PBSJ’s subsidiary undertakings). The investigation 
suggested that FCPA violations may have occurred but did not extend beyond this company and that none of PBSJ’s executive management 
were involved in criminal conduct. PBSJ voluntarily disclosed this matter to the Department of Justice and to the securities and exchange 
commission (SEC) and is cooperating fully with their review. The FCPA provides for penalties, criminal and civil sanctions and other remedies. 
Neither at the date of acquisition nor at subsequent year ends has management been able to estimate the potential penalties that may be 
imposed and therefore no provision had been made. It is not considered possible to determine an accurate estimate of the fines and 
penalties imposed as they are not formula driven or in any way the result of a predefined calculation. The Group does not have an estimate 
of when this will be resolved but it is considered unlikely to be within the next financial year.
Group companies are from time to time involved in claims and litigation. The Group carries significant professional indemnity insurance cover 
for such claims.

Unsolicited mail
The Company is obliged by law to make its 
share register available to third parties who 
may then use it for a mailing list. If you  
are a UK shareholder and you wish to limit 
receipt of unsolicited mail you may do so  
by registering with the Mailing Preference 
Service (MPS). Registration can be made 
online at www.mpsonline.org.uk or via 
telephone on 0845 703 4599.
Giving your shares to charity
If you only have a small number of shares 
whose value makes it uneconomic to sell 
them, you may wish to consider donating 
them to charity though ShareGift, an 
independent share donation scheme.  
The relevant share transfer form can be 
obtained from the registrar. ShareGift  
is administered by The Orr Mackintosh 
Foundation, registered charity number 
1052686. Further information may be 
obtained on +44 (0)20 7930 3737 or  
from www.sharegift.org.
Identity theft
Identity theft is on the increase. Criminals 
may steal your personal information, putting 
your Atkins shareholding at risk.
Tips for protecting your Atkins shares:
•	ensure all your certificates are kept  
in a safe place or hold your shares 
electronically in CREST via a nominee
•	keep all correspondence from the registrar 
that shows your shareholder reference 
number in a safe place, or destroy your 
correspondence by shredding it
•	if you change address inform the registrar 
in writing or via our share portal at  
www.myatkinsshares.com
•	know when dividends are paid and 
consider having your dividend paid directly 
into your bank account. This will reduce 
the risk of the cheque being intercepted  
or lost in the post. If you change your 
bank account, inform the registrar of the 
details of your new account. You can  
do this by post or online using our share 
portal at www.myatkinsshares.com. 
Respond to any letters the registrar sends 
you about this
•	if you receive a letter from the registrar 
regarding a change of address or a 
dividend instruction but have not recently 
moved or requested a change to how  
you receive your dividends please contact 
them immediately as you may have been  
a victim of identity theft
•	if you are buying or selling shares only  
deal with brokers registered in your 
country of residence or the UK.
Warning to shareholders
Share fraud includes scams where investors 
are called out of the blue and offered shares 
that often turn out to be worthless or 
non-existent, or an inflated price for shares 
that they own. These calls come from 
fraudsters operating in ‘boiler rooms’ that 
are mostly based abroad.
While high profits are promised, those  
who buy or sell shares in this way usually 
lose their money. The Financial Services 
Authority found most share fraud victims  
are experienced investors who lose an 
average of £20,000, with around £200m 
lost in the UK each year.
If you are offered unsolicited investment 
advice, discounted shares, a premium price 
for shares you own, or free company or 
research reports, you should take these 
steps before handing over any money:
1.  get the name of the person and 
organisation contacting you
2.  check the Financial Services Register  
(FSR) at www.fca.org.uk/firms/systems-
reporting/register/search to ensure  
they are authorised
3.  use the details on the FSR to contact  
the firm
4.  if you are based in the UK, call the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768  
if there is no telephone number on  
the FSR or you are told it is out of date
5.  search the FCA’s list of known 
unauthorised firms and individuals  
to avoid doing business with
6.  remember: if it sounds too good to  
be true, it probably is.
If you use an unauthorised firm to buy or  
sell shares or other investments, you will not 
have access to the Financial Ombudsman 
Service or Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong.
If you are approached about a share  
scam you should tell the FCA using  
the share fraud reporting form at  
www.fca.org.uk/consumers/scams, where 
you can find out about the latest investment 
scams. If you are based in the UK, you can 
also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 
0800 111 6768.
If you have already paid money to share 
fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud 
online at www.actionfraud.police.uk or,  
if you are based in the UK, by telephone  
on 0300 123 2040. 166 Investor Information

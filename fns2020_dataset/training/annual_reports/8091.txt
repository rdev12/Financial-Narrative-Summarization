Who we are
Informa was formed in December 1998 by the merger 
of IBC Group plc and LLP (Lloyd’s of London Press). 
Since then, the continual growth and vision of the 
Company has been built around the supply of high 
quality, proprietary business-to-business knowledge 
through some of the longest-standing brands in 
the world of publishing, conferences, exhibitions
and training.
Although we are a relatively young Company, our 
bloodline dates back to 1734 when the fi rst issue of 
the maritime publication Lloyd’s List was fi rst pinned 
to the wall of Edward Lloyd’s City of London coff ee shop. 
Today Lloyd’s List is still published daily and, along with 
other products and services, provides information, 
analysis and knowledge for business decision makers 
in the global shipping community.
Since then, mergers with the Taylor 
& Francis Group, a world-leading 
academic publisher in 2004, plus 
the acquisition of IIR Holdings and 
Datamonitor in 2005 and 2007 
respectively, have built on our 
strategy to expand our business 
through both acquisition and 
organic growth.
Today, Informa is a progressive and 
successful international business 
headquartered in Switzerland with 
many industry leading products 
and services in niche markets 
around the world.
What we do
Informa provides academics, businesses and
individuals with unparalleled knowledge, up-to-the 
minute information and highly specialist skills and 
services. With around 8,000 employees working in
some 150 offi  ces in over 40 countries, our global 
reach and breadth of off er is unique. 
Our academic information division publishes books 
and journals with over 72,000 titles available that provide 
individuals and organisations with the knowledge they 
need to carry out their work.
Our professional and commercial information 
businesses off er structured databases, subscription-
based services, real-time news, research and business-
critical information creating business advantage.
We are the largest publicly-owned organiser

dynamic, multi-platform solutions tailored to our 
customers’ needs. We have many leading product

Informa has a strong track record of creating value 
from organic growth and acquisitions since its creation 
in 1998, including its expansion through a combination 
of organic and acquisition, both strategic and bolt on, 
led growth. These have included the merger with Taylor 
& Francis and the acquisitions of PJB Publications, IIR 
Holdings and Datamonitor.
In the Academic Information division, digital delivery is 
increasingly important for both books and journals and 
Informa is working hard to remain delivery platform 
neutral. Informa is also working to build on subject areas 
such as environment and urban planing and regional 
studies where it has a signifi cant strength, during 2011.
In the Professional and Commercial Information 
division, Informa is investing in platforms and 
distributions systems, restructuring or adding to our 
existing sales teams and expanding geographically, 
and will continue to do so in 2011.
In the Events and Training division, Informa is intending 
to launch new trade shows and conferences in 2011, 
build on its market-leading positions in Middle East 
and within the Healthcare sector, as well as expand into 
key geographies within the Far East and Latin America.

INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   4 21/03/2011   17:33 In 2010, Informa continued to build its 
high value subscription base. This past 
year, over a third of Group revenues came 
from data subscription services which 
have shown strong renewal rates in both 
the academic and the professional and 
commercial sectors. 
We added a further 71 academic journals, 
developed increased digitised functionality to 
the Lloyd’s List Group and launched a number 
of new products. The healthcare sector within 
the Citeline suite of products has performed 
well with new product launches and more 
planned for 2011. Informa Healthcare’s online 
portal, informahealthcare.com was enhanced in 
2010 helping drive a substantial revenue growth 
for digital books.
The drive to higher value corporate subscriptions 
continues to be core to the strategy of the various 
subscription led businesses. These high value sales 
are underpinned by our specialist knowledge and 
proprietary content, consequently strengthening 
Informa’s position in both digital and print formats.

INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   5 21/03/2011   17:33 As the world moves ever more towards 
digital and multi-platform delivery, 
our companies continue to develop 
more of our products and services to 
be available electronically. 
Digital marketing, social media and online 
services bring us closer to our key audiences and 
present opportunities to produce more targeted, 
richer and relevant information. Our engagement 
and delivery in these platforms increases customer 
loyalty, retention and price leverage. 
In 2010 we continued to develop and expand 
our high quality content with nearly three 
quarters of our publishing revenues coming 
from digital activity. A good example of this is 
the new Lloyd’s List Intelligence tracking service 
which uses satellite and land based receivers to 
monitor movement, a far cry from the days when 
Edward Lloyd pinned his list on the wall of his 
coff ee shop back in 1734.
Print-on-demand and online partnerships 
not only greatly enhance the effi  ciency of the 
fulfi llment and distribution but also reduce our 
carbon footprint and move us towards a more 
sustainable business.

Contributors on CPDcast have nearly 8,000 years 
combined legal experience, despite the service 
only being in its second full year of trading!
In 2010, Informa produced almost 
100 exhibitions around the world, from 
the recently acquired Anti-Ageing show 
to Arab Health in the Middle East. 
Our diverse range of robust and market-leading 
events include large, full-scale exhibitions and 
conferences through to extremely niche training 
courses and seminars and represent an excellent 
opportunity for growth and high quality earnings.
The recent acquisitions of Expo Farmacia and 
Australian Exhibitions and Conferences (AEC) 
has strengthened our position in this area and 
will boost our  exhibitions to around 127 in 2011.
We continue to identify emerging themes and 
produce timely relevant events. Amongst the 
many successful conferences we ran in 2010 are 
the “Com” series with a highly successful new 
launch in Nigeria, Market Research in the US, the 
German Energy event, pharma events such as 
Clinica Trials and Partnering with CROs and the 
SuperReturn series.

INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   11 21/03/2011   17:33 Chairman’s Statement
Over the past three years, the world has experienced 
some of the worst economic conditions ever and I am 
delighted at how well the Informa business model has 
performed. This is in part due to the changes that we 
have consciously made to the information we provide 
as well as the way we provide it and in part to the 
diversification into new product areas and geographies.
Informa was a different Company ten years ago to what 
it is today. It was mainly a business to business events 
business, with advertising based publishing and like 
many businesses then, we had minimal digital content. 
In 2010, some 70% of adjusted operating profits came 
from information publishing, 41% of our revenue 
is electronic and 36% of our revenue comes from 
subscriptions. In fact in 2010 only 2% of revenue  
came from advertising.
Importantly, the 2004 merger between Informa and 
Taylor & Francis (T&F) created a business with a balance 
between cyclical growth and predictable subscription 
revenues. The T&F academic business, which in 2010 
accounted for 35% of adjusted operating profit, is a 
market leading business of the highest quality with 
particular strength in the areas of humanities and 
social sciences. T&F which was a nil premium, non cash 
transaction, with its subsequent improvement in profit 
levels, has added considerable value to the Group. 
Although the T&F merger was fundamental, our objective 
of creating a high value knowledge and information 
business has been achieved thus far through a 
combination of both organic and acquisition led growth. 
The three major acquisitions of PJB Publishing (Scrip) in 
I am pleased to announce a strong set of results for 2010,  
which again demonstrate the underlying strength of the  
business, especially renewable revenue streams, high 
margins and strong cash generation. 
Derek Mapp, Chairman
Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 10
INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   12 21/03/2011   17:33 2003, IIR Holdings (IIR) in 2005 and Datamonitor in 2007 
have grown substantially and have all improved the quality 
and organic growth potential of the enlarged Group.
In 2011, the Company continues to invest in organic 
growth, both in existing and emerging markets. We 
will also look to make fill-in acquisitions which both 
generate value and add to the quality of the business. 
These will be in sectors where we already have core 
strength and where we can achieve revenue and cost 
synergies. Quite separately, we will consider assets for 
disposal and in so doing we can use the funds generated 
to add overall to shareholder value, either through 
improving the balance sheet, or through re-investment. 
Looking forward, our emphasis will remain on growing 
sustainable shareholder value, investing for growth  
and improving the resilience and visibility and as  
such the overall quality of our business. From an organic 
and acquisition perspective, we will look at assets 
which are digital, content rich, have proprietorial 
information, with high levels of repeat business and 
events with geo-cloning opportunities.
Emerging markets will be increasingly important 
and during 2010 we added to our events portfolio in 
Brazil and established new events in Saudi Arabia and 
Vietnam. An acquisition at the end of 2010 brought us  
12 new large exhibitions in Australia, which, together 
with our existing business there, makes us one of the 
leading Australian events companies. Looking forward 
to 2011, we have more opportunities in the UAE and the 
Far East where we already have a base but also in new 
emerging markets such as Turkey. 
From a trading perspective, our businesses benefited in 
2010 from improving economies, especially in Asia, Latin 
America, Australia, Germany and Scandinavia. Southern 
Europe especially Italy and Spain remain weak, whereas 
the US business was sluggish, with perhaps a more 
sustained recovery towards the end of the year. From 
a sector perspective, most of our areas grew in 2010, 
especially financial events, which did of course decline 
during the financial crisis. More difficult areas were real 
estate and property and some of our financial data 
businesses, which relied heavily on bank subscriptions. 
We learned much during the downturn, including 
how efficient our business is, how resilient our market 
leading products are, how important our top brands are 
and how flexible our people and our cost base are. This 
helps us to grow the operating margin every year and 
yet still invest for the future. 
We also recognise that where our products were not 
market leading they would suffer in a downturn and 
as such we have reduced the scale considerably of our 
smaller events and also consolidated some publications. 
This process will continue and already in 2010 some 50% 
of our events gross profits were delivered by our top 200 
leading events. 
Informa will remain high quality, high margin, highly 
cash generative, highly digital and increasingly resilient. 
Our investment organically and through acquisition will 
push us into emerging markets where we anticipate a 
wider range of growth opportunities. With an efficient 
balance sheet and a highly committed team, we 
certainly have an exciting few years ahead. I would like 
to thank everyone inside Informa for their hard work and 
commitment both now and over the past 12 months and 
wish them continued success for 2011.

to perform well, demonstrating the resilient nature 
of its high quality earnings streams. This division has 
delivered organic revenue and adjusted operating profi t 
growth of 4.7% and 4.5% respectively during 2010. 
Our book businesses had a strong year with a number 
of deals in new, emerging market libraries ensuring we 
kept pace with a record breaking 2009 performance. 
Ongoing technical developments in both print-on-
demand and marketing activity supports the ever 
growing portfolio of books with nearly 5.5 million 
books sold in 2010 of which around 70% of the revenue 
generated was from the back catalogue.
The on-going strength of our journals business 
has been supported by an increase in online usage 
of over 25%, showing the strength of our product 
range and the success of the marketing teams. This 
acceleration in usage emphasises the ever improving 
quality of our publications and will further increase 
the resilience of the business and strengthen its 
position in its niche market.
Digital delivery is increasingly important for both the 
books and journals and we work hard to remain delivery 
platform neutral. 100% of our journals are available 
digitally along with 32,000 of our books (2009: 22,000).
Geographically, emerging markets are an important 
growth area with India now the fourth largest books 
market for our academic information and there are 
promising growth prospects in China. Emerging 
markets now represent 13% of the AI revenues 
compared to 11% last year.
We remain sensitive to the demands of an academic 
environment with signifi cant budgetary pressure and 
we have worked closely with our customers to secure 
2011 revenue. The journal renewal process has delivered 
in line with our expectations. We believe this refl ects 
the weighting of our portfolio towards HSS and libraries’

on those subject areas such as environment and urban 
planning and regional studies where we have signifi cant 
strength during the course of 2011. 
Professional and Commercial Information (PCI)
The PCI division which provides books, journals, 
database products, intelligence centres and other
similar products to the healthcare, pharmaceutical, 
fi nancial services, maritime, commodities, telecoms 
and legal sectors, accounts for 30% of Group revenue 
and 35% of the adjusted operating profi t. PCI consists
of Informa Business Information (IBI) and Informa
Financial Information (IFI).
As expected, during the year we saw the lag impact 
on subscription income especially in the fi nancial 
services sector, however, during the second half of 2010, 
revenues grew and we expect them to continue to grow 
in 2011. We have taken the opportunity over the past 
two years to remove marginal product, consolidate titles 
and invest in our market leading brands and products, 
which will be the core of this division’s growth in 2011 
and beyond.
The PCI division delivers 88% of its products digitally, 
driving further growth from high value corporate sales 
and digital upselling. Subscriptions account for 74% 
of the overall division’s revenue with a high renewal 
rate of 87% which is a testament to the strength of 
the product off ering.
We have continued to reduce our reliance on advertising 
which is only 6% of PCI revenue. We will move forward 
with a stronger, higher quality set of assets in this 
portfolio. The migration from print to digital and from 
single subscriber to corporate access continues to boost 
the performance of this division and will be continued. 
The Citeline suite of products for the pharmaceutical 
market has performed very well with new product 
launches in 2010 and more planned for 2011. Informa 
Healthcare’s online portal, informahealthcare.com,
was also enhanced in 2010 helping to drive a 
substantial revenue growth for digital books. Lloyd’s 
List has seen a 21% increase in subscription revenue 
with the new launch of its online product. Many other 
product successes contributed to the ever improving 
portfolio within the IBI division.
Towards the end of 2010, we took the decision to 
fully integrate Datamonitor into IBI. During the year 
Datamonitor continued to grow its subscriber base 
and sales and has ended the year in a stronger position 
than it started. Previously it had interacted closely with 
the rest of the Group but maintained a more expanded 
infrastructure than most other acquired businesses. 
We believe that now is the right time to combine 
all of the divisions’ market leading products within 
the Healthcare, Financial and Telecoms sectors. This 
portfolio will present our customers with an even more 
compelling sales proposition. We have also taken the 
opportunity to remove some of the marginal product 
in certain sectors and focus on the niche areas of 
information which can command high margins. 
We have taken the opportunity over the past two years

the core of this division’s growth in 2011 and beyond.

INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   15 21/03/2011   17:33 IFI, which delivers high value subscription products  
to the financial sector, represents 22% of PCI revenues. 
We have continued to see a lag on subscription income 
in this area but have diversified the portfolio somewhat 
through the acquisition of an emerging funds database 
which has strong growth potential.
Across this division we are investing in platforms and 
distributions systems, restructuring or adding to our 
existing sales teams, expanding geographically and we 
believe that the prospects remain encouraging for 2011.
Events and Training
Our Events and Training business, consisting of trade 
shows and exhibitions, large and small conferences and 
training courses, accounts for 45% of Group revenue 
and 30% of adjusted operating profit. This division has 
benefited from improving economic conditions around 
the world with organic revenue from core operations 
increasing by 2.7%. With the benefit of operational 
gearing, adjusted operating profits have grown by  
8.1% to £93.5m and the margin has improved by  
150 basis points to 17%.
2010 witnessed improved economic conditions in Asia, 
Latin America, Australia, Germany and Scandinavia. The 
US remained tougher but there were definitely signs 
of an improved recovery towards the end of the year. 
On a sector basis, our financial events recovered well, 
telecoms remained strong and we expanded our stable 
of market-leading healthcare events. Trade shows and 
exhibitions remained our most resilient products, whilst 
average delegate numbers increased across our entire 
conference portfolio giving us confidence for the future. 
In May we ran IPEX, our one quadrennial event. This was 
a great success and contributed strongly to this year’s 
results. Other notable successes include Arab Health, 
which celebrated its 35th year in 2010, the World Anti-
Aging Congress held in March, the Broadband World 
Forum held in October and the SuperReturn Series 
which was held seven times in different locations  
during the course of the year.
The larger events portfolio has performed well in 2010 
with the revenue from the top 200 events increasing 
by 16% (5% excluding IPEX). The number of events 
generating more than £0.5m has increased from 69 to  
76 in the last 12 months. This will be an area of focus 
for the Group as we look to increase the number of 
exhibitions that we run, either through new launches  
or acquisition, or by seeking to increase the scale of  
our market leading conferences. 
Our local language conference and training companies 
in Germany and the Netherlands recovered well after 
a challenging 2009. We removed a significant number 
of events year-on-year but were able to grow profits 
by 28% between them. We achieved a strong recovery 
in Sweden and Denmark, in Australia where we added 
an exhibition business late in the year to our market 
leading conference and training company and in the 
US where our conference business, led by its marketing 
division, grew its adjusted operating profits by 21%.
Our corporate training portfolio showed a much 
improved performance in the second half of the year 
with strong growth in the Far East and Australia and an 
improvement in its larger US operations. Revenue in the 
key final three months of the year, excluding Robbins 
Gioia, grew by 11% which gives us cautious optimism 
for 2011. Robbins Gioia, the US Government contractor, 
stabilised over the final months of the year.
We have started 2011 well with Arab Health, held 
in January, achieving its highest ever revenue and 
rebooking a record amount onsite for 2012. We also held 
our market-leading Energy event in Germany and Middle 
East Electricity, both of which have grown. 
Forward bookings across our exhibition business and 
the outlook for the conference businesses remains 
positive. We are intending to launch new trade shows 
and conferences in 2011, build on our market-leading 
positions in the Middle East and within the Healthcare 
sector, as well as expand into key geographies within 
the Far East and Latin America.

INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   16 21/03/2011   17:33 Financial Review
2010 was a challenging year from a global trading perspective 
so I am pleased with these fi nancial results which demonstrate 
the strength of a balanced portfolio and an ability to manage 
costs eff ectively.
Adam Walker, Finance Director
Adjusted and Statutory Results
In this Financial Review we refer to adjusted 
and statutory results. Adjusted results are prepared 
to provide a more comparable indication of the 
Group’s underlying business performance.
Adjusted operating profit increased to £313.2m 
(2009: £309.5m) driven by the slight increase in the 
adjusted operating margin from 25.3% to 25.5%. 
The increase in adjusted operating profi t and margin 
demonstrates the benefi ts of our early actions to adapt 
our cost base to the challenging trading conditions. 
As well as the increase in adjusted operating profi t, 
we are pleased by the way the Group has continued to 
convert profi t into cash. Free cash fl ow generated by the 
Group was £231.4m, up 3%.
Translation Impact
The Group generates the majority of its revenue 
overseas. The largest exposure is to US Dollars with 
approximately 49% of Group revenue generated in 
USD and currencies pegged to the USD. Each one cent 
movement in the USD to GBP exchange rate has a circa 
£3.9m impact on revenue and a circa £1.4m impact on 
operating profi ts. Off setting any negative impact on 
operating profi ts are decreases to interest payable 
and tax payable. 
For bank debt covenant testing purposes, profi t and 
debt translation is calculated at the average rate of 
exchange throughout the relevant period.

INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   18 21/03/2011   17:33 Revenue
Organic revenue increased by 0.4% reflecting a 
consistent performance in our publishing businesses,  
up 2%. Events revenues declined by 1% but excluding 
the impact of Robbins-Gioia, the US Government 
contractor, grew by 2.4%. We also decided not to run 
marginal events and consolidated certain print titles. 
Operating Profit
Adjusted operating profit increased to £313.2m (2009: 
£309.5m). Organic adjusted operating profit increased 
by 2%, with an increase of 10% by the events businesses 
recognising the impact of operational leverage offset by 
a 1% fall at the publishing business. 
Statutory operating profit increased by 13% to £164.0m 
(2009: £145.7m), resulting principally from the £25.8m 
decrease in restructuring and reorganisation costs.
Restructuring and Reorganisation Costs
Restructuring and reorganisation costs for the year 
of £8.3m (2009: £34.1m) largely reflect the cost to 
the businesses of responding to changing market 
conditions. These include redundancy costs of £4.6m 
(2009: £18.0m), reorganisation costs of £2.8m (2009: 
£5.0m), and vacant property provisions of £0.9m (2009: 
£4.7m). In addition, during 2009 aborted transaction 
costs of £2.1m and professional fees of £4.3m were 
incurred in connection with the redomicile of the 
ultimate parent company.
Other Adjusting Items
As a consequence of applying IFRS 3 (2008) Business 
Combinations from 1 January 2010, acquisition related 
costs of £1.3m and subsequent re-measurement of 
contingent consideration of £0.8m have been expensed.
Net Finance Costs
Finance costs net of interest receivable, decreased by 
£9.2m to £39.0m. This is primarily due to the full year 
impact in 2010 of reduced debt, following the rights issue 
proceeds of £242.5m received in May 2009, and further 
debt reductions from cash flows at the end of 2009 
and end of 2010. Furthermore, there were exceptional 
interest charges in 2010 of £2.2m relating to borrowing 
costs being written off and the de-designation of interest 
rate swaps, as proceeds from the Private Placement loan 
notes were used to pay down the term loans. 
We maintain a balance of fixed and floating rate  
debt through utilising derivative financial instruments. 
The majority of the fixed interest swaps were entered 
into at the time of the Datamonitor acquisition in 2007 
and will expire in 2011. 
Profit Before Tax
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 6% to £276.4m 
(2009: £261.3m) and adjusted profit for the year also 
increased by 8% to £209.0m (2009: £193.1m).
Taxation
Across the Group, tax has been provided on adjusted 
profits at an adjusted tax rate of 24.4% (2009: 26.1%). 
This adjusted tax rate benefits from profits generated  
in low tax jurisdictions, including Switzerland.
The Group tax charge on statutory profit before tax 
was 20.9% (2009: credit 10.4%). 
Earnings and Dividend
Statutory diluted EPS of 16.5p (2009: 18.8p) is 12% below 
2009 and adjusted diluted EPS of 34.8p (2009: 34.3p) 
is 1% ahead of 2009. If we included a full year’s effect 
of the rights issue in 2009, the statutory diluted EPS 
of 16.5p (2009: 17.7p) is 7% below 2009 and adjusted 
diluted EPS of 34.8p (2009: 32.2p) is 8% ahead of 2009.
The Board has proposed a second interim dividend  
of 9.50p per share (2009: 7.85p per share), in line with 
the Group’s existing dividend policy. This dividend 
will be paid on 18 May 2011 to ordinary shareholders 
registered as of the close of business on 26 April 2011. 
This will result in a total dividend for the year of 14.0p 
per share (2009: 11.45p per share). Dividend cover has 
been reduced from 3 times to 2.5 times on an adjusted 
earnings basis.
Return on Capital Employed
The Group has undertaken three significant transactions 
in recent years – the merger with Taylor & Francis and 
the acquisitions of IIR and Datamonitor. In addition, a 
number of smaller bolt on acquisitions have also been 
completed. Acquisitions have to meet our acquisition 
criteria which include delivering returns in excess of 
the Group’s WACC in the first full year, being earnings 
enhancing in the first full year and achieving a cash 
payback within seven years. 
The return on investment from acquisitions completed 
in 2009 is 18.9%, considerably ahead of the Group’s 
current weighted average cost of capital.

In the year ended 31 December 2010, before taking into account financing activities, spend on acquisitions or 
proceeds from the sale of assets, the Group generated free cash flow of £231.4m (2009: £225.0m). This demonstrates 
the ability of the Group to deleverage quickly.
The change to net debt arising from acquisitions (net of disposals) was a £53.3m outflow (2009: £38.5m outflow) 
which comprises current year acquisitions of £48.0m (2009: £13.2m) and consideration in respect of acquisitions 
completed in prior years of £5.3m (2009: £25.3m). There were no material disposals during the current or prior 
year. We have robust criteria for assessing acquisitions and we target acquisitions and alliances that accelerate our 
strategic development and meet our financial criteria.
Net debt decreased by £93.5m from £872.6m to £779.1m reflecting cash flow of £107.7m, and adverse exchange 
movements of £11.1m. During the year the Group paid £75.0m in relation to the 2009 second interim and the 2010 
first interim dividends.
Financing and Bank Covenants
Private placement loan notes of US$730.0m equivalent were issued in December 2010 and January 2011. The notes 
are denominated in US Dollars ($597.5m), Euros (€50.0m) and Sterling (£40.0m). Amounts issued in December 2010  
are US Dollars ($552.5m), Euros (€50.0m) and Sterling (£40.0m). The remaining US Dollars amount ($45.0m) was issued 
in January 2011. As per note 23, the private placement loan note as at 31 December 2010 totalled £440.0m. Proceeds 
of the issue have been used to repay existing bank debt facilities. The note maturities will range between five and

weighted average interest rate of 4.3%.
The Group has in place a single credit agreement which 
comprises an amortising term loan facility, fully drawn in 
three currency tranches, and a non-amortising £500.0m 
multicurrency revolving credit facility. The rights issue 
proceeds were used to prepay the scheduled 2009 and 
2010 term loan repayments, leaving term loan balances 
at 31 December 2010 of £366.9m drawn in $200.0m, 
€100.0m, and £125.0m. The term loan and revolving 
credit facilities mature in May 2012 and we expect there 
to be comfortable headroom on our facilities through  
to that date. 
The principal financial covenant ratios under these 
facilities are maximum net debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times 
and minimum EBITDA interest cover of 4.0 times, tested 
semi-annually. At 31 December 2010 both financial 
covenants were comfortably achieved, with the ratio 
of net debt (using average exchange rates) to EBITDA 
reduced from 2.7 times at 31 December 2009 to 2.3 
times at 31 December 2010.
Balance Sheet
Deferred income, which represents income received 
in advance, was up 4% (9% excluding the impact of 
IPEX, a quadrennial event) on a constant currency basis 
at 31 December 2010 compared to the same date in 
2009. Deferred income arises primarily from advance 
subscriptions or forward bookings for trade shows, 
exhibitions or conferences. Subscriptions generated 
by our academic journal business renew annually a 
year in advance and many trade shows and exhibitions, 
because of their market leading status, receive 
commitments up to a year in advance. 
Pensions
The Group’s financial obligations to its pension schemes 
remain relatively small compared to the size of the 
Group, with net pension liabilities at 31 December 2010 
of £10.5m (2009: £11.3m).
Following the completion of the triennial valuations 
of the main defined benefit schemes, a revised deficit 
funding plan has been agreed with the trustees 
to eliminate the deficits in the three schemes. The 
contributions for the ongoing service cost are estimated 
to decrease from £1.2m in 2010 to £0.3m in 2011. In 
addition, the contributions paid towards reducing  
the scheme deficits will increase from £2.3m in 2010  
to £3.4m in 2011 and £3.7m in 2012 when the next 
triennial valuation will be available.
Conclusion
Whilst it has been a tough trading environment for the 
Group over the past two years, the ability to generate 
over £300m of adjusting operating profit at a 25% 
margin each year demonstrates the resilience and 
quality of our product offering. At the same time as 
digital technological advancements, product launches 
and other innovations have enhanced the information 
we provide to our customers, we have worked hard to 
ensure that the back office environment has continued 
to improve.
The Group operates predominantly around seven 
principal shared service centres spread geographically 
in alignment with the Group’s main profit centres. I am 
pleased with the progress that has been made in this 
area with the recruitment of some new management, 
the introduction of improved systems and overall 
delivering greater efficiency and improved customer 
service. The shared service centres work closely with the 
IT function which is managed on a regional basis and 
where again we have made significant progress towards 
standardisation of systems on a global basis. 
Alongside this, we have strengthened the small but core 
finance team based at the centre who provide strong 
and effective leadership across all financial disciplines 
including the control framework, corporate finance, 
treasury and taxation. I would like to thank all the finance 
teams around the world for all their hard work in 2010.
We enter 2011 with a strong balance sheet, comfortable 
headroom within our banking facilities, plans for growth 
and a business with a high quality of earnings – visible 
recurring revenue streams and strong cash generation.

net assets of the Group in the year are listed in Note 18 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Business Review
The Business Review, forming part of the management 
report, provides a review of the development and the 
operational and financial performance of the business 
during the year ended 31 December 2010. Information that 
forms part of the Business Review is found in the following 
sections of this Annual Report:
 information about the strategy, development and 
performance of the business, and key performance 
indicators, of the Company during the financial year and 
future prospects are set out in the Chairman’s Statement 
and the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 10 to 14; 
 principal risks and uncertainties are described on  
pages 26 to 30;
 financial risk management objectives and policies 
(including a description of when hedge accounting has 
been applied) and the Company’s exposure to price 
risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk are 
explained in Note 24;
 information about the Company’s Corporate 
Responsibility policies, including environmental, 
employee, and social and community issues are set out 
in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 37;
 details of the principal subsidiaries are set out in Note 
18; and
 the results for the year are explained in detail in  
the Financial Review and are summarised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement on page 52 and  
the related Notes.
In relation to the use of financial instruments by the Group, 
a review is included within Note 24 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. There are no significant differences 
between the market value of any interests in land of the 
Group and the amount at which those interests are included 
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
As a whole the Annual Report provides information about 
the Group’s businesses, its financial performance during the 
year and likely future developments. 
Other than as described in this report, there have not been 
any significant changes to the Group’s principal activities 
during the year under review and the Directors are not 
aware, at the date of this report, of any likely major changes 
in the Group’s activities in the new financial year. There have 
been no significant events since the reporting date.
Dividends
The Directors have declared that a second interim dividend 
for the year of 9.50p per ordinary share to be paid on 
18 May 2011 to ordinary shareholders registered as at 
the close of business on 26 April 2011. Together with the 
first interim dividend of 4.50p per ordinary share paid on 
17 September 2010, this makes a total for the year of 14.00p 
per ordinary share (2009: 11.45p). (The Group pays a second 
interim dividend rather than a final dividend due to the 
operation of the Dividend Access Plan.) 
The Company operates a Dividend Access Plan for all its 
shareholders. Those shareholders who hold fewer than 
100,000 shares are deemed to consent to receive their 
dividends from Informa DAP Limited, a UK incorporated 
Informa Company. Those shareholders holding over 100,000 
shares may elect to join the Dividend Access Plan by 
completing an Election Form. This form is available from the 
Company’s Registrars whose contact details can be found 
on page 126. If shareholders holding over 100,000 shares 
do not elect to join the Dividend Access Plan, dividends 
will be received from the Company which is domiciled in 
Switzerland and may be subject to Swiss tax regulations. 
Shareholders may elect to receive shares instead of cash 
from their dividend allocation through the Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan (DRIP).

contract of significance. 
Directors’ Indemnities
Indemnities are in force under which the Company has 
agreed to indemnify the Directors, to the extent permitted 
by Jersey law and the Company’s Articles of Association, in 
respect of any liability arising out of, or in connection with,

As at 18 March 2011, the Company’s issued share capital 
comprised 601,035,125 ordinary shares with a nominal 
value of 0.1p each. Details of the authorised and issued 
share capital, together with movements in the issued 
share capital during the year, are shown in Note 7 of the 
Company’s Financial Statements. 
The rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, 
being the only share class of the Company, are set out in 
the Company’s Articles of Association (Articles), which 
can be found at www.informa.com. Subject to Jersey law, 
any share may be issued with or have attached to it such 
preferred, deferred or other special rights and restrictions

Governance 
Directors’ Report continued
INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   26 21/03/2011   17:33 Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and speak 
at GMs of the Company and to appoint one or more proxies 
or, if the holder of shares is a corporation, a corporate 
representative. On a show of hands, each holder of ordinary 
shares who (being an individual) is present in person 
or (being a corporation) is present by a duly appointed 
corporate representative, not being himself a member, shall 
have one vote and on a poll, every holder of ordinary shares 
present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every 
share of which he is the holder. Electronic and paper proxy 
appointments and voting instructions must be received 
not later than 48 hours before a GM. A holder of ordinary 
shares can lose the entitlement to vote at GMs where that 
holder has been served with a disclosure notice and has 
failed to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests held in those shares. Except as (1) set out above 
and (2) permitted under applicable statutes, there are 
no limitations on voting rights of holders of a given 
percentage, number of votes or deadlines for exercising 
voting rights. 
The Directors may refuse to register a transfer of a 
certificated share which is not fully paid, provided that the 
refusal does not prevent dealings in shares in the Company 
from taking place on an open and proper basis or where the 
Company has a lien over that share. The Directors may also 
refuse to register a transfer of a certificated share unless 
the instrument of transfer is: (i) lodged, duly stamped (if 
necessary), at the registered office of the Company or any 
other place as the Board may decide accompanied by the 
certificate for the share(s) to be transferred and/or such 
other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to 
show the right of the transfer or to make the transfer; or (ii) 
in respect of only one class of shares. 
Transfers of uncertificated shares must be carried out using 
CREST and the Directors can refuse to register a transfer of 
an uncertificated share in accordance with the regulations 
governing the operation of CREST.
The Directors may decide to suspend the registration of 
transfers, for up to 30 days a year, by closing the register of 
shareholders. The Directors cannot suspend the registration 
of transfers of any uncertificated shares without obtaining 
consent from CREST. 
There are no other restrictions on the transfer of ordinary 
shares in the Company except: (1) certain restrictions may 
from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations 
(for example insider trading laws); (2) pursuant to the 
Company’s share dealing code whereby the Directors and 
certain employees of the Company require approval to deal 
in the Company’s shares; and (3) where a shareholder with 
at least a 0.25% interest in the Company’s certificated shares 
has been served with a disclosure notice and has failed to 
provide the Company with information concerning interests 
in those shares. There are no agreements between holders 
of ordinary shares that are known to the Company which 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or  
on voting rights. 
Shares are from time to time held by a trustee in order 
to satisfy entitlements of employees to shares under the 
Group’s share schemes. Usually the shares held on trust 
are no more than sufficient to satisfy the requirements of 
the Group’s share schemes for one year. The shares held 
by these trusts do not have any special rights with regard 
to control of the Company. While these shares are held on 
trust their rights are not exercisable directly by the relevant 
employees. The current arrangements concerning these 
trusts and their shareholdings are set out on page 45. 
There are no significant agreements to which the Company 
is a party that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change 
of control following a takeover bid (nor any agreements 
between the Company and its Directors or employees 
providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
that occurs because of a takeover bid) except for the Group’s 
private placement loan notes and facilities described in Note 
23 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The rules for appointment and replacement of the Directors 
are set out in the Articles. Directors can be appointed by the 
Company by ordinary resolution at a GM or by the Board 
upon the recommendation of the Nomination Committee. 
The Company can remove a director from office, including 
by passing an ordinary resolution or by notice being given 
by all the other Directors. 
The powers of the Directors are set out in the Articles 
and provide that the Board may exercise all the powers 
of the Company including to borrow money up to an 
aggregate of three times a formula based on adjusted 
capital and reserves. The Company may by ordinary 
resolution authorise the Board to issue shares, and increase, 
consolidate, sub-divide and cancel shares in accordance 
with its Articles and Jersey law.
The Company may amend its Articles by special resolution 
approved at a GM.
Purchase of Own Shares
At the end of the year, the Directors had authority,  
under a shareholders’ resolution passed on 27 April 2010,  
to purchase through the market up to 10% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary shares as at 30 June 2010.  
This authority expires at the conclusion of the AGM of  
the Company to be held in 2011.

INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   27 21/03/2011   17:33 Employee Consultation 
The Group places considerable value on the involvement 
of its employees and continues to keep them informed on 
matters affecting them and on the various factors affecting 
the performance of the Group. This is achieved principally 
through formal and informal meetings, email updates and 
via the Company’s global intranet site. The internet site 
was reconfigured this year improving global reporting on 
corporate responsibility. The internet site enables staff to 
put anonymous questions to the Executive management. 
Employee representatives are consulted regularly on a wide 
range of matters affecting their current and future interests.
The Group divisions regularly undertake staff surveys. As an 
example Taylor & Francis global survey was undertaken in 
2010. The response rate year on year improved from 80 to 
85% of all employees. This survey illustrated an improved 
year-on-year employee engagement rating and also 
demonstrates a reduction in employee turnover.
All employees worldwide are also invited periodically to 
attend webinars, take part in live on-line polls, and ask the 
Executive Directors questions about the business and its 
future. The webinars, including the results of the polls, are 
posted on the Company’s intranet so that those employees 
who are unable to attend can view them.
Since the establishment of the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
in 2009, all UK employees are eligible to participate in the 
SIP once they have completed six months’ service with the 
Company. The SIP is an HM Revenue & Customs Approved All 
Share Incentive Plan offering UK employees the opportunity 
to purchase annually up to £1,500 of shares in the Company 
out of pre-tax salary. In addition, from 2008, all US employees 
are eligible to participate in the Company’s US Stock Purchase 
Plan (SPP) once they have completed six months’ service. 
The SPP offers US employees the opportunity to purchase 
annually up to $2,940 of shares in the Company  
at a 15% discount to the prevailing market price.
Equal Opportunities 
Informa believes in equality of opportunity for all 
employees based on merit and that no employee or job 
applicant should receive less favourable treatment on 
the grounds of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, 
colour, race, religion, nationality or ethnicity. Informa’s 
divisions are all disabled friendly business operations. 
The Company’s equal opportunity policy not only  
covers fair recruitment, but also the opportunities  
given to staff on training and development, and the  
Group’s views on equal opportunities form a part of 
the employee induction training. 
The Group’s objective is to provide continued suitable 
employment to staff whose circumstances change, with 
appropriate training if necessary. Informa’s offices are 
required to enable access for all abilities and comply  
with all applicable local laws. 
Risks and Uncertainties  
A number of factors (risk factors) affect the Group’s 
operating results and financial condition. In common 
with other information providers, the Group’s profitability 
depends in part on the prevailing economic environment 
and the strength of the academic, professional and business 
communities to which it sells. In addition, the Group’s 
profitability is dependent on maintaining a strong and 
highly motivated management team, maintaining brand 
reputation, quality of information and its ability to use 
and protect the security of its marketing databases. This 
section describes some of the principal risk factors that the 
Directors believe could materially affect the Group. The 
Group adopts a risk management process that is monitored 
by the Board and which is intended to ensure a consistent 
and coherent approach to the risk factors that are described 
in this section and to those other risk factors that may arise 
or which may become material in the future. Beneath the 
description on each risk is a note of the main mitigating 
factors or actions which the Group takes.
1.  The Group’s businesses are affected by the conditions of the 
sectors and regions in which they and their customers operate
The performance of the Group depends on the 
financial health and strength of its customers, which 
in turn is dependent on the economic conditions of 
the industries and geographic regions in which they 
operate. Traditionally, spending on parts of the Group’s 
products has been cyclical due to companies spending 
significantly less in times of economic uncertainty. 
Additional negative factors include downward pressure 
on budgets and corporate consolidation in certain 
sectors (e.g. financial services). Global economic 
conditions also mean that certain customers might 
become insolvent which may in turn lead them to 
default on payment for products already purchased. 
Unforeseen disruptions, whether caused by natural 
causes or otherwise, can also be detrimental to the 
Group’s businesses. 
Mitigation is achieved, where possible, through 
the Group’s diversification of its operations across 
vertical markets and geographies, which provides a 
broad customer base. Furthermore, during the recent 
conditions of recession the Group has enhanced its 
credit control function with a view to maintaining 
tighter control over upfront payments for events 
and subscriptions and also continuous monitoring 
of trade receivables to mitigate further default risk.
2. The markets in which the Group operates are highly 
competitive and subject to rapid change
The markets for the Group’s products are highly 
competitive and in a state of ongoing and uncertain 
change. Some of the Group’s principal competitors 
have substantial financial resources, recognised brands, 
technological expertise and market experience that 
may better position them to anticipate and respond 
to these changes. If the Group is unable successfully

Governance 
Directors’ Report continued
INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   28 21/03/2011   17:33 to enhance and/or develop its products in a timely 
fashion, the Group’s revenue could be affected. There 
are also low barriers to entry in relation to certain parts 
of the Group’s businesses. 
The Group maintains a competitive advantage 
through ongoing investment in its products, 
reinforcing its market leading position in many 
markets. The Group also recognises that its 
competitiveness is maintained by the recruitment 
and retention of key employees – see point 7 below.
3. The Group’s intellectual property (IP) rights may not  
be adequately protected and may be challenged by third parties
The Group relies on agreements with its customers  
and trademark, copyright and other IP laws to establish 
and protect the IP rights subsisting in its journals, books 
and training materials. However, these rights may be 
challenged, limited, invalidated or circumvented by  
third parties seeking to infringe or otherwise profit  
from the Group’s proprietary rights without its 
authorisation. In addition, there is now a growing 
amount of copyright legislation relating to digital 
content. These laws remain under legal review and there 
remains significant uncertainty as to the form copyright 
law may ultimately take. Additionally, enforcement of IP 
rights is limited in certain jurisdictions, and the global 
nature of the internet makes it impossible to control 
the ultimate destination of content produced by the 
Group. The Group may also be the subject of claims of 
infringement of the rights of others or party to claims 
to determine the scope and validity of the IP rights of 
others. Litigation based on these claims is common 
amongst companies that utilise digital IP. 
The Group protects its rights by consolidating its 
portfolio of trademark registrations, implementing  
its brand protection strategy, and increasing its digital 
rights protection. The Group supports these activities 
through membership of organisations that defend  
IP rights globally.
4. The Group’s Academic division’s revenue can be 
adversely affected by changes in the purchasing 
behaviour of academic institutions
Academic institutions fund purchases of Group 
products from limited budgets that may be sensitive 
to changes in private (including endowments) and 
governmental sources of funding particularly in times 
of economic uncertainty and austerity. Accordingly, 
any such decreases are likely to affect adversely the 
Group’s results within its Academic division.
The Group is constantly developing its products to 
seek to ensure, as much as possible, that academic 
institutions consider that its products are essential 
content for purchase even in times of economic 
uncertainty and austerity. Additionally, the Group  
has expanded, and continues to expand, its sales 
activities outside of its traditional western markets 
to new markets where economic conditions are 
perceived to be stronger, and uses advances 
in technology to develop new products that 
generate incremental revenue streams.
5. Currency fluctuations may have a significant impact 
on the reported revenue and profit of the Group
The financial results of the Group are reported  
in pounds Sterling but its business operations  
receive revenue and incur expense in other  
currencies in particular, US Dollars and Euros.  
The relative movements between the exchange  
rates in the currencies in which costs are incurred 
and the currencies in which revenue is earned can 
significantly affect the results of those businesses.
A significant portion of the Group’s revenues are 
denominated in US Dollars and Euros. Since the entities 
generating these revenues have cost bases denominated 
in US Dollars and Euros, there is a degree of natural 
hedging which partially mitigates the risk of reported 
revenues being impacted by currency movements. 
This risk can not, however, be completely eliminated. 
Management therefore choose to present, in addition 
to statutory revenue and operating profit metrics, both 
revenue and operating profit on a constant currency 
basis thereby allowing the reader of the financial 
statements to assess the performance of the Group 
without the distorting effect of currency fluctuations.
At a profit before tax level, the Group aims to hedge 
this risk further by drawing a proportion of its 
borrowings in US Dollars and Euros, which means 
that currency fluctuations will increase / decrease the 
Group’s interest charge in the opposite direction to any 
decrease / increase in the Group’s operating profit. 
6. The Group’s debt finance arrangements contain financial and 
non-financial covenants with which the Group must comply 
The Group’s debt finance arrangements (principally 
comprising a private placement of loan notes and bank 
credit facilities) contain covenants and undertakings 
with which the Group must comply. If the Group were 
to fail to comply with any of the covenants in its credit 
facilities, it could result in acceleration of the Group’s 
obligations to repay those borrowings or cancellation 
of those facilities. In the event that the Group 
anticipated such a breach or otherwise believed it had 
insufficient headroom for its operations, the Group may 
be required to sell assets at depressed prices.
The principal financial covenants include a  
maximum net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, 
Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) covenant  
and minimum EBITDA interest cover covenant, each  
of which is tested semi-annually.

INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   29 21/03/2011   17:33 6. The Group’s debt finance arrangements contain 
financial and non-financial covenants with 
which the Group must comply continued
These ratios could be breached following a reduction 
in the Group’s revenue arising from continued 
deterioration of economic conditions or other factors 
outside the Group’s control. The Group’s current level 
of borrowings are such that its net debt to EBITDA ratio, 
and other financial metrics, the subject of covenants 
in credit agreements, are comfortably achievable at 
the present time. Additionally, the Group has stated an 
intention to keep borrowings within a range of 2.0x to 
2.5x of EBITDA over the medium-term (except for short-
term increases following acquisitions), which is well 
within the covenant noted above. Notwithstanding this, 
the detailed cash flow and profit forecasting procedures 
which the Group undertakes would normally be 
expected to identify any potential issues with regards to 
covenant compliance on a timely basis thereby allowing 
mitigating actions to be taken if required. 
Given the significance to the Group of profits 
derived from foreign currencies, management has 
also taken action to reduce the potential risk of 
technical breaches of the net debt to EBITDA ratio, 
which could be caused by sudden movements in 
exchange rates, by ensuring that both net debt and 
EBITDA are translated at the same exchange rate.
The Group’s non-financial covenants are 
reasonably standard for the Group’s type of 
borrowings and its legal and corporate finance 
teams monitor compliance with them regularly.
7. The Group relies on the experience and talent of its 
senior management and on its ability to recruit and 
retain key employees for the success of its business
The successful management and operations of the 
Group are reliant upon the contributions of its senior 
management and other key personnel. In addition, the 
Group’s future success depends in part on its ability 
to continue to recruit, motivate and retain highly 
experienced and qualified employees in the face of often 
intense competition from other companies. Additionally, 
many of the Group’s key employees are employed by 
the Group under profit-sharing or profit related bonus 
arrangements with respect to the businesses they 
operate, and in times of declining profit there can be 
no assurances that the Group will be able to retain such 
senior management or other key personnel (or indeed 
that the Group will be able to attract new personnel to 
support the growth of its business).
The Group offers compensation packages which are 
competitive based on current market information and 
thereby give it the best opportunity to recruit and 
retain people of sufficient calibre. The Group believes 
that its people are challenged in their day to day work 
and obtain appropriate and relevant experience to 
develop further and prepare for progression within the 
organisation, which assists in their retention. 
The effectiveness of the Group’s HR policies has 
been externally acknowledged, e.g. for the third  
year running the Group was recognised as one of 
Britain’s Top Employers by the CRF Institute.
8. Changes in tax laws or their application or 
interpretation may adversely impact the Group
The Group operates in a large number of countries. 
Accordingly, its earnings are subject to tax in many 
jurisdictions. Relevant authorities may amend the 
substance or interpretation of tax laws that apply to 
the Group’s businesses, in a manner that is adverse to 
the Group. There can therefore be no assurance that 
the various levels of taxation to which the Group is 
subject will not be increased or changed. In addition, 
if any Group Company is found to be, or to have been, 
tax resident in any jurisdiction other than those in 
which the Group is currently deemed to be tax resident 
or to have a permanent establishment in any such 
jurisdiction, this may have a material adverse effect on 
the amount of tax payable by the Group. Given that the 
Company has its domicile in Zug Switzerland, the risk 
may be more pronounced. 
The Group employs an experienced Head of Tax who 
keeps abreast of potential changes in tax legislation 
across a range of jurisdictions, engaging in pro-active 
tax planning strategies which enable the Group to 
react quickly to changes in the tax position of any  
of its companies or businesses. 
9. Risks associated with doing business internationally 
and the expansion into new geographic regions 
present new risk factors specific to these regions
The Group’s businesses could be adversely affected 
by a variety of other international factors, including 
changes in a specific country’s or region’s political and 
cultural climate or economic condition and changes 
to, or variances among, foreign laws (including laws 
relating to intellectual property rights and contract 
enforcement) and regulatory requirements. The 
Group’s expansion into various geographic regions 
also presents logistical and management challenges 
related to business cultures, language compliance and 
restrictions on repatriation of earnings. The Group may 
face risks in penetrating new geographic markets due 
to established and entrenched competitors, difficulties 
in developing products that are tailored to the needs of 
local customers, lack of local acceptance or knowledge 
of the Group’s products, lack of recognition of its brands, 
and the unavailability of local companies for acquisition.
In expanding its business geographically, both 
organically and by acquisition, the Group regularly 
reviews risks relevant to particular geographies 
and formulates appropriate mitigation strategies. 
The Group also believes that geographic expansion 
provides a counterbalance to these risks in providing 
opportunities in higher growth markets.

Governance 
Directors’  Report continued
INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   30 21/03/2011   17:33 10. Increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive 
information sources may reduce demand for the Group’s products
In recent years, more public sources of free or relatively 
inexpensive information have become available, 
particularly through the internet, and this trend is 
expected to continue. For example, some governmental 
and regulatory agencies have increased the amount of 
information they make publicly available at no cost. Such 
sources may reduce demand for the Group’s products.
The Group regularly monitors changes in its market 
places and adjusts its product offerings where 
appropriate. It also seeks to take advantage of 
internet trends where appropriate to defend or 
grow its business, e.g. use of social networking.
11. The Group is dependent on the internet and its electronic 
delivery platforms, networks and distribution systems
The Group’s businesses are increasingly dependent 
on electronic platforms and distribution systems, 
which primarily deliver the Group’s products through 
the internet. Any significant failure or interruption 
of these systems, including sabotage, break-ins, 
terrorist activities, natural disaster, service outages and 
computer viruses could thereby restrict the Group’s 
ability to provide services to customers. The Group 
may also be disadvantaged if it does not keep abreast 
of all relevant new technological procedures or if such 
changes are expensive to implement.
The Group regularly invests in its internet and 
electronic delivery platforms, networks and distribution 
systems, and provides user support and services 
to customers having problems accessing data. 
12. Breaches of the Group’s data security systems or other 
unauthorised access to its databases could adversely 
affect the Group’s businesses and operations 
The Group has valuable databases and as part of its 
businesses provides its customers with access to 
database information. There are persons who may try 
to breach the Group’s data security systems or gain 
other unauthorised access to its databases in order 
to misappropriate such information for potentially 
fraudulent purposes or to approach its customers for 
commercial purposes. Because the techniques used 
by such persons change frequently, the Group may be 
unable to anticipate or protect against the threat of 
breaches of data security or other unauthorised access. 
This could damage the Group’s reputation and expose 
it to a risk of loss litigation or regulatory action and 
possible liability, as well as increase the likelihood of 
more extensive Governmental regulation of  
these activities in a way that could adversely affect  
this aspect of the Group’s business.
The Group regularly invests in improving data 
security, digital rights encryption and contracted 
obligations of distributors. These efforts are 
led by a designated data security officer.
13. The Group is subject to regulation regarding 
the use of personal customer data
The Group is increasingly required to comply with 
strict data protection and privacy legislation which 
restrict the Group’s ability to collect and use personal 
information. The need to comply with data protection 
legislation can affect the Group in a number of material 
ways including e.g. making it more difficult to grow and 
maintain marketing data and also through potential 
litigation or regulatory action relating to the alleged 
misuse of personal data. In some cases, the Group may 
rely on third party contractors to maintain its databases. 
The Group is exposed to the risk that its data could be 
wrongfully appropriated, lost or disclosed, or processed 
in breach of data protection regulation, by or on behalf 
of the Group in which case, the Group could face liability 
under data protection laws and/or suffer reputational 
damage from the resulting loss of goodwill. 
The Group seeks to monitor ongoing changes to  
data protection laws and best practices across its 
main trading areas in order to ensure that appropriate 
protections and procedures are in place in relation to 
the data held by or on behalf of the Group. This work  
is overseen by a Group Data Privacy Officer.
14.  The Group may be adversely affected by enforcement 
of and changes in legislation and regulation affecting 
its businesses and that of its customers
Compliance with various laws and regulations may 
impose significant compliance costs and restrictions 
on the Group or alternatively fines for non-compliance. 
In addition, such regulations often provide broad 
discretion to the administering authorities and changes 
in existing laws or regulations, or in their interpretation or 
enforcement, could require the Group to incur additional 
costs in complying with those laws, or require changes 
to its strategy, operations or accounting and reporting 
systems. In particular, laws and regulations relating to 
communications, data protection, e-commerce, direct 
marketing and digital advertising have become more 
prevalent in recent years. Existing and proposed legislation 
and regulations may impose limits on the Group’s 
collection and use of certain kinds of information 
and its ability to communicate such information 
effectively to its customers. Similarly, the Group’s 
customers are required to comply with various laws, 
regulations, administrative actions and policies that are 
subject to change. For example, the Group relies on the 
pharmaceutical industry for a proportion of its publishing 
subscription revenue. Changes in government 
health policies and regulatory pressures may affect 
pharmaceutical companies’ ability or desire to 
continue to provide the same levels of spending with 
the Group as they do currently. Anti-bribery legislation, 
which is becoming more comprehensive and wider-
ranging, may also pose particular challenges, given the 
uncertainty concerning some of its provisions. 
The Group monitors legislative and regulatory changes 
and alters its business practices where appropriate.

Auditors
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval 
of this annual report confirms that:
 so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant  
audit information of which the Company’s auditors  
are unaware; and
 the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought 
to have taken as a director in order to make himself/
herself aware of any relevant audit information and  
to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware  
of that information.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue  
in office as auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will 
be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare the 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. The financial statements are required 
by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the 
Company’s financial position, financial performance and 
cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the 
effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria 
for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the 
International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for 
the preparation and presentation of financial statements’. 
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be 
achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. 
However, the Directors are also required to:
 properly select and apply accounting policies;
 present information, including accounting policies,  
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information; 
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s 
financial position and financial performance; and
 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper 
accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
In accordance with DTR 4.1.12, the Directors confirm that,  
to the best of their knowledge:
 the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set of accounting 
standards and give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 the year end review includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and  
the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks  
and uncertainties that they face.

Governance 
Directors’ Report continued
INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   32 21/03/2011   17:33 The Board recognises that it is accountable to shareholders 
for its standards of governance and is therefore committed 
to the principles of corporate governance contained in 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) 
that was issued in 2008 by the Financial Reporting Council. 
It is in the Board’s view that the Company has been fully 
compliant with all the Code provisions set out in Section 1 
of the code throughout the year ended 31 December 2010. 
Together this report and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 38 to 47, explain how the Company has 
applied the principles and supporting principles of  
Good Governance set out in the Code.
As a Company listed on the London Stock Exchange, 
Informa is subject to the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority and complies with the provisions  
of the Combined Code and relevant institutional 
shareholder guidelines.
As Informa is incorporated in Jersey, it is not subject  
to the UK Companies Act. However, the Board considers  
it appropriate to provide shareholder safeguards which  
are similar to those that apply to a UK registered Company  
and are consistent with the relevant provisions of the  
UK Companies Act.
The Board
Informa plc is the ultimate holding Company of the 
Informa Group of companies (the Group or Informa)  
and is controlled by its Board of Directors. The Board 
members are set out on pages 20 to 21. The Board’s main 
roles are to create value for shareholders, to provide 
entrepreneurial leadership of the Group, to approve 
the Group’s strategic objectives and to ensure that the 
necessary financial and human resources are made  
available to enable those objectives to be met.
A schedule which sets out the matters reserved for the 
Board’s approval is reviewed and updated annually. The 
specific responsibilities reserved for the Board include: 
 approving the Group’s long-term objectives and 
commercial strategy; 
 approving the Group’s annual operating and capital 
expenditure budgets; 
 reviewing operational and financial performance; 
 approving major acquisitions, disposals and capital 
projects; 
 reviewing the Group’s systems of internal control 
 and risk management; 
 reviewing the environmental, health and safety  
policies of the Group; 
 approving appointments to, and removals from,  
the Board and of the Company Secretary; 
 approving policies relating to Directors’ remuneration; 
and
 reviewing the dividend policy and determining the 
amounts of dividends.
The Board has delegated the following activities to the 
Executive Directors: 
 the development and recommendation of strategic 
plans for consideration by the Board that reflect the 
longer-term objectives and priorities established by 
the Board;
 implementation of the strategies and policies of the 
Group as determined by the Board; 
 monitoring of the operating and financial results 
against plans and budgets; 
 monitoring the performance of acquisitions and 
investments against plans and objectives; 
 prioritising the allocation of capital, technical and 
human resources; and 
 developing and implementing risk management systems.
The Roles of the Chairman, Chief Executive 
and Senior Independent Director
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman of 
the Board, the Chief Executive and the Senior Independent 
Director comply with the guidance from the UK Institute of 
Chartered Secretaries and Administrators (ICSA) and as such 
are clearly defined. These are set out in writing and have 
been approved by the Board. 
Derek Mapp has been Non-Executive Chairman since 
17 March 2008 and as Chairman, he leads the Board and 
is responsible for setting its agenda and ensuring its 
effectiveness. He is also responsible for ensuring that 
Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information 
and for effective communication with shareholders. He 
promotes a culture of openness and debate to facilitate 
the effective contribution of Non-Executive Directors and 
constructive relations between the Executive and Non-
Executive Directors. He also acts on the results of the Board 
performance evaluation by leading on the implementation 
of any required changes to the Board and its Committees 
including recognising the strengths and addressing the 
weaknesses of the Board, and, where appropriate, proposes 
new members be appointed to the Board or seeking the 
resignation of Directors. The Chairman holds periodic 
meetings with Non-Executive Directors without the 
Executives present.

Corporate Governance Statement
INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   33 21/03/2011   17:33 Peter Rigby was re-appointed as Chief Executive on 
17 March 2008 and has the responsibility of running the 
Company. As Chief Executive, he has direct charge of the 
Group on a day-to-day basis and is accountable to the Board 
for its operational and financial performance. He is also 
primarily responsible for implementation of the Company’s 
strategy including ensuring the achievement of the Group’s 
budgets and optimising the Group’s resources. He also has 
primary responsibility for managing the Group’s risk profile, 
identifying and executing new business opportunities and 
for management development and remuneration.
Dr Pamela Kirby was appointed as Senior Independent 
Director on 17 March 2008 and is available to meet 
shareholders on request and to ensure that the Board is 
aware of any shareholder concerns not resolved through 
existing mechanisms for investor communication. She acts 
as a sounding Board for the Chairman and, if and when 
appropriate, serves as an intermediary for the other Directors.
Directors and Directors’ Independence
As at 31 December 2010 the Board comprised five 
independent Non-Executive Directors, one of whom is the 
Chairman, and two Executive Directors all of whom, except 
Stephen Carter, have served throughout the 2010 financial 
year. Stephen Carter was appointed by the Board as a fifth 
Non-Executive Director on 11 May 2010.
The Board includes independent Non-Executive Directors 
who constructively challenge and help develop proposals 
on strategy and bring strong, independent judgement, 
knowledge and experience to the Board’s deliberations. 
The independent Directors are of sufficient calibre and 
number that their views carry significant weight in the 
Board’s decision-making process. The Board considers all of 
its Non-Executive Directors to be independent in character 
and judgement. In particular none of them has any personal 
or business relationships which give rise to any conflict or 
potential conflict and each freely contributes to Board and 
committee discussions and decision making.
There is an agreed procedure in place for the Directors to 
obtain independent professional advice, at the Group’s 
expense, should they consider it necessary to do so in order 
to carry out their responsibilities. The Directors’ contracts 
are available for inspection at the registered office and 
principal office during normal business hours and will be 
available for inspection at the AGM.
Information and Professional Development
On appointment the Directors receive relevant information 
about the Group, the role of the Board and the matters 
reserved for its decision, the terms of reference and 
membership of the principal Board Committees and the 
powers delegated to those Committees, the Group’s 
corporate governance policies and procedures and the 
latest financial information about the Group. This is 
supplemented by introductory meetings with key senior 
executives. On appointment the Directors are also advised 
of their legal and other duties and obligations as a Director 
of a listed Company.
Throughout their period in office, the Directors are regularly 
updated on the Group’s business and the environment in 
which it operates, by written briefings and by meetings with 
senior executives, who are invited to attend and present at 
Board meetings from time to time. They are also updated on 
any changes to the legal and governance requirements of 
the Group and those which affect themselves as Directors 
and are able to obtain training, at the Group’s expense, to 
ensure they are kept up-to-date on relevant new legislation 
and changing commercial risks.
Regular reports and papers are circulated to the Directors 
in a timely manner in preparation for Board and Committee 
meetings. These papers are supplemented by any 
information specifically requested by the Directors from 
time to time. The Non-Executive Directors receive monthly 
management reports from the Chief Executive and the 
Finance Director which enable them to scrutinise the Group’s 
and management’s performance against agreed objectives.
Performance Evaluation of the Board and its Committees
The Board utilises a formal and rigorous process, led by 
the Chairman, for the annual internal evaluation of the 
performance of the Board, its principal committees and 
individual Directors. On appointment the Directors are 
made aware that their performance will be subject to 
evaluation. The Non-Executive Directors led by the Senior 
Independent Director meet at least annually to appraise the 
Chairman’s performance.
In respect of the 2010 financial year the Board 
commissioned Alvarez and Marsal and Hanson Green 
to carry out an external evaluation of the corporate 
governance of Informa plc, including an evaluation of 
its Chairman. A comprehensive process has been carried 
out which has included a review of Board and committee 
papers and agendas, and interviews with all Directors, the 
Company Secretary and a selection of senior managers, 
shareholders and the Company’s stockbrokers. It has also 
included observations of Board and committee meetings 
and several planning and informational meetings with the 
Chairman and Company Secretary. The review resulted in 
a detailed analysis of the operation and effectiveness of 
both the Board and its committees and of compliance with 
the Combined Code and the new UK corporate governance 
code. The feedback was provided both orally and in a 
written report. The conclusions provided a very positive 
report on the Company’s governance and provided some 
suggestions for improvement. These are being considered by 
the Board as part of its decision making for 2011. 
Re-election
The Company’s Articles of Association provide for all 
Directors to be subject to annual re-election at the AGM.

Corporate Governance Statement continued
INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   34 21/03/2011   17:33 The Board is satisfied, following independent formal 
evaluation, that each Director continues to be effective 
and to demonstrate commitment to their role.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the 
Board through the Chairman on all governance matters  
and all Directors have access to his advice and services.
Relations with Shareholders
The Company is committed to maintaining good 
communications with investors. Each of Derek Mapp as 
Chairman and Dr Pamela Kirby as Senior Independent 
Director provides the Board with feedback on any issues 
raised with them by shareholders. 
The Executive Directors have frequent discussions 
with institutional shareholders on a range of issues, 
including governance and strategy, affecting the Group’s 
performance. Meetings are also held with the Group’s 
largest institutional shareholders on an individual basis 
following the announcement of the Group’s interim 
and annual results and on other occasions. In addition, 
the Group responds to individual ad hoc requests for 
discussions from institutional shareholders. Following 
meetings held with shareholders after the interim and 
annual results announcements, the Board is provided with 
feedback from the Executive Directors, the Group’s brokers 
and its public relations advisers on investor perceptions. 
The Company’s brokers’ reports on the Group are also 
circulated to all Directors, as are monthly reports of 
significant changes in the holdings of larger investors.
The AGM, for which at least 20 working days’ notice is given 
and where shareholders are invited to ask questions during 
the meeting and are able to meet with the Directors after 
the meeting, is normally attended by all the Directors. The 
number of proxy votes for, against or withheld in respect 
of each resolution is disclosed at the AGM and a separate 
resolution is proposed for each item.
The Group’s corporate website at www.informa.com provides 
a wide range of information about the Group which is of 
interest to both institutional and private investors. This 
includes all announcements made by the Company to the 
FSA as well as video recordings of the interim and annual 
presentations made to analysts, and details of the Group’s 
business and sectors in which it operates.
Going Concern Basis 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Chairman’s Statement and  
Chief Executive’s Review on pages 10 to 14.
As set out on pages 26 to 30 a number of risk factors 
and uncertainties affect the Group’s results and financial 
position. In particular the current economic climate  
creates uncertainties over the level of demand for the 
Group’s products and services. The Group adopts an 
extensive budgeting process in forecasting its trading 
results and cash flows and updates these forecasts to  
reflect current trading on a regular basis.
The Group’s net debt and banking covenants are discussed 
in the Financial Review on pages 15 to 19 and the exposure 
to liquidity risk is discussed in Note 24 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
The Group sensitises its projections to reflect reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance and cash 
conversions, taking into account its substantial deferred 
revenues (£309.8m at 31 December 2010). These forecasts 
and projections for the period up to 30 June 2012, show that 
the Group is expected to be able to operate within the level 
of its current facility and meet its covenant requirements 
for a period of one year from the date of the signing 
of the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2010.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that there are no material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt about the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. Accordingly, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual 
report and financial statements.
Procedures to Deal with Directors’ Conflicts of Interest
The Company’s Articles, which were adopted by 
shareholders on 2 June 2009, include provisions covering 
Directors’ conflicts of interest. 
The Articles allow the Board to authorise any matter that 
would otherwise involve a Director breaching his duty to avoid 
conflicts of interest. The Company has procedures in place 
to deal with a situation where a Director has a conflict of 
interest. As part of this process, the Board will endeavour to:
 consider each conflict situation separately on its 
particular facts;
 consider the conflict situation in conjunction with the 
Company’s Articles;
 keep records and Board minutes as to authorisations 
granted by Directors and the scope of any approvals 
given; and
 regularly review conflict authorisations.
Internal Control and Risk Management 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system 
is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The concept of reasonable assurance 
recognises that the cost of control procedures should not 
exceed the expected benefits.
33 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2010
INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   35 21/03/2011   17:33 The Board has an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the 
Group. This process was in place throughout the year under 
review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements, and is in accordance with the 
Turnbull Guidance “Internal Control: Revised Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code.”
The key features of Informa’s system of internal control 
and risk management systems in relation to the financial 
reporting process include:
 all business units produce and 
agree an annual business plan against which the 
performance of the business is regularly monitored. 
 each business unit’s operating 
profitability and capital expenditure are closely 
monitored. Management incentives are tied to  
financial results. These results include explanations  
of variances between forecast, actual and budgeted 
performance, and are reviewed in detail by Executive 
management on a monthly basis. Key financial 
information is reported to the Board on a monthly basis.
 the framework 
provides clear guidelines for all business units 
of the approval limits for capital and operating 
expenditure, and other key business decisions.
 a risk assessment is embedded into 
the operations of the Group as part of each business 
unit’s annual plan submitted to Executive management 
and the Board for approval. Each business unit 
considers the significant risks to its business and to the 
achievement of the proposed plan. In doing so, each 
unit considers risk in terms of probability of occurrence 
and potential impact on performance, and mitigating 
actions, control effectiveness and management 
responsibility are identified to address these risks. 
The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal controls, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls, risk management and the Group’s 
high-level internal control arrangements. In performing its 
review of effectiveness, the Audit Committee considered 
the following reporting:
 The Risk Committee reports on the effectiveness of risk 
management, governance and compliance activity 
within Informa. This Committee comprises the Chief 
Executive, a cross section of senior officers and 
managers of the Group and is chaired by the Finance 
Director. The Risk Committee supports the Board in its 
consideration of current and forward-looking material 
business risk exposures.
 The external auditors present their proposed annual 
audit plan for approval by the Audit Committee and 
report on any issues identified in the course of their 
work, including internal control reports on control 
weaknesses, which were provided to the Audit 
Committee as well as executive management.
 Internal Audit present their proposed annual audit plan for 
approval by the Audit Committee and reports on reviews 
and tests of key business processes and control activities, 
including following up the implementation of management 
action plans to address any identified control weaknesses 
and reporting any overdue actions to the Audit Committee. 
In order to ensure the quality of the Internal Audit function 
and provide assurance that the Internal Audit function 
complies with the Standards of the Institute of Internal 
Auditors, during 2010 the Audit Committee appointed 
RSM Tenon to conduct an independent External Quality 
Assurance review of the Internal Audit function, which is 
further described below. The remit, approach and delivery 
of the Internal Audit function were found to be satisfactory, 
and the function was found to comply with the International 
Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. 
The Board confirms that no significant failings or 
weaknesses have been identified from the reviews 
performed by Internal Audit.

INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   37 21/03/2011   17:33 accounting, audit and risk issues that are relevant to the 
Group. The mixture of experience of its members assist in 
providing a challenging environment in which these issues 
are debated. The Finance Director, Deputy Finance Director, 
Head of Internal Audit, Chief Operating Officer and Head of 
Tax attend all or part of its proceedings in order to provide 
information to, and be questioned by, the Committee. 
The composition of the Committee was reviewed during 
the year and the Board and Committee are satisfied that it 
has the expertise and resource to fulfill its responsibilities 
effectively including those relating to risk and control.
The Audit Committee monitors the integrity of the Group’s 
financial statements and any formal announcements relating 
to the Group’s performance. The Committee is responsible 
for monitoring the effectiveness of the external audit process 
and making recommendations to the Board in relation to 
the appointment, re-appointment and remuneration of 
the external auditors. It is responsible for ensuring that an 
appropriate relationship between the Group and the external 
auditors is maintained, including reviewing non-audit services 
and fees. The Committee also, in accordance with Turnbull 
Guidance, reviews annually, and has done so during the year 
and up to the date of this report, the Group’s system of internal 
controls and the process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks faced by the Group. It reviews 
the effectiveness of the Group Internal Audit function (which 
includes business risk management) and is responsible for 
approving, upon the recommendation of the Chief Executive, 
the appointment and termination of the head of that function. 
These responsibilities are principally carried out through the 
Risk Committee whose activities are overseen by the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board.
The Committee meets as appropriate with the Executive 
Directors and management, as well as privately with both 
the external and internal auditors. The Committee has 
during the year to 31 December 2010 received sufficient, 
reliable and timely information from the Senior Managers  
to enable it to fulfil its duties. 
In 2010 the Committee has fulfilled its duties under 
its terms of reference during the year and discharged  
its responsibilities primarily by: 
 reviewing the Group’s draft preliminary and interim 
results statements prior to Board approval and 
reviewing the external auditors’ detailed reports 
thereon. In particular reviewing the opinions of 
management and the auditors in relation to the 
carrying values of the Group’s assets and any 
contingent liabilities;
 reviewing the appropriateness of the Group’s 
accounting policies;
 reviewing regularly the impact on the Group’s financial 
statements of matters such as the adoption of 
International Financial Reporting Standards;
 recommending to the full Board, which adopted the 
recommendation, the reappointment of Deloitte LLP  
as the Group’s external auditors;
 reviewing and approving the audit fee and  
reviewing non-audit fees payable to the  
Group’s external auditors;
 reviewing the external auditors’ plan for the audit of 
the Group’s financial statements, which included key 
areas of scope of work; key risks on the financial 
statements; confirmations of auditor independence 
and the proposed audit fee and approving the terms  
of engagement for the audit;
 reviewing the Group’s system of controls and its 
effectiveness. In particular; it approves the annual 
internal audit plan and biannually it reviews the work 
done by Internal Audit and actions which follow from 
the work;
 reviewing the Group’s systems to identify and manage 
risks (including regular consultation with the Head of 
Internal Audit and in particular the operation of the 
Group’s risk committee); and
 reviewing post-acquisition reports on integration  
and performance of significant recent acquisitions 
compared to plans.
The Audit Committee also monitors the Group’s 
whistleblowing procedures to ensure that appropriate 
arrangements are in place for employees to be able to raise 
matters of possible impropriety in confidence, with suitable 
subsequent follow-up action.
The Audit Committee also undertakes a thorough performance 
evaluation which is led by the Chairman of the Committee.
External Auditors
The Audit Committee is also responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Group’s policy on 
external audit. The policy assigns oversight responsibility for 
monitoring the independence, objectivity and compliance with 
ethical and regulatory requirements to the Audit Committee, 
and day to day responsibility to the Finance Director. It states 
that the external auditors are jointly responsible to the Board 
and the Audit Committee and that the Audit Committee is the 
primary contact. The policy also sets out the categories of non-
audit services which the external auditors will and will not be 
allowed to provide to the Group, subject to de minimis levels. 
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of the 
external auditors, the Audit Committee reviewed:
 the external auditors’ plan for the current year,  
noting the role of the senior statutory audit partner, 
who signs the audit report and who, in accordance  
with professional rules, has not held office for more 
than five years, and any changes in the key audit staff;

Corporate Governance Statement continued
INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   38 21/03/2011   17:33 the arrangements for day-to-day management  
of the audit relationship;
 a report from the external auditors describing their 
arrangements to identify, report and manage any 
conflicts of interest; and
 the overall extent of non-audit services provided by 
the external auditors, in addition to its case-by-case 
approval of the provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditors.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors,  
the Audit Committee reviewed:
 the arrangements for ensuring the external auditors’ 
independence and objectivity;
 the external auditors’ fulfilment of the agreed audit 
plan and any variations from the plan;
 the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors in 
their handling of the key accounting and audit 
judgements; and
 the content of the external auditor’s reporting on 
internal control.
Following the above, the Audit Committee has 
recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP is re-
appointed. Deloitte LLP has been the Group’s external 
auditors since 2004. The Audit Committee considers that 
the relationship with the external auditors is working well 
and remains satisfied with their effectiveness. The external 
auditors are required to rotate the audit partner responsible 
for the Group and subsidiary audits every five years and 
the current lead audit partner has been in place since 2009. 
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Group’s 
choice of external auditor.
The Company has in place a policy for the provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditors. This policy 
provides that the firm’s services may only be provided where 
(1) auditor objectivity and independence may be securely 
safeguarded and (2) where the fees payable either in respect 
of the assigned work or overall in any year do not exceed the 
amount of fees payable in respect of its audit work.
During 2010 an External Quality Assurance review of the 
Group’s Internal Audit function was carried out. The purpose 
of the review was to provide an independent perspective on 
the function’s conformance with the Definition of Internal 
Auditing and the International Standards for the Professional 
Practice of Internal Auditing as well as an evaluation of the 
application of the applicable Code Ethics. The conclusion 
was that the remit, approach and delivery of the internal 
audit function are found to be satisfactory. While some 
areas of process improvement were identified, the related 
recommendations set out in the report are not deemed to be 
significant, and were designed further to enhance the current 
internal audit processes and procedures.
Corporate Responsibility 
During 2010, Keith Brownlie was the senior executive with 
day-to-day responsibility for Corporate Responsibility (CR) 
direction and development. Keith is retiring in early 2011, 
with responsibility for CR being passed to Emma Blaney, 
Director of HR. The Group’s CR priorities and strategy are 
formulated and led by a CR committee which reports into 
the Board. Meetings are minuted and communicated to 
other senior level committees when appropriate. 
CR priorities have been decided upon using a diverse range 
of stakeholder insights including:
 in-house expertise from colleagues;
 regular presentations from external parties at Group  
CR Committee meetings;
 institutional investor feedback and insights;
 staff communications;
 feedback and questions from the Group’s customers;
 dialogue with Trade Unions and Non-governmental 
Organisations (NGOs);
 the Group’s membership of networks such as the 
MediaCSRForum; and
 advice from our retained CR advisers.
The Group CR Strategy has five key pillars:
1. providing a rewarding, fair and inspiring workplace  
for staff;
2. ensuring product integrity and quality;
3. managing environmental impacts;
4. maintaining and improving customer service levels; 
and
5. giving back to the communities in which it operates.

INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   39 21/03/2011   17:33 This report has been prepared in accordance with the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority. Although it is not a requirement of Jersey Company law to have the Directors’ Remuneration Report approved by 
shareholders, the Board believes that as a Company whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange it is important 
in terms of its corporate governance for it to do so. Accordingly a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM. 
This report has been divided into separate sections for:
1 information which is unaudited; and
2 information on which the Company’s auditors have reported as having been properly prepared. 
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is responsible to the Board for (1) formulating and recommending to the 
Board remuneration policy and strategy for the Executive Directors and (2) reviewing individual remuneration packages  
of the Executive Directors, including terms and conditions of employment and any changes. 
The Committee also reviews the general remuneration framework for the senior management of the Group and  
approves the operation of any Group share-based incentive schemes, including any Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs).  
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Group website. The membership of the Committee during 2010 
was as follows, each of whom served for the whole year:
Dr Pamela Kirby (Chair of Committee)
Dr Brendan O’Neill
John Davis
The Company Chairman, Derek Mapp, usually attends the meetings by invitation but is not present when matters relating to 
his own remuneration are discussed. The number of meetings of the Committee during 2010 and individual attendance by 
its members are shown on page 34. None of the members who served on the Committee during the year had any personal 
financial interest (other than as a shareholder of the Company) or conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or 
day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. The principal activities carried out by the Committee during 2010 were:
 determination of Non-Executive Chairman’s and Executive Directors’ remuneration;
 determination of the Executive Directors’ bonuses for 2009 and bonus targets for 2011;
 determination of the terms on which the Executive Directors would relocate to Switzerland;
 LTIP awards: determination of performance conditions, vesting of the 2007 grant to Peter Rigby and new awards for 
both Executive Directors and senior management;
 consideration and approval of the Remuneration Report for the 2009 Annual Report;
 monitoring of senior management remuneration; 
 review and appointment of new remuneration consultants; and
 consideration of the Group Defined Benefit Pension Schemes.
In determining the Executive Directors’ remuneration, the Committee consulted the Chairman about its proposals; no Executive 
Director played a part in any decision about his or her own remuneration. Hewitt New Bridge Street (Hewitt) and Towers Watson 
provided advice to the Committee during the year. Following a review, Towers Watson was formally appointed as advisers 
to the Committee in November 2010. As Dr Brendan O’Neill is a member of the Board of Towers Watson Inc, the holding Company 
of Towers Watson, he did not take part in the process of selecting advisers. A statement regarding the Company’s remuneration 
consultants can be found at www.informa.com. Neither Hewitt nor Towers Watson provide any other material services to 
the Group. The Company Secretary, John Burton, also provided assistance to the Committee during the year.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   40 21/03/2011   17:33 Executive Remuneration Breakdown
1
Remuneration Policy
The remuneration of the Executive Directors is designed to provide for a competitive compensation package which refl ects 
the Group’s performance against fi nancial objectives and personal performance criteria. Incentives reward above-average 
performance and are designed to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre executives. The performance assessment of the 
Executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
There are fi ve elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors:
 basic annual salary;
 benefi ts;
 annual bonus;
 share incentives; and
 relocation, retirement and life assurance benefi ts.
The Company’s policy is that a clear majority of the maximum potential remuneration of the Executive Directors should 
be performance-related. As described further below, Executive Directors may earn an annual bonus and benefit from 
participation in a performance-based LTIP. For 2010, all of the bonus payable to the Executive Directors was based on earnings 
per share (EPS) performance. Their 2011 bonus has been set on the same basis. Vesting of LTIP awards granted prior to 2009 
have been conditional upon EPS growth and subject to a total shareholder return (TSR) underpin. LTIP awards granted after 
2008 are subject solely to TSR performance as described below. The chart and table below show the ratios of performance-
related remuneration to base salary and benefi ts of the Executive Directors paid or awarded in respect of the 2010 fi nancial 
year (with the LTIP award valued on the basis of other vesting at 36.7% of face value). These arrangements for bonus and LTIP 
awards refl ect the Committee’s view that the best long-term interests of shareholders are achieved though incentivising the 
Executive Directors through a dual focus on EPS and TSR growth. 
The Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors. In its judgment the remuneration policies for both Executive Directors and senior 
management do not raise environmental, social or governance/operational risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible 
behaviour. Senior management remuneration is set on a similar basis to the Executive Directors except often with lower 
basic salary and substantially lower LTIP elements but more variable bonus/profi t share provision. The latter is usually tied 
directly to the annual profi t performance of a business unit.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that the Chairman determines 
that it is appropriate. 
During 2010 Peter Rigby served as Non-Executive Chairman of Electric Word plc, for which he received and retained fees 
of £12,000.

INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   41 21/03/2011   17:33 Relocation Benefits
As a result of the Company’s redomicile to Switzerland in 2009, the Executive Directors have been relocated so as to be 
based at the Company’s principal offices in Zug, Switzerland. The Committee determined that the Company would meet 
the cost of relocation, and to provide an ongoing relocation benefits allowance on the basis that the ongoing arrangements 
would be broadly cost-neutral to the Company, taking into account estimated savings that the Company would be able to 
realise as the result of the relocation. The main benefit provided from the allowance relates to the provision of housing in 
Switzerland. The costs of the provision of these benefits is contained in the benefits in kind/allowances column of the table 
of Directors’ Emoluments on page 44 of this Report.
Reporting Currency
As the Executive Directors are now required to reside in Switzerland they have entered into new service contracts under 
which they are paid in Swiss Francs (CHF). As a result, for clarity of reporting, all monetary benefits receivable by the 
Executive Directors are set out in this report in CHF. However, the remuneration of the Directors in the financial statements 
is set out in pounds Sterling, the Company’s reporting currency.
Basic Salary
For the purpose of the relocation to Switzerland, the Committee converted the existing 2010 Sterling salaries into Swiss Francs 
at the rate of CHF1.7;£1, being the average exchange rate between the pound and the Swiss Franc during 2009, rounded to 
the nearest whole decimal point for administrative simplicity, as shown in the table below. The basic salaries of the Executive 
Directors are reviewed by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and upon a change of position or responsibility. In 
deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers pay practices in the Group as a whole and makes reference to objective 
external research which gives current information on remuneration practices in appropriate comparator companies.
A review of the salaries of the Executive Directors was undertaken at the end of 2010 with the assistance of Towers Watson. 
It included an analysis of benchmark data from a comparator Group of FTSE 51-150 companies excluding those in financial 
services. Following its review, the Committee concluded that it was appropriate to increase the annual basic salaries of the 
Executive Directors with effect from 1 January 2011 by 3%, as set out below.

Other Benefits
Each of the Executive Directors receives a general benefit allowance of CHF42,500 per annum (£25,000 up to the dates set 
out in the notes to the table above) together with private medical insurance cover and permanent health insurance cover.
Annual and Deferred Bonus
The Committee continues to consider adjusted diluted EPS to be the most suitable financial measurement on which to 
base annual incentives and align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the Company’s shareholders as this 
measurement of performance can be directly influenced by the performance of the Executive Directors and is a key driver 
in generating returns to shareholders. For 2010 the maximum annual bonus was 125% of basic salary dependent upon 
achievement of a sliding scale of challenging diluted adjusted EPS targets which were set at levels to encourage and reward 
the delivery of excellent levels of performance. 
Any award of bonus above 100% may only take the form of a conditional award of shares in the Company which will vest 
only if the Executive Director remains in employment throughout the deferral period of three years, subject to good leaver 
provisions. The number of shares awarded will be determined by reference to the market value of the shares at the date 
concurrent awards under the LTIP are made. Shares utilised for this purpose will be acquired by market purchase; newly 
issued shares will not be used. 
Applying the sliding scale formula, a bonus of 107.9% of basic salary was awarded to each of Peter Rigby and Adam Walker 
for the 2010 financial year, reflecting a year of good financial performance.

Governance 
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   42 21/03/2011   17:33 For 2011, the annual bonus will again be determined based on a sliding scale of diluted adjusted EPS performance, with the 
maximum opportunity increased to 150% of basic salary for appropriately stretching levels of performance. If achieved, any 
award in excess of 100% of base salary may only take the form of a conditional award of shares in the Company, which will 
vest only if the Executive Director remains in employment throughout the deferral period of three years, subject to good 
leaver provisions. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan
Since 2006 Executive Directors have been invited to participate in the Company’s LTIP, which had been introduced and 
approved by shareholders in 2005.
Awards were made in April 2007 and April 2008 at the same level to Peter Rigby (and also to Adam Walker in April 2008,  
his first year in office). Awards were made to the Executive Directors in both 2009 and 2010 of 150% of basic salary and it  
is intended that the same size of award be made to the Executive Directors in 2011.
2007 Awards
40.2% of the 2007 award made to Peter Rigby vested on 17 March 2010 based on performance during the performance 
period. Adjusted diluted EPS grew by an average of 9.62% and the Company’s TSR was 27.7% over the three-year 
performance period, which led to 40.2% of the award vesting. Further details on the 2007 vesting can be found on page 46.
2008 Awards
The EPS-related performance conditions attaching to the LTIP awards made in 2008 had not been met as at 
31 December 2010 and accordingly the 2008 LTIP awards will lapse in March 2011.
2009 Awards
For the LTIP awards made in 2009 and 2010, the following performance conditions apply. It is also intended that these 
performance conditions shall apply to awards to be made for 2011:
 one half of the shares under an award will vest based on the Company’s TSR performance ranked against the TSR 
performance of the constituents of the FTSE 350 index (excluding investment trusts). This half of an award shall vest at 20%  
at median ranking and 100% at upper quintile ranking. Any ranking below median results in none of the award vesting; 
 one half of the shares under an award will vest based on the Company’s TSR performance ranked against the TSR 
performance of the constituents of the FTSE All Share Media Index. This half of an award will vest 20% at median 
ranking and 100% at upper quintile ranking. Any ranking below median results in none of the award vesting; and
 irrespective of the extent to which the TSR performance conditions have been met for the vesting of an award, an 
award will not vest unless a general financial underpin is satisfied. If the Board is not satisfied that the underlying 
financial performance of the Company is reflective on the TSR performance conditions result, it will have the ability to 
scale back vesting (to zero if it considers it appropriate to do so).
Use of TSR as a primary performance measure is considered the best way to align the longer-term interests of management 
and shareholders, with the approach also being the most transparent way of ensuring that executives are incentivised to, 
and rewarded for, the delivery of above market returns to shareholders. In addition, operating a general financial underpin 
also seeks to ensure that a keen focus is maintained on the underlying financial performance of the business.
The shares awarded to participants of the LTIP grants are satisfied through the Informa Group Employee Share Trust, 
currently administered by Nautilus Trust Company Limited in Jersey. 
All-Employee Share Plans
From January 2006 the Executive Directors, along with all other UK employees, were eligible to participate in the Company’s 
pre-existing Share Incentive Plan (the pre-existing SIP), introduced and approved by shareholders in 2005. A new Share 
Incentive Plan (new SIP) was approved by shareholders for its adoption pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement becoming 
effective on 30 June 2009 and approved by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on 6 July 2009. The terms of the new SIP are the 
same in all material aspects. Both SIPs are HMRC Approved All-Employee Share Incentive Plans which offer UK employees the 
opportunity to purchase up to £1,500 of shares in the Company per year out of pre-tax salary. Eligible employees can join the 
SIP provided they have completed six months’ service with the Company.
Following the relocation of both the Executive Directors to Switzerland, as overseas employees and in accordance with the 
rules of the SIP, neither of the Executive Directors is able to continue to participate in the plan. Consequently, both Executive 
Directors have ceased to contribute to the SIP and so have ceased to acquire shares through the plan. Shares previously 
acquired under the SIP prior to the Executive Directors’ relocation remain in the SIP. Peter Rigby holds a total of 1,820 shares 
and Adam Walker 669 shares in the SIP.

All-Employee Share Plans continued
The Company introduced a US Stock Purchase Plan (SPP) in 2008 which was approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 
2008. Eligible employees are invited to join the SPP on an ongoing basis once they have completed six months’ service with 
the Company. The SPP provides a means by which the Group’s US employees may purchase the Company’s shares at a 15% 
discount to the market price. No tax benefi t is available under the SPP. Eligible US employees can purchase up to $2,940 of 
shares per year out of post-tax salary. Shares in Informa held in the SPP at the time of the Scheme of Arrangement becoming 
eff ective on 30 June 2009 were exchanged for shares in the Company; accordingly no new SPP was introduced at this date.
Share Options
The Committee decided in 2005 no longer to grant share options to Executive Directors. Details of subsisting share options 
granted to Peter Rigby in 2004 and earlier are shown on page 46. Existing grants were amended for the Rights Issue on 
27 May  2009 and rolled over to the Company pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement becoming eff ective in June 2009.
Share Ownership Guidelines
Formal share ownership guidelines require the Executive Directors to build up, over a three-year period, a holding in the 
Company’s shares equal to at least one and a half times annual basic salary. Both Executive Directors met this requirement 
as at 31 December 2010.
Retirement and Life Assurance Benefits
The Executive Directors are entitled to receive a contribution of 25% of basic salary toward their retirement arrangements. The 
Company also provides life assurance cover providing for the payment of a lump sum in the event of the insured’s death in service.
Until 21 March 2010, as Peter Rigby was neither an active member of any Group pension scheme nor eligible to make further 
tax effi  cient pension contributions, instead the Company paid to him a monthly payment in lieu of pension contributions 
equal to 25% of basic salary (after deducting the incremental National Insurance costs to the Company). Since that date, as in 
Switzerland 25% of salary pension contributions which may be paid free of deductions are limited to a salary of CHF820,000, 
the excess is also payable in cash after deducting incremental Swiss employer social security costs.
Further details of these entitlements are shown on page 47.
Performance Graph
The graph below shows the Company’s performance, measured by TSR, compared with the performance of the FTSE All Share 
Media Index, also measured by TSR, in the fi ve-year period ended 31 December 2010. The FTSE All Share Media Index has been 
selected for this comparison because the Company is a constituent Company of that index.

INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   44 21/03/2011   17:33 Directors’ Contracts
At 31 December 2010 and in accordance with the Company’s policy, each of the Executive Directors had service contracts 
with an indefinite term under which 12 months’ notice must be given by the Company or by the Director. In March 2010, 
as a result of the relocation arrangements described above, the Executive Directors entered into new service contracts 
with the Company. These contracts are under Swiss law but other than changes required to reflect local law and custom in 
Switzerland, the terms and conditions are essentially the same as those contained in their previous service contracts which 
had been entered into under English law.
There are no specific terms in relation to the service contracts concerning termination following a change of control or  
any special rules concerning equity awards following termination; the Executive Directors are subject to the same rules  
and awards under share schemes following a termination of employment as for all other participants of the relevant 
schemes. In the event of early termination (except for cause), their contracts provide for compensation equal to basic salary, 
benefits allowance and retirement benefit and (in the case of Peter Rigby only, bonus) for the notice period. The Company’s 
policy in respect of protection from exposure to the risk of payment in the event of termination of an Executive Director’s 
contract due to poor performance is to ensure that in the event of a new Executive Director being appointed that no bonus 
is payable under the service contract in the event of the Company making a payment in lieu of notice of termination.  
This policy was followed in relation to the service contract of Adam Walker.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has specific terms of appointment, terminable by three months’ notice. The dates of 
the Directors’ original contracts are shown in the table below, although the contracts have been amended from time to 
time by letter agreement as required, including to reflect the Group’s redomicile and the relocation to Switzerland of the 
Executive Directors and to reflect changes to salary or fee levels. The contracts of the Non-Executive Directors were novated 
on 24 June 2009 so as to be with Informa plc as the new holding Company of the Group. However, the terms of the contracts 
remain the same. The contracts, which include details of remuneration, are available for inspection at the registered office 
and principal office, and will be available for inspection at the AGM.

The grants were made on the terms described on page 41. Subject to achievement of the relevant performance conditions 
and continued employment, these awards will vest subject to a three-year performance period, commencing on 1 January 
of the year of grant. The Committee was satisfied that pursuant to the performance conditions covering Peter Rigby’s award 
made in 2007, 40.2% of his award vested on 17 March 2010. The share price and value of the vesting proportion share award 
on the date of vesting was 381p and £186,248 respectively. Of the 121,603 shares originally awarded, 48,884 vested of which 
Peter Rigby retained 28,842 and sold 20,042, with the balance of the award of 72,719 shares lapsing on the date of vesting. 
The Committee noted that the EPS-related performance conditions covering the Executive Directors’ awards made in 2008 
had not been achieved and accordingly the 2008 awards will lapse in March 2011.

they have no accrued entitlements under these schemes.
Payments made by the Group directly to Directors or their nominated retirement investment vehicles in respect of their 
retirement benefit entitlements are as set out below. Consistent with the form of presentation of the financial information 
in the emoluments table above, the figures below are provided in Swiss Francs. The payments in respect of 2009 and the

The Committee resolved not to make a bonus payment to Peter Rigby in respect of the 2009 financial year. Instead, the Committee decided to make a contribution of £585,200 
(CHF993,611) (the Contribution Amount) to the Informa Group 2010 Employer-Financed Retirement Benefits Scheme (EFRBS), for it to be invested to provide retirement and/or 
death benefits to Peter Rigby. As this contribution was not immediately and fully deductible for corporation tax purposes, the Committee decided to make the contribution in 
two stages in order to have a neutral effect on the Group’s cashflow, when compared with the payment of a bonus. The first payment of £475,276 (CHF806,971) (representing 
81.216% of the Contribution Amount) was paid to the EFRBS in March 2010 and the balance of the Contribution Amount will be paid to the EFRBS in the year in which Peter 
Rigby draws down his benefits under the EFRBS. This remuneration report records both payments being made to Peter Rigby in respect of the 2009 financial year, irrespective  
of the timing of these payments.

INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   49 21/03/2011   17:33 Corporate Responsibility (CR) has always been a core part  
of the business strategy of the Informa Group, but our focus 
in 2010 has been to ensure that it is properly integrated into 
each of the business divisions.
In 2010, all managing directors and divisional Chief 
Executives across the business nominated a senior level 
representative to lead on CR within each division of the 
organisation. Informa’s key businesses also set up divisional 
CR teams which have been tasked with identifying material 
CR issues for their businesses.
Our CR Representatives will now be supported at Group 
level by a full-time CR Co-ordinator, who will manage CR 
on a day-to-day basis. The programme will continue to 
be overseen at Group Level by our Director of CR and HR, 
Emma Blaney, who reports into Peter Rigby.
Providing a rewarding, fair and inspiring workplace for staff
For the third year running Informa was recognised as one 
of Britain’s Top Employers by the CRF Institute. The annual 
survey used in respect of these awards looks at pay and 
benefits, training and development, career opportunities, 
working conditions, and company culture. Taylor & Francis 
(T&F) carried out their own staff survey for the second year 
running. Their overall response rate increased from 80% 
to 85%, with an employee engagement level of over 85%, 
several percentage points above the external benchmarks 
provided by the survey company. The survey is now a core 
component of the T&F strategy and the management 
teams use employee feedback to help drive business 
changes. During 2010 a whole range of initiatives relating 
to personal and professional development, training, staff 
communication and teamwork were introduced in their 
offices worldwide.
Informa’s employee benefits continued to grow and expand 
with a new corporate ISA on offer to all staff in the UK from 
April 2011. A new computer purchase scheme was launched 
in 2010 and has been well received. 
Training continues to be delivered to staff internally across 
the businesses through the Group Informa Academy, 
with the Company also offering internal training sessions. 
Informa supplemented this with external training providers 
when needed.
The Company launched an employee volunteering 
policy this year. In the past many of our staff had been 
volunteering their time to support local charities and 
community organisations. We formalised this giving 
all staff the opportunity to volunteer one day per year. 
Informa sees this as not only an opportunity to support 
local communities but also helps develop staff alongside 
traditional training and development routes.
Ensuring product integrity & quality
As a knowledge based Company Informa’s clients need to 
know that events and publications are expertly researched 
providing balanced, truthful, and reliable content. For 
the academic publications the peer review process helps 
safeguard content. More widely for the Group’s magazines 
and daily news papers an editorial and content code to guide 
journalists and editors has been developed. In 2011 Informa 
aims to roll out a programme of training and initiatives to 
raise awareness in order to support the code, ensuring that 
it covers both in house staff writers and also freelancers.
Maintaining and improving customer service 
One of the key priorities for the Group in 2011 is to continue 
to develop digital content in innovative formats. Informa is 
supporting this process in two important ways:
1. By adapting more flexible business models in 
recognition of the fact that our customers now use 
information in different ways; and 
2. By ensuring that our knowledge is accessible  
to all potential customer Groups, especially the  
most vulnerable to exclusion.
T&F has been at the forefront of the development of digital 
content. In January 2010, it contributed to an independent 
study into the accessibility of ebook platforms by the 
Shaw Trust and also received an honourable mention in 
the first JISC TechDis awards (www.techdis.ac.uk) which 
recognise publishers who have excelled in changing and 
adapting their business processes to meet their customers’ 
accessibility needs.
Managing environmental impacts
Informa is an office based organisation and so the impact 
of direct operations largely relates to the office network. 
Whilst Informa has been able to increase the coverage of 
reporting for this network, it is recognised that more is 
required and this will be a focus for 2011. Informa will also 
up-date all facilities manager’s environmental guidance 
documents which will be made available for all offices.
More importantly Informa wants to do more to understand 
the wider environmental impact through the Group’s print 
supply chain for academic publications, the data centres 
used by the Group, and the air travel to and from the 
Group’s events. This will be a focus for the environment 
programme in 2011.

Informa has long encouraged employees to get involved 
in local community initiatives, as well as take part in Group 
community activities such as fundraising for the World 
Cancer Research Fund (WCRF). 
In 2009, the Group launched its new Community Strategy to 
drive community initiatives across all its businesses. It had 
two main elements: 
1. Volunteering Policy: One day per year for all 
employees; and
2. Partnerships Policy: Encourage each of our businesses 
to build a long-term partnership with a local or 
strategic community partner.
In 2010, a total of £76,100 was raised for our global partner, 
WCRF, through both staff  fundraising and matched funding 
from Informa.
Looking forward to 2011
Our key objectives for 2011 are:
Groupwide:
 Improve CR data reporting for the business.
 Develop CR best practice guidance documents 
for the business.
 Roll-out smart-meter electricity monitoring to 
at least two Group sites.
 Continue to promote and develop the three Group 
wide programmes: 
 Charitable giving – Banana Run
 Environment Awareness – Green Week
 Community Volunteering Week 
Academic Information: 
 Undertake a research project to measure the 
environmental impact of the print supply chain 
logistics for T&F, and use the results to drive further 
improvements.
 Increase employee volunteering at main sites.
Professional and Commercial Information:
 Develop pilot training on the Editorial and Content 
Code at IBI head offi  ce.
 Roll out an overseas volunteering initiative as part 
of IBI’s joint employee development and community 
involvement initiative. In 2011 40 staff  will be sent 
for two weeks to work on community overseas 
community projects.
Events and Training:
 Develop best practice case study on management 
of waste from events. Use this to encourage best 
practice among our events operations partners.
 Develop community partnership between IIR UK 
and the Microloan Foundation.

with homeless young people in Delhi by 
providing them with an education and 
opportunities to reintegrate into society.
T&F identifi ed the organisation as a suitable 
partner for them in 2010 through a rigorous 
screening process designed to help them 
not only fi nd a well-respected partner but 
also one who needed the skills their staff  
could off er. They were supported in this 
by one of their authors, Ms Pushpa Sunder, 
who has written a book on NGOs in India and 
therefore knows the landscape very well.
Throughout the year the number of 
employees involved increased, striving 
to meet the charity’s needs and working 
together by off ering a range of varied 
opportunities for staff  to get involved. 
Some of these are:
 Teams of volunteers have spent a day 
at one of the charity’s care homes;
 The marketing department has sent 
out the charity’s leafl ets to its database 
of contacts & will solicit donations to 
the charity at conferences & book 
launches; and
 Sent gifts to each care home 
during Diwali.
45% of staff , an enviably high rate, have 
now contributed some time to the charity 
and this will hopefully rise even further 
over the long-term.

Independent Auditors’ Report 
to the Members of Informa plc
We have audited the Group financial statements (the 
“financial statements”) of Informa plc for the year ended 
31 December 2010 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1  
to 38. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the  
overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements: 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2010 and of the Group’s profit 
for the year then ended;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union; and
 have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
 proper accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or proper returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
 the financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
 we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 the directors’ statement, contained within the 
Corporate Governance Statement, in relation to going 
concern;
 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code specified 
for our review; and
 certain elements of the report to the shareholders by 
the Board on directors’ remuneration.

1 General information
The Company is incorporated in Jersey under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and headquartered in Switzerland. The 
address of the registered office is given on page 24. The consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2010 and for 
year then ended comprise those of the Company and its subsidiaries and its interests in associates and jointly controlled 
entities (together referred to as the Group).
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Principal Activities and Business Review 
sections of the Directors’ Report on page 23.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, for further analysis refer to the 
Corporate Governance Statement on page 33.
These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (GBP) because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 3.
Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
Standards and interpretations adopted in the current period
The following new standards, amendments and interpretations have been adopted in the current year:
IFRS 2 (amended 2009) Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions 
IFRS 3 (2008) Business Combinations
IAS 27 (2008) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners  
IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers  
Improvements to IFRSs (2009)
The adoption of these standards and interpretations has not led to any changes to the Group's accounting policies except for 
adopting IFRS 3 (2008) Business Combinations and IAS 27 (2008) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. 
As a consequence of adopting these revised standards, the Group has applied the following policies on a prospective basis  
with regard to business combinations and purchases and disposals in a controlled entity transacted on or after 1 January 2010:
 Acquisition related transactions costs are now expensed; and
 Consideration to purchase a business is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. If any contingent payments are 
subsequently re-measured, due to a reassessment of fair value, these changes are transacted through the Income Statement.
Standards and interpretations in issue, not yet adopted 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been 
applied in these financial statements were in issue but have not yet come into effect:
IAS 12 (amended 2010) Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets – not endorsed by the EU
IAS 24 (revised 2009) Related Party Disclosures – endorsed by the EU
IAS 32 (amended 2009) Classification of Rights Issues  – endorsed by the EU
IAS 39 (amended 2009) Recognition and Measurement: Eligible Hedged Items – endorsed by the EU
IFRS 7 (amended 2010) Financial Instruments: Disclosures – not endorsed by the EU
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – not endorsed by the EU
IFRIC 14 (amended 2009) Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement – endorsed by the EU
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments – endorsed by the EU
Improvements to IFRSs (2010) – not endorsed by the EU
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material 
impact on the financial statements of the Group, except for: 
 IFRS 9 is a new standard which enhances the ability of investors and other users of financial information to understand 
the accounting of financial assets and reduces complexity. IFRS 9 uses a single approach to determine whether a 
financial asset is measured at amortised cost or fair value, replacing the many different rules in IAS 39. This standard is 
effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013 and therefore the Group has not commenced 
its evaluation of the impact on the Group’s reported profit or net assets.

2 Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
Adjusted results
Management believes that adjusted results and adjusted earnings per share (Note 14) provide additional useful 
information on underlying trends to shareholders. These measures are used for internal performance analysis and incentive 
compensation arrangements for employees. The term ‘adjusted’ is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore be 
comparable with similarly titled profit measurements reported by other companies. It is not intended to be a substitute for, 
or superior to, IFRS measurements of profit. 
The following charges were presented as adjusting items:
Notes
2010
£m
2009
£m
Amortisation of other intangible assets 16 133.8 129.7
Impairment 31 5.0 –
Restructuring and reorganisation costs 8 8.3 34.1
Acquisition related costs 7 1.3 –
Subsequent re-measurement of contingent consideration 7 0.8 –
Loss on disposal of business 31 – 1.0
De-designation of hedge accounting 10 1.1 –
Excess interest on early repayment of syndicated loans 10 1.1 –
151.4 164.8
Tax related to adjusting items 12 (41.3) (78.2)
110.1 86.6
The principal adjustments made are in respect of:
 restructuring and reorganisation costs – the costs incurred by the Group in reorganising and integrating acquired 
businesses, non-recurring business restructuring and the closure or disposal of businesses; 
 amortisation and impairment of other intangible assets – the Group continues to amortise other intangible assets and 
test for impairment of these assets. The amortisation charge in respect of intangible software assets is included in the 
adjusted results. The amortisation charge in respect of all remaining other intangible assets is excluded from the 
adjusted results as management does not see these charges as integral to underlying trading; 
 excess interest on early repayment of syndicated loans – capitalised facility fees are amortised over the loan periods but 
where syndicated loan facilities have been terminated early, the unamortised fees are immediately expensed. This 
accelerated expense is not viewed as being part of the underlying results and is thus excluded from the adjusted results; and
 de-designation of hedge accounting – where syndicated loan facilities have been terminated early the fixed interest 
rate swaps are of a greater value than the remaining borrowings. As the swap cannot be re-designated, the over hedged 
element of the swaps has been charged to the income statement as an exceptional interest charge.
The tax related to adjusting items is the tax effect of the items above and in 2010 it also includes the effect of the reduction in 
the UK deferred tax rate from 28% to 27%. In 2009 the tax related to adjusting items also included the deferred tax arising on 
Group restructuring.
The Group’s operations are split into three broad market sectors of Academic Information, Professional & Commercial 
Information and Events & Training. These divisions are further analysed into more specific segments which bring together 
products in comparable market areas under common business heads. This is how the Group’s operational management is 
structured and its results are reviewed and thus form the reporting segments (Note 6).

3 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain assets and 
financial instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted, all of which have been consistently applied, are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. The consolidated 
financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries 
acquired or sold are included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the 
effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of acquired subsidiaries to 
bring their accounting policies into line with those used by other members of the Group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expense are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity and 
consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination plus their share of changes in equity 
since that date.
Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods 
and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes, and provisions  
for returns and cancellations. 
Subscription income is deferred and recognised over the term of the subscription. 
Sponsorship and exhibition income are deferred and recognised when the event is held. 
Delegates’ income represents fees earned and is recognised when the event is held. 
Copy sales revenue is recognised on the sale of the directory or publication.
Advertising revenue is recognised on issue of the publication.
Consulting and training revenues are recognised as services are delivered. Where consultancy services are provided over 
a period of time, revenue is recognised using the stage of completion method when the outcome of the contract can be 
measured reliably. The stage of completion is determined with regard to key milestones in the contract being attained and 
the percentage of services performed under the contract as a percentage of the total services to be performed. 
Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial 
asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividend income
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Business combinations
Business combinations from 1 January 2010: 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is 
measured at the aggregate of fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the

Consolidated Income Statement.

Business combinations continued
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, will be 
recognised in accordance with IAS 39  Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement either in profit or loss or as a 
change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured 
until it is finally settled within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount 
recognised for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration 
is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in profit or loss.
Business combination prior to 1 January 2010: 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. 
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 
(2004) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are 
classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are 
recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary companies and businesses is calculated as the excess of purchase 
consideration over the fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. It is recognised as an asset 
at cost, assessed for impairment at least annually and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units, as defined by the 
Board for internal management purposes, expected to benefit from the combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment 
annually or more frequently when there is an indication that it may be impaired. Where an impairment test is performed a 
discounted cash flow analysis is carried out based on the cash flows of the cash generating unit compared with the carrying 
value of that goodwill. Management estimate the discount rates as the risk affected cost of capital for the particular cash 
generating units. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other 
assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
Upon disposal, the attributable carrying value of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. For business combinations, cost is calculated based on the Group’s  
valuation methodologies (Note 4). These assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis, which 
are as follows:
Book lists 20 years
Journal titles 20 – 40 years 
Database content and intellectual property 4 – 10 years
Large scale events and exhibitions 8 – 10 years
Software which is not integral to a related item of hardware is included in intangible assets. Capitalised internal-use software 
costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software, and payroll 
and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote substantial time to, the project. 
Capitalisation of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its 
internal purpose. These costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives which are deemed to be 
3-10 years. 
The expected useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed annually.
The Group does not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives.
INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   62 21/03/2011   17:33 61 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2010
Property and equipment
Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment. Depreciation is 
provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property and equipment on a straight line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of the assets. The rates of depreciation are as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings Over life of the lease 
Equipment, fixtures and fittings 3 – 15 years
Freehold land is not depreciated.  
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the net sale 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Income Statement.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash 
generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated 
as a revaluation decrease.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value 
less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through  
a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly 
probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be 
committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the  
date of classification.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and expenses incurred in 
bringing the inventory to its present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less 
marketing and distribution costs expected to be incurred. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on 
the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are 
retranslated at the rates ruling at that date. These translation differences are disclosed in the Income Statement.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at 
the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value 
are included in the Income Statement for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary 
items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange 
component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
The statements of financial position of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Pounds Sterling at the closing rates of 
exchange. The results are translated at an average rate, recalculated for each month between that month’s closing rate  
and the equivalent for the preceding month.

3 Accounting policies
Foreign currencies continued
Foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of opening net investments in foreign subsidiaries at the 
closing rate are taken directly to the hedging and translation reserve. In addition, foreign exchange differences arising 
from retranslation of the foreign subsidiaries’ results from monthly average rate to closing rate are also taken directly to 
the Group’s hedging and translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised in the Income Statement in the 
financial year in which the operations are disposed of. The translation movement on matched long-term foreign currency 
borrowings, qualifying as hedging instruments under IAS 39, are also taken directly to the hedging and translation reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the lease 
and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful economic lives of the assets. The 
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Statement of Financial Position as a finance lease obligation. Finance 
charges are allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the 
Income Statement. 
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Income Statement in equal annual amounts over the lease term.
Rental income from sub leasing property space is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease and is 
matched with the corresponding payments made under the head lease.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and 
is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax nor accounting profit. 
Deferred tax is calculated for all business combinations in respect of intangible assets and properties. A deferred tax liability 
is recognised to the extent that the fair value of the assets for accounting purposes exceeds the value of those assets for tax 
purposes and will form part of the associated goodwill on acquisition. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to 
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Pension costs
Certain Group companies operate defined contribution pension schemes for employees. The assets of the schemes are held 
separately from the individual companies. The pension cost charge associated with these schemes represents contributions 
payable and is charged as an expense when they fall due.
The Group also operates funded defined benefit schemes for employees. The cost of providing these benefits is determined 
using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each reporting date. Past service cost 
is recognised immediately to the extent the benefits are vested, and otherwise are amortised on a straight line basis over the 
average period until the benefits become vested. The current service cost and the recognised element of any past service 
cost are presented within operating profit. The interest cost arising on the pension liability less the interest return on the 
scheme assets is presented within finance costs. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they 
occur, outside of the Income Statement and in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The expected return on scheme 
assets reflects the estimate made by management of the long-term yields that will arise from the specific assets held within 
the pension scheme. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Statement of Financial Position represents the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and the fair value of any relevant scheme assets.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. A fair value for the equity-settled share 
awards is measured at the date of grant. The fair value of the Share Options and Long-Term Incentive Plan is measured 
using the Binomial or Monte Carlo model of valuation, which are considered to be the most appropriate valuation 
techniques. The valuation takes into account factors such as non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations. To assign a fair value to share awards granted under the Share Matching Plan where the proportion of 
the award released is dependent on the level of total shareholder return, the Monte Carlo Simulation methodology is 
considered the most appropriate.
An expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award over the vesting period on a straight line basis, after 
allowing for an estimate of the share awards that will actually vest. The estimate of vesting is reviewed annually, with any 
impact on the cumulative charge being recognised immediately.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised in the Group’s Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are classified into the following categories: loans and receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and available-
for-sale investments. The classification is determined by Management upon initial recognition, and it is based on the 
purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest 
income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
(including all fees on points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and 
other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for all debt instruments within the Group. 
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible (with a maturity of three months or less) to a known amount of cash and are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Cash Flow Statement.

3 Accounting policies continued
Available-for-sale investments
Listed and unlisted shares held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being available-for-sale and 
are stated at fair value. Fair values of listed securities are based on quoted market prices and the unlisted securities are based 
on cost. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of 
or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the 
Income Statement for the period. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognised in the investments revaluation reserve is included in profit or loss for the period.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date. Financial assets are impaired where there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the 
estimated future cash flows of the investment have been negatively impacted.
For unlisted shares classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its 
cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include:
 significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
 default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
 it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation.
For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually 
are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of 
receivables could include the Group’s past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed 
payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of 43 days (2009: 39 days), as well as observable changes in national 
or local economic conditions that correlate with increased default risk on receivables. A specific provision will also be raised 
for trade receivables when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according 
to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter 
bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments (more than 90 days overdue) are considered 
indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the 
exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of a provision account. When a trade 
receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the provision account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited against the provision account. Changes in the carrying amount of the provision account 
are recognised in the Income Statement.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the assets have expired 
or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. If the Group 
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred 
asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the 
Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to 
recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered 
into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of 
its liabilities.
Classification as debt or equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangement.
INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   66 21/03/2011   17:33 65 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2010
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the 
Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the 
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Finance costs 
Finance costs of debts are capitalised against the debt value on first drawdown of the debt and are recognised in the Income 
Statement using the effective interest rate method. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective 
interest rate method.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an 
effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest 
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
The derivative instruments utilised by the Group to hedge these exposures are primarily interest rate swaps. The Group does 
not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 
whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group 
designates certain derivatives as either:
 hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash 
flow hedge); or
 hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, 
as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. Furthermore, at the 
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a 
hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows 
are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. If the cash 
flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time 
the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in 
equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For cash flow hedges that result in the recognition of a 
financial asset or financial liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the Income Statement in the same period in 
which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the 
Income Statement as they arise.

3 Accounting policies
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting continued
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the 
period of the contracts.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity 
is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the Income Statement for the period.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more 
than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current 
assets or current liabilities.
Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note 24.
ESOP Trust shares
Own shares deducted in arriving at shareholders’ funds represent the cost of the Company’s ordinary shares acquired by the 
Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) trusts in connection with certain of the Group’s employee share schemes.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been 
communicated to the affected parties.

4 Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, the Directors are required to make 
judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are 
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
In addition to the judgment taken by management in selecting and applying the accounting policies set out above, the 
Directors have made the following judgments concerning the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
Valuation and asset lives of separately identifiable intangible assets
In order to determine the value of the separately identifiable intangible assets on a business combination, management 
are required to make estimates when utilising the Group’s valuation methodologies. These methodologies include the use 
of discounted cash flows, revenue forecasts and gross profit multiples. Asset lives are estimated based on the nature of the 
intangible asset acquired and range between 3 and 40 years.
Valuation of share-based payments
In order to determine the value of share-based payments, management are required to make an estimation of the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. The expected volatility is determined by calculating 
the historical volatility of the Company’s share price calculated over one, two and three years back from the date of grant. The 
list of inputs used in the Binomial and Monte Carlo Simulation models to calculate the fair values are provided in Note 37.
Valuation of financial instruments at fair value
Management have made a number of assumptions with regards to the models used to value financial instruments at their 
fair value at year end. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. Note 24 details the methods 
used to value the primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Group’s borrowing requirements and the 
derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate profile.
For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features 
of the instrument. Other financial instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on assumptions 
supported, where possible, by observable market prices or rates. 
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
There are a number of assumptions management have considered in performing impairment reviews of goodwill and 
intangible assets, as determining whether goodwill or intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in 
use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the directors 
to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to 
calculate present value. Note 15 details the assumptions that have been applied.
Pension assumptions
There are a number of assumptions management have considered on the advice of actuaries which have an impact on the 
results of the valuation of the pension scheme liabilities at year end. The most significant assumptions are those relating to 
the discount rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions. Note 36 details the assumptions 
which have been adopted.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgment in determining the amounts to be recognised. In particular, 
judgment is used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised with consideration given to 
the timing and level of future taxable income.
Provisions
Provisions have been made for onerous leases, dilapidations and restructuring. These provisions are estimates and the 
actual costs and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events. Any difference between expectations and the 
actual future liability will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made. Details of the Group’s provisions 
are set out in Note 28.
Contingent consideration
Contingent consideration relating to acquisitions has been included based on management estimates of the most likely 
outcome (Note 28). However under IFRS 3 (2008) subsequent remeasure of contingent consideration is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.

6 Business segments
Business segments
Management has identified reportable segments based on financial information used by the Board of Directors in allocating 
resources and making strategic decisions. 
Information currently reported to the Board for the purposes of managing performance is focused on the different services 
the Group offers, namely publishing, and training and events.
The Group’s five identified reportable segments under IFRS 8 are as follows:
Academic Information (AI)
This division, which includes the Taylor & Francis publishing business, provides a portfolio of online and print publications, 
primarily for academic users across the spectrum of Science, Technology, Humanities and Social Sciences. 
Professional and Commercial Information (PCI)
This division, which includes Datamonitor, Informa Business Information and Informa Financial Information provides 
information, across a range of formats and on a global basis, to a variety of sectors including Medical, Pharmaceutical, 
Financial, Law, Commerce, Commodities, Maritime and Telecoms.
Events and Training – Europe, US and ROW

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies described in Note 3. 
Adjusted operating result by operating segment is the measure reported to the Group’s Chief Executive for the purpose 
of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance. Unallocated costs were £Nil in 2010. The unallocated 
costs of £6.4m in 2009 related to aborted transaction costs and change of domicile referred to in Note 8. Finance costs and 
investment income are not allocated to segments, as this type of activity is driven by the central treasury function, which 
manages the cash positions of the Group.

the tangible, intangible and financial assets attributable to each segment. All assets are allocated to reportable segments 
except for corporate balances, including taxation (current and deferred). Assets used jointly by reportable segments are 
allocated on the basis of the revenues earned by individual reportable segment.

Holders of 49,237 (2009: 71,628) ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each have waived their rights to receive dividends.
Pursuant to the Dividend Access Plan (DAP) arrangements put in place in 2009 as part of the Scheme of Arrangement, 
shareholders in the Company are able to elect to receive their dividends from a UK source (a DAP election). Shareholders 
who (i) held 100,000 or fewer shares on the date of admission of the Company’s shares to the London Stock Exchange and 
(ii) in the case of shareholders who did not own the shares at that time, on the first dividend record date after they become 
shareholders in the Company, unless they elect otherwise, are deemed to have elected to receive their dividends under the 
DAP arrangements. Shareholders who hold more than 100,000 shares and who wish to receive their dividends from a UK 
source must make a DAP election. All elections remain in force indefinitely unless revoked. Unless shareholders have made a 
DAP election, or are deemed to have made a DAP election, dividends will be received directly from the Company, domiciled 
in Switzerland, and will be taxed accordingly.

14 Earnings per share
Basic
The basic earnings per share calculation is based on a profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent of £98.9m 
(2009: £105.6m). This profit on ordinary activities after taxation is divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue 
(less those non-vested shares held by employee share ownership trusts) which is 600,421,797 (2009: 560,764,541).
Diluted
The diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the basic earnings per share calculation above except that the 
weighted average number of shares includes all potentially dilutive options granted by the reporting date as if those  
options had been exercised on the first day of the accounting period or the date of the grant, if later, giving a weighted 
average of 600,627,044 (2009: 560,843,788). 
The table below sets out the adjustment in respect of diluted potential ordinary shares:
2010 2009
Weighted average number of shares used in basic earnings per share calculation 600,421,797 560,764,541
Effect of dilutive share options 205,247 79,247
Weighted average number of shares used in diluted earnings per share calculation 600,627,044 560,843,788
Adjusted earnings per share
The basic and diluted adjusted earnings per share calculations have been made to allow shareholders to gain a further 
understanding of the trading performance of the Group. They are based on the basic and diluted earnings per share 
calculations above except that profits are based on continuing operations attributable to equity shareholders and are 
adjusted for items that are not perceived by management to be part of the underlying trends in the business, and the tax 
effect of those adjusting items, as follows:
2010 2009
Profit for the year 98.9 106.5

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be 
impaired. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the 
value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates for the period. Management estimates 
discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific  
to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and long-term growth in gross domestic product. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors 
for the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following four years based on estimated growth rates. The most 
recent financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors have been prepared after considering the current economic 
environment in each of our markets. The estimates of future cash flows are consistent with past experience adjusted for 
management’s estimates of future performance. The cash flows thereafter are based upon the long-term historic growth 
rates of the underlying territories in which the CGU operates. A growth rate of 3% has been applied for years 2-5 in AI, a 
range between 4% and 9% for PCI and a range between 3% and 17% for the Events businesses.

For the year ended 31 December 2010 continued
Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 78
15 Goodwill continued
The pre-tax discount rates applied are 9.5% for AI and PCI and 10.5% for the Events businesses. There has been no change 
to the discount rate since the prior year, which is consistent with the fact that there has been no significant change in the 
markets in which the Group operates. A terminal growth rate of 2% has been used for AI and PCI, and 3% for the Events 
businesses. The rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
At 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009, the carrying amounts of goodwill for CGUs were tested for impairment and 
deemed not to be impaired. 
Those CGUs which had the lowest level of headroom or potential impairment in this analysis related to the Events businesses.  
If the economic environment surrounding this sector declines in 2011, the effect of which would erode the customer base 
further, there may be the possibility of a future impairment. Management will conduct regular reviews to monitor this.
Management has undertaken sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test assumptions 
arising from a range of possible future trading and economic scenarios. The scenarios have been performed separately for 
each CGU with the sensitivities summarised as follows:
 An increase in the pre-tax discount rate by 1%.
 A decrease of between 1% and 2% (depending on the CGU) on forecast operating profits over years 2-5, and a decrease 
in the terminal growth rate by 1% for all CGUs. 
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would result from an increase in the pre-tax discount rate. However, 
an impairment of £23.7 million would result from sensitivities applied to the growth rates for the European Conferences 
business (included in CGU for Events Europe).

The June 2010 United Kingdom Budget Statement included proposals to reduce the rate of UK corporation tax by 1% per 
annum from 28% to 24% by 1 April 2014. The change from 28% to 27% was enacted at 31 December 2010. The effect of the 
reduction to 27% has reduced the deferred tax liability at 31 December 2010 by approximately £3.8m, increased profit for the 
year by £4.0m and decreased other comprehensive income by £0.2m.
The proposed further reductions to 24% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year. The overall effect 
of a further reduction to 24%, if applied to the deferred tax balance at 31 December, would reduce the deferred tax liability 
by approximately £11.6m.
At 31 December 2010, the Group has unused tax losses of £nil (2009: £11.5m) available for offset against future profits.  
A deferred tax asset of £nil (2009: £3.2m), has been recognised in respect of these losses.
At the reporting date, the aggregate amount of withholding tax on post acquisition undistributed earnings for which 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £7.4m (2009: £3.1m). No liability has been recognised because the 
Group, being in a position to control the timing of the distribution of intra-group dividends, has no intention to distribute 
intra-group dividends in the foreseeable future that would trigger withholding tax.

24 Financial instruments 
(a) Financial risk management
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
 Capital risk management
 Market risk
 Credit risk
 Liquidity risk
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s management of capital, 
and the Group’s objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk. 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management 
framework. The Board has established a Treasury Committee which is responsible for developing and monitoring the 
Group’s financial instrument related risk management policies. The committee meets and reports regularly to the Board of 
Directors on its activities.
The Group treasury function provides services to the Group’s businesses, co-ordinates access to domestic and international 
financial markets and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through internal risk 
reports which analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including currency risk, 
fair value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Treasury Committee has put in place policies that have been established to identify and analyse financial instrument 
related risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. 
These policies provide written principles on funding and investment policies, credit risk, foreign exchange risk and interest 
rate risk. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Treasury Committee. This committee is assisted 
in its oversight role by Internal Audit, who undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and 
procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. 
Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while 
maximising the return to stakeholders as well as sustaining the future development of the business. In order to maintain 
or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2009.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes borrowings (Note 23) and cash and cash 
equivalents (Note 20), and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital (Note 25), 
reserves and retained earnings.
US private placement
Private placement loan notes of US$730.0m equivalent were issued in December 2010 and January 2011. The notes are 
denominated in US Dollars ($597.5m), Euros (€50.0m) and Sterling (£40.0m). Amounts issued in December 2010 are US Dollars 
($552.5m), Euros (€50.0m) and Sterling (£40.0m). The remaining US Dollars amount ($45.0m) was issued in January 2011. As 
per note 23, the private placement loan note as at 31 December 2010 totalled £440.0m. Proceeds of the issue have been used 
to repay existing bank debt facilities. The note maturities will range between five and ten years, with an average duration of 
8.3 years, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.3%.
Cost of capital
The Group’s Treasury Committee reviews the Group's capital structure on a regular basis and as part of this review, the 
committee considers the weighted average cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Gearing ratio
The principal financial covenant ratios under these facilities are maximum net debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times and minimum 
EBITDA interest cover of 4.0 times, tested semi-annually. At 31 December 2010 both financial covenants were comfortably 
achieved, with the ratio of net debt (using average exchange rates) to EBITDA reduced from 2.7 times at 31 December 2009 
to 2.3 times at 31 December 2010.

(c) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the 
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage 
and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group’s activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in 
interest rates. The Group enters into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates and by managing the 
risk of currencies of its borrowings, the Group is able to achieve a level of natural hedge of both the Statement of Financial 
Position net currency assets and also the currency earnings due to the currency interest payable. Refer to both interest rate 
risk and foreign currency risk in Note 24 (d) and (e) respectively. 
The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by a central treasury 
department (Group Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Board sets the Group’s treasury policy 
to ensure that it has adequate financial resources to develop the Group’s businesses and to manage the currency and 
interest risks to which the Group is exposed. Group Treasury monitors the distribution of its cash assets, borrowings and 
facilities so as to control exposure to the relative performance of any particular territory, currency or institution.
INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   88 21/03/2011   17:33 87 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2010
The Board and the Treasury Committee provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering 
specific areas, such as funding, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investments of excess liquidity. 
Risk is measured in terms of impact, inherent risk and residual risk, and takes account of management’s control actions in 
mitigating against both external and internal risk events.
The risk model consolidates unique risk events and aggregated risk categories at both a business unit level and Group-wide, 
and the results are presented to the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee for discussion and review, and may drive the 
allocation of Internal Audit resources to provide assurance on significant risks in its annual plan.
(d) Interest rate risk
The Group has no significant interest-bearing assets and is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds 
at both fixed and floating interest rates. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. 
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings by the 
use of interest rate swap contracts. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined 
risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either protecting the Statement of Financial Position or 
protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Group's policy is to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by using interest rate swaps as cash flow 
hedges to hedge up to 90% of forecast interest payments over a period of up to five years, based on forecast net debt levels 
by currency during that period. This policy provides a level of certainty of future interest costs by swapping floating to fixed 
interest payments which in turn assists the predictability of achieving interest-based loan covenants.
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section  
of this note.
Interest rate swap contracts
The Group draws down on its bank borrowing facilities at floating rates of interest. A portion of those are then swapped to 
fixed rates in line with the Group Treasury policy in order to manage its cash flow interest rate risk. Such contracts enable the 
Group to convert borrowings from floating rates and swap them into fixed rates. Under interest rate swaps, the Group agrees 
with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals (primarily quarterly), the difference between fixed contract rates and 
floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts. 
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the future 
interest rate curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below. The average 
interest rate is based on the outstanding balance at the end of the financial year. 
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding

At 31 December 2010, the fixed interest rates vary from 3.13% to 6.15% (2009: 3.13% to 6.15%), and the main floating rates 
are EURIBOR and LIBOR. Gains or losses deferred in equity on interest rate swap contracts as of 31 December 2010 will be 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
A high percentage of loans are at fixed interest rates or are designated in hedging relationships, and hence the Group’s 
interest rate sensitivity would only be affected by the exposure to variable rate debt.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for 
the year would have decreased or increased by £0.3m (2009: £2.4m).
(e) Foreign currency risk
The Group is a business with significant net US Dollar (USD) and net Euro (EUR) transactions; hence exposures to exchange 
rate fluctuations arise. In the absence of any currency conversion, cash positions in USD and other trading currencies, such as 
the EUR would develop imbalances by growing GBP debt. 
Allied to the Group’s policy on the hedging of surplus foreign currency cash inflows, the Group will usually seek to finance its 
net investment in its principal overseas subsidiaries by borrowing in those subsidiaries’ functional currencies, primarily EUR and 
USD. This policy has the effect of partially protecting the Group’s consolidated Statement of Financial Position from movements 
in those currencies to the extent that the associated net assets are hedged by the net foreign currency borrowings.

After taking into account foreign currency borrowings of £620.1m (2009: £526.0m) used to hedge against net investments in 
foreign subsidiaries, the remaining monetary assets and liabilities are in the same currency as the functional currency of the 
operations involved.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group receives approximately 49% of its revenues and incurs approximately 43% of its costs in USD or currencies pegged 
to USD. The Group is therefore sensitive to movements in the USD against the GBP. Each 1 cent movement in the USD to GBP 
exchange rate has a circa £3.9m impact on revenue and a circa £1.4m impact on operating profits. Offsetting this will be reductions 
to USD interest and USD tax liabilities. This analysis assumes all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
The Group receives approximately 11% of its revenues and incurs approximately 10% of its costs in Euros. The Group is 
therefore sensitive to movements in the Euro against the GBP. Each 1 cent movement in the Euro to GBP exchange rate has 
a circa £1.2m impact on revenue and a circa £0.4m impact on operating profits. Offsetting this will be reductions to Euro 
interest and Euro tax liabilities. This analysis assumes all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
(f ) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are loans and receivables (trade and other receivables) and cash and cash equivalents, 
which represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The amounts presented in the Statement 
of Financial Position are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior 
experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the 
Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk  
of financial loss from defaults. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited by dealing only with counterparty banks 
with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies such as Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. 
No new credit exposure on derivative financial instruments is permitted to a financial institution with a rating lower than 
A+ or equivalent. The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the 
aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions. Credit exposure is controlled 
by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Treasury Committee regularly.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents 
the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas and the 
Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of 
the Group’s customer base, including default risk of the industry and country in which the customers operate, has less of an 
influence on credit risk.

(f ) Credit risk continued
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any Group of counterparties 
having similar characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities. 
Concentration of credit risk did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year. 
The Group establishes a provision that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables 
and investments when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The main components of this provision are a 
specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for 
Groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss provision is 
determined by references to past default experience. 
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit rating system to assess the potential customer’s 
credit quality. All customers have credit limits set by credit managers and are subject to standard terms of payment for each 
division. As the events division works on a prepaid basis they are not subject to the same credit controls and they have a low 
bad debt history. The Group is exposed to normal credit risk and potential losses are mitigated as the Group does not have 
significant exposure to any single customer.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables, which are non-interest bearing, 
approximates their fair value.

Trade receivables that are less than three months past due for payment are generally not considered impaired; included in 
these trade receivables are debtors with a carrying amount of £0.5m (2009: £9.0m), which are past due at the reporting date 
for which the Group has not provided, as there has not been a significant change in the credit quality and the amounts are 
considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. 
A provision relating to returns on books of £9.4m (2009: £9.3m) has been disclosed separately in the table above. This 
provision is based on Management’s best estimate of previous seasonal sales and returns trends, and is included as part of 
the overall provision balance.

22.1 25.2
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade 
receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due 
to the customer base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision 
required in excess of the above amounts.
There are no customers who represent more than 10% of the total gross balance of trade receivables in both 2010 and 2009.

(g) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate 
responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, though operationally it is managed by 
Group Treasury. Group Treasury have built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of 
the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity 
risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking and other debt facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously 
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Included in 
Note 23 is a summary of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk. 
Historically and for the foreseeable future the Group has been and is expected to continue to be in a net borrowing position. 
The Group’s policy is to fulfill its borrowing requirements by borrowing in the currencies in which it operates, principally 
GBP, USD and EUR; thereby providing a natural hedge against projected future surplus USD and EUR cash inflows as well as 
spreading the Group’s interest rate profile across a number of currencies. 
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial assets and liabilities.
The table below has been drawn up based on the contractual maturities of the financial assets including interest that will be

Under IFRS 7 contractual cash flows are undiscounted and therefore may not agree with the carrying amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The Group draws down on its bank borrowing facilities at floating rates of interest. A portion of those are then swapped  
to fixed rates in line with the Group treasury policy. The first portion of these swaps that matures within twelve months  
has a principal amount of £403.7m (2009: £144.4m), the second portion that matures in a period greater than one year  
but less than two years of £114.6m (2009: £397.2m) and the final portion that matures between two and five years of £nil 
(2009: £112.0m). 
Interest payments on these borrowing facilities are included in the contractual cash flows of the designated financial 
instruments. The portion that is due for payment in less than one year is £19.8m (2009: £29.3m), the portion that is due in 
more than one year but less than two years is £6.4m (2009: £9.1m) and the amount that is due between two and five years is 
£nil (2009: £2.0m). There is no amount payable after five years in 2010 (2009: £nil).

(h) Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction 
between informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value. 
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
 the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid 
markets is determined with reference to quoted market prices;
 the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) is determined in 
accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from 
observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments; and
 the fair value of derivative instruments is calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, use is 
made of discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-
optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives.
The directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in 
the financial statements approximate to their fair values due to the short maturity of the instruments or because they bear 
interest at rates approximate to the market.

(i) Fair value measurements recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair 
value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability 
that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The contingent consideration relates primarily to the acquisitions made in the year (EuroMediCom SAS, CPDcast.com Limited 
and Emerging Portfolio Fund Research Inc). The contingent consideration will be paid between one and four years.
The property lease provision represents the estimated excess of rent payable on surplus property leases, plus dilapidation 
provisions, less rent receivable via sub leases. The property lease provisions will be fully utilised between one and five years. 
As discussed in Note 8, during 2009 the Group implemented a number of restructuring and reorganisation projects.  
The restructuring provision is expected to be substantially utilised by 31 December 2011.

An analysis of the maturity of debt is given in Note 24 (g). 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value. 
Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. The average 
credit period taken for trade purchases is 45 days (2009: 52 days). 
There are no suppliers who represent more than 10% of the total balance of trade payables in either 2010 or 2009.
The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit time frame. 
Therefore, under the normal course of business, the Group is not charged interest on overdue payables.

Disposals made in 2010
On 23 July 2010, the Group disposed of Counsel on Education in Management ('CEM'), an Events business specialising 
in conferences for HR professionals. An impairment charge of £5.0m was recognised in the Interim accounts for the six 
months ended 30 June 2010. Upon completion, proceeds of £0.1m were received, which was offset by related costs of £0.1m. 
Therefore there was no impact to the final impairment charge recognised of £5.0m.
Disposals made in 2009
On 6 July 2009, the Group disposed of its interest in Mark Two Communications B.V. with a loss of £1.0m. The net assets of 
Mark Two Communications B.V. at the date of disposal were £1.0m.

 These acquisitions are covered by the ‘Current year’s business combinations’ tables in this note. Where goodwill is provisional, a best estimate of fair value has been made 
but these will be reviewed and adjusted in the next year should it be necessary.
The combined benefit to the Group’s profit after tax from the newly acquired businesses amounted to £1.8m on revenues  
of £6.3m (2009: £0.6m on revenues of £2.0m). The total net assets of newly acquired businesses amounted to £56.0m as at  
31 December 2010 (2009: £19.9m). 
All acquisitions were paid for in cash (including deferred and contingent consideration) and in all acquisitions full control 
over the business has been acquired by acquiring 100% of the ordinary issued share capital, with the exception of Australian 
Exhibitions and Conferences (Australasia) Proprietary Limited on page 103. All transactions have been accounted for by the 
purchase method of accounting.

36 Retirement benefit schemes
The Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes, the Informa Final Salary Scheme, the Taylor & Francis Group 
Pension and Life Assurance Scheme and the Achieve Learning (UK) Pension and Benefits Scheme (the Group Schemes) for 
all qualifying UK employees providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. The assets of the Group Schemes are held 
in separate trustee administered funds. Contributions to the Group Schemes are charged to the Income Statement so as to 
spread the cost of contributions over employees’ working lives with the Group. Contributions are determined by a qualified 
actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method. 
Charge to operating profit
The charge to operating profit for the year in respect of pensions was £8.8m (2009: £8.9m). The net pension charge for the 
defined benefit schemes in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year was £1.8m (2009: £2.2m), of which £1.2m (2009: 
£1.0m) was charged to operating profit. The Group also operates defined contribution schemes, and contributions charged 
to the Consolidated Income Statement during the year were £7.6m (2009: £7.9m).
Defined benefit schemes
Informa Final Salary Scheme
The latest full actuarial valuation of the Informa Final Salary Scheme was carried out at 31 March 2008. An actuarial valuation 
was carried out for IAS 19 purposes as at 31 December 2010 by a qualified independent actuary. The Group agreed to pay 
annual contributions of 27.3% of members' pensionable salaries each year, plus payments to pay off the deficit. The Employer 
expects to pay £2.0m to the Scheme during the accounting year beginning 1 January 2011 in respect of the deficit payments, 
plus £0.2m in respect of benefit accrual to 1 April 2011. The market value of the scheme’s assets as at 31 December 2010 
was £50.2m which represented 84% of the benefits (valued on an IAS 19 basis) that had accrued to members, after allowing 
for expected future increases in earnings. The Scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 April 2000 and will close to future 
accrual on 1 April 2011.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the IAS 19 valuation are those relating to  
the discount rate, rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries, price inflation and pensions. The 
assumptions adopted are:
2010 2009
Discount rate 5.2% p.a. 5.8% p.a.
Rate of return on investments 5.8% p.a. 5.5% p.a.
Rate of price inflation pre-retirement 2.6% p.a. 3.4% p.a.
Rate of increase in pensions in payment – non pensioners 3.7% p.a. 3.7% p.a.
Rate of increase in pensions in payment – pensioners 3.2% p.a. 3.4% p.a.
Rate of increase in salaries 4.8% p.a. 4.9% p.a.
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the Informa Final Salary Scheme liabilities are set out below:
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.1% Decrease/increase by £1.3m
Rate of price inflation pre-retirement Increase/decrease by 0.25% Increase/decrease by £2.9m
Rate of increase in salaries Increase/decrease by 0.25% Increase/decrease by £0.6m
Rate of mortality Increase/decrease by 1 year Increase/decrease by £1.5m
Taylor & Francis Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme
The latest full actuarial valuation of the Taylor & Francis Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme was carried out at 
30 September 2008. An actuarial valuation was carried out for IAS 19 purposes as at 31 December 2010 by a qualified 
independent actuary. The Group agreed to pay annual contributions of 27.8% of members' pensionable salaries each year, 
plus payments to pay the deficit. The Employer expects to pay £1.3m to the scheme during the accounting year beginning 
1 January 2011 in respect of the deficit, plus £0.1m in respect of benefit accrual to 1 April 2011. The market value of the 
scheme’s assets as at 31 December 2010 was £17.0m which represented 94% of the benefits (valued on an IAS 19 basis) that 
had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. The Scheme closed to new entrants on  
8 March 2002 and will close to future accrual on 1 April 2011.

The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the IAS 19 valuation are those relating to  
the discount rate, rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries, price inflation and pensions.

Achieve Learning (UK) Pension & Benefits Scheme
The latest full actuarial valuation of the Achieve Learning (UK) Pension & Benefits Scheme was carried out at 31 December 2006. 
A further valuation was carried out at 31 December 2008 for IAS 19 purposes and was updated to 31 December 2010 by a 
qualified independent actuary.  A new actuarial valuation is currently in process as at 31 December 2009 and it is expected 
that the Trustees will put in place a new recovery plan.  The scheme was closed to future accrual of pensions at the time of 
the acquisition of IIR Holdings Limited in 2005. The Group’s contribution over the year was £60,000. The market value of the 
scheme’s assets as at 31 December 2010 was £5.9m which represented 98% of the benefits (valued on an IAS 19 basis) that 
had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in inflation. 
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the IAS 19 valuation are those relating to the discount 
rate, rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in price inflation and pensions. The assumptions adopted are:
2010 2009
Discount rate 5.2% p.a. 5.8% p.a.
Rate of return on investments 6.8% p.a. 6.7% p.a.
Rate of price inflation pre-retirement 2.6% p.a. 3.4% p.a.

The expected return on assets assumptions are derived by considering the expected long-term rates of return on plan 
investments. The overall rate of return is a weighted average rate of return of each asset class. The long-term rates of return 
on equities and property are derived from considering current long-term fixed interest government bond rates with the 
addition of an appropriate future risk premium. The long-term rates of return on bonds and cash investments are set in line 
with market yields currently available.
The Group Schemes’ assets do not include any of the Group’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or 
other assets used by, the Group.

Following the completion of the triennial valuations of the main defined benefit schemes, a revised deficit funding plan 
has been agreed with the trustees to eliminate the deficits in the three schemes. The contributions for the ongoing 
service cost is estimated to decrease from £1.2m in 2010 to £0.3m in 2011. In addition, the contributions paid towards 
reducing the scheme deficits will increase from £2.3m in 2010 to £3.4m in 2011 and £3.7m in 2012 when the next triennial 
valuation will be available.

37 Share-based payments
The Group share options and Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) provide for a grant price equal to the average quoted market 
price of the Group's shares on the date of grant. The vesting period is generally 3 years. The options expire if they remain 
unexercised after the exercise period has lapsed. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before 
the options vest, unless they meet certain eligibility criteria. The options are equity-settled.
The Group recognised total expenses of £2.1m (2009: £0.6m) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 
the year ended 31 December 2010.

In order to satisfy the share awards granted under Long-Term Incentive Plan, the share capital would be increased by up to 
4,738,236 shares. The Company is planning to issue additional share capital to satisfy the awards although if circumstances 
change it may instead buy the shares as needed on the open market. 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over one, two and three 
years back from the date of grant. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
On 8 April 2010 the number of shares granted for the Long-Term Incentive Plan was 1,304,737 with no exercise cost.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2010
1 Corporate information
Informa plc (the Company) was incorporated under Jersey Company Law on 11 March 2009, as a public Company limited by 
shares with the name Informa Limited and changed its name on 29 April 2009 to Informa plc. The principal legislation under 
which the Company operates is the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and regulations made thereunder, although the Company 
is domiciled in Switzerland and therefore operates under Swiss tax laws.
Principal activity and business review
Informa plc is the parent company of the Informa Group (the Group) and its principal activity is to act as the ultimate holding 
company of the Informa Group.
The shares of the Company are listed on the London Stock Exchange and trading in these shares commenced on 30 June 2009.
2 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis (for further analysis – refer to Corporate 
Governance Statement on page 33) and under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991 and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). 
The Company’s financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling being the Company’s functional currency. 
The Directors’ Report, Corporate Governance Statement and Directors’ Remuneration Report disclosures have been made in 
the Group Annual Report of Informa plc.
Profit and loss account
Pursuant to Article 104 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, the Company’s revenue for the period is £nil, loss before tax 
for the year is £6.8m (11 March 2009 to 31 December 2009: £6.6m) and loss after tax and retained loss for the year is £6.8m 
(11 March 2009 to 31 December 2009: £6.6m).
Cash flow statement
The Company’s results for the year ended 31 December 2010 are included in the consolidated financial statements of Informa 
plc, which are publicly available. Consequently, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash 
flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 (Revised 1996) Cash Flow Statements. 
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures, that transactions with wholly owned 
subsidiaries, do not need to be disclosed.
Financial instruments
The Informa plc consolidated financial statements contain financial instrument disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures and these would also comply with the disclosures required by FRS 29 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures. Accordingly, the Company has taken advantage of the exemptions provided in paragraph 2D of FRS 29 not to 
present separate financial instrument disclosures for the Company.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. Where the recoverable amount of the 
investment is less than the carrying amount, an impairment is recognised.
ESOP Trust shares
Own shares deducted in arriving at shareholders’ funds represent the cost of the Company’s ordinary shares acquired by the 
Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) trusts in connection within certain of the Company’s employee share schemes.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible (with a maturity of three months or less) to a known amount of cash and are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.pdf   120 21/03/2011   17:33 119 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2010
Property and equipment
Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment. Depreciation is 
provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property and equipment on a straight line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of the assets. The rates of depreciation are as follows:
Equipment, fixtures and fittings 3-5 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the net sale 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Income Statement.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees. A fair value for the equity settled share 
awards is measured at the date of grant. The fair value is measured using the Binomial or Monte Carlo model of valuation, 
which are considered to be the most appropriate valuation techniques. The valuation takes into account factors such as non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. To assign a fair value to share awards granted under the 
Share Matching Plan where the proportion of the award released is dependent on the level of total shareholder return, the 
Monte Carlo Simulation methodology is considered the most appropriate.
In terms of FRS 20 Share-based payment, where a parent grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, 
and such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the 
parent, the subsidiary is required to record an expense for such compensation, with a corresponding increase recognised 
in equity as a contribution from the parent. Consequently, in accordance with UITF 44 FRS 20 (IFRS 2) – Group and Treasury 
Transactions the Company has recognised an addition to fixed asset investments of the aggregate amount of these 
contributions that have accrued in the period with a corresponding credit to equity shareholders’ funds.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions arising from operating activities are translated from local currency into Pounds Sterling at the 
exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 
the year-end are translated at the period end exchange rate. Foreign currency gains or losses are credited or charged to the 
Profit and Loss account as they arise.
Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial 
asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Interest expense 
Finance costs of debts are capitalised against the debt value on first drawdown of the debt and are recognised in the Profit 
and Loss account at a constant rate over the life of the debt.

On 30 June 2009 the ESOP Trust was acquired from Old Informa.
As at 31 December 2010 the Informa Employee Share Trust held 49,237 (2009: 189,050) ordinary shares in the Company at 
a cost of £0.1m (2009: £0.4m) and a market value of £0.2m (2009: £0.6m). 49,237 shares (2009: 71,628) held by the Employee 
Share Trust have not been allocated to individuals and accordingly, dividends on these shares are waived. 
During the year equity dividends of £8.7m (11 March 2009 to 31 December 2009: £2.8m) were paid by the Company to those 
shareholders who did not elect to receive dividends under the Dividend Access Plan (DAP) arrangements. In total, dividends 
of £74.1m (11 March 2009 to 31 December 2009: £21.6m) were paid in the period of which £65.4m (11 March 2009 to  
31 December 2009: £18.8m) were paid by Informa DAP Limited under the DAP arrangements. Further details of the proposed 
dividend and DAP arrangements are given in Note 13 to the Group financial statements.

Details of the share-based payments are disclosed in the Group financial statements (Note 37).

Registrars 
In early 2011, Informa moved its Registrar service from 
Equiniti (Jersey) Limited (Equiniti) to Computershare 
Investor Services (Jersey) Limited (Computershare). The 
Shareholder Helpline run by Computershare is available 
between Monday and Friday, 8.30 am to 5.30 pm. The 
number to call is 0870 707 4040, if you are calling from 
outside the UK please call: +44 870 707 4040. This helpline 
deals with various share related queries.
They also offer a free online service which enables you to:
 view and manage all of your shareholdings; 
 register for electronic communications; 
 buy and sell shares instantly online with the dealing 
service; and
 other shareholder services such as change of address, 
transfer shares or replace a lost certificate.
Visit www.investorcentre.co.uk/je for further information. 
You will need your shareholder reference number as shown 
on your letter from Informa dated 25 January 2011 which 
outlines the move to Computershare.
If you currently hold a Shareview Portfolio account (as 
managed by Equiniti) you will need to re-register under 
the new Computershare web-address. You can register 
quickly and easily by going to www.investorcentre.co.uk/je 
and clicking on the ‘Register’ button. You will be asked for 
various information including the following:
 the company in which you hold shares or loan notes 
managed by Computershare;
 your last name as it appears on a recent share 
certificate or tax voucher;
 shareholder reference;
 your postcode; and
 your current email address. 
Or you can select the ‘Single Access’ option which allows 
you to view your Informa holdings without creating an 
account. In order to do this you just need to input your 
shareholder reference number and your post code.  
Once entered you are then able to manage your 
shareholding account online.
Global payments service
This service provided by Informa’s Registrar enables 
shareholders to have dividend payments paid directly  
into their bank account in their chosen local currency.  
To view terms and register for this service, please visit  
www.investorcentre.co.uk/je. 
Dividend
Informa usually pays a dividend to all shareholders twice 
each year. Informa operates a Dividend Access Plan which is 
open to all its shareholders. Those shareholders who hold 
fewer than 100,000 shares are deemed to consent to receive 
their dividends from a UK resident Informa company. 
However, if a shareholder holding over 100,000 shares 
wishing to do so may elect to join the Dividend Access Plan 
by completing an Election Form. This form is available from 
Informa's Registrars by calling 0870 707 4040, if you are 
calling from outside the UK please call: +44 870 707 4040. 
If you hold over 100,000 shares and do not elect to join the 
Dividend Access Plan you will receive your dividends from 
Informa plc which is domiciled in Switzerland.
Alternatively, shareholders can elect to receive shares 
instead of cash from their dividend allocation through the 
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP).
Shareholders can also arrange for dividends to be paid by 
mandate directly to a UK bank or building society account 
through the BACSTEL-IP (Bankers’ Automated Clearing 
Services) system. For the benefit of shareholders resident 
in any of the Eurozone countries, the Company offers the 
option to receive dividends in Euros.
Share Dealing
If shareholders wish to buy or sell any Informa shares,  
they can do so by calling NatWest Stockbrokers, on 0808 
208 4433 (+44 808 208 4433). Instructions on how to deal 
will be provided over the phone. The helpline is open 8.00 
am to 4.30 pm UK time, Monday to Friday, except Bank 
Holidays.
CREST Electronic Proxy Voting
The Company will be accepting proxy votes through the 
CREST Electronic Proxy Voting system.

ShareGift
ShareGift (Registered Charity no. 1052686) is an 
independent UK charity which specialises in accepting

£13m has been given by ShareGift so far to over 1,700 
different UK charities. Further information about ShareGift 
can be found on their website, www.ShareGift.org or by 
calling 020 7930 3737 (+44 20 7930 3737).
Electronic shareholder communication
As part of Informa’s Corporate Social Responsibility 
programme and in particular our ongoing commitment to 
reduce our environmental impact, we offer all shareholders 
the opportunity to elect to register for electronic 
communications. For further information please visit  
www.informa.com.
Protecting your investment from share register fraud
Over the last few years a number of companies have become 
aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited 
phone calls or correspondence concerning investment 
matters. These are typically from brokers who target 
existing shareholders offering to sell what often turn out 
to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. 
They can be extremely persuasive and very persistent. 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free 
company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
 Make sure you get the correct name of the person  
and organisation
 Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA 
before getting involved. You can check at  
www.fsa.gov.uk/register
 Report the matter to the FSA either by calling  
0845 606 1234 (+44 845 606 1234)
 Inform our Registrar on 0870 707 4040  
(+44 870 707 4040) 
Tips on protecting your shareholding
 Ensure all your certificates are kept in a safe place or 
hold your shares electronically in CREST via a nominee.
 Keep all correspondence from the Registrars in a safe 
place, or destroy correspondence by shredding it.
 If you change address inform the Registrars. If you 
receive a letter from the Registrars regarding a change 
of address and you have not recently moved, contact 
them immediately.
 Know when the dividends are paid and consider having 
your dividend paid directly into your bank (contact the 
Registrars). If you change your bank account, inform the 
Registrars of the details of your new account. Respond 
to any letters the Registrars send to you about this.
 If you are buying or selling shares, only deal with brokers 
registered in the UK or in your country of residence.

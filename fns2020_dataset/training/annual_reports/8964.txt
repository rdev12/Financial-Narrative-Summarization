At a Glance
What does K3 do?
K3 is one of the UK’s leading providers of integrated business solutions to 
the supply chain sector. Our customers are Retailers, Manufacturers and 
Distributors who are looking for global, brand leading business solutions 
from a specialist provider who is dedicated to their market sector.
We support 2,300 customers from four regional 
centres in the UK, with our international operations 
headquartered in Holland.
Increasingly our customers are considering Cloud 
Computing, to defray IT costs and to provide a more 
flexible and secure IT infrastructure that will deliver 
them a competitive edge.
We take market leading solutions from Microsoft, 
Sage and SYSPRO and add our own Intellectual 
Property (“IP”) to create industry specific solutions.
By having our own IP , we can tailor these solutions 
to our core markets and our solutions are thus more 
competitive, creating more loyal customers, whilst at 
the same time driving up margins.
We have loyal customers and once installed, our 
software systems can remain in place for 15 years 
or longer. This ensures that K3 generates very high 
levels of recurring income.
K3 has a strong and successful track record of 
growth. We have steadily grown organically and 
through acquisition over the last 10 years and will 
continue with this dual growth strategy.

Our markets
Retail
K3 entered the retail market in 2004 
with a key acquisition. This business 
unit has grown significantly since 
then and now has over £20m of sales 
annually. Our customers tend to be 
well known ‘high street’ retailers 
which select K3 because of our 
sector knowledge, track record and 
innovative solutions. In recent times, 
high street retailers have been under 
pressure but K3 has continued to 
grow thanks to a strategic investment 
in multi-channel retail (including 
internet, store and mail order) in 
2008/9 and, despite the economic 
downturn, K3 continues to win major 
new contracts year on year.
Manufacturing
With over 1,000 manufacturing 
customers, K3 is the largest provider 
of integrated business solutions 
to the manufacturing sector. We 
offer solutions for both ‘discrete’ 
and ‘process’ manufacturers, and 
our customers range from global 
multi-nationals running K3 solutions 
worldwide to small engineering 
companies.
Distribution
Distribution is the most recent 
area of K3’s expansion, with several 
acquisitions creating a dedicated 
business unit of size and scale. Whilst 
there is considerable overlap with our 
retail and manufacturing customers, 
we now have some 700 dedicated 
distribution customers relying on K3 
for their IT services and support.
International
One of the fastest growing parts of 
K3 is our International Operations 
Division based in The Hague. From 
here we support our international 
retail and distribution customers, 
with some major global corporate 
customers such as Inter IKEA 
Systems B.V., the owner and 
franchisor of the IKEA concept. Our 
Pebblestone fashion distribution 
solution is managed from here, 
supporting a network of 30 
distributors in 20 countries.
Hosting and 
Managed Services
From data centres in Edinburgh, 
London and New York we support 
a global hosting and managed 
service business that looks after the 
IT infrastructures for K3 customers 
around the globe, both on-premise 
and hosted. Cloud Computing is a 
fast growing sector for industry as 
a whole and this is also one of K3’s 
fastest growing business units.

Chairman’s Statement
“I am pleased to report that K3 has delivered 
excellent results for the year to 30 June 2011 in a 
difficult trading environment. They demonstrate 
the strength of K3’s business model, with 
continued new business wins underpinned by 
high levels of recurring income. ”
Overview
I am pleased to report that K3 has 
delivered excellent results for the year 
to 30 June 2011 in a difficult trading 
environment. They demonstrate 
the strength of K3’s business model, 
with continued new business wins 
underpinned by high levels of recurring 
income. Revenues rose 20% to £52.80m 
(2010: 12 months £43.84m) and adjusted 
profit before tax
*1
 increased 29% to 
£8.68m (2010: 12 months £6.72m). Our 
long term recurring contracted income 
delivered 46% of the Group’s total 
income and has increased by 39% to 
£24.18m. A further 43% of income came 
from existing customers through the 
sale of additional services or products. 
The Group also continued to generate 
good cash flows.
Of particular note this year were 
the performances of the Managed 
Services Division and our international 
software operations. Both areas 
saw significant growth during the 
year. The strong performance at our 
international software operations, 
based in The Netherlands, was helped 
by significantly increased activity with 
Inter IKEA Systems B.V. (the owner and 
franchisor of the IKEA concept, the 
largest customer in the Group) as well 
as strong sales from our Pebblestone 
business unit and a significant increase 
in sales of our retail solutions in Holland 
and across Europe. Our core UK Retail 
and Manufacturing Software Divisions 
continued to win new customers 
and generated good profit and cash 
contributions in particularly tough 
domestic trading conditions.
The level of major contract wins which 
the Group secured was encouraging. 
We closed a total of £11.10m of major 
contracts during the year (2010:  
12 months £12.40m). Notable deals 
signed by our UK business included 
Hobbycraft, Topps Tiles and Sam 
McCauley, the chemists. 
We completed four acquisitions 
(Panacea, FDS Sage 200, Sense and 
Clarita) during the year. These have 
added additional technical skills, IP 
and new customers to whom we can 
cross-sell our products and services. 
Importantly, two acquisitions, Panacea 
and FDS Sage 200, have enabled us to 
complete our strategic move into the 
Sage marketplace. After the year end, 
we added a further two acquisitions and 
we will continue to seek suitable targets 
which will, in particular, increase the 
Group’s recurring income and provide 
sales opportunities for our Managed 
Services Division. 
The Managed Services Division almost 
quadrupled its revenues during the 
year (helped by the acquisition of 
Panacea during the first half) and we 
saw strong demand for these services 
across the Group. In the second half of 
the financial year, we signed an exclusive 
worldwide hosting agreement with 
SYSPRO, a leading developer of ERP 
solutions for the manufacturing sector 
globally. Managed Services represent a 
substantial growth opportunity for K3 
and the investment we made in the year 
has established a platform for growth. 
We will continue to focus on this major 
opportunity over the new financial year 
and beyond.
More broadly, the Group’s profitability 
continues to benefit from our strategy 
of developing our own library of 
Intellectual Property (“IP”). By enhancing 
the core business software products 
we resell, with our own IP , we enrich 
and tailor these solutions to the specific 
markets we serve. This improves both 
our competitive positioning and our 
operating profit.
While the economic climate remains 
challenging, we view K3’s growth 
prospects very positively. We see 
substantial, long-term growth 
opportunities, especially in hosting 
and managed services, which will 
drive recurring revenue growth and 
cash generation. The acquisitions we 
have made in the financial year under 
review, as well as in the prior year, have 
strengthened the Group and we expect 
K3 to make further strong progress in 
the new financial year. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

Financial Results
K3 changed its accounting year end to  
30 June (from 31 December) in December 
2009 to align its financial year end with 
Microsoft Corporation, with whom K3 
has a strong trading relationship, and to 
provide shareholders with greater visibility 
of likely year end results as K3 generates 
the greater proportion of its revenue in the 
latter half of the calendar year. 
The comparative audited figures for 2010 are 
for the 18 month period ended 30 June 2010, 
referred to throughout as “2010: 18 months” .
Unaudited results for the 12 months ended 
30 June 2010 have been extracted from the 
2010 financial statements (note 30). The 
Directors consider these provide a more 
meaningful comparison and are referred 
to throughout as “2010: 12 months” . 
Group revenues over the year ended 
30 June 2011 rose by 20% to £52.80m 
(2010: 12 months £43.84m; 18 months 
£59.78m). The four acquisitions 
completed in the year made a combined 
contribution of £7.98m to sales. Adjusted

to £8.68m (2010: 12 months £6.72m; 
18 months £7.66m). After taking into 
account amortisation of acquired 
intangibles, acquisition costs and 
exceptional reorganisation costs listed 
above, profit before taxation rose by 
10% over the year to £4.91m (2010:  
12 months £4.46m; 18 months £4.77m). 
The tax charge for the year ended 30 
June 2011 was £0.43m (2010:  
12 months £1.0m; 18 months £1.02m). 
The lower charge for 2011 against 2010 
reflected the greater proportion of 
earnings in Ireland and the Netherlands 
where tax rates are lower than in the UK, 
a reduction in the UK Corporation tax 
rate to 26% in the final quarter of the 
year and the deferred tax credit arising 
on acquisition intangible assets.
Adjusted earnings per share

 increased 
by 34% over the year to 27.5p (2010:  
12 months 20.5p; 18 months 23.7p) and 
basic earnings per share increased by 
20% to 17.5p over the year (2010:  
12 months 14.6p; 18 months 15.2p).
Cash flows and banking
K3 generates good cash flows, with 
a seasonal weighting in October-
December. Net cash generated from 
operating activities was £5.64m 
(2010: 12 months £6.86m; 18 months 
£7.33m). Operating cash flows in 
the year included £1.69m in respect 
of regularising liabilities that were 
significantly outside normal statutory 
due dates and commercial terms at 
the date of acquiring companies and 
trades, £0.49m of acquisition costs and 
£0.45m of exceptional reorganisation 
costs. The underlying adjusted cash 
flow from operations therefore was 
£8.28m. During the year the Group 
made debt repayments of £2.87m, paid 
£0.98m of interest, paid tax of £1.37m 
and received proceeds from share 
issues of £0.17m. In addition, £5.10m 
was paid to the vendors of the four 
cash-based acquisitions, together with 
outstanding earn out payments from 
earlier acquisitions. Additional funds 
of £7.5m were received by way of bank 
loan to fund the acquisitions and the 
associated liabilities. Net debt at 30 June 
2011 has increased by £4.51m year on 
year, to stand at £15.49m (30 June 2010: 
£10.98m).
In September 2010, the Group agreed 
additional banking facilities including 
£5.0m of revolving credit facilities 
(“RCF”) for working capital purposes 
and a further £7.5m of RCF to fund 
acquisitions. After the year end, in July 
2011, an additional RCF of £1.05m for 
acquisitions was also made available. In 
July 2011, we also raised £5.09m net of 
costs in a placing of shares. 
Group reorganisation
We completed a reorganisation of the 
Group during the year which enabled 
the full integration of the acquired 
businesses to create a platform for future 
growth, at a cost of £0.45m (accounted 
for as an exceptional cost). Now that 
the reorganisation is complete we have 
four main trading divisions, Microsoft 
UK, International, SYSPRO and Sage, 
and Managed Services, together with 
Head office. Our financial reporting will 
reflect the Group’s new structure from

Subject to shareholder approval at K3’s

Outlook
K3 made very good progress in the 
financial year under review against 
challenging conditions in its core 
markets. Results demonstrate again the 
strength and resilience of K3’s business 
model, with strong cash flows, high 
levels of recurring income (46%) and 
existing customers generating a further 
43% of Group revenues a year. The 
strategic acquisitions we made, both 
this financial year and last, have added 
new IP , customers, technical skills and 
a global distribution network, and will 
benefit us in the current financial year 
and beyond.
Managed Services represents a 
significant opportunity for K3. We have 
been investing to create a platform for 
growth and further investment will be 
needed to fully exploit the potential.  
The Sage marketplace has opened 
up additional hosting-related growth 
opportunities, which we will also be 
focusing on.
K3 is well-positioned operationally and 
financially to continue its development. 
With the opportunities we see ahead of us, 
we view both short and long term growth 
prospects for the Group very positively.

Chief Executive’s Review
“K3 has performed exceptionally 
well in the last 12 months in difficult 
market conditions, delivering 
excellent revenue and profits growth. ” 
Introduction
K3 has performed exceptionally well in 
the last 12 months in difficult market 
conditions, delivering excellent revenue 
and profits growth. Major initiatives 
during the year included a significant 
investment in Managed Services, 
continued development of our own IP , 
further complementary acquisitions 
and a group reorganisation to provide a 
stronger platform for growth.
The final six months of the financial 
year saw a particularly strong financial 
performance, with revenues up 38% 
to £28.13m (2010 H2: £20.32m) and 
adjusted operating profit
*5 
up 65% to 
£3.34m (2010 H2: £2.02m). With the 
first half year also being ahead of the 
prior year, the full year revenue was up 
20% on the same period last year at 
£52.80m (2010: 12 months £43.84m: 
18 months: £59.78m). Adjusted profit 
from operations
*6
 was up 27% at £9.58m 
(2010: 12 months £7.57m; 18 months 
£9.05m). The full year results included 
the benefit of the four acquisitions we 
made over the course of the financial 
year, which together contributed £7.98m 
to revenues and £0.88m to adjusted 
operating profit
*7
.
Our extensive customer base, today 
totalling 2,300 customers, is one of the 
most valuable assets we own and the 
year’s results demonstrate this. Existing 
customers have delivered some 89% 
of the Group’s sales, with 46% of sales 
recurring annually, from software 
licence and support renewals for the ERP 
systems we maintain. Once installed, an 
ERP software system can remain in place 
for over 15 years, providing K3 with 
substantial ongoing recurring income. 
As the Group continues to develop, a 
central plank of our growth strategy 
is the delivery of additional services 
and products to our large customer 
base. In particular, we are focused on 
the development of our hosting and 
managed services offering, which helps 
to reduce customers’ overall IT costs. We 
believe hosting and managed services 
represent a major opportunity for K3 
and have invested significantly this year 
in increasing our capability across all our 
products. The acquisition of Panacea, 
which contained a substantial managed 
service business in addition to its Sage 
customers, in November 2010, was a 
material step forward, adding critical 
mass, technical expertise and recurring 
income to our Managed Services 
Division. The delivery of hosting and 
managed services to our substantial 
customer base represents a major 
opportunity for K3 and we intend to 
invest further in these activities to fully 
exploit this major opportunity.
In a very difficult market, the level of our 
major contract wins was encouraging, 
totaling £11.1m compared to £12.4m for 
the same period last year.
Of particular note was the performance 
of our international business, based 
in The Netherlands, where two 
significant developments have driven 
strong growth. Firstly, we have been 
able to leverage successfully the two 
Pebblestone acquisitions we made in 
the second quarter of 2010 to establish 
K3 as a major supplier of ERP systems 
to the Dutch Fashion market and to 
build up the 30 country international 
partner channel for Group IP . Secondly, 
the business commenced a major global 
initiative with Inter IKEA Systems B.V. 
(the owner and franchisor of the IKEA 
concept, the largest customer in the 
Group), which will benefit results over an 
extended period.
A key part of our value proposition 
is the development of our own IP to 
enhance the market leading business 
solutions (Microsoft, SYSPRO and Sage)  K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011
9
that we offer. We invested over £1m in 
IP development during the year and 
this will help us to maintain our strong 
competitive positioning, creating 
further loyal customers and enhancing 
operating profits. K3 remains a member 
of Microsoft’s Inner Circle (reserved for 
its top partners worldwide) and our 
relationship with SYSPRO deepened 
with an exclusive global partnership 
agreement for hosting. 
We took the decision to expand into 
the Sage market in the first half of the 
financial year, to broaden the Group’s 
product portfolio, and made two 
acquisitions that have created a Sage 
Division, with 450 customers who 
contribute approximately £3.2m of 
recurring Sage income per annum. This 
will increase as we roll out our Sage 
hosting proposition over the coming 
year. We see very good opportunities 
to add further Sage customers, both 
organically and via acquisition, and 
believe that our hosting proposition will 
see strong uptake. 
We strengthened the Group’s 
organisational structure during the year 
to create a stronger platform for growth 
and have established four main trading 
divisions in addition to our Head Office. 
The four divisions are Microsoft UK, 
International, SYSPRO and Sage, and 
Managed Services. Reporting in future 
will reflect this new structure.
Financially, the Group remains strong, 
with good cash generation and banking 
facilities to support further acquisitions. 
This places us in a very good position to 
continue with our growth plans and we 
view prospects for K3 very positively.

Key Performance Indicators
The Board considers the key performance indicators by which it measures the performance of the Group 
to be revenue, gross margin and profit from operations, adjusted for amortisation of acquired intangibles, 
acquisition costs and exceptional costs. The performance indicators used by the Group are summarised 
below and the table sets out K3’s performance for the year under review.
Revenue is the gross revenue as reported 
in the financial statements, comprising 
software, hardware, consultancy, and 
support and managed services. This is 
a key measure of activity within each 
business segment and for the Group as 
a whole.
Gross margin percentage is calculated as 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue. 
This measure identifies the level of 
contribution derived from each sale or 
component thereof. 
Adjusted profit from operations is 
calculated as profit from operations 
per the financial statements, adjusted 
for the impact of amortisation of 
acquired intangibles, acquisition costs 
and exceptional costs. This is a key 
performance indicator for quoted 
companies.
*Adjusted operating cash percentage 
is the operating cash generated after 
adding back cash flows in respect 
of regularising liabilities that were 
significantly outside normal statutory 
due dates and commercial terms at 
the date of acquiring companies and 
trades, acquisition costs and exceptional 
reorganisation costs , divided by the 
adjusted operating profit. This is a key 
indicator in measuring the Group’s 
ability to convert operating profit into 
cash. See note 32.
Adjusted EPS is calculated as profit 
for the period, adjusted for the tax 
affected impact of acquired intangibles 
amortisation, exceptional reorganisation 
costs and acquisition costs, divided 
by the weighted average number of 
shares during the period. This is a key 
performance indicator for quoted 
companies.
Recurring revenue is the income 
provided for annual licence renewals 
and support for software used by our 
customers. This is a key indicator in 
measuring the underlying resilience and 
growth of the business.
Percentage of recurring revenue 
measures the growth of income 
providing core stability to the business. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

Operational Review
K3 changed its accounting year end to 30 June (from 31 December) in December 2009 to align its financial year end with Microsoft 
Corporation, with whom K3 has a strong trading relationship, and to provide shareholders with greater visibility of likely year end 
results as K3 generates the greater proportion of its revenue in the latter half of the calendar year.
The comparative audited figures for 2010 are for the 18 month period ended 30 June 2010, referred to throughout as “2010: 18 months” .
Unaudited results for the 12 months ended 30 June 2010 have been extracted from the 2010 financial statements (note 30). The 
Directors consider these provide a more meaningful comparison and are referred to throughout as “2010: 12 months” .
Overview
For the year to 30 June 2011, our Retail 
Software Division, which comprises 
our UK and international businesses, 
supplying Microsoft Dynamics software, 
generated revenues of £27.84m, up 3% 
over the year (2010: 12 months £26.96m; 
18 months £36.79m). Adjusted profit 
from operations
*8
 was £5.06m, up 32% 
over the year (2010: 12 months £3.80m; 
18 months £4.93m). In the six months 
to 30 June 2011, revenue showed an 
11% uplift to £15.24m against the prior 
period (2010: £13.71m) and adjusted 
operating profit
*9
 increased by 40% to 
£2.48m (2010: £1.77m). The acquisition 
of Clarita in April 2011 contributed 
revenue of £0.65m and operating profit 
of £0.10m to the overall results. All Key 
Performance Indicators are growing 
satisfactorily, though margin pressure 
has been evident as customers have 
staggered deal implementation and we 
have invested in Retail AX resources.
The Retail Software Division made 
excellent progress in the year to  
30 June 2011, securing £8.3m of major 
contract wins compared to £7.7m in the 
same period last year. Our international 
business, based in The Netherlands, 
performed especially well. In the UK, the 
strength of our multi-channel offering, 
incorporating our own IP , continues to 
support our performance.
Our library of IP in the Retail Software 
Division has grown over the year and 
includes multi-channel specialist 
modules (call centre, kiosk, retail store 
hospitality and Web linkages), fashion 
retail and wholesale modules.
UK
Revenues for the year ended to 30 June 
2011 were £19.43m, down 10% over 
the year (2010: 12 months £21.63m; 
18 months £29.43m) though in the six 
months to 30 June 2011 the decrease 
was only 2% on the same period last 
year, at £10.10m (six months to 30 June 
2010: £10.30m). The adjusted operating 
profit
*10
 over the year rose by 5% to 
£3.04m (2010: 12 months £2.90m; 18 
months £3.72m). The results for the six 
months include the acquisition of Clarita 
for a three month period.
The UK business secured a total of 
£5.6m major contract wins in the 
year compared with £7.7m for the 
same period last year. Major new wins 
included orders from Hobbycraft, Sam 
McCauley, the chemists and Topps Tiles. 
In the tougher retail environment, we 
have seen many customers buying in 
stages thus reducing initial deal size. 
The major orders we secured, providing 
a mixture of consultancy, software, 
enhancement and hardware revenues, 
were largely driven by our multi-channel 
offering, which supplies retailers 
with a fully integrated retail solution, 
encompassing online ordering, call 
centre management, internet kiosks, 
point of sale functionality and full ‘back 
office’ capability.

The value of our retail IP was evident 
again with good sales to the existing 
customer base, though margin was 
reduced due to resourcing of the AX 
Retail initiative. We will continue to 
invest heavily in retail IP , bringing the 
Microsoft AX product in line with our 
Microsoft Dynamics NAV portfolio and 
innovating further on both products. 
The partnership we signed at the 
beginning of the financial year with 
Omnica Ltd, the multi-channel software 
specialist, extends our AX capability in 
the retail sector, with specialist modules 
for the multi-channel sales. Our UK sales 
pipeline is healthy, with a number of 
deals potentially closing in the first half 
of the new financial year. 
International
Our Netherlands-based business, K3 
Business Solutions, performed strongly, 
increasing revenues over the year ended 
to 30 June 2011 by 57% to £8.41m  
(2010: 12 months £5.34m; 18 months 
£7.36m) and increasing adjusted 
operating profit
*11
 by 124% to £2.02m 
(2010: 12 months £0.90m; 18 months 
£1.21m). The last six months of the 
period saw revenues rise by 50% to 
£5.13m (six months to 30 June 2010: 
£3.41m) and adjusted operating profit
*12
 
grew by 112% to £1.27m (six months to 
30 June 2010: £0.60m).
The Dutch business has seen a step-
change in performance. There are 
two major factors driving this. The 
Pebblestone acquisitions made in the 
second quarter of 2010 established K3 as 
a major supplier of ERP systems into the 
Dutch fashion market, with a 30 country 
international partner channel for Group 
IP . We also commenced a major global 
initiative with Inter IKEA Systems B.V. (the 
owner and franchisor of the IKEA concept, 
the largest customer in the Group), which 
will benefit results over an extended 
period. Dutch retail sales are performing 
well, with deals closing on a regular basis, 
and we are seeing opportunities open up 
across Europe. The business is operating 
at full capacity and we are recruiting 
further resource to meet the demand we 
are currently generating.

Manufacturing Software Division
Overview
The Manufacturing Software Division 
comprises three business units, 
K3 Supply Chain Solutions (“SCS”), 
supplying SYSPRO ERP solutions, K3 AX 
specialising in process manufacturing 
and including the Sense Enterprise 
Solutions business (“Sense”) and small 
systems business based in Hook. 
Revenues from the Manufacturing 
Software Division for the year were flat 
at £15.47m (2010: 12 months £15.58m; 
18 months £21.32m) and adjusted 
operating profit
*13
 decreased by 15% to 
£3.50m (2010: 12 months £4.12m;  
18 months £4.49m). The Sense AX 
business, acquired in April 2011, 
contributed revenue of £0.56m and 
adjusted operating profit
*14 
of £0.14m. 
As a Division we have suffered margin 
pressure from our key suppliers which is 
likely to continue in the new financial year.
In the six months to 30 June 2011, 
revenue at £6.12m was up 8% (2010: 
£5.67m) but adjusted profit from 
operations
*15
 fell to £0.21m (2010: 
£0.42m).
There is strong seasonality in the 
Division’s income as the above revenue 
and profit profile illustrate. This 
seasonality is driven by the timing of 
SYSPRO software licence and support 
renewals, which are billed in October 
and are realised in cash during October 
to December. The value of this recurring 
income in the year to 30 June 2011 
was £9.13m (2010: 12 months £8.8m). 
This income stream continues to be 
very stable and highly predictable, 
reflecting the business critical nature 
of the systems we implement and 
support. The last six months have been 
difficult with deal cycles lengthening 
as manufacturing customers defer 
investment and our margins have also 
come under pressure from key suppliers. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011
13 *See note 33 on page 92 for further details
SCS
K3 Supply Chain Solutions (“SCS”), 
which supplies SYSPRO ERP solutions, 
delivered revenues broadly unchanged 
over the year at £10.36m (2010: 
12 months £10.40m; 18 months 
£14.08m) and adjusted profit from 
operations
*16
 were stable at £3.01m 
(2010: 12 months £3.14m; 18 months 
£3.38m).
In the six months to 30 June 2011, 
revenues were £3.43m (six months 
ended 30 June 2010: £3.45m) and the 
adjusted loss from operations
*17
 was 
£0.03m (six months ended 30 June 
2010: profit of £0.15m), reflecting 
both seasonality and margin pressure 
mentioned above.
New order intake at SCS remained 
under pressure over the year and in the 
light of this and cost pressure from our 
major supplier, the year’s results are very 
creditable. Results were supported by 
sales of additional services to customers 
as well as annual software licence 
and support income and overhead 
reductions. To have achieved broadly 
the same level of profit against the 
comparable period last year in these 
difficult market conditions has been an 
excellent result.
K3 AX
K3 AX, which addresses the process 
manufacturing marketplace, with 
product specialisation in fresh food and 
steel processing, has had an extremely 
disappointing year following the 
improved performance in the previous 
period. While revenue over the year to 
30 June 2011 was up by 15% to 
£2.92m (2010: 12 months £2.54m; 
18 months £3.34m), the adjusted loss 
from operations
*18
 was £0.31m (2010: 
12 months profit of £0.13m; 18 months 
loss of £0.18m). However, the second half 
of the year showed an improvement, with 
revenues at £1.65m (six months ended 
30 June 2010: £1.11m) and the adjusted 
operating loss
*19
 at £0.08m (six months 
ended 30 June 2010: loss of £0.07m).
Having closed five deals in the last period 
and expanded our delivery capacity, we 
found very soft demand this year and 
new software sales have been hard to 
close. Our development plans for the 
product range were also held back by 
substantial changes being implemented 
by Microsoft in the AX product. However, 
the acquisition of Sense in March 2011 
has brought critical mass and additional 
skills to the AX business unit, as well as 40 
new customers. It also positions K3 AX 
as one of the larger AX provider in the 
UK and we see very good opportunities 
to cross-sell our products and services 
to Sense’s existing customer base. 
The reduction in losses in the second 
half compared to the first half year is a 
reflection of closing three late deals and 
the profitability of Sense, acquired in the 
third quarter of the financial year, which 
contributed £0.56m of revenues and 
£0.14m of adjusted operating profits.
Small systems division, Hook 
(formerly in Chertsey)
Our small systems division, which 
comprises a customer base running 
smaller ERP systems, generated sales 
of £2.19m in the year (2010: 12 months 
£2.65m; 18 months £3.91m) and the 
adjusted profit from operations
*20
 was 
£0.79m (2010: 12 months £0.86m; 
18 months £1.29m). The second half of 
the year shows revenue of £1.03m (six 
months ended 30 June 2010: £1.12m) 
and an adjusted profit from operations
*21
 
of £0.32m (six months ended 30 June 
2010: £0.34m). As expected, revenues 
generated by this division continued 
to decay gently although we partly 
mitigated the impact of this by selling 
CRM services. Following the acquisition 
of Panacea in November 2010, we have 
relocated the business to Hook, which 
will underpin profitability.

Sage Division
We took the strategic decision to 
enter the Sage ERP marketplace in 
the period and two acquisitions in the 
first half (Panacea in November 2010 
and the Sage 200 business of 
FD Systems Limited in December 2010) 
have established K3 with a meaningful 
Sage presence. The Sage ERP solutions 
we now offer predominantly service 
the Distribution sector and our 
customer base totals approximately 
525 companies, delivering recurring 
income of approximately £3.2m of Sage 
sales per annum, derived from a mix of 
software licence and support.
The Division generated a partial revenue 
contribution of £4.15m (2010: £nil) and 
adjusted operating profit
*22
 contribution 
of £0.42m (2010: £nil). These revenues 
represent approximately 50% of the 
potential of these two businesses.
At the beginning of 2011, we combined 
the two acquisitions into one site at 
Hook and have been developing our 
Sage hosting proposition. This will roll 
out over the coming year and will place 
us in a strong position to cross-sell 
hosted solutions to new and existing 
Sage customers, mirroring the model 
we are deploying for our Microsoft and 
SYSPRO customers. 
We see a significant opportunity to 
develop our Sage Division and will 
continue to acquire complementary 
Sage businesses to grow K3’s contracted 
recurring revenues and leverage further 
hosting opportunities.

Managed Services Division
The Managed Services Division offers 
a range of application solutions both 
on-premises, hosted and via Software 
as a Service using hosting centres in 
New York, London and Edinburgh.
Over the year to 30 June 2011, 
revenues generated by the Managed 
Services Division almost quadrupled 
to £4.70m (2010: 12 months £1.23m; 
18 months £1.60m). Adjusted profit 
from operations
*23
 increased by 86% 
to £0.54m (2010: 12 months £0.28m; 
18 months £0.41m). In the six months 
to 30 June 2011, revenues rose almost 
3.5 times to £3.02m over the prior 
period (2010: £0.87m) and adjusted 
profit from operations
*24
 rose by 86% to 
£0.39m (2010: £0.21m). The managed 
services business of Panacea, acquired 
in November 2010, made a partial 
contribution of £2.64m to revenues 
and £0.25m to adjusted profit from 
operations
*25
.
The business is continuing to grow 
rapidly with strong interest in our 
managed services solutions from 
our customers. We see a substantial 
opportunity to develop the Managed 
Services Division and committed 
significant investment to its development 
during the year which accounts for the 
fall in gross margin and profitability 
lagging revenue growth. We will continue 
to invest in this opportunity.
In February 2011, we announced a 
potentially significant opportunity 
with SYSPRO, a leading developer of 
ERP solutions to the manufacturing 
sector globally. Under the terms of our 
agreement, we will be providing hosted 
Software as a Service on an exclusive 
basis worldwide to SYSPRO customers. 
We will be working with SYSPRO’s 
partner network to market this service 
and believe this could represent a 
material opportunity for us. 
The Division’s closing run rate of revenue 
at the year-end was £4.1m (2010: £2.33m).

Central costs for the year amounted 
to £0.25m (2010: 12 months £0.64m; 
18 months £0.78m). These costs 
included Directors’ costs, group human 
resources and accounting personnel, 
legal department and costs associated 
with the Plc. The costs are stated net of 
recovery of elements recharged to the 
operating units, which have increased 
with the expansion of the Group.
Our share of associated company 
losses in the year to 30 June 2011 was 
£nil (2010: 12 months £nil; 18 months 
£0.03m). This reflects the change in 
ownership structure of the underlying 
investment, which is now treated as an 
available-for-sale investment.
During the year we strengthened 
the Group’s organisational structure 
to create a stronger platform for 
growth which enabled the complete 
integration of the acquired businesses. 
This reorganisation cost £0.45m which 
has been shown as an exceptional cost 
within profit from operations. From 
1 July 2011, the reporting of results will 
reflect four trading Divisions; Microsoft 
UK, International, SYSPRO and Sage, and 
Managed Services; together with head 
office.

Central Division Group Reorganisation
Our International IP Division, established

manages the portfolio of fashion and 
wholesale products acquired from 
Pebblestone, the Pebblestone reseller 
channel we bought in June 2011, as well 
as the Group’s other IP products suitable 
for distribution across our customer base. 
The benefit of our library of intellectual 
property is becoming increasingly 
evident in Group’s results, helping to 
enhance margins as well as sales. In 
the year, the Division contributed sales 
of £0.64m and an adjusted profit from 
operations
*26 
of £0.32m. Additional sales 
of £0.36m of K3 product are included 
within the results of the Retail Software 
Division.
During the year we enhanced the 
functionality of our Pebblestone product 
and established a product roadmap 
for its future development. We also 
refreshed the Pebblestone distribution 
network, which is showing good 
potential for the future.
We have continued to expand our library 
of IP across all operating units, especially 
hosting, Retail AX and Fresh Dynamics 
AX, mirroring the strategy of Microsoft. 
K3’s sector specific solutions therefore 
remain highly competitive and attractive 
to both new and existing customers.

Strategy and Objectives
The Board’s strategy remains unchanged 
and is to establish K3 as one of Europe’s 
leading suppliers of Microsoft and 
Sage based supply chain management 
systems, with a particular emphasis 
on the growth markets of “hosted 
applications” and “cloud computing” .
Nearer term, the Board’s key objectives 
are to:
•	 achiev e 	 g r o wth 	 in 	 our 	 tar get 	 mar kets;
•	 cr ea t e 	 shar eholder 	 v alue 	 thr ough	
increases in adjusted earnings per 
share;
•	 g r o w 	 r ecur r ing 	 inc ome 	 lev els 	 and
•	 achiev e 	 pr og r essiv e 	 incr eases 	 in 	 the	
dividend.
Acquisitions since the last year have been 
made to accelerate the timescale over 
which this strategy is delivered.
Post Year End Events
After the year end, in July 2011, we 
completed two acquisitions, buying the 
Retail Merchandising Division of Azurri 
Computer Solutions Ltd (“Azurri Retail”) 
and FD Systems Ltd (“FDS”), the Sage 
solutions and e-commerce provider.
Azurri Retail, whose customers include 
Matalan, JJB Sports, Littlewoods and 
Holland & Barratt, generates recurring 
income of approximately £0.6m 
annually. It is currently being integrated 
with K3’s existing retail software 
operations.
Having acquired the Sage 200 business 
of FDS in December 2010, we bought 
the remainder of FDS seven months 
later. The deal has added 300 Sage 
customers and additional expertise 
across the full range of Sage products. 
FDS has also developed its own 
e-commerce solution, which integrates 
fully with Sage and Microsoft products.
Outlook
We are delighted with the progress 
K3 has made in the year under review 
and results illustrate the high degree of 
robustness to our earnings. A very large 
proportion of the Group’s income is 
recurring, derived from K3’s substantial 
customer base, which now numbers in 
excess of 2,300 customers.
The Group also continues to generate 
good cash flows and the very high level 
of major contract wins is also pleasing, 
pointing to the strength of our product 
offering in the markets we address.
Over the last year, we have seen 
the growth in the business that we 
anticipated in the 2010 financial report. 
We expect the business to grow further 
as we see the full year impact  
of acquisitions and the annualised 
impact of business wins in Managed 
Services. The Group remains 
well-funded. We will seek further 
complementary acquisitions to 
strengthen our position and continue 
the growth of the business.
We believe that K3 is well placed to 
deliver a strong performance over the 
coming year despite the uncertain 
economic outlook.

£9.05m). Profit from operations for the 
year was £5.81m (2010: 12 months 
£5.49m; 18 months £6.16m).
The amortisation of intangible assets of 
£2.83m (2010: 12 months £2.08m; 
18 months £2.89m) includes 
amortisation on new acquisitions 
of £0.38m and full year charges for 
acquisitions made during the previous 
period. Finance costs were £0.91m 
(2010: 12 months £0.85m; 18 months 
£1.37m). The resulting profit for the year 
was £4.48m (2010: 12 months £3.65m; 
18 months £3.75m).
Earnings per share and dividends
Adjusted earnings per share
*28
 was 
27.5p (2010: 12 months 20.5p;  
18 months 23.7p). Earnings per share 
was 17.5p (2010: 12 months 14.6p;  
18 months 15.2p).
The directors propose to pay a dividend 
of 0.75p per share (2010: 0.25p) 
maintaining the dividend for the year at 
the same level as that for the previous 
18 months.
Cash flow and net debt
The net cash position was at 30 June 
2011 of £0.11m (2010: cash overdraft 
of £0.57m). There were bank and other 
loans were £16.30m (2010: £11.35m). 
Repayments against bank and other 
loans during the period were £2.87m 
(2010: 18 months £4.75m). New loans 
of £7.50m were obtained to fund the 
acquisitions during the year. £5.10m was 
paid to vendors of these acquisitions with 
£0.31m of earn out payments in relation 
to acquisitions made in the prior period. 
There was a increase in the sterling value 
of the Euro denominated loan of £0.47m 
(2010: decrease of £0.80m).
The Group’s net cash inflow in the year 
was £0.60m (2010: 18 months £3.24m). 
The Group’s inflow from operations in 
the period was £5.64m (2010: 18 months 
£7.33m). However, this is after making 
payments in relation to acquisitions 
of £1.69m to regularise liabilities that 
were significantly outside normal 
statutory due dates and commercial 
terms at the date of acquisition, £0.49m 
of acquisition costs and £0.45m of 
exceptional reorganisation costs.
The Group adopts cash flow hedge 
accounting in respect of its interest 
collar. The effect is that £0.09m has 
been credited to the cash flow hedging 
reserve. A financial liability of £0.07m 
(2010: £0.20m) is included as derivative 
financial instruments within current 
trade and other payables. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

Taxation
The tax charge for the period was £0.43m 
(2010: 12 months £1.00m; 18 months 
£1.02m) comprising a charge of £1.42m 
(2010: 12 months £1.58m; 18 months 
£1.77m) of current taxation and a credit 
of £0.99m (2010: 12 months £0.58m; 
18 months £0.75m) of deferred taxation, 
of which £1.07m (2010: 12 months 
£0.58m; 18 months £0.81m) related to 
the amortisation of intangible assets. This 
credit for deferred tax in the current year 
includes £0.30m following the reduction 
of the tax rate in the UK from 28% to 26%. 
The effective tax rate was 21.8% (2010: 
18 months 22.2%) due to the inclusion of 
profits from overseas subsidiaries which 
are taxed at lower rates.
Cautionary statement
This business review has been prepared 
for shareholders to provide them with 
additional information to assess the 
company’s strategies and the potential 
for those strategies to succeed. It 
should be noted that the business 
review contains certain forward looking 
statements. These statements are made 
by the directors in good faith, based 
on the information available to them 
up to the time of the approval of this 
report. Accordingly, all these statements 
should be treated with caution, due to 
the inherent uncertainties, including 
both economic and business risk factors, 
underlying any such forward looking 
information.
Principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of potential risks 
and uncertainties, which could have 
a material impact on the Group’s 
performance and could cause actual 
results to differ materially from expected 
and historical results. The Group’s risk 
management policies and procedures to 
deal with operational risk are included in 
the Corporate Governance Statement on 
pages 23 and 24. The principal business 
risks which the Group faces can be 
categorised as follows: 
Strategic
Changes in the business environment 
influence the Group’s development 
in terms of the strategies which it 
pursues and the products and services 
it offers. These changes may stem 
from market competition or economic 
and technological advancement. The 
executive directors regularly review the 
Group’s strategic progress and obtain 
market information to assist in strategic 
decisions around products, competitors 
and potential acquisitions. We recognise 
that selected acquisitions will play a key 
role in future growth of the business 
as illustrated by the major acquisitions 
made since 2003. We are expanding into 
the emerging technologies of “hosted 
applications” and “cloud computing” . 
We also recognise that the ability 
to integrate acquisitions and derive 
synergies is key and, to this end, we have 
strengthened our central management 
team to ensure that strategic objectives 
and targets are reached.
Business environment
The Group’s customer base is 
mainly in the retail, distribution and 
manufacturing sectors, primarily in 
the United Kingdom and Europe. The 
environment in which the Group offers 
its products and services is, therefore, 
dependent on the economic and other 
circumstances affecting these business 
sectors including competitor behaviour. 
Over the years we have developed 
a creative, innovative, competitive 
culture and a reputation for advanced 
functionality and product quality. The 
 20% increase in revenue year on year
 Newly acquired businesses contributed 
 revenues of £8.00m

Group has made significant investment 
in its library of IP which protects 
the business from competition and 
increases the barrier to entry in our 
specialists markets. Whilst there is still a 
difficult economic backdrop in our core 
markets, the Group is well placed as one 
of Microsoft’s larger business partners in 
the UK and has high levels of predictable 
income from its existing customer 
base, both in the UK and in its overseas 
markets.
Relationships
The Group benefits from a number of 
close commercial relationships with 
key suppliers and customers. Damage 
to or loss of these relationships could 
have a direct and detrimental effect 
on the Group’s results. The key Group 
supplier relationships are secured by 
commercial agreements lasting for up 
to 5 years and management participate 
in regular product and strategy reviews 
with the supplier. On an annual basis 
our customers commit to maintenance 
and support agreements that facilitate 
availability of product upgrades and 
business support.
Delivery
Our products and services operate in 
business critical areas for our customers 
and any failure to meet contractual 
commitments and client expectations 
could damage our reputation and 
impact upon our financial position. 
To mitigate this risk we monitor our 
performance continuously against 
contractual commitments and 
expectations and deploy a wide range 
of experienced technical specialists 
and project managers to evaluate 
performance. High risk projects are 
monitored at Divisional board level, 
meetings of which are attended by main 
Board executive directors.
Financial
Whilst all risks may be considered 
to have a financial impact, the 
management of the Group’s financial 
resources represents a key area of focus. 
Financial risks are faced in ensuring 
sufficient funds are available to meet 
financial commitments as and when 
they fall due and protecting the Group’s 
financial strength against adverse 
movements in financial markets. Further 
details are provided in note 19.
•	 Cr edit 	risk – The Group’s credit risk 
is primarily attributable to its trade 
receivables. The amounts presented 
in the statement of financial position 
are net of allowances for doubtful 
debts, estimated by the Group’s 
management based on prior 
experience and their assessment of 
the current economic environment. 
The Group operates in three key 
markets and hence the credit risk is 
concentrated on retail, manufacturing 
and distribution customers. The Group 
manages credit risk by ensuring that 
outlays by the Group are matched 
with receipts from customers where 
possible and by tight control over 
contractual terms.
•	 C urr enc y 	 risk 	– The Group’s currency 
risk is primarily attributable to its trade 
receivables where certain customers 
are billed in US Dollars or Euros 
where these are not the functional 
currency of the Group company. 
Where possible the risk is hedged by 
amounts payable in those currencies. 
The acquisition of Landsteinar 
Netherlands in September 2007 was 
part funded by a Euro loan which acts 
as a hedge against the net assets of 
the business.
•	 P ric e 	risk 	– The Group does not have 
any financial instruments which are 
exposed to price risk.
•	 Liquidit y 	 and 	 cash	 flo w - The Group 
has deferred contingent consideration 
and a bank loan with set payment 
dates. The Group ensures that it has 
sufficient funds to meet its obligations 
or commitments associated with its 
financial instruments by monitoring 
cash flow as part of its day-to-
day control procedures and also, 
more strategically, to ensure that 
financing is in place with manageable 
repayment periods and that 
appropriate facilities are available to 
be drawn upon when the need arises. 
The facilities from the Group’s bankers 
require the Group to meet certain 
covenants throughout the term of 
the loans and the Group’s forecasts 
indicate that the Group will remain 
within the set parameters.
•	 I n t er est 	 r a t e - Interest rate risk arises 
from the extent to which the Group 
holds interest rate sensitive assets or 
is exposed to interest rate sensitive 
liabilities. The Group maintains a 
balance of fixed and floating interest 
rates on its financing to manage this 
exposure and also has an interest 
rate hedge strategy set up with its 
UK bankers. The Group has a collar 
hedging arrangement to mitigate the 
risk of interest rates falling outside 
specified ranges on approximately 
18% of sterling denominated long 
term loans. Foreign currency loans 
that were taken out at the time of 
the Landsteinar Netherlands and 
Pebblestone acquisitions are not 
currently hedged for interest rates.

additional or complementary products, IP and skills, together 
with customer bases that we can grow through our managed 
services capability.
Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements Other K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

The Board supports the principles of good governance. In fulfilling their responsibilities, the directors 
believe that they govern the company in the best interests of the shareholders, whilst having due regard 
to the interests of the stakeholders in the group including, in particular, customers, employees and 
suppliers. The Combined Code has been replaced by the UK Corporate Governance Code, which applies 
to companies of the main list of the London Stock Exchange, and the Quoted Companies Alliance’s 2005 
Corporate Governance Guidelines for Smaller Companies has been superseded by new QCA Guidelines 
issued in September 2010. Although as a company quoted on AIM it is not required to comply with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the directors intend to comply with the provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code in so far as they consider it appropriate having regard to the size 
of the group and have decided to provide corporate governance disclosures comparable with those 
required of a listed company. 
The board
The group is headed by an effective 
board which meets on a bi-monthly 
basis and as and when required to 
consider ad hoc matters such as 
considering and approving the purchase 
or sale of any business or subsidiary. All 
meetings in the period were attended 
by all the directors. It is supplied in 
a timely manner with information of 
a quality to enable it to discharge its 
duties. The board has determined those 
matters which are retained for board 
sanction and those matters which are 
delegated to the executive management 
of the business. The types of decisions 
which are to be taken by the Board are:
•	 appr o v al 	 of	 the	 financial 	sta t emen ts	
and profit plans for the group;
•	 appr o v al 	 of	 an y 	unbudget ed	 plans 	 in	
accordance with prescribed authority 
levels;
•	 appr o v al	 of	 all 	shar eholders ’ 	 cir culars	
and announcements;
•	 appr o v al	 of	 the	 appoin tmen t 	or	
termination of advisors to the group;
•	 the	pur chase	 or	sale	of	 an y 	 business 	or 	
subsidiary;
•	 an y 	new 	bor r o wings ,	 facilities	 and 	
related guarantees;
•	 an y 	asset	pur chase	or	 lease ,	 hir e	
purchase facility or rental agreement 
over prescribed authority limits;
•	 an y 	 dona tion 	 t o 	 a 	 political 	 par ty , 	 or 	 an y	
charitable donation exceeding £250.
The Board has established three standing 
sub-committees to assist in the discharge 
of corporate governance responsibilities. 
They are the nominations committee, 
remuneration committee and audit 
committee. The roles of each of the 
committees, their members and activities 
during the period are covered separately 
within this report.
The Board comprised the Chairman, 
two executive and one non-executive 
director, details of whom are included on 
page 31. The composition of the Board 
is designed to provide an appropriate 
balance of group, industry and general 
commercial experience and is reviewed 
as required to ensure that it remains 
appropriate to the nature of the group’s 
activities.
The roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive are distinct. The office of 
Chairman is held by Mr TA Milne. The 
office of Chief Executive is held by  
Mr NA Makeham.
Appointments to the Board are the 
responsibility of the Nominations 
Committee.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprises 
the Chairman, Mr TA Milne, and the 
non-executive director, Mr PJ Claesson, 
and the Chief Executive,  
Mr NA Makeham, and is chaired by the 
Chairman. Meetings are arranged as 
necessary and none were held during 
the year. The committee is responsible 
for nominating candidates (both 
executive and non-executive) for the 
approval of the Board to fill vacancies or 
appoint additional persons to the Board. 
Its terms of reference are available 
upon request and are placed on the 
company’s website.
All directors receive induction on 
joining the Board covering the group’s 
operations, goals and strategy, and their 
responsibilities as directors of the group. 
The company supports the directors 
in developing their knowledge and 
capabilities.
The directors have established a 
procedure, agreed by the Board, for 
directors in the furtherance of their duties 
to take independent professional advice, 
if necessary, at the company’s expense.
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
requires that the Board should 
undertake a formal and rigorous annual 
evaluation of its own performance and 
that of its committees and individual 
directors. However, no formal evaluation 
was conducted during the period 
although informal evaluation of the 
performance of the individual executive 
directors was conducted by the 
Chairman.

Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements Other
All directors are subject to election by 
shareholders at the first opportunity 
after their appointment. In accordance 
with the Articles of Association, all 
directors are required to retire by 
rotation and shall be eligible for re-
election. The terms and conditions of 
appointment of the non-executive 
director are available for inspection 
upon request.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises 
the Chairman, Mr TA Milne, and the 
non-executive director, Mr PJ Claesson, 
and is chaired by the Chairman. 
It reviews the remuneration and 
contractual arrangements of the 
executive directors. The remuneration 
of the Chairman and the non-executive 
director is determined by the Board 
as a whole, based on a review of the 
current practices in other companies. 
The committee met twice during the 
year and both meetings were attended 
by both members of the committee. The 
terms of reference are available upon 
request and are placed on the company’s 
website.
Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
The Board recognises its responsibility to 
present a balanced and understandable 
assessment of the group’s position 
and prospects, both within its half year 
and annual financial statements and in 
other price-sensitive public reports. The 
statement of the directors’ responsibility 
in preparing the financial statements is 
made on page 29.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors 
have formed a judgement, at the time of 
approving the financial statements, that 
there is a reasonable expectation that 
the group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason the 
directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.
Internal control
The Board recognises its ultimate 
accountability for maintaining an 
effective system of internal control 
which is appropriate in relation to both 
the scope and nature of the group’s 
activities. The system covers all controls 
including:
•	 financial;
•	 oper a tional;
•	 c omplianc e; 	and
•	 r isk	managemen t.
The responsibility for managing risks on 
a day to day basis lies with the executive 
directors. The principle business risks 
and the actions to mitigate the risks 
are included in the Financial Review on 
pages 19 and 20. Details of operational 
risks are included below.
Operational
These risks, which are inherent in all 
business activities, are those which 
mainly result from the potential 
breakdown of individual business units 
or the group’s control of its human, 
physical and operating resources. The 
potential financial or reputational loss 
arising from failures in internal controls, 
flaws or malfunctions in computer 
systems and poor product design or 
delivery all fall within this category.
There is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant issues faced by the group 
which has been in place throughout the 
period and up to 16 September 2011. It 
has been regularly reviewed by the Board 
and it accords with the Turnbull guidance.
The Board and senior management have 
a clear and consistent understanding of 
the key risks facing the business. Whilst 
they recognise that it is not possible 
to eliminate risk completely, they have 
established an infrastructure of controls, 
systems, staff and processes which 
aim to minimise the likelihood of risks 
occurring or reduce the impact should 
they do so. The key elements of this 
infrastructure which enable the Board to 
review the effectiveness of the system of 
internal controls are as follows:
•	 establishmen t 	of 	a 	f or mal	
management structure, including the 
specification of matters reserved for 
decision by the Board;
•	 setting 	 and 	r eviewing	 the 	 str a t eg ic	
objectives of the group;
•	 B oar d	 in v olv emen t 	 in 	 the	setting 	and	
review of the annual budget;
•	 the 	r egular	 r eview	of	 the 	 g r oup ’ s 	
performance compared with budget 
and forecasts;
•	 pr e	and	post	in v estmen t 	 appr aisal 	 of	
capital expenditure;
•	 in t eg r it y 	and 	c ompet enc e 	of 	
personnel as part of the control 
environment; and 
•	 g r oup 	r epor ting	 instruc tions	 and 	
procedures including delegation of 
authority and authorisation levels, 
segregation of duties and other 
control procedures, and standardised 
accounting policies. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011
24
The Board and senior management are 
aware that any significant operational 
matters which raise cause for concern 
may have arisen because of or give 
rise to material internal control issues. 
There is a process in place whereby any 
member of management who becomes 
aware of an internal control issue can 
bring this to the attention of the Chief 
Finance Officer. There were no such 
issues raised during the period under 
review.
The Board acknowledges its 
responsibility for the group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The Board is committed 
to operating comprehensive processes 
to manage the key risks which face 
the business. They have established 
a framework of policies, systems and 
procedures to ensure that the nature 
and extent of the risk undertaken is 
commensurate with the commercial 
returns and, where necessary, to 
ensure prudent risk-taking to protect 
shareholder value. Such a system 
is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can provide 
only reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee comprises the 
Chairman, Mr TA Milne, and the non-
executive director, Mr PJ Claesson, 
and is chaired by the Chairman. The 
committee met twice during the year 
and meetings were attended by both 
members of the committee. The role 
of the Audit Committee is to consider 
the appointment of the auditors, audit 
fees, scope of audit work and any 
resultant findings. It reviews external 
audit activities, monitors compliance 
with statutory requirements for financial 
reporting and reviews the interim and 
full year financial statements before 
they are presented to the Board for 
approval. The Chief Executive, Chief 
Finance Officer and external auditors 
attend meetings of the Audit Committee 
by invitation. The committee is also 
required to review the effectiveness of 
the group’s internal control systems, to 
review the group’s statement on internal 
control systems prior to endorsement by 
the Board and to consider, from time to 
time, the need for a “risk sub-committee” 
to assist in monitoring the group’s 
internal control systems. Its terms of 
reference are available upon request and 
are placed on the company’s website.
The Audit Committee considers and 
determines relevant action in respect 
of any control issues raised by the 
auditors. Given the size of the group and 
the close day to day control exercised 
by the executive directors and senior 
management, no formal internal audit 
department is considered necessary.
Relations with shareholders
The company seeks to maintain good 
communication with shareholders. The 
executive directors make presentations 
to institutional shareholders covering 
the interim and full year results. Whilst 
most shareholder contact is with the 
executive directors, the Chairman 
and the non-executive director are 
available to meet major shareholders if 
requested to do so. The views of major 
shareholders are obtained through 
direct face-to-face contact and analysts’ 
or brokers briefings. 
The Board considers the AGM to be an 
important opportunity to communicate 
with shareholders and encourages their 
participation. The company despatches 
the notice of AGM, with explanatory 
notes describing items of special 
business, at least 21 working days 
before the meeting. All shareholders 
have the opportunity formally or 
informally to put questions to the 
company’s AGMs. All directors attend 
the AGM and the Chairman of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees is available to answer 
questions from shareholders. At each 
AGM the Chairman advises shareholders 
of the proxy voting details on each of 
the resolutions which is dealt with on a 
show of hands. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

During the year, the auditors provided 
non-audit services in relation to 
consultation on interim results and tax 
advice in connection with acquisitions 
and payroll taxes. The Board considered 
the proposed non-audit services in 
advance to ensure that it was satisfied 
that neither the nature nor the scale of 
the non-audit services would impair the 
auditors’ objectivity and independence.
Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
Whilst the group is not required to 
comply with the provisions of the 
Combined Code (now replaced by the 
UK Corporate Governance Code), it has 
given considerable attention to the 
provisions set out therein.  The Group 
is currently  reviewing its compliance

The salaries of the executive directors are determined after giving full consideration to the best practice 
provisions and after a review of the performance of the individual. It is the aim to reward directors 
competitively; consideration is, therefore, given to the median remuneration paid to senior management 
of comparable public companies. No director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
for the financial statements
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors 
to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law 
the directors have elected to prepare 
the group financial statements 
in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union 
and the company financial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law. Under company 
law the directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the 
group and company and of the profit 
or loss of the group for that period. The 
directors are also required to prepare 
financial statements in accordance with 
the rules of the London Stock Exchange 
for companies trading securities on the 
Alternative Investment Market. 
In preparing these financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
•	 selec t 	suitable 	 ac c oun ting	policies 	
and then apply them consistently;
•	 make 	judgemen ts 	and	 ac c oun ting 	
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
•	 sta t e 	whether 	they	 ha v e 	been 	
prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;
•	 pr epar e 	 the 	 financial 	 sta t emen ts 	 on 	
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the 
company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the company 
and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
Supplier payment policy
The company’s policy, which is also 
applied by the group, is to agree terms 
of payment with suppliers when setting 
the terms of each transaction, ensure 
that suppliers are made aware of the 
terms of payment and abide by the 
terms of payment. Trade creditors of 
the company at 30 June 2011 were 
equivalent to 55 (18 month period 
ended 30 June 2010: 67) days’ purchases, 
based on the average daily amount 
invoiced by suppliers during the period.
Charitable and political contributions
Charitable contributions during the 
period amounted to £4,096 (18 month 
period ended 30 June 2010: £5,693). 
There were no political contributions 
during the year or prior period.

Disabled employees
Applications for employment by 
disabled persons are always fully 
considered, bearing in mind the 
aptitudes of the applicant concerned. In 
the event of members of staff becoming 
disabled every effort is made to ensure 
that their employment with the group 
continues and that appropriate training 
is arranged. It is the policy of the group 
that the training, career development 
and promotion of disabled persons 
should, as far as possible, be identical 
with that of other employees.
Employee consultation
The group places considerable value on 
the involvement of its employees and 
has continued to keep them informed 
on matters affecting them as employees 
and on the various factors affecting 
the performance of the group. This is 
achieved through informal discussions 
between management and other 
employees at a local level.
Directors’ indemnity cover
All directors benefit from qualifying 
third-party indemnity provisions in place 
during the financial period and at the 
date of this report.
Environmental matters
The directors recognise that whilst the 
group’s business activities as a developer 
and supplier of software applications 
have minimal direct environmental 
impact, they acknowledge that the 
group’s actions may have an impact on 
the environment through its day to day 
activities and through its wider network. 
They acknowledge a commitment to 
the protection of the environment and 
the group’s environmental policy aims 
to raise awareness of environmental 
matters and to establish standards. 
The group’s intention is to establish 
a paperless working environment 
wherever appropriate. This is 
supported through the automation 
of a number of internal management 
and administrative processes such as 
timesheets and performance appraisals. 
The group also encourages staff to 
minimise unnecessary travel by using 
web exchange, telephone conferencing 
and working from home in appropriate 
circumstances. 
Events after the reporting date
These are detailed in note 31 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Website publication
The directors are responsible for 
ensuring the annual report and the 
financial statements are made available 
on a website. Financial statements are 
published on the company’s website in 
accordance with legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements, 
which may vary from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. The maintenance and 
integrity of the company’s website is 
the responsibility of the directors. The 
directors’ responsibility also extends to 
the ongoing integrity of the financial 
statements contained therein.
Auditors
All of the current directors have taken 
all of the steps that they ought to have 
taken to make themselves aware of any 
information needed by the company’s 
auditors for the purposes of their audit 
and to establish that the auditors are 
aware of the information. The directors 
are not aware of any relevant audit 
information of which the auditors are 
unaware.
The Notice of Annual General Meeting 
contains a resolution to re-appoint BDO 
LLP as auditors for the ensuing year.

1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements
Statement of compliance
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs and 
IFRIC interpretations) as endorsed by the European Union (“endorsed IFRS”) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies preparing their accounts under endorsed IFRS. The company has elected to prepare its parent company 
financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 94 to 108. 
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. The policies have 
been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated. The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain derivative financial instruments which have been 
valued in accordance with IAS 39.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In preparing the Group financial statements for the current period, the Group has adopted the following new International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), amendments to IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 
(IFRIC) Interpretations:
IFRS 3 (Revised) – Business Combinations
IAS 27 (amended) – Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
IAS 39 (amended) – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement
IFRS 3 (Revised) – Business Combinations requires costs of acquiring business combinations to be charged to the income 
statement whereas previously these costs were treated as part of the cost of the entity acquired. £0.49m has been charged to 
the income statement during the current year. IAS 27 (amended) and IAS 39 (amended) have not had a significant impact on the 
results or the net assets of the Group.
The following standards and interpretations were effective in 2011 but are not relevant to the Group:
IFRIC 17 – Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners
IFRS 1 (Revised) – First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards
IFRIC 18 – Transfer of Assets from Customers
IFRS 2 (amended) – Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions

Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into 
the Group.
Revenue comprises the value of sales to third party customers of software licences, customised software, hardware and fees 
derived from installation, consultancy, training, support and managed services. It is stated exclusive of value added tax and net of 
trade discounts and rebates. 
Revenue on the sale of software licences is recognised where there is persuasive evidence of an agreement with a customer 
(contract and/or binding purchase order), delivery of the software has taken place, collectability is probable and the fee is fixed 
and determinable. If significant post-delivery obligations exist, revenue is deferred until no significant obligations remain. 
Revenue on the sale of customised software, hardware and installation is recognised on delivery to a customer or on completion 
of contractual milestones. Revenue from training and consultancy is recognised as the contract progresses. Revenue from 
support and managed services is generally invoiced in advance, termed “deferred revenue” , and taken to revenue in equal 
monthly instalments over the relevant period.
Profit from operations
Profit from operations is stated after charging all operating costs including those separately disclosed by virtue of their size or 
unusual nature or to facilitate a more helpful understanding of the group’s results. It is stated before finance income and costs.

1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the company and its subsidiaries (“the group”) as if they formed 
a single entity. Intra-group transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated in the group 
consolidation.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. Control exists when the group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting 
rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. 
Business combinations
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries’ assets and 
liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date. The results of 
subsidiaries acquired in the period are included in the income statement from the date on which control is obtained. 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the 
assets, including any intangible assets identified, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but 
is measured at cost less impairment losses. In determining the fair value of consideration, the fair value of equity issued is the 
market value of equity at the date of completion, and the fair value of contingent consideration is based upon the extent to 
which the directors believe performance conditions will be met and thus whether any further consideration will be payable.
As permitted by IFRS 1, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2006 (date of transition to IFRS) has been frozen at 
the UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. 
The group performs its impairment reviews at the cash-generating unit level. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable net book value of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on 
disposal.
Associates
Where the group has the power to participate in (but not control) the financial and operating policy decisions of another entity, 
it is classified as an associate. Associates are initially recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost. The 
group’s share of post-acquisition profits and losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except that losses in 
excess of the group’s investment in the associate are not recognised unless there is an obligation to make good those losses. 
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the group and its associates are recognised only to the extent of unrelated 
investors’ interests in the associate. The investor’s share in the associate’s profits and losses resulting from these transactions is 
eliminated against the carrying value of the associate.
Any premium paid for an associate above the fair value of the group’s share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the associate. The carrying value of the investment in 
each associate is subject to impairment in the same way as goodwill arising on a business combination described above.
Where the group does not have the power to participate in (or control) the financial and operating policy decisions of another 
entity, it is classified as an available-for-sale investment. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Impairment charges of non-financial assets (excluding deferred tax assets)
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken at the financial 
period end. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the 
higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use (effectively the expected cash to be generated from using the asset in 
the business)), the asset is written down accordingly. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the 
asset’s cash-generating unit (i.e. the lowest group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separable identifiable 
cash flows). Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination giving rise to the goodwill.
The estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not 
been adjusted. 
Impairment charges are included in administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement, except to the extent they 
reverse gains previously recognised in total comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions entered into by group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which they operate (the “functional currency”) are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of transactions. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated at the rates ruling at that date. Exchange 
differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are similarly recognised immediately in the 
income statement except for foreign currency borrowings qualifying as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, in 
which case exchange differences are recognised in a separate component of equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the group enters into forward contracts and options (see below 
for details of the group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments). Where the group has entered into 
forward currency contracts to hedge future foreign currency cash flows, the group adopts hedge accounting for these transactions.
On consolidation, results of overseas subsidiaries are translated using the average exchange rate for the period. The balance 
sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated using the closing period end rate. Exchange differences arising, if any, are taken to 
a separate component in equity (the translation reserve). Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in 
the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on 
acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling denominated assets and liabilities.
Exchange differences recognised in the income statement of group entities’ separate financial statements on the translation of 
long-term monetary items forming part of the group’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to the 
foreign exchange reserve on consolidation.

Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Executive Directors.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset 
was acquired. The Group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity.
Financial assets are recognised at fair value on the group’s statement of financial position when the group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They 
arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers, e.g. trade receivables. Trade receivables do not carry any 
interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of 
the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under 
the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present 
value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net, 
such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in 
the income statement. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is 
written off against the associated provision.
The group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand deposits held at call and overdrafts with banks. 
Fair value through profit or loss
This category comprises only in-the-money derivatives (see Financial liabilities section for out-of-money derivatives). They are carried in 
the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement in finance 
income or expense line. Other than derivative financial instruments which are not designated as a hedging instrument, the group does 
not have any assets held for trading nor does it voluntarily classify any financial assets as being at fair value through profit or loss.
Available-for-sale
Non-derivative financial assets not included in the above categories are classified as available-for-sale and comprise principally 
the Group’s strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries or associates. They are carried at fair value with 
changes in fair value generally recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in an available-for-sale reserve. 
Where there is a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset (which constitutes 
objective evidence of impairment), the full amount of impairment, including any amount previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income, is recognised in profit or loss. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Financial liabilities
The group classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories, depending on the purpose for which it was acquired. Other than 
financial liabilities in a qualifying hedging relationship (see below), the group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows:
Fair value through profit or loss
This category comprises only out-of-the-money derivatives (see financial assets for in-the-money derivatives) and contingent 
consideration. They are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the 
consolidated income statement. 
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities include the following items:
•	 Bank	 bor r o wings 	ar e 	 initially	 r ec og nised	a t	 fair	 v alue	 net	of	an y	 tr ansac tion 	 c osts 	 dir ec tly 	a ttr ibutable	 t o 	 the	issue	 of 	 the 	
instrument. Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the 
liability carried in the statement of financial position. Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs and 
premiums payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding; 
•	 T r ade 	pa y ables	and	other 	shor t -t er m 	 monetar y 	liabilities , 	which 	 ar e 	initially	r ec og nised 	a t	fair 	 v alue	 and	subsequen tly	car r ied	
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Fair value measurement hierarchy
IFRS 7 requires certain disclosures which require the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value 
using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the fair value measurement (see note 19). 
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
(a) quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);
(b) inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as 
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) (Level 2); and
(c) inputs from the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3).
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the financial asset or financial liability is categorised is determined on the basis 
of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in 
their entirety into only one of the three levels.
Hedge accounting
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at 
their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The group designates certain derivatives as either:
•	 Hedges 	 of	 in t er est 	r a t e 	and	f or eig n 	 cur r enc y	cash	 flo w 	 r isk	associa t ed	 with	 a 	 r ec og nised 	 asset	or	liabilit y	or	 a 	 highly	pr obable	
forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or
•	 Hedges 	 of	 a 	net	in v estmen t	in	 a 	 f or eig n 	 oper a tion 	 (net	in v estmen t 	hedge).
The group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as 
well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The group also documents its 
assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions 
are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.

Financial Statements (continued)

1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Hedge accounting (continued)
The fair values of derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 20. Movements on the hedging reserve 
in shareholders’ equity are shown in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The full fair value of a hedging 
derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current 
asset or liability, if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow 
hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the 
asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity 
are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a 
liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects 
net profit or loss.
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation 
Where the group has foreign currency borrowings to hedge changes in the net investment of foreign operations arising from 
movements in the forward exchange rate, to the extent that the hedge is effective, gains and losses arising on the foreign 
currency borrowings are recognised directly in equity. The ineffective portion of such hedges is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Pension contributions
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as 
incurred. The group has no defined benefit arrangements in place.
Share-based payments
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, that is, share options and warrants. Equity-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. Fair value is measured by use of a trinomial lattice model. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the group’s best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s 
estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting 
the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised 
over the vesting period is based on the amount that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of 
the options and warrants granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether 
the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to meet a market vesting condition.
The group has applied the exemption available under IFRS 2, to apply its provisions only to those options and warrants granted 
after 7 November 2002 and which were outstanding at 1 January 2006. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Leased assets
Leases for which the group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Assets 
held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their expected 
useful lives. The amount initially recognised as an asset is the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of 
the minimum lease payments payable over the term of the lease. The corresponding lease commitment is shown as a liability. 
Lease payments are analysed between capital and interest. The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant 
proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease. The capital 
element reduces the balance owed to the lessor.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
Externally acquired intangible assets
Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
useful economic lives. The amortisation expense is included within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other 
contractual/legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques (see 
section related to critical estimates and judgements below).
The significant intangibles recognised by the group, their estimated useful economic lives and the methods used to determine the 
cost of intangibles acquired in business combinations are as follows:
Intangible asset Estimated useful economic life Valuation method
Software distribution agreements 5-9 years Estimated royalty stream if the rights were to be licensed
Contractual customer relationships 5-15 years Estimated discounted cash flow
Intellectual property rights 10 years Estimated royalty stream if the rights were to be licensed
Internally generated intangible assets (research and development costs)
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally-generated 
intangible asset arising from the group’s software development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met:
•	 it 	is 	t echnically	 f easible 	 t o 	dev elop 	the 	pr oduc t	f or	 it 	 t o 	 be	sold;
•	 adequa t e 	r esour c es 	 ar e 	a v ailable	t o	c omplet e 	the	 dev elopmen t;
•	 ther e 	 is	 an 	 in t en tion 	 t o	 c omplet e	and	sell	 the	 pr oduc t;
•	 the 	 g r oup	is 	able	t o	 sell 	 the	 pr oduc t;
•	 sale	 of	the	pr oduc t 	will	 gener a t e	futur e 	 ec onomic	 benefits; 	and
•	 expenditur e	 on 	the	pr ojec t 	 can 	be	measur ed 	 r eliably .
The expenditure capitalised represents the cost of direct labour incurred in developing the software product. 
Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives commencing from the date of first 
income recognition. The estimated useful lives for development expenditure are estimated to be in a range of between three and 
seven years. The amortisation expense is included within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement. Where 
no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in 
which it is incurred.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
tax profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on intangible assets and other temporary differences 
recognised in business combinations.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except 
where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly 
to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either:
•	 the 	 same	taxable	 g r oup 	 c ompan y ; 	 or
•	 diff er en t 	 g r oup	en tities	 which 	 in t end	either 	t o	settle	 cur r en t	tax	 assets 	 and	 liabilities 	on	 a 	 net 	 basis , 	 or	t o 	 r ealise	the	assets 	
and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities 
are expected to be settled or recovered.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost. The cost of items of property, plant and equipment is its 
purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the asset concerned, 
the cost of property, plant and equipment, less estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date. 
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are:
•	 L ong 	 leasehold 	 buildings	 P er iod 	 of 	 lease
•	 L easehold 	 impr o v emen ts	 P er iod 	 of 	 lease
•	 P lan t, 	 fixtur es	 and 	 equipmen t	 T hr ee 	 t o 	 fiv e	 y ears
•	 Mot or 	 v ehicles	 F our 	 y ears
Provision is made against the carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment where impairment in value is deemed to 
have occurred. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. The group considers all highly liquid investments with original 
maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral 
part of the group’s cash management system are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the 
statement of cash flows.
Employee share ownership plans
As the company is deemed to have control of its ESOP trust, it is treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for the purposes of the 
group accounts. The material assets, liabilities, income and costs of the K3 Business Technology Group plc Share Incentive Plan 
are included in the financial statements. Until such time as the group’s own shares vest unconditionally with employees, the 
consideration paid for the shares is deducted in equity shareholders funds. 
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a 
result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions 
are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, and are 
discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and released to income statement where changes in circumstances indicate that a 
provision is no longer required.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The nature 
of the group’s business is such that there can be unpredictable variation and uncertainty regarding its business. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are 
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The key sources of estimation that have a 
significant impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed below:
Valuation of intangibles acquired in business combinations
Determining the fair value of software distribution agreements and intellectual property rights acquired in business combinations 
requires estimation of the discounted royalty payments that would have to be paid to acquire the distribution agreement or 
intellectual property rights if it had not been acquired as part of the business combination. Determining the fair value of contractual 
customer relationships acquired in business combinations requires estimation of the value of the cashflows related to those 
relationships and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. More details including carrying values are included 
in note 11.

1 Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)
Valuation of contingent consideration
When valuing the contingent consideration still payable on acquisitions, the group considers various factors including the 
performance of the acquired entity since acquisition together with its expected performance to the end of the earn-out period. 
Following the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised) – Business Combinations, contingent consideration is recognised at, and carried 
thereafter at, fair value. All changes in fair value (other than measurement period adjustments) are reflected in the income 
statement. More details including carrying values are included in notes 16 and 17.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill 
has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash 
generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. An impairment review has been performed at the 
reporting date and no impairment has been identified. More details including carrying values are included in notes 11 and 12.
Useful economic lives of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are amortised or depreciated over their useful economic lives. Useful lives are 
based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for 
continued appropriateness. Changes to estimates can result in changes in the carrying values and hence amounts charged to the 
income statement in particular periods which, in the case of intangible assets, could be significant. More details including carrying 
values are included in notes 10 and 11.
Capitalised development expenditure and subsequent amortisation
Where such expenditure meets the relevant criteria the group is required to capitalise development expenditure. In order to assess 
whether the criteria is met the Board is required to make estimates in relation to likely income generation and financial and technical 
viability of the relevant development projects and the period over which the group is likely to benefit from such expenditure.

The group completed a reorganisation during the year which enabled the full integration of the acquired businesses to create 
a platform for future growth, at a cost of £0.45m, which is accounted for an exceptional cost. This relates mainly to redundancy 
costs. Now that the reorganisation is complete, from 1 July 2011 the Group has established four main trading divisions,  
Microsoft UK, International, SYSPRO and Sage, and Managed Services, together with Head Office.
Following amendments to IFRS3 “Business Combinations” , the costs of acquiring business combinations are no longer treated as 
part of the cost of the entity acquired and are charged to the income statement.

5 Segment information
IFRS 8 requires identification of operating segments on the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the entity’s 
chief operating decision maker (‘CODM’) in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance. The CODM has 
been determined to be the Executive Directors as they are principally responsible for evaluating operating segment performance 
and deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments.
The group has five main operating divisions – Retail Software, Manufacturing Software, Sage Software, Managed Services and IP , 
with the Retail Software division divided geographically between UK and Ireland, and Holland. These six segments represent the 
group’s reportable segments under IFRS 8. The IP and Sage divisions have arisen as a result of acquisitions on 29 June 2010 and 
during the year. Each reportable segment has a segment manager who is directly accountable to, and maintains regular contact 
with, the CODM.
The Manufacturing Software reportable segment comprises three operating units (SCS, AX and small systems business based in 
Hook (formerly in Chertsey)) as discussed in the Business Review. The results of these operating segments have been aggregated 
into one reportable segment as they exhibit similar economic characteristics and have one overall segment manager. In addition, 
AX and small-systems division Hook do not meet the quantitative thresholds as required by IFRS 8 to qualify as separately 
reportable segments.

5 Segment information (continued)
Although the Managed Services segment does not meet the quantitative threshold required by IFRS 8, management has 
concluded that this segment should be reported separately, as its economic characteristics are different to the other segments 
and it is closely monitored by the CODM as a potential growth business segment.
The Central segment comprises head office and other centrally incurred costs which are recharged to the units through a central 
management charge. 
The activities and products and services of the operating segments are detailed in the Business Review on pages 11 to 16.
To match the requirements of the enlarged and integrated business, the reporting structure is being amended along product 
lines and future segmental reporting will be focused on Microsoft UK, International, SYSPRO and Sage, and Managed Services, 
together with Head Office.
The CODM primarily assesses the performance of the operating segments based on adjusted operating profit. This is a measure 
of divisional operating profit less an allocation of centrally incurred costs. Adjusted operating profit is profit before interest, tax, 
amortisation of acquired intangibles, exceptional costs and acquisition costs.
The segment results for the year ended 30 June 2011 and for the 18 month period ended 30 June 2010, reconciled to profit 
before taxation as included in the consolidated income statement, are as follows:

Segment assets and segment liabilities are reviewed by the CODM in a consolidated statement of financial position. Accordingly, 
this information is replicated in the group consolidated statement of financial position on page 35. As no measure of assets or 
liabilities for individual segments is reviewed regularly by the CODM, no disclosure of total assets or liabilities has been made, in 
accordance with the amendment to paragraph 23 of IFRS 8.

The calculations of earnings per share are based on the profit for the period and the following numbers of shares.

 Shares Shares

Weighted average number of shares used in basic EPS 25,650,457 24,599,450
Effects of:
Employee share options and warrants 631,663 48,517
Weighted average number of shares used in diluted EPS 26,282,120 24,647,967
Certain employee options and warrants have not been included in the calculation of diluted EPS because their exercise is contingent 
on the satisfaction of certain criteria that had not been met at the end of the period. In addition, certain employee options have also 
been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their exercise price is greater than the weighted average share price during the 
period (i.e. they are out-of-the-money) and therefore it would not be advantageous for the holders to exercise those options.
The alternative earnings per share calculations have been computed because the directors consider that they are useful to 
shareholders and investors. These are based on the following profits and the above number of shares.

and investors. The comparatives have been adjusted accordingly. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

12 Goodwill and impairment (continued)
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations, derived from the present value of future 
cash flows generated by the CGUs. There are a number of assumptions and estimates involved in calculating the present value of 
the future cash flows, including but not restricted to the following:
•	 g r o wth 	 r a t es	 applied	 t o	pr ofit 	fr om 	oper a tions 	 used	 as 	 the 	 basis	 f or	the	 futur e	cash 	flo w s;
•	 the 	 disc oun t	r a t e	 applied 	t o	 the	cash	flo w s 	t o	calcula t e	their	 pr esen t 	v alue .
Although the directors are satisfied that the assumptions used are appropriate to the current circumstances of the group, 
changes to these key assumptions or estimates could significantly affect the result of the impairment calculation. The basis of the 
assumptions used is as follows:
•	 managemen t 	estima t es	 disc oun t	r a t es 	using	pr e -tax 	r a t es 	 tha t	r eflec t 	 cur r en t	 mar ket	assessmen ts 	of 	 the 	 time 	 v alue 	of 	
money and the risks specific to the business. The growth rates are based on management forecasts for the markets in which 
each CGU operates.
•	 the 	 g r oup	pr epar es	pr e -tax	cash	 flo w 	 f or ecasts 	 der iv ed	 fr om 	 the 	 most	r ec en t	financial 	 f or ecasts	appr o v ed 	 b y 	the	dir ec t ors	
for the next two years and extrapolates cash flows for future periods of between 5 and 15 years which is based on 
management’s assessment of the useful economic lives. In the 3 year period following the approved forecasts, growth 
rates of between 2.25% and 20% have been applied (except for the CGUs relating to AX, small-systems division Hook and 
Managed Services). A growth rate of 25% has been applied to the cash flows for AX for the first 2 years as it is an emerging 
business with large value orders so that a small number of new customers will make a significant impact on the future cash 
flows. In the period thereafter, a long term growth rate of 2.25% has been applied. The Hook CGU relates to small systems 
and a gradual attrition of income is expected, although this is lower than in previous forecasts due to the increase in CRM 
services now provided by the division. Hence an attrition rate of 5% has been applied. The Managed Services division 
is expected to grow rapidly and the impact of the investment in its development during 2011 to 2013 is expected to be 
reflected in significant growth in cashflows in 2014. The cash forecasts for 2012 and 2013 are reduced by the investment 
in development with the consequence that the growth in cashflows for 2014 is expected to leap to 60% for 2014. 10% has 
been applied for the next 2 years with a long term growth rate of 2.25% thereafter. The most recent financial forecasts have 
been prepared on the assumption that gross margins will be consistent with those in 2011 and that overheads are in line 
with any changes in the level of revenues forecast. The growth rates are based on industry growth rates, management’s view 
of the observable markets as well as historical and estimated requirement by customers for the products and services. 
•	 the 	 r a t e 	 used	t o 	 disc oun t 	the	 f or ecast	 pr e -tax 	cash	 flo w s 	is 	10% 	and	r epr esen ts 	the	dir ec t ors ’ 	 cur r en t	 best	estima t e 	 of	 the	
weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”).
As a result of the impairment testing carried out on the basis of these estimates and assumptions, no impairment provisions are 
considered necessary.  K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

The fair value of the unquoted securities is based on the expected cash flows discounted using a rate based on the market 
interest rate and the risk premium specific to the unlisted security of 9.5%.
The Group’s strategic investment is a 20% interest in Cyntergy Limited. Although the group holds a 20% interest, it has no right to 
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of Cyntergy Limited and, consequently, considers that it does not exert 
significant influence. Therefore, the investment in Cyntergy Limited is accounted for as an available-for-sale investment.

The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value at 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010.
Of the above, trade receivables of £nil (2010: £0.12m) and accrued income of £0.27m (2010: £1.267m) is due after more than 
one year.
The group is exposed to credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers. The group has over 2,300 customers 
spread across various industries, although predominantly in the retail, manufacturing and distribution sectors, and hence 
the concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large and diverse customer base. The group assesses the credit rating for 
new customers to minimise the credit risk. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts are made based on management’s objective 
assessment of the risk taking into account the age of the debt and items considered to be in dispute with customers. Given that 
the large number of customers limits the concentration of credit risk, the directors consider that no further credit provision is 
required other than the provision for impairment of £0.82m (2010: £0.47m).
As at 30 June 2011 trade receivables of £8.84m (2010: £5.35m) were past due but not impaired. They relate to the customers 
against whom no provision is considered necessary. The ageing analysis of these receivables is as follows:
 2011 2010
 £’000 £’000
Up to 3 months overdue 5,511 2,815
3 to 6 months overdue 2,699 1,555
6 to 12 months overdue 625 977
 8,835 5,347
As at 30 June 2011 trade receivables of £0.82m (2010: £0.47m) were past due, impaired and provided against. There are no 
individually significant receivables included within this provision. The group takes a prudent view in assessing the risk of non-
payment and considers provision for all debts more than 3 months in arrears unless there are specific circumstances to indicate 
that there is little or no risk of non-payment of these older debts.
The carrying amounts of the group’s trade and other receivables are denominated in the following currencies:

Risk management
The group is exposed through its operations to one or more of the following financial risks:
• Market price risk
 – Fair value or cash flow interest rate risk
 – Foreign currency risk
• Liquidity risk
•	 Cr edit 	 r isk
Policy for managing these risks is set by the Board following recommendations from the Chief Finance Officer. Certain risks 
are managed centrally, while others are managed locally following guidelines communicated from the centre. The policy for 
each of the above risks is described in more detail below. Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented 
throughout these financial statements.
There have been no substantive changes from previous periods in the group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its 
objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or methods used to measure them.

Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the group, from which financial risk arises, are as follows:
•	 T r ade 	r ec eiv ables
•	 C ash 	 a t 	 bank
•	 T r ade	and 	other	pa y ables
•	 F loa ting-r a t e 	 bank	loans
•	 L oans	fr om	r ela t ed 	par ties
•	 I n t er est 	 r a t e	c ollars
•	 F or w ar d	cur r enc y	 c on tr ac ts .
Market risk
Market risk arises from the group’s use of interest bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk that 
the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), 
foreign exchange rates (currency risk) or other market factors (other price risk).
Fair value and cash flow interest rate risk
The group has fixed interest loans in respect of finance leases with a net book value of £0.05m (2010: £0.05m) and loans from 
related parties of £0.64m (2010: £0.64m). The fixed rates applicable are 19% and 8.5% respectively.
Bank debt totalling £14.91m (2010: £9.70m) is held under floating rates linked to monthly LIBOR and EURIBOR. The group makes 
use of interest rate collar arrangements to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR. As at 30 June 2011 13% (2010: 35%) of 
outstanding bank debt was covered by these arrangements.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange risk arises because the group has operations located in Europe whose functional currency is not the same 
as the group’s primary functional currency (sterling). The net assets from overseas operations are exposed to currency risk 
giving rise to gains or losses on retranslation into sterling. The group has hedged its net investments in overseas operations by 
denominating a proportion of its bank loans in Euros so that the cash flow risk created from such hedging techniques reduces 
the volatility in consolidated net assets.
Foreign exchange risk also arises when individual group operations enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than 
their functional currency. It is group policy that such transactions should be hedged by entering into forward contracts where 
it is considered the risk to the group is significant. This policy is managed centrally by group treasury entering into a matching 
forward contract with a reputable bank.
It is group policy that transactions between group entities are always denominated in the selling entity’s functional currency 
thereby giving rise to foreign exchange risk in the income statement of both the purchasing group entity and the group. No 
external hedge is entered into as there is no exposure to consolidated net assets from intra-group transactions. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

19 Financial instruments (continued)
Other market price risk
Where the group has generated a significant amount of surplus cash it invests in money market over-night deposits. The 
directors believe that the exposure to market price risk from this activity is acceptable in the group’s circumstances.
Liquidity risk
The liquidity risk of each group entity is managed centrally by the group treasury function comparing to budgets and quarterly 
forecasts. 
All surplus cash is held centrally to maximise the returns on deposits through economies of scale. The type of cash instrument 
used and its maturity date will depend on the group’s forecast cash requirements. The group maintains a revolving credit facility 
with a major banking corporation to manage any unexpected short-term cash shortfalls. The facilities from the Group’s bankers 
require the Group to meet certain covenants throughout the term of the loans. During the period the rolling cashflow cover 
covenant was removed, and the group’s forecasts indicate that the group will remain within the set parameters.
The principle terms of the group’s borrowings are set out in note 17.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the group. The 
group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales. It is group policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of new 
customers before entering contracts. Such credit ratings, taking into account local business practices, are then factored into any 
contractual arrangements.
The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer. The carrying amount of financial assets 
recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
Further details, including quantitative information, are included in note 15.

Capital disclosures
The group monitors “adjusted capital” which comprises all components of equity (i.e. share capital, share premium, retained 
earnings and other reserves) other than amounts in the cashflow hedging reserve and the translation reserve. Other reserves

can continue to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. In order to maintain the capital structure, 
the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell 
assets to reduce debt.
Sensitivity analysis
Whilst the group takes steps to minimise its exposure to cash flow interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk as described above, 
changes in interest and foreign exchange rates will have an impact on profit.
The directors consider a 1.0% movement in the interest rate to be reasonably possible as at the reporting date. Excluding the 
impact of the interest rate collar, the annualised effect of a 1.0% increase or decrease in the interest rate at the reporting date on 
the variable rate debt carried at that date would, all other variables being held constant, in the directors’ opinion, be immaterial.
The group’s foreign exchange risk is dependent on the movement in the Euro to sterling exchange rate. The directors consider a 
2% movement in the Euro rate to be reasonably possible as at the reporting date. The effect of a 2% strengthening or weakening 
in the Euro against sterling at the balance sheet date on the Euro denominated debt at the date and on the annualised interest 
on that amount would, all other variables being held constant, in the directors’ opinion, be immaterial. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

and the risk premium specific to the unlisted security of 7% (2010: 7%). Were the risk premium adjustments to be increased by 
2%, the fair value of the level 3 asset would have been reduced by £0.01m (2010: £0.01m).

Interest rate collar
The Group has interest rate collar arrangements expiring 31 August 2012 under which the floating LIBOR rate is capped at 5.75% 
with a floor at 4.75%. At 30 June 2011 the notional principal amount under the Group’s interest rate collar was £1.97m (2010: 
£3.41m).
Losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity (note 23) on the interest collar as of 30 June 2011 will be continuously 
released to the income statement until the repayment of existing borrowings is complete.
Since the adoption of hedge accounting, given that the hedges are deemed to be highly effective, changes in the fair values of 
the collar have been taken to the hedging reserve in equity. Prior to the adoption of hedge accounting changes in the fair values 
of the collar were included in financial income and expense in the income statement.
Forward foreign exchange contract
The notional principal amounts of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 30 June 2011 was £0.29m (2010: £nil). The 
hedged highly probable forecast transaction denominated in foreign currency was expected to occur within one month of the 
period end. Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity (note 23) on forward foreign exchange contracts as of 
the period end are recognised in the income statement in the period during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the 
income statement.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity
The group has Euro denominated borrowing amounting to £4.13m (2010: £4.64m) which is designated as a hedge of the net 
assets in the Group’s Dutch subsidiary K3 Business Solutions BV. The fair value of the borrowing at 30 June 2011 was £4.09m 
(2010: £4.57m). The foreign exchange loss of £0.39m on translation of the borrowing to the presentational currency at the 
reporting date is recognised in the Translation reserve (note 23).
21 Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 26% (2010: 28%).

Finance leases
The group leases a small proportion of its office equipment and leasehold improvements (net carrying value £nil). Such assets are 
generally classified as finance leases as the rental period approximates to the estimated useful economic life of the assets concerned 
and often the group has the right to purchase the assets outright at the end of the minimum lease term by paying a nominal 
amount.

employees and directors.
Pension costs for defined contribution schemes in period to 30 June 2011 are £0.56m (2010: £0.53m).
26 Share-based payments
As disclosed in note 22, K3 Business Technology Group plc operates an equity-settled share-based remuneration scheme for 
employees: an Executive Share Option Scheme for certain senior management including executive directors. Under the scheme 
there are two types of share options: those where the options vest based on the achievement of a share price target and those 
where the options vest on the achievement of target growth in adjusted earnings per share, i.e. adjusted for amortisation of 
acquired intangibles, cost of share-based payments and exceptional items and with the tax charge being 30% of the operating 
profit so adjusted. All options are subject to the employee having completed three years service from the date of grant.

executive directors will exercise the options after the vesting date when the share price is 25% higher than the target share price 
and that other employees will exercise when the target share price is achieved.

Panacea Limited
On 17 November 2010 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Panacea Limited, now called K3 Panacea Limited. The 
consideration was £1.55m satisfied on completion in cash. Contingent consideration is also payable on the completion of certain 
contracts.

The contingent cash consideration payable is dependent on completion of certain contracts. It will fall in the range of £nil to 
£0.03m. It is anticipated that this will be payable in full in October 2011.
The intangible assets recognised in the adjustments relate to customer relationships. £0.74m of the deferred tax liability recognised 
relates to these intangible assets. The goodwill is attributable to the significant synergies which are expected to arise from the 
integration of this business with that of K3’s existing Managed Services and other product offerings, and those intangibles such as 
the workforce which are not recognised separately. The existing Managed Services division acquired in 2010 (DigiMIS Limited) and 
Panacea are regarded as one CGU and the goodwill for Panacea is therefore included with that for DigiMIS in note 12.
Since the acquisition date, K3 Panacea Limited has contributed £5.56m to group revenues and group profit includes a loss of 
£0.29m.

£0.26m of the contingent consideration was paid in February 2011 and the remainder was paid in July 2011.
The intangible assets recognised in the adjustments relate to the intellectual property and customer relationships and a tax 
amortisation benefit. £0.33m of the deferred tax liability recognised relates to these intangible assets. The adjustment to trade 
and other payables relates to deferred income. The deferred tax asset of £0.06m relates to deferred income balances which have 
already been taxed on a receipts basis. The goodwill is attributable to the significant synergies which are expected to arise from the 
integration of this business with that of Panacea Limited, acquired in November 2010, and those intangibles such as the workforce 
which are not recognised separately.

The deferred cash consideration is expected to be paid in full in October 2011. The amount is dependent on collection of trade 
receivables acquired. The contingent cash consideration payable is dependent on the introduction of new business by the former 
managing director and is payable in quarterly instalments as these contracts are introduced over the next three years. The 
contingent consideration will fall in the range of £nil to £0.90m. The directors’ current estimate is £0.17m.
The intangible assets recognised in the adjustments relate to customer relationships. £0.28m of the deferred tax liability recognised 
relates to these intangible assets. The goodwill is attributable to the significant synergies which are expected to arise from the 
integration of this business with that of K3’s existing AX business and other product offerings, and those intangibles such as the 
workforce which are not recognised separately. The existing AX business and Sense are regarded as one CGU and the goodwill for 
Sense is therefore included with that for AX in note 12.
Since the acquisition date, Sense Enterprise Solutions Limited has contributed £0.56m to group revenues and group profit includes 
a loss of £0.05m.

The fair value of the shares issued was determined by reference to their quoted market price of £0.9225 at the date of acquisition.
The contingent cash consideration payable is dependent on profit generated by K3 Managed Services Limited over the two year 
period following the date of acquisition. The amount included above represents the directors’ current best estimate of the amount 
payable, which they consider is likely to be paid. Part of the contingent consideration was due to be satisfied in shares, however, all 
of the contingent consideration is now payable in cash. Contingent consideration has been reduced by £0.23m during the current 
year as the amount paid in relation to the first earn out period was lower than that recognised at 30 June 2010.
The intangible assets recognised in the adjustments relate to customer relationships. £0.24m of the deferred tax liability recognised 
relates to these intangible assets. The goodwill is attributable to the significant synergies which are expected to arise from the 
integration of this business with that of K3’s existing managed services offering, and those intangibles such as the workforce which

Details of directors and key management compensation are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 26 to 28 and note 4. Other 
than their remuneration and participation in the group’s share option schemes, there are no transactions with key management 
personnel. Other related party transactions are as follows:
Included within other loans due to related parties are loans of £0.64m (2010: £0.64m) from CA Fastigheter AB, a company 
connected with Mr PJ Claesson, a director of the Company. A loan of £0.75m was made in connection with the acquisition of Alpha 
Landsteinar in October 2004. The loan was repayable in twelve equal quarterly instalments commencing on 31 March 2006 subject 
to earlier repayments from proceeds from a future placing or from new bank loans raised. No repayments have been made during 
the current or previous period. Interest is charged at 8.5% per annum and the accrual at the year end amounted to £14,000 and is 
included in accruals (2010: £14,000). In connection with the loan, the company issued 200,000 warrants for ordinary shares of 25p. 
These are exercisable at £0.90 and until the date upon which the loan is repaid. As the loan remains outstanding, the warrants 
remain exercisable. In addition, 500,000 warrants for ordinary shares of 25p each were issued to CA Fastigheter AB during 2007 in 
recognition of the reduction in its security following the increase in borrowings from the bank to fund the acquisition of McGuffie 
Brunton Limited. The warrants are exercisable at 123.5p and until the loan is repaid upon meeting the following conditions: 300,000 
of the warrants are exercisable when the company’s share price reaches £2.50; 100,000 are exercisable when it reaches £3.25; 
100,000 have no conditions attached to them. 
On 23 June 2005 the company received a loan of £1m from Johan and Marianne Claesson AB, a company connected with  
Mr PJ Claesson, a director of the company. The loan was made in connection with the acquisition of Information Engineering Group 
Limited in June 2005 and was repaid during 2005. In connection with the loan, the company issued 400,000 warrants for ordinary 
shares of 25p. These are exercisable at an exercise price of £0.90. During the year ended 30 June 2011 the exercise period was 
extended until the date on which the loan due to CA Fastigheter AB is repaid.
On 29 December 2008, the company received a loan of £1m from CA Fastigheter AB. The loan was a short-term arrangement to 
ensure prudent liquidity over the year end period. The loan was repaid in full on 7 January 2009 in accordance with the terms of the 
loan. Interest and fees of £0.02m were also paid in respect of the loan.
On 29 July 2008 Mr DJ Bolton was appointed a non-executive director of Dawson International Plc, a company connected with 
Mr PJ Claesson, a director of the Company. The Company has charged fees to Dawson International Plc for the services provided by 
Mr Bolton during the period of £17,000 (2010: £67,000), of which £nil was outstanding at the year end (2010: £nil). K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

30 Proforma unaudited results for the year ended 30 June 2010
 In the prior year, the group changed its financial year end from 31 December to 30 June, with the objective of bringing its year end in 
line with that of Microsoft Corporation and providing shareholders with greater visibility on full year results since the majority of 
revenues typically fall in the second half of the calendar year. Below is a table of the proforma unaudited results for the twelve months 
ended 30 June 2010. The information has been extracted from note 30 to the financial statements for the 18 month period to 30 June 
2010. These have been amended for the inclusion within profit from operations of cost of share-based payments as the directors 
consider the amounts to be immaterial and therefore not useful to shareholders and investors. The comparatives have been adjusted 
accordingly.

32 Notes to the cash flow statement
Cash generated from operations is stated after payments to regularise liabilities that were significantly outside normal statutory due 
dates and commercial terms at the date of acquiring companies, that the directors consider to be a cost of acquisition. In addition, cash 
flows from operations include acquisition costs and exceptional reorganisation costs arising as a result of acquisitions during the year. 
The adjusted cash generated from operations has been computed because the directors consider it more useful to shareholders and 
investors in assessing the underlying operating cash flow of the Group. The adjusted cash generated from operations is calculated as 
follows:

1 Accounting policies for the company financial statements
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the 
preceding period.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom accounting standards. 
Intangible assets – goodwill
The group has previously hived up the trade and assets of a subsidiary undertaking into the parent undertaking at book value. 
This results in the investment in a subsidiary which has no trade and hence provision would normally be made against that 
investment under UK GAAP . The company has however applied a true and fair override as allowed under the Companies Act 2006 
and transferred an amount equal to the accounting impairment from investments to goodwill. The Board feels that this more 
accurately reflects the fact that in substance there has been no loss of value to the company. Had the investment been written 
down in strict accordance with UK GAAP , this would have resulted in a provision, in the parent undertaking only, of £1,104,000 
(2010: £1,988,000) which is now being amortised over the remaining useful economic life of five years.
Intangible assets – research and development
Research expenditure is written off as incurred. Development expenditure is also written off, except where the directors are 
satisfied as to the technical, commercial and financial viability of individual projects. In such cases, the identifiable expenditure is 
deferred and amortised over the period during which the company is expected to benefit. This period is between three and five 
years. Provision is made for any impairment. The directors do not consider the capitalised development costs are a realised loss as 
their carry forward is justifiable under the provisions of SSAP 13.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on all 
tangible fixed assets, at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as 
follows:
Leasehold improvements Period of lease
Plant and machinery, office equipment and fixtures 20-33% per annum
Motor vehicles 25% per annum
Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill
The need for any fixed asset impairment write-down is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the 
higher of realisable value and value in use.

Company Financial Statements (continued)
for the year ended 30 June 2011
1 Accounting policies for the company financial statements (continued)
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment except for foreign currency investments where the 
company has applied net investment hedging. Where net investment hedging is applied, the revaluation is recorded in reserves. 
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is 
measured either by reference to the nominal value or the fair value of the shares where appropriate. Any premium is ignored 
when the nominal value is used. 
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at the amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date 
where transactions or events that resulted in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future 
have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the group’s taxable profits and its results as 
stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from 
those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it 
can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying 
timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the timing differences are 
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Turnover
Turnover is calculated net of value added tax and represents the total amount receivable by the company in respect of the sale of 
software licences, customised software, hardware and fees derived from installation, consultancy, training and support.
Income on the sale of software licences is recognised where there is persuasive evidence of an agreement with a customer 
(contract and/or binding purchase order), delivery of the software has taken place, collectability is probable and the fee 
is fixed and determinable. If significant post-delivery obligations exist, income is deferred until no significant obligations 
remain. Income on the sale of customised software, hardware and installation is recognised on delivery to a customer or on 
completion of contractual milestones. Income from training and consultancy is recognised as the contract progresses. Income 
from support is generally invoiced in advance, termed “deferred revenue” , and taken to income in equal monthly instalments 
over the relevant period. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

1 Accounting policies for the company financial statements (continued)
Pension costs
For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other 
post-retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the period. Differences between contributions payable in the period and 
contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet. 
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the forward 
contract rate. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the 
rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Where the company enters into foreign currency borrowings to hedge changes in the net investment of foreign subsidiaries 
arising from movements in the forward exchange rate, gains and losses arising on the foreign currency borrowings are 
recognised directly in equity. 
Leases
Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to 
owned assets, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful 
lives. The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the 
profit and loss account over the period of the lease to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments 
outstanding. Hire purchase transactions are dealt with similarly, except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on 
such a basis. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are similarly spread on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term, except where the period to the review date on which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the 
prevailing market rate is shorter than the full lease term, in which case the shorter period is used.
Share-based payment
Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the profit and 
loss account over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting 
period is based on the amount that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options 
granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting 
conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to meet a market vesting condition.
When the terms and conditions of the options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, 
measured immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to the profit and loss account over the remaining 
vesting period.
Fair value is measured by use of a trinomial lattice model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the 
directors’ best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Notice of Annual General Meeting (continued)
Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting
Please refer to notes 9 to 18 relating to entitlement to attend and vote at the meeting and the appointment of proxies.
1. Mr PJ Claesson was appointed as a non-executive director of the Company in March 2001. Biographical details of  
Mr PJ Claesson are set out on page 31 to these financial statements.
2. The payment of a dividend requires approval of the shareholders and that approval is sought in Resolution 4.
3. Resolution 5 would empower the directors to allot shares for any reason up to an aggregate nominal amount of £2,372,680 
representing approximately one-third of the issued share capital of the Company at the date of the notice of Annual General 
Meeting. 
4. Resolution 6 would empower the directors to allot equity securities for cash other than to existing shareholders pro rata 
to their existing holdings. Such power would be limited to the situations referred to in sub-paragraphs 6.1 and 6.2 of that 
resolution. Sub-paragraph 6.1 refers to rights issues and similar issues, where difficulties arise in offering relevant securities 
to certain overseas shareholders or where fractional entitlements arise. Sub-paragraph 6.2 permits allotments for cash (other 
than rights issues or similar) of ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £711,804 representing approximately 
one-tenth of the current issued ordinary share capital of the Company. The resolution is proposed so as to give the directors 
greater flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. The directors have no present intention of 
exercising the authority.
5. On a show of hands every shareholder present in person has one vote, on a poll every shareholder has one vote for each 
share held by him. The necessary quorum at this meeting is two members present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote 
upon the business to be transacted.
6. The Company specifies that only those members registered on the Company’s register of members at:
	 •	 6.00pm	 on 	 21	 No v ember 	 2011; 	 or ,
	 •	 if 	 this	 M eeting	 is	adjour ned , 	a t 	6.00pm	 on	the	da y 	t w o	 da y s 	pr ior 	t o 	 the	adjour ned	 meeting ,
 shall be entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting.
Issued shares and total voting rights
7. As at 5.00pm on 17 October 2011, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 28,472,163 ordinary shares of  
25 pence each. Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, therefore, the 
total number of voting rights in the Company as at 5.00pm on 17 October 2011 is 28,472,163.
Documents on display
8. The following documents will be available for inspection at Baltimore House, 50 Kansas Avenue, Manchester M50 2GL from 
the date of the notice of the Annual General Meeting until the time of the Meeting and for at least 15 minutes prior to the

Appointment of proxies
9. If you are a member of the Company at the time set out in note 6 above, you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all 
or any of your rights to attend, speak and vote at the Meeting and you should have received a proxy form with this notice of 
meeting. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the proxy form.
10. A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the Meeting to represent you. Details of how to 
appoint the Chairman of the Meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out in the notes to the 
proxy form. If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the Meeting you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy 
(not the Chairman) and give your instructions directly to them.
11. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. You 
may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. Further copies of the proxy form may be 
obtained by photocopying the form. Please indicate in the box next to the proxy’s name the number of shares in relation to 
which he/she is authorised to act as your proxy. Please also indicate by ticking the box provided if the proxy instruction is 
one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and should be returned in the same envelope. 
12. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against 
the resolution. If no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy 
will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the Meeting.
Appointment of proxy using hard copy proxy form
13. The notes to the proxy form explain how to direct your proxy to vote on each resolution or withhold their vote.
 To appoint a proxy using the proxy form, the form must be:
	 •	 c omplet ed 	and	sig ned;
	 •	 sen t 	t o 	 C apita	 R eg istr ars , 	 P XS, 	34	 B eckenham 	R oad , 	B eckenham,	 Ken t	BR3	 4TU	or	 deliv er ed 	t o 	 C apita 	 R eg istr ars 	 a t

	 •	 r ec eiv ed 	 b y	C apita	 R eg istr ars 	no	 la t er	than 	10.30am	 on 	 21 	No v ember 	2011.
In the case of a member which is a company, the proxy form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf 
by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company.
Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the proxy form is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or 
authority) must be included with the proxy form.

Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting (continued)
Proxy voting using the Registrar’s share portal
14. You may also submit your proxy vote electronically using the Share Portal service at www.capitashareportal.com. If not 
already registered for the Share Portal, you will need your Investor Code as shown on a recent dividend tax voucher or recent 
share certificate. For an electronic proxy vote to be valid, your appointment must be received by no later than 10:30am on 21 
November 2011.
CREST proxy voting (uncertificated shareholders)
15. a) CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do 
so by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members 
and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s) who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
 b) In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message 
(a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’ (formerly 
CRESTCo’s) specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. 
The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given 
to a previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuers’ agent (ID 
RA10) by the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments specified in this notice. For this purpose, the time of receipt will 
be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from 
which the registrars are able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this 
time, any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through 
other means. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that 
Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal 
system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility 
of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or 
has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such 
action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. 
In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, 
in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. 
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
Appointment of proxy by joint members
16. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment 
submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint 
holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior). K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011
115
Changing proxy instructions
17. To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy appointment using the method set out above. Note that the 
cut-off time for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also apply in relation to amended instructions; any amended 
proxy appointment received after the relevant cut-off time will be disregarded.
 Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard-copy proxy form and would like to change the instructions using another 
hard-copy proxy form, please contact Capita Registrars on 0871 664 0300. Calls cost 10 pence per minute plus network 
extras. Lines are open 8.30am to 5.30pm Monday to Friday.
 If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of 
proxies will take precedence. If the Company is unable to determine which of more than one valid proxy appointment was 
deposited or delivered last in time, none of them shall be treated as valid in respect of the share(s) to which they relate.
Termination of proxy appointments
18. In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company by sending a signed hard copy notice clearly 
stating your intention to revoke your proxy appointment to Capita Registrars, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent 
BR3 4TU. In the case of a member which is a company, the revocation notice must be executed under its common seal 
or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of attorney or any other 
authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be included 
with the revocation notice.
 The revocation notice must be received by Capita Registrars, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU no later 
than 10.30am on 21 November 2011.
 Appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from attending the Meeting and voting in person. If you have appointed a 
proxy and attend the Meeting in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to report that your company made good strategic progress in the last 
twelve months on many fronts, against a challenging market backdrop.
While revenues showed some growth in the year, adjusted profit before tax was 18.3% 
higher due to increased volumes and efficiency savings. This was achieved despite an 
increase in our investment in research and development. Cash management remains a 
focus for the Group and at the year-end we were in a net cash position. Following two 
acquisitions since the year end, this has moved to a very manageable modest debt.
The Board’s responsibilities include ensuring that Gooch & Housego has a robust and 
achievable strategy , investments are made without undue risks, we have the resources 
to achieve our objectives and that the Company operates efficiently. Our consistent 
strategy of diversifying the Company’s product range and customer base was effective 
in the year with the establishment of our new Systems Technology Group and the 
subsequent award of a number of early stage development contracts in the Space 
sector. It is expected that these activities will lead to business growth as the products 
progress from the development phase and enter production in the medium term. 
These contracts will assist in the business moving up the value chain into sub-systems 
in line with our strategic objectives. Gooch & Housego’s risks in this new sector are 
also minimised as these new product developments are mostly externally funded.
We continued to assess ways of improving the efficiency and the effectiveness of 
the business and management changes and organisational improvements were made 
this year to the marketing and sales activities of the group. We are also exploring if 
a reduction in the number of sites in the US by consolidating capabilities would 
increase efficiency. Progress was also made in sharing technology between 
operations, whilst recognising national security constraints. In manufacturing, 
plans were made to increase the use of our partner company in the Czech Republic 
where labour costs are significantly lower, whilst maintaining product quality.
The global environment in which we enter our new financial year remains unclear. 
In the US, budget uncertainties continue to cloud our vision and the reduction in 
Government spending could limit our opportunities in Aerospace & Defence. It is, 
however, important to note Gooch & Housego’s technology has the advantage of 
being relevant in areas where expenditure is likely to be least affected. In the Far 
East and Europe, some improvement in the economic situation is evident which we 
expect to benefit the Company in due course.
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all employees for their efforts 
and contribution during the year to the success of the Company. With their support, 
the Board believes the company is well placed to continue its growth into the future.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
Chief 
Executive 
Officer’s 
Statement
2013
Trading conditions during the year were broadly positive, albeit set against a 
background of some uncertainty affecting most of the sectors in which Gooch & 
Housego operates. Order intake was at the level needed to sustain growth in the 
business. The order book ended the year at £27.8 million, an increase of 12% from 
the beginning of the year.
Gooch & Housego has seen continued growth in its Aerospace & Defence business 
despite the headwinds affecting this sector. While some significant programmes 
stalled or were subject to delays, other more mature programmes proceeded as 
planned and outweighed the setbacks. While this market continues to be challenging, 
the Company remains optimistic about continued growth prospects based on the 
strong customer relationships that have been developed in recent years and the 
breadth of opportunities currently being addressed.
In line with its strategy, the Company has continued to diversify its activities in the 
Industrial sector, with sensors and test and measurement systems growing in 
importance over the past year. In the industrial laser market Gooch & Housego has 
kept pace with the technology shift away from solid state lasers in favour of fibre 
lasers for many routine materials processing applications. The Company is now a 
major supplier to the fibre laser market at both component and subsystem level. 
In Life Sciences, the Company began to utilise its Systems Technology Group (STG), 
established mid-way through the year, to leverage its excellence in components to 
develop subsystems-level products to address new opportunities in laser surgery 
and to build upon its already strong presence in Optical Coherence Tomography 
(OCT). These initiatives, combined with established business in microscopy and 
research and development work in diagnostics, have reinforced Life Sciences as 
one of the Company’s main growth markets. 
Creating the means to deliver growth has been a primary objective during the past 
year. The aim has been to build a broad-based business that can deliver sustainable 
growth in flat economic conditions and is able to respond to economic recovery, 
while being sufficiently well-balanced to minimise the effects of market cyclicality. 
We have sought to deliver growth in a number of ways:
• Via organic growth and new product development
• By moving up the value-chain from components to sub-systems
•  By developing new application areas where Gooch & Housego can take  
a market leading position 
•  Through acquisitions, where they accelerate the delivery of our strategic 
objectives
•  By leveraging our supply chain and low-cost manufacturing relationships  
to increase competitiveness
•  By strengthening our presence in geographical markets with significant  
growth potential
Organic New Product Development
A more focused approach to research and development has paid dividends in 2013, 
with a significant number of new products being brought to market. These new 
products have ranged from acousto-optic, electro-optic and fibre optic devices, to 
sophisticated laser sources and optical amplifiers, spanning a broad range of 
application areas ranging from microelectronics to satellite communications. By 
carefully selecting our projects, based on enhanced market intelligence derived 
from increasingly close relationships with our major customers, we have been able 
to increase the success rate and value of the new products we have developed.
 
Organic Growth – Moving up the Value Chain
The Systems Technology Group (STG) was established to drive organic growth at 
the sub-systems level. Recognising that it is difficult to make the transition from 
components to systems, and inefficient to try to do this at multiple locations, the 
STG provides Gooch & Housego with a vehicle to undertake the development of 
complex photonic sub-systems without the constraints that apply to its 
component manufacturing operations. With optical, mechanical, electronic and 
software design and modelling capabilities, and the ability to integrate multiple  GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2013 8
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
photonic component technologies (for example, fibre optics, semiconductor lasers 
and acousto-optics), each of which may be manufactured at a different Gooch & 
Housego facility, the STG is able to lead and coordinate complex projects with 
commercial customers, space agencies and collaborative partners. Although still a 
small team (seven people at the year-end), the STG is expected to double in 
headcount during 2014. The STG is also able to call upon development and 
engineering resources from across Gooch & Housego, and works with outside 
partners and consultants, with the result that it is able to take on more demanding 
projects than its small size would suggest.
The STG has initially focussed on space photonics and optical coherence 
tomography (OCT). In both applications Gooch & Housego is experiencing customer 
pull to supply “black-box” solutions, rather than low-level components. In these 
new markets Gooch & Housego’s customers tend to be very large organisations 
that perform the role of systems integrator, and they are not well-equipped to 
interact at the component level.
In space applications, photonics technology has significant advantages over the 
equivalent electronic systems that are the norm today (specifically lower mass, 
higher bandwidth and reduced power consumption, all of which contribute to 
lower cost). A major technology shift in favour of photonics technology is taking 
place and represents an opportunity for Gooch & Housego to take a leading 
position in this rapidly developing new market. Gooch & Housego has a strong 
heritage in space qualified photonic components and the objective is to leverage 
this to develop a family of sub-systems for applications in telecommunications and 
earth observation satellites. Once proven in satellite applications it is anticipated 
that this technology will filter down to the much larger commercial and military 
aerospace markets. (Gooch & Housego has already participated in several 
collaborative projects with aerospace partners to investigate the application of 
fibre optic networks for data, sensing and control systems in next generation 
aircraft). The STG has successfully bid for a number of European Space Agency 
(ESA) and European Union Framework 7 (EU FP7) collaborative programmes and 
has recently completed a programme to design and demonstrate a fibre optic 
amplifier suitable for use in a satellite laser communications system.
Acquisitive Growth
Shortly after the year end Gooch & Housego completed the acquisition of 
Spanoptic Limited (“Spanoptic”), a manufacturer of precision optical components 
based in Glenrothes, Scotland.
Spanoptic specialises in spherical and aspheric lenses and diffractive optics for 
applications in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared regions of the spectrum. This 
capability is highly complementary to Gooch & Housego’s predominantly planar 
optics business and enhances the Company’s ability to provide complete  
sub-system solutions to its customers in line with its strategic objectives. 
Spanoptic’s capabilities in infrared optics and coatings are particularly relevant  
to Gooch & Housego’s activities in the Aerospace & Defence sector.
In recent years Spanoptic has invested heavily in state-of-the-art optical 
manufacturing, metrology and thin-film coating equipment. These investments 
have enabled Spanoptic to produce optical components at the upper end of the 
quality and precision scale while maintaining highly competitive pricing. As a  
result, Spanoptic has been able to win business and develop strong, mainly 
European customer relationships across a broad range of applications including 
analytical instrumentation, optical sensing, security, imaging, life sciences and 
aerospace and defence. 
Also following the year end, in late November 2013, Gooch & Housego completed 
the acquisition of Constelex Technology Enablers Limited (Constelex), a small 
Athens, Greece, based business specialising in the design and manufacture of 
low-noise, high power optical fibre amplifiers and lasers for applications in 
telecommunications, sensing and defence. The Constelex team will relocate to the 
UK in early 2014 and will be based at Gooch & Housego’s Torquay facility as part of 
the STG. Constelex brings highly relevant optical systems expertise to the STG plus

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
a number of ESA and EU funded collaborative projects in the space photonics field. 
The acquisition of Constelex will add valuable skills and experience to the STG and 
will help to accelerate the delivery of the Company’s strategic objective of 
becoming a leader in space photonics.
Increasing Competitiveness
Spanoptic’s competitive advantage is further enhanced by the strategic alliance 
that it has with a Chinese manufacturer of precision optics, optical sub-systems 
and instrumentation. This alliance is being developed and extended to provide 
Gooch & Housego with an enhanced foothold in the increasingly important 
Chinese market and to serve as a high-quality, low-cost manufacturing partner  
for both components and systems. With the ability to manufacture photonic 
sub-systems and instrumentation in higher volumes and at lower cost than would 
be possible elsewhere within Gooch & Housego this relationship will enable the 
Company to scale to higher volumes than would otherwise have been possible.
Similarly, we have made greater use of our established European contract 
manufacturing partner based in the Czech Republic to enhance the competitiveness 
of our products, a process that will continue in the current year. 
Strengthening our Presence in Geographical Markets with Significant 
Growth Potential
2013 has seen a number of initiatives to increase our penetration of Far Eastern 
markets. Over the past 25 years Gooch & Housego has grown its business in Japan 
with the assistance of its distribution partners. In order to gain access to new 
opportunities and to demonstrate commitment to this important market, Gooch  
& Housego Japan KK was established and an office opened in Nagoya in April  
2013. A number of significant new opportunities are already under development.  
In addition to the new relationships in China that came with the acquisition of 
Spanoptic, we have strengthened our applications engineering team there and 
opened a sales office in Singapore during 2013.
Summary
During 2013, Gooch & Housego has made considerable progress in line with  
its strategic objectives to yield a better balanced business with enhanced  
growth potential.
Gooch & Housego has become a more vertically integrated business. At the 
component end of the scale, the acquisition of Spanoptic has added highly 
complementary capabilities in precision optics. The STG has given Gooch & Housego 
a vehicle with which to provide its customers with sub-systems design and 
development services, and the acquisition of Constelex has enhanced the ability of 
the STG to develop complex systems for space and telecommunications applications.
Greater efficiency and volume has helped to deliver revenue growth at improved 
margins, resulting in strong cash generation and a net cash position at the year end.
Prospects
Gooch & Housego has taken a number of important initiatives in the past year – a 
re-focussing of Research and Development and Sales and Marketing, the creation 
of the STG and the identification of new markets such as space photonics. When 
combined with the acquisitions of Spanoptic and Constelex, these initiatives 
provide Gooch & Housego with the means to deliver growth in a flat economy, and 
the ability to respond to, and benefit from, market recovery.
With excellent customer relationships and a strong pipeline of new products Gooch 
& Housego is well-positioned to deliver sustained growth and continued margin 
improvement.

market and the desire of the customer base to “pull” Gooch & Housego up  
the value chain.
•  The Group continues to invest in longer term R&D projects. In October 2013,  
Gooch & Housego acquired Spanoptic. This acquisition strengthens the Group’s 
position in precision optics for the Life Sciences market. Whilst Gooch & Housego  
is not planning any further acquisitions in the short term, the Group is not 
discounting high quality acquisitions as a route to grow its Life Sciences business 
should the opportunity arise.

APPLICA TIONS, PRODUCTS AND MARKETS
Nuclear fusion research and energy laser technology is being used to recreate 
the conditions found in the core of the sun. At these temperatures and pressures 
isotopes of hydrogen fuse to form helium and in doing so release huge amounts  
of energy – the energy that powers the sun and stars. One of the most exciting 
potential applications of this research is using laser fusion to provide limitless 
quantities of clean, carbon-free energy to meet the world’s growing needs.  
The products supplied into this market utilise a wide range of the Company’s 
technologies including crystal growth, precision optics, thin-film coatings and fibre 
optics. Gooch & Housego supplies many of the world’s leading nuclear fusion 
energy research facilities. Gooch & Housego is sole supplier of many critical optical 
components used in the world’s most powerful laser system at the National 
Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
Instrumentation for applications in agricultural, solar, marine and industrial 
research. An example of an industrial research application is the development of 
Light Emitting Diode (LED) illumination systems. Instrumentation products are 
supplied from our Orlando facility and include photometers, radiometers, 
spectroradiometers and their associated calibration services. The customer base 
ranges from universities and research institutes to Government agencies and 
national standards laboratories.
Growth Strategy
•  To maintain and develop the business’s capabilities in crystal growth and ultra 
precision optics for nuclear fusion research and energy, University research and 
“Big Science” projects. Gooch & Housego is the custodian of some of the world’s 
most advanced optical technologies. It is not therefore surprising that there is a 
constant and significant demand for such products and technologies from some 
of the world’s foremost universities and research institutes. The products 
supplied into this market span the complete breadth of the Company’s 
technology portfolio. Many of Gooch & Housego’s current products have evolved 
from early stage collaborations with universities and it is an area the Company 
continues to focus on.
•  The Company continues to invest in R&D to develop and commercialise the next 
generation of Instrumentation products. GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REVIEW
Performance 
Overview
The business has delivered profitable growth and improving margins whilst experiencing 
variable demand patterns within our core markets. The trend towards a more evenly 
balanced business has continued, reflecting our strategy of diversification and our 
efforts to develop new opportunities in Aerospace & Defence and Life Sciences.
Following a steady first half, the second half of this financial year experienced strong 
sales into many of our market sectors. It is particularly pleasing to report sales growth 
of 16.3%, in aggregate, in our key target markets of Aerospace & Defence and Life 
Sciences. These markets now account for 38.9% of Gooch & Housego’s total revenue.
In the financial year under review, margins benefited from the greater operating 
leverage gained from increased volumes and efficiency gains made by the  
business this year. As a result adjusted operating margins have increased  
to 16.2% (2012: 14.7%).

year. Statutory profit before tax was £8.3m compared with £7.1m last year.
The effective rate of tax was 25.8% (2012: 24.8%), reflecting a combination of the 
varying tax rates applicable throughout the countries in which the Group operates, 
principally the UK and the USA. The introduction of the patent box tax rate from April 
2013 has not contributed to a lower tax rate in 2013 and will not in 2014. The effective 
rate of tax should benefit in the future from further reductions in the UK tax rate.
Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased from 28.2p to 32.0p. Basic EPS was 
27.7p compared with 24.4p last year.

NON GAAP MEASURES
The Company uses a number of non GAAP measures which are shown in the table 
above and in the segmental analysis. These measures are used to illustrate the impact of 
non-recurring and non-trading items on the Company’s financial results. These are the 
impact of the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition costs and costs 
associated with restructuring activities. In addition, the Company uses the term 
EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation). This is a 
commonly used measure of operating performance and cash flow.
SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
Industrial
Our Industrial business fell marginally during the year, with revenues of £34.3m, compared 
with £35.8m last year. Revenue from the Group’s traditional Q-switch product fell during 
the year, as anticipated, and now represents 12.2% of total group revenues. We believe 
this reflects the continuing shift towards the use of fibre lasers in materials processing 
applications. This appears to be supported by the significant increase in sales of fibre laser 
components experienced by Gooch & Housego in 2013. Telecommunications revenues 
were down in 2013 following the completion of the London Olympics, a one off benefit 
experienced in 2012 and the continuing softness in the undersea components business.
Operating profit for the Industrial sector as a whole was 6.8% higher at £7.0m, compared 
with £6.6m last year. This reflects a combination of cost-saving initiatives and a better 
performance from our Palo Alto facility , being offset to some extent by a poorer product mix.
Aerospace & Defence (A&D)
Our A&D business revenue increased by 11.9% from £15.4m to £17.3m in 2013. Despite 
a significant reduction in engineering contracts, which were affected by US Government 
sequestration issues, the business was able to deliver considerable growth in this market 
sector. This was driven through the provision of both components and systems to our UK 
and US A&D customers. Operating margins in this sector were marginally down in 
percentage terms, but increased absolutely. This reflected the combination of mix and 
volume this year.
Life Sciences
Gooch & Housego grew its presence in the Life Sciences sector in 2013 with revenues 
of £7.4m (2012: £5.7m). The growth in this market was driven by the Optical Coherence 
Tomography (OCT) and Microscopy markets. Operating margins in this sector were 
marginally down in percentage terms, but increased absolutely. This was mainly a 
reflection of the business having to absorb a larger share of Group costs.
Scientific Research
Our activities in the Scientific Research market are dominated by a small number of large, 
long-term programmes. This market saw growth in 2013 on the back of increased 
business from laser fusion projects. These programmes are now largely complete, although 
we do expect on-going business to service replacement and maintenance requirements.
RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (R&D)
Gooch & Housego continues to invest in R&D in all areas of the business and regards this 
as fundamental to the continued growth of the company. There were a large number of 
product releases in 2013 and there is an extensive new product pipeline with a number 
of new product introductions anticipated in the 2014 financial year.
Expenditure on R&D in the year to 30 September 2013 increased by 15% from £4.3m to 
£4.9m. A proportion of this increase was funded through UK Government and European 
grant funding. R&D expenditure represented 7.8% of revenue (2012: 7.0%). The Group 
capitalised £0.03m (2012: £0.01m) of R&D expenditure.

ANNUAL REPORT 2013 20
BALANCE SHEET
The Group’s shareholders’ funds at the end of the year were £64.9m, an increase 
of £6.3m over the prior year. This increase mainly comprised £1.0m due to the 
issue of share capital and £5.3m from retained earnings.
Additions to property, plant and equipment totalled £2.0m. The main fixed asset 
additions were in response to the increase in Aerospace & Defence business, 
where a further £1.0m has been invested in extending coating and precision optics 
capabilities. £0.5m has also been invested in expanding our Torquay facilities and 
equipment to accommodate the Systems Technology Group.
Working capital was 24.7% of revenue in the current year compared to 21.3% in 
2012. Inventories have increased by £0.6m from £12.8m in 2012 to £13.4m at this 
year-end. This has been driven by the necessity to hold safety stocks for our A&D 
customers. Since the half-year, the business has worked on initiatives to reduce 
inventory. This has resulted in inventory carrying values reducing by £0.8m from 
£14.2m as at 31 March 2013. Trade receivables increased from £9.2m to £10.2m 
following a strong final quarter revenue performance.
Cash balances at 30 September 2013 were £14.6m, compared with £11.7m at 30 
September 2012. Net cash flows from operating activities generated £9.2m, 
compared with £8.9m last year. During the year the business moved from a net 
debt position of £0.3m as at 30 September 2012, to a net cash position of £5.7m.

ORDER BOOK
As at 30 September 2013, the Group order book stood at £27.8m, compared to 
£24.9m at the end of the 2012 financial year, a 12% increase. On a like for like basis, 
excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the order book was 12% higher. Book to 
bill ratios for the business as a whole were 0.98 times (six month rolling average) 
as at 30 September 2013, compared to 1.01 times for the same period last year.
STAFF
The Group workforce reduced slightly from 588 at 30 September 2012 to 581 at the 
end of September 2013, a fall of 7. This is a net position and therefore reflects both 
the reductions in staffing resulting from the work the business has done in integration 
and rationalisation of sites and processes and the additional investment that the 
business has made in engineering, business development and senior management. 
During the year, the Group appointed Jon Fowler as EVP Commercial Development. 
Mr Fowler was an internal appointment having previously held a general 
management role in our US operations. Mr Fowler brings a wealth of customer 
development experience to this role.

year of 6.3p (2012: 5.2p). The final dividend will be payable on 28 February 2014 to 
shareholders on the Company’s share register as at close of business on 7 February 2014.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs)
The Group objective is to deliver sustainable, long-term growth in revenue and 
profits. This is to be achieved through the execution of the Board’s strategies of 
market diversification, the continued investment in R&D to support organic growth, 
the acquisition of strategically complementary businesses and the on-going drive to 
move up the value chain.
In striving to achieve these strategic objectives, the main financial performance 
measures monitored by the Board are:
Total revenue growth 2013 2012 2011
At actual exchange rates 4% 0% 37%
At constant exchange rates 3% (1%) 40%
The Board is focused on delivering revenue growth by investing both organically 
and through acquisitions. The Group business has delivered underlying growth,

•  Retention of key personnel – The Group recognises the importance of 
retaining and developing its highly skilled management team and workforce in 
order to achieve its strategic objectives. As a result, the Group has and continues 
to establish development and reward schemes to encourage individuals to play a 
long term role in the future development of the Group.
•  Future trading levels and order book – Gooch & Housego PLC has seen a rapid 
growth in its business in recent years. Through its strategies of market 
diversification and moving up the value chain, the Group seeks to provide routes 
to new markets and reduce the dependence on any one market sector. However, 
the continued growth in the business is difficult to predict.  
•  Financing – As at 30 September 2013, the Company was in a net cash position of 
£5.7m (2012: net debt of £0.3m). The level of debt is considered to be appropriate 
and serviceable. The Group operates within certain banking covenants which it 
has reported under and complied with during the financial year. The Group 
undertakes detailed and regular financial planning and forecasting reviews to 
minimise any financial risk due to changing market conditions.
•  Research and Development – The Group invests heavily in research and 
development, to develop new products and maintain long term growth. The 
development of new processes and products involves risks such as development 
timescales, which may take longer than originally forecast and hence involve more 
cost. There are also technical risks associated with development programmes that 
mean original expected results are not delivered. Expenditure is only capitalised 
once the commercial and technical feasibility of a product is proven. These risks are 
minimised by operating managed research and development programmes which 
are reviewed against cost and technical progress expectations.
KEY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (“KPIs”)
The Group uses a selection of KPIs to monitor and review the performance of the 
business. These are detailed from page 21 of the Financial and Operating Review. 
DIVIDENDS
During the year ended 30 September 2013 a final dividend of 4.0p per share was 
paid for the previous financial year, the final 2011 dividend of 3.0p per share was 
paid in the year ended 30 September 2012. A further interim dividend of 2.3p per 
share was paid for the half year ended 31 March 2013 (2012: 2.0p).
For the year ended 30 September 2013, the Directors propose that a final dividend 
of 4.0p per share be paid.

TREASURY POLICIES
The Group’s treasury policies are designed to manage financial risk to the Group that 
arises from operating in a number of foreign currencies and to maximise interest 
income on cash deposits, whilst maintaining the security of these deposits. As an 
international group of companies, the main exposure is in respect of foreign currency 
risk on the trading transactions undertaken by group companies and on the translation 
of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries. This exposure is principally to the US dollar.
Monthly cash management reporting and forecasting is in place to facilitate 
management of this currency risk. The operations of group treasury take place 
at head office.
All balances not immediately required for group operations are placed on short-term 
deposit with leading international highly rated financial institutions.
At a transactional level, the Group seeks to offset its exposure to foreign exchange 
movements by contracting with significant supply partners in US Dollars and 
undertakes regular financial reviews to assess whether it would be appropriate for 
the Group to enter into currency hedging contracts to mitigate the currency risk. 
During the year there were no forward contracts in place.
At a translational level, the Group has structured the majority of its borrowings in US 
Dollars, which acts as a hedge of a net investment against its US Dollar denominated 
companies within the Group.
QUALITY
The Group prides itself on the highest standards of product quality and customer 
satisfaction. In doing this, it recognises that a failure to maintain such standards 
would be detrimental to its future trading performance. As a result, an ongoing 
emphasis is placed on quality control and customer communication.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Group has a continuing commitment to a high level of research and development. 
This commitment is to actively develop new technologies and capabilities that will 
become a key part of the Group’s future product portfolio and revenues.
“
A more focused 
approach to R&D 
has paid dividends 
in 2013, with a 
significant number 
of new products 
being brought  
to market.” GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2013 29
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES
The Directors have the benefit of an indemnity which is a qualifying third party 
indemnity provision as defined by Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006. The 
indemnity was in force throughout the last financial year and is currently in force. 
The Company also purchased and maintained throughout the financial year 
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance in respect of itself and its Directors.
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT
The Group is committed to including all employees in the performance and 
development of the business. An established employee appraisal and reward 
scheme is in operation and employees are appraised regularly with relevant 
development support provided by the Group.
The Group attaches considerable importance to informing and involving its 
employees on matters which concern them and in the achievement of its business 
objectives. The Group has a formal employee communication plan involving regular 
meetings between management and employees and the provision of a 
comprehensive employee handbook.
EMPLOYMENT OF DISABLED INDIVIDUALS
The Group is committed to employment policies, which follow best practice, based on 
equal opportunities for all employees, irrespective of sex, race, colour, disability or 
marital status. Full and fair consideration is given to applications for employment from 
disabled persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Employees 
who become disabled during their working life will be retained in employment 
wherever possible and will be provided help with any necessary rehabilitation and 
retraining. The Group is prepared to modify procedures or equipment, wherever 
this is practicable, so that full use can be made of an individual’s abilities.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board recognises the importance of good corporate governance and has put in 
place procedures it considers appropriate.  
The Board currently comprises three Executive and four Non-Executive Directors. 
The directors holding office during the period of this report and their biographies 
are detailed from page 24 and are also available on our website;  
www.goochandhousego.com
The Board focuses on formulation of strategy, management of effective business 
controls and review of business performance. The Board is specifically responsible 
for the approval of annual and interim results and interim management 
statements, acquisitions and disposals, major capital expenditure, borrowings, 
director and company secretary appointments and removals, any material 
litigation, strategic forecasting and major development projects.
A framework of delegated authorities is in place that details the structure of 
delegation below Board level and includes matters reserved to the Board.
All the Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Board to be independent in 
character and judgement.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association all directors will retire at 
the Annual General Meeting and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
The Board has three formally constituted committees, the Audit committee, the 
Remuneration committee and the Nomination committee.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the Group’s system  
of internal financial control. The system can provide only reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatements and losses.
There are defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authorities. There  
are also internal financial controls in existence which are centrally maintained  
and documented and provide reasonable assurance of the maintenance of  
proper accounting records and the reliability of financial information used within 
the business.
The Group does not have an internal audit department, but senior finance staff 
perform a formal, annual review of all the sites’ internal controls.
Annual budgets are prepared for each company. Financial and operational reports 
enable the Board to compare performance against budget and to take action 
where appropriate.
During the year the Group continued to develop its risk management policy, which 
is reviewed on a regular basis. Gooch & Housego has also developed and published 
its policies in relation to the Bribery Act and fraud.
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
The policy of the Group is to meet the statutory environmental requirements 
placed upon it and to apply good environmental practice in its operations while 
recognising that it is contractually obliged to meet its customer requirements.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union, and the parent company financial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law 
the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the 
company and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the group and parent company financial statements 
respectively;
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business. GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2013 31
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and 
the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s and Group’s auditors are unaware. Each Director has taken all the steps 
that he ought to have taken in his duty as a Director to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s and Group’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
GOING CONCERN
Based on Management’s operating projections and cash flow forecasts, the Directors 
believe that the Group will generate sufficient cash and have access to working 
capital facilities to enable it to meet its funding requirements for at least the next  
12 months and comply with its banking covenants. 
Accordingly, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the 
financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the Company 
and the Group will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

ANNUAL REPORT 2013 32
The Audit Committee, which consists of all four non-executive Directors, is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group

and the Chief Executive Officer. There were no material changes in the reporting standards that affect our financial statements in 2013.
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE
•  Monitors the integrity of the Company’s financial statements and 
reviews significant financial reporting judgements.
•  Reviews the effectiveness of financial and regulatory compliance 
controls and systems.
•  Oversees the relationship with the external auditors including 
agreeing their fee, scope of any non-audit services and fee and 
assessing their independence and effectiveness.
AREAS OF FOCUS FOR THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
• Financial reporting at the half year and full year
•  External audit, including meeting with the auditors at the planning 
and completion stages of their work for both the half and full year
• Governance
• Code of Conduct, including our Whistle Blower Policy

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT
INTRODUCTION
It is an objective of the Group to attract and retain Directors of high calibre and reward them in a way which encourages the creation of 
value for shareholders. The Committee undertakes the determination of executive Directors’ annual remuneration packages and these are 
reviewed with effect from 1 October each year. No executive Director plays a part in the discussion about their remuneration.
Although not a member of the committee, Gareth Jones submits a report and is usually requested to present the report to the committee. 
After presenting the report he withdraws from the meeting and does not participate in the decision making or voting processes. 
Executive Directors are paid a basic salary together with annual bonus payments based on the achievement of Group profitability targets.  
In addition, executive Directors participate in a share option scheme and receive benefits in kind, including medical expenses and insurance. 
Non-executive directors are paid a fee to attend board meetings and to serve as members of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
committees. Further payments may be made in respect of additional services provided at the request of the Company.

2013 PERFORMANCE
Gooch & Housego has continued to perform well in 2013, delivering strong financial performance and continuing to make progress in its key 
strategic goals of diversification and moving up the value chain.
In terms of financial performance, net profit margin improved from 13.5% to 15.3%. Once again a strong cash performance resulted in the 
Group reporting a significant net cash position for the first time since 2008. The increasing strength of the balance sheet meant that the 
Company was able to recommend a 21% increase in the total dividend for the year.
At an operational level, the business has achieved an unprecedented level of diversification in 2013, with 39% of the business now being 
generated from the new markets of Aerospace & Defence and Life Sciences. The establishment of the Systems Technology Group is a 
progressive step in helping move the business up the value chain.
2013 bonus outcomes were 40.5% of maximum, reflecting the challenging targets set by the Remuneration Committee.
SHAREHOLDER CONSUL TATION
Following consultation with major shareholders in early 2013, the Long Term Incentive Plan (L TIP) was approved by the Committee and 
awards made on 9 April 2013.
During the consultation, we took into consideration all comments received, and I am very grateful for the constructive and helpful feedback. 
This feedback helped to shape the L TIP into a scheme that will both support the underlying objectives and provide shareholders with the 
comfort that their views are taken account of in the design of the L TIP .
2013 PROPOSALS
Gooch & Housego’s objective is to set salaries for its Directors within a mid-market range and also uses variable remuneration mechanisms to 
ensure that individuals only receive substantial remuneration for exceptional performance.
We continue to review the remuneration framework to ensure that it is appropriate to attract and retain executives of the right calibre. To 
this end the Committee has commissioned an independent review of Director benefits and bonus schemes. This review is ongoing with 
conclusions expected before the 2014 year end.
The committee values all feedback from shareholders and hopes to receive your support at the forthcoming AGM.

* For 2013 the values for Share Options in the above table are based upon the vesting of awards under the Value Creation Plan (VCP) 
introduced in 2010 as this was the only scheme to meet its performance criteria during the period. Share options from the 2004 and 2005 
schemes were exercised during the year by Directors but these had met their performance criteria before 2012. Details of these are shown 
later in this report.
The basic pay of the Chief Executive Officer did not increase in the year, this compares to an increase of 4% for the Company as a whole.
DIRECTORS’ PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
During the year the Company contributed to a money purchase pension scheme on behalf of the executive Directors. The number of Directors 
who are accruing benefits under a pension scheme is 3 (2012: 3). Contributions to a scheme on behalf of continuing Directors amount to 8% of the 
Director’s basic salary.
DIRECTORS’ CONTRACTS
The Executive Directors have rolling service contracts that are subject to six months’ notice. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do

SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
At 30 September 2013 Gooch & Housego had three active share based incentive schemes. These are detailed below:
GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC 2004 COMPANY SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The Gooch & Housego PLC 2004 Company Share Option Scheme (the “2004 Scheme”) had two grants of share options, on 23 July 2004, and on 
8 December 2005. These share option awards were to three executive Directors and four senior employees. No further awards have been made 
under the 2004 Scheme.
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
The directors’ share options were subject to the achievement of certain financial performance criteria, all of which have now been met. All 
Directors’ options under the 2004 scheme have been exercised.
Senior employees’ share options also have performance criteria attached and can only be exercised if these conditions are met. Details of the 
performance criteria are given in Note 27 of the financial statements.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT
GOOCH & HOUSEGO 2010 VALUE CREATION PLAN
On 7 January 2010, the Company introduced a Value Creation Plan (the “2010 VCP”) as a replacement to the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan 
(the “2007 L TIP”). The 2010 VCP has become the primary equity incentive vehicle to retain and incentivise key employees in the company and 
align their interests with those of shareholders.
Under the 2010 VCP , key employees were granted a one-off award of units from an agreed total. These units had no intrinsic value on grant 
but gave participants an opportunity to be awarded Company shares proportionate to the value created for shareholders above the threshold 
value at the third anniversary of the plan.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, on the third anniversary, being 7 January 2013, value created during the life of the plan, over and 
above a pre-determined threshold value based on a share price of £2.00, has been calculated. A share of that value (approximately 12%) will 
be distributed amongst the participating members of senior management of the Group in the form of nil-cost share options (UK participants) 
and share awards (US participants). Half of the awards made are exercisable immediately and the balance after twelve months, subject to 
certain conditions.
Executive Directors’ share options are listed below:

GOOCH & HOUSEGO 2013 LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
On 9 April 2013, a new Long Term Incentive Plan was adopted. Under the plan, awards will be made annually to key employees based on a 
percentage of salary. Subject to the satisfaction of the required TSR performance criteria and EPS financial performance, these grants will 
vest upon publication of the results of the Company for the year ending 30 September 2015.
On 9 April 2013, awards were made under the 2013 L TIP new plan to a number of key employees, including the three executive Directors of 
the Company. Aggregate awards made to Directors of the Group were as follows:
G C W Jones 56,876 Nil-cost share options
T Scribbins 36,985 Nil-cost share options
A N Boteler 35,076 Nil-cost share options
During the year to 30 September 2013, £340,749 (2012: £471,000) was charged to the income statement in respect of the IFRS 2 share 
based payments charge on all share option schemes (valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model) and £340,000 (2012: £370,000) in 
respect of accrued employer’s national insurance contributions, based on a year end share price of £5.55 (2012: £4.35).

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT to the Members of Gooch & Housego PLC
We have audited the group financial statements of Gooch & Housego 
Plc for the year ended 30 September 2013 which comprise the Group 
Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Cash Flow Statement, the Group 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 30, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. 
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report 
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In our opinion the group financial statements: 
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at  
30 September 2013 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union; and 
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTER PRESCRIBED  
BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the group financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the group financial 
statements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED  
TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
OTHER MATTER
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Gooch & Housego Plc for the year ended 30 
September 2013.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 September 2013
1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Gooch & Housego PLC (the ”Company”) is incorporated and domiciled 
in the United Kingdom. The Company is listed on the Alternative 
Investment Market (“ AIM Market”) of the London Stock Exchange. The 
address of the registered office of the Company is given on page 1.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 
30 September 2013 comprise the Company, Gooch & Housego PLC, 
and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). A listing of 
the Company’s major subsidiaries is set out on page 65.
The Group is a manufacturer of specialist optoelectronic components, 
materials and systems and specialist instrumentation and life 
sciences devices. The Group has facilities in the United Kingdom, 
Germany and the United States.
2 BASIS OF PREPARATION
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention as modified by financial assets and financial liabilities 
(including derivative instruments) at fair value and in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (“IFRS”) and IFRIC Interpretations in issue at 30 
September 2013, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies preparing financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS.  
3 APPLICATION OF IFRS
Adoption of new standards
During the current reporting period there were no new standards or 
amendments which had a material impact on the net assets of the Group.
In addition, standards or amendments issued but not yet effective 
are not expected to have a material impact on the net assets of the 
Group. However, the Group is closely monitoring the IASB projects on 
contract revenue recognition and the lease accounting overhaul as 
they could potentially have a material impact on the Group’s results.
4 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of  
the financial statements are set out below. The policies have  
been consistently applied to all of the years presented, unless  
otherwise stated.
Consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the 
Group. Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that 
are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the 
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of a business 
combination is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity 
instruments issued, the fair value of contingent or deferred 
consideration and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of 
exchange. Costs directly attributable to the business combination are 
charged to the income statement. The excess of the costs of a 
business combination over the fair value of the identifiable net assets 
acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of a business combination 
is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, 
the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. Should 
the fair value of contingent or deferred consideration vary from the 
actual value on settlement date, the difference is recognised directly 
in the income statement.
T ransactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between 
Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated 
but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. 
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary 
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Segment reporting
A business segment is a grouping of operations engaged in providing 
products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are 
different from those of other business segments. A market segment is 
engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic 
environment that are subject to risks and returns which are different 
from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
The chief operating decision maker in determining a business or 
operating segment is the Board of Directors.
Foreign currency translation
a.  Functional and presentational currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds 
Sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency. Items included 
in the financial statements of each of the Group’s subsidiaries are 
measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”).
b.  Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into an entity’s functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at balance 
sheet exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except 
when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and 
qualifying net investment hedges.
c.  Subsidiaries
The results and financial position of subsidiaries that have a 
functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
•  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are 
translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
•  income and expenses for each income statement are translated at 
average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on 
the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are 
translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
•  all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of 
the net investment in foreign operations, and of borrowings and other 
currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are 
taken to shareholders’ equity. When a foreign operation is partially 
disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity 
are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a 
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less 
depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the items. GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2013 45
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 September 2013
No depreciation is charged on freehold land or capital work in 
progress. Certain plant used in the manufacturing process which is 
constructed from precious metals is not depreciated.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated to allocate their cost over 
their estimated useful lives, as follows:
• Freehold buildings         2-3% Straight line
• Leasehold property over term of lease Straight line
• Plant and machinery  10-20% Straight line
•  Fixtures, fittings and  
computers 10-33% Straight line
• Motor vehicles 25% Reducing balance
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted 
if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. Where an asset’s carrying 
amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, the asset’s 
carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair 
value less costs to sell or an asset’s value in use.
Intangible assets
a.  Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination 
over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired 
business. Goodwill arising from business combinations is included in 
‘intangible assets’. 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. The impairment testing requires an 
estimation of the ‘value in use’ of the Cash-generating unit (the “CGU”) 
to which goodwill is allocated using appropriately discounted cash 
flow projections. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an 
expense to the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing a CGU is defined as either a 
business segment or an operating entity, as appropriate. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying 
amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
b.  Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
Internally incurred costs associated with the filing and perfection of 
patents and trademarks are capitalised and carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight 
line method to allocate the cost over their useful economic lives and 
are charged to Research and Development in the income statement.
Acquired patents, trademarks and licences are shown at historical 
cost. Patents, trademarks and licences have a finite useful life and 
are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is 
calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost over 
their useful economic lives.
c.  Computer software
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software 
programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Costs that are directly associated with the development of identifiable 
and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will 
probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, 
are capitalised and recognised as intangible assets. Costs include the 
software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of 
relevant overheads. 
Acquired computer software and licences are capitalised on the basis 
of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Capitalised software costs are amortised using the straight line 
method over their estimated useful lives of up to 5 years and charged 
to Administration in the income statement.
d.  Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of 
gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is 
recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs incurred after the point at which the commercial and 
technical feasibility of the product have been proven, and the decision 
to complete the development has been taken and resources made 
available, are capitalised. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost 
of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. Development costs are amortised 
using the straight line method over their estimated useful life lives, 
which is typically 7 years, and are charged to Research and Development 
in the income statement.
e.  Acquired intangibles
Other acquired intangible assets are stated at fair value less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
The useful life of each of these assets is assessed based on the 
differing natures of each of the intangible assets acquired. 
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful life of the assets acquired and charge to administration in the 
Income Statement.
• Customer relationships  up to 3 years
• Brand names  up to 3 years
• Acquired patents, trademarks and licences  up to 3 years
Government grants
Government grants are accounted for on an accruals basis. Grants are 
credited to the income statement over the life of the project. Where 
grants are used to fund the acquisition of property , plant and equipment, 
the grant is initially credited to deferred income then credited to the 
income statement over the estimated economic life of the asset.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether an asset may 
be impaired. If any such indicator exists, the Group tests for impairment 
by estimating the recoverable amount which is the higher of the value 
in use and the fair value less costs to sell. If the recoverable amount is 
less than the carrying value of the asset, the asset is impaired and the 
carrying value is reduced to its recoverable amount. In addition to this, 
assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually. 
Non-financial assets other than goodwill which have suffered an 
impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at 
each balance sheet date. 
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except those with maturities 
greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date. These are 
classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are classified 
as trade and other receivables in the balance sheet. GOOCH & HOUSEGO PL C
ANNUAL REPORT 2013 46
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 September 2013
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost and net 
realisable value. The cost of finished goods and work in progress 
comprises design costs, raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs 
and related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). 
It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated 
selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable 
variable selling expenses.
Long term contract balances included in work in progress comprise costs 
incurred on long term contracts, net of any amounts transferred to 
trading expenditure, after deducting foreseeable losses and related 
payments on account. Costs include all direct material and labour costs 
incurred in bringing a contract to its state of completion at the year end. 
Provisions for estimated losses on contracts are made in the period in 
which such losses are foreseen. Long term contract balances do not 
include attributable profit. The amount by which customer billings exceed 
the revenue recognised on a contract is shown as a payment on account.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment. 
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when 
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. 
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the 
debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default 
or delinquency in payments (more than 30 days overdue) are 
considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired. 
The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, 
discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount 
of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and 
the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within 
‘Administration costs’. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is 
written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited 
against ‘Administration costs’ in the income statement. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement 
includes cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks with original 
maturities of three months or less, and the drawn down balance of 
the $8m Revolving Credit Facility. The drawn down balance of the 
$8m Revolving Credit Facility is shown within borrowings in current 
liabilities in the balance sheet.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 
incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the 
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the 
period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset the borrowing costs 
are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.
Borrowing costs are classified as current liabilities unless the Group 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at 
least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date 
that a contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at 
their fair value. The Group documents the relationship between the 
hedging instrument and the hedged item and, on a periodic basis, 
assesses whether the hedge is effective.
The fair value of the financial instrument used for hedging purposes 
is disclosed in Note 30. Movements on the hedging reserve in 
shareholders’ equity is disclosed in Note 26.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that 
are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity.
Taxation
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and 
deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the 
year using rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and any 
adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on 
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial 
statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for, if 
it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
other than a business combination that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. 
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that 
have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax 
asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax is recognised in the income statement except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income and equity, in which case it is recognised in 
other comprehensive income and equity.
In the UK and US, the Company is entitled to a tax deduction for amounts 
treated as compensation on exercise of certain employee share options 
under each jurisdiction’s tax rules. As explained under “Share options” 
below, a compensation expense is recorded in the Company’s income 
statement over the period from the grant date to the vesting date of the 
relevant options. As there is a temporary difference between the 
accounting and tax bases, a deferred income tax asset is recorded. 
The deferred income tax asset arising is calculated by comparing the 
estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future 
(based on the Company’s share price at the balance sheet date) with 
the cumulative amount of the compensation recorded in the income  GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2013 47
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 September 2013
statement. If the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds 
the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory 
rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity.
Employee benefits
a. Pension obligations
The Group operates money purchase pension schemes for UK 
employees and Section 401(k) plans for US employees. The Group pays 
contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance 
plans on a mandatory , contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no 
further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. 
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense in 
the income statement when they are due. Prepaid contributions are 
recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction 
in the future payments is available.
b.  Profit share and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and 
profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the 
profit attributable to the Group’s shareholders after certain adjustments. 
The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where 
there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
c.  Share options
The Group operates a number of share option schemes. In accordance 
with IFRS 2 the fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense in 
the income statement. The total amount to be expensed over the 
vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the 
options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability targets). Non-market vesting 
conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 
that are expected to vest. 
Employer’s National Insurance in the United Kingdom and equivalent 
taxes in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise of certain share 
options. In accordance with IFRS 2, this is treated as a cash-settled 
transaction. A provision is made, calculated using the fair value of the 
Company’s shares at the balance sheet date, pro-rated over the 
vesting period of the options.  
At each balance sheet date, for awards with non market vesting 
conditions, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options 
that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to 
original estimates, if any , in the income statement, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity. The fair value of the options under the 2004 
Gooch & Housego PLC Company Share Option Scheme was determined 
by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the 
options under the Gooch & Housego 2010 Value Creation Plan and 
the Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan were 
determined by using the Monte Carlo option pricing model.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction 
costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and 
the amount has been reliably estimated.
The Group monitors and assesses its warranty provision requirement 
on a continuing basis. The provision for other liabilities and charges 
provides for the anticipated cost of repair and rectification of products 
under warranty, based on historical repair and replacement costs. In 
addition the Directors will also assess expected changes in future 
costs based on current information.
Leases
Leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of an asset are treated as a finance lease. Assets held under 
a finance lease are capitalised at their fair value at the inception of the 
lease and depreciated over the estimated useful economic life of the 
asset or lease term if shorter.
Finance charges are associated with the finance lease are expensed 
in proportion to the capital amount outstanding.
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease 
rentals are expensed in equal annual amounts over the lease term.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or 
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of 
the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, 
rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be 
reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will 
flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each 
of the Group’s activities as described below. The amount of revenue 
is not considered to be reliably measurable until all contingencies 
relating to the sale have been resolved.
a.  Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of the underlying 
sale have been transferred to the customer, and when collectability 
of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Depending on the 
terms of business, this occurs either on the dispatch/delivery of the 
goods supplied or on acceptance by the customer.
b.  Long-term contracts
Two companies within the Group (Gooch & Housego (Ohio) and EM4) 
have a number of long term contracts in place. Revenue is recognised on 
these by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity 
at the balance sheet date. Revenue and profits are determined by 
estimating the outcome of the contract and determining the costs 
and profit attributable to the stage of completion.
Where the outcome of the contract cannot be reliably estimated, 
contract costs are recognised as an expense when incurred and 
revenue is recognised to the extent of the costs incurred that are 
expected to be recoverable. In both cases, any expected contract loss 
is recognised immediately.
Revenue from long term contracts recognised in the year ended 30 
September 2013 was £2,272,000 (2012: £3,667,000)
c.  Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the 
effective interest method. GOOCH & HOUSEGO PL C
ANNUAL REPORT 2013 48
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 September 2013
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised 
as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in 
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
5 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk management
Management considers capital as equity, as shown in the Group 
balance sheet, excluding net debt.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the 
Group’s ability 
• to continue as a going concern, 
•  to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders and 
• to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Board is satisfied that these objectives have been met during 
the year. Actions taken during the year to achieve these objectives 
are outlined in the Chief Executive’s Review.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may
• adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders,
• return capital to shareholders,
• issue new shares,
• sell assets to reduce debt and
• vary the level of debt financing.
While the Group’s debt to equity ratio is consistently monitored, 
changes in the Group’s need for capital and the selection of the source 
and funding of capital are assessed against a number of criteria 
which may have a direct effect on the Group debt to equity ratio. 
The Group’s capital needs include, but are not solely limited to, its
•  investment in non-current assets;
•  investment in working capital; and
•  acquisition of businesses, technologies and other intangible assets.
 
The criteria against which the Group’s capital needs are assessed 
include, but are not limited to, 
•  availability of and cost of debt financing;
•  ability to raise equity financing at an acceptable share price; and
•  ratio of debt to equity. 
Financial risks
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market 
risk (including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the 
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Where considered 
appropriate, the Company will use derivative financial instruments 
to hedge risk exposures during the year.
i. Market risk
a. Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign 
exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily 
with respect to the US Dollar.
Foreign exchange risk arises from 
• future commercial transactions;
• recognised assets and liabilities; and
• net investments in foreign operations.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net 
assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. 
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign 
operations is managed primarily through borrowings denominated 
in the relevant foreign currencies. 
No financial derivatives have been entered into to manage foreign 
exchange exposure.
As a significant amount of the Group’s profit is earned by its US 
subsidiaries, the Group’s profit is sensitive to movements in the US 
Dollar exchange rate. If the average US Dollar exchange rate for the 
year had been consistent with the closing exchange rate at 30 
September 2012, with all other variables constant, post tax profits 
for the year would have been £69,000 lower (2012: £25,000 
higher) as a result of the translation in US Dollars.  
Equity is more sensitive to movement in the US Dollar exchange rate as 
a significant amount of the Group’s net assets are held in the Group’s 
US subsidiaries. If the US Dollar weakened by 10% against Pound 
Sterling with all other variables held constant, the net assets of the 
Group would be £3,234,000 lower (2012: £3,099,000 lower). If the US 
Dollar strengthened by 10% against Pound Sterling with all other 
variables held constant, the net assets of the Group would be 
£3,952,000 higher (2012: £3,787,000 higher).
b. Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group has cash balances of £14.6m which are held in interest 
bearing current accounts. The Group’s income and operating cash flows 
are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from its long term borrowings 
and revolving credit facility. A 1% increase in the cost of borrowing 
would have resulted in an annualised increase in interest expense of 
£43,000 (2012: £38,000) had the Group’s borrowings been in place 
throughout the year.
Borrowings issued at variable interest rates expose the Group to cash 
flow interest rate risk. The Group uses an interest rate swap to hedge 
a proportion of the interest rate risk. During 2012 and 2013, the 
Group’s borrowings at variable interest rates were denominated in 
Pound Sterling and US Dollars as detailed in Note 22.
ii. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or 
counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. It arises principally from the Group’s trade receivables.
a. Trade and other receivables
The management of credit risk exposure is the responsibility of each 
business unit which has credit policies in place to mitigate the risk. The 
credit policies seek to verify a customer’s credit worthiness prior to 
trading and maintain the level of trading within agreed credit limits. 
Changes to credit limits require authorisation in accordance with 
internal control policies.
The Group is exposed to concentration of credit risk. The Group’s top 
ten customers in 2013 accounted for 33% of the Group’s revenue 
(2012: 32%). No individual customer made up more than 6% of 
revenue (2012: 6%).
The Group’s trade receivables are analysed in note 19. GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2013 49
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 September 2013
b. Cash
Cash is held in current and deposit accounts with financial 
institutions which have credit ratings of A- or greater, except for one 
subsidiary which held cash in a bank rated BBB at the year end, but 
which has now been closed.
iii. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its 
financial obligations as they fall due. The Group aims to achieve a 
balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost effective 
borrowing structure.
The Company’s facilities comprise an $18 million US Dollar denominated 
term loan of which $6.8m is outstanding (2012: $11.3m), a £3.1 
million Sterling denominated term loan of which £2.0m is still 
outstanding (2012: £2.4m), an $8 million revolving credit facility (drawn 
to $4 million at both 30 September 2013 and 30 September 2012) and 
at 30 September 2013 an undrawn capital expenditure facility of $8 
million, which was subsequently fully drawn down on 9 October 2013. 
These are analysed in Notes 22 and 29. All facilities are committed 
until April 2015, subject to certain covenant provisions.
The Group aims to ensure that there are sufficient funds or credit 
lines available to supplement cash flows generated from trading to 
meet known obligations in the next twelve months.
6 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) requires the 
Directors to make critical accounting estimates and judgments that 
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and 
accompanying notes. These estimates and judgments are 
continually evaluated and are based on historical experiences and 
other factors, including expectations of future events that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting 
accounting estimates will on occasions fail to equal actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have significant risk of causing 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below.
 
Going Concern
The Directors are required to make an assessment of the Group’s ability 
to continue to trade as a going concern. In making this assessment the 
Directors make critical estimates and judgements in respect of expected 
future revenues, costs, investment requirements and debt servicing 
obligations. The Directors have given this matter due consideration and 
have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group financial 
statements on a going concern basis. The two main considerations 
were as follows:
•  Group cash flow – During the year ended 30 September 2013, the 
Group was highly cash generative due to a strong trading 
performance. The Group expects to continue generating cash from 
operating activities.
•  Bank Facilities – The Group maintains a regular and ongoing 
constructive dialogue with its bankers and keeps them advised of 
Group developments and progress against its business plan. The 
Royal Bank of Scotland plc has committed significant facilities to 
the Group which are available through April 2015. 
 
At 30 September 2013, the Group had available cash resources, 
based on translating the revolving credit facility at the closing 
exchange rate for the US Dollar to Pound Sterling, of £17.0m 
(2012: £14.2m). 
Revenue recognition
Revenue from long term contracts is recognised on a percentage-of-
completion method basis. Use of this method requires an estimation 
of the total project resource requirement and also an estimation of 
the cost to complete and the assessment of potential losses on 
uncompleted contracts.
Provisions for income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. 
Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide 
provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and 
calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities 
for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether 
additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these 
matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, 
such differences will impact the income tax and deferred income tax 
provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group tests goodwill for impairment at least annually. This 
requires an estimation of the value in use of the Cash Generating 
Units (the “CGUs”) to which goodwill is allocated. As set out in Note 
17, estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an 
estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGUs and also 
to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present 
values of those cash flows.
Provision for impairment of trade receivables
The Group assesses trade receivables for impairment which requires 
an estimation of the likelihood of payment forfeiture by customers. 
In making this assessment, the Directors will consider the payment 
history of the customer as well as the customer’s future viability.
Inventory provision
The Group continually monitors and assesses the provision for old and 
slow moving inventory. Factors considered by the Directors include 
the expected future usage and the potential obsolescence and 
deterioration of the Inventory.
Warranty provision
The Group monitors and assesses its warranty provision requirement 
on a continuing basis. In addition to considering historical repair and 
replacement costs, the Directors will also assess expected changes 
in future costs based on current information.
 
Share options
In accordance with IFRS 2, share options are measured at fair value at 
the date of grant. The fair value determined is then expensed in the 
Group income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting 
period, with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of the 
options under the 2004 Gooch & Housego PLC Company Share Option 
Scheme was measured by using the Black-Scholes option pricing 
model. The fair value of the options under the Gooch & Housego 
2010 Value Creation Plan and the 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan  
was measured by using the Monte Carlo option pricing model. The 
valuation of share options requires several judgements to be made 
in respect of the number of options that are expected to be 
exercised. Details of the assumptions included in the valuation of 
options are disclosed in Note 27. GOOCH & HOUSEGO PL C

Factors affecting the future tax charge
Overseas tax losses of £2.2m (2012: £1.8 m) and UK tax losses of £1.0m (2012: £0.9m) are available to offset against future profits of the 
Group. The utilisation of these losses is not sufficiently certain to recognise a deferred tax asset.
The changes to the main rate of corporation tax for UK companies announced in the March 2013 Budget were substantively enacted for 
financial reporting purposes on 2 July 2013. The main changes in corporation tax rates, that will have accounting implications for deferred tax, 
are as follows: 
• The main rate of corporation tax will reduce from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014. 
• The main rate of corporation tax will further reduce to 20% from 1 April 2015.
The majority of the deferred tax assets and liabilities is either located outside the UK or expected to be realised or settled after 1 April 2015. 
Accordingly, the deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to the UK companies have been recognised at 20% resulting in a decrease in 
the Group’s net deferred tax asset and a charge to the income statement of £43,000 (2012: £54,000). GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC

Goodwill is allocated according to each operating entity as follows: Cleveland (£2.1m), Melbourne (£1.8m), Norderstedt (£0.1m), Ilminster 
(£0.6m), New Jersey (£0.6m), Torquay (£1.3m), Moorpark (£5.1m) and Boston (£5.8m). 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The impairment testing requires an 
estimation of the ‘value in use’ of the CGU. The value in use calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on the latest projections 
approved by the Board for year one. For the purposes of the impairment review, the following key assumptions were made in respect of the 
cash flows beyond year one:
• 42% Projected gross profit margin
• 5% Average growth in EBITDA to 2019, 3% thereafter
• 10.6% pre-tax discount rate used to discount cashflows
The projected gross profit margin and average growth is based on past performance and the Directors’ expectations for the foreseeable 
future. Based on this calculation of the value in use, no impairment of goodwill has arisen during the year ended 30 September 2013.
The Boston cash generating unit made a small loss during the year ended 30 September 2013. However, the business continues to 
contribute to the Group’s Space Photonics activities and management expect activity levels to increase. Consequently, the impairment 
calculation for the Boston cash generating unit utilises a specific set of growth assumptions based on forecast revenue streams resulting in 
an average annual forecast EBITDA of £720,000 in the period to 30 September 2018. The headroom on the impairment calculation (of 
£693,000), would be reduced to zero if the average annual EBITDA were to reduce to £550,000.
Whilst the directors are confident that no impairment is necessary at 30 September 2013, should the forecast results not be met an 
impairment may become necessary. GOOCH & HOUSEGO PL C

Overseas tax losses of £2.2m (2012: £1.8m) and UK tax losses of £1.0m (2012: £0.9m) are available to offset against future profits of the 
Group. The Group has not recognised a deferred income tax asset of £0.9m (2012: £0.6m) in respect of these losses due to uncertainty as to 
whether they would be utilised within the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax has been provided in relation to unremitted earnings from overseas subsidiaries on the basis that no incremental tax charge 
is currently anticipated to arise upon remittance of these earnings to the UK.

27 SHARE OPTIONS
The Company operates the Gooch & Housego PLC 2004 Company Share Option Scheme (the “2004 Scheme”), the Gooch & Housego 2010 Value 
Creation Plan (the “2010 VCP”) and the Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2013 L TIP”).
The Gooch & Housego PLC 2004 Company Share Option Scheme
The Company has ceased granting share options under the 2004 Scheme. Options under this scheme were granted at market price on the 
date of grant with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of the grant. The contractual life of 
an option is 10 years and is subject to continued employment.
At 30 September 2013, one senior employee within the Group has 39,281 share options outstanding relating to the 2004 Scheme. These 
options were subject to specific performance criteria, namely that their subsidiary audited pre-tax profits for the relevant year were at least 
US$500,000 and the subsidiary pre-tax profits were not less than 95% of the agreed budget. It is unlikely these criteria will be fulfilled and 
the options expire in July 2014. The remuneration report details the executive Directors’ share options and the performance criteria which are 
needed to be met for them to exercise their options. 
The options under the 2004 Scheme were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value per option and the assumptions 
used in the calculations are as follows:
Grant date      8 Dec 2005 23 Jul 2004
Share price at grant date      272.5p 133.5p
Exercise price      272.5p 133.5p
Number of employees      2 5
Shares under option      250,000 1,313,275
Vesting period (years)      1-4 1-4
Expected volatility      38.1% 56.7%
Option life (years)      10 10
Expected life (years)      5.5 5.5
Risk free rate      4.23% 4.99%
Expected dividends expressed as dividend yield     1.49% 1.49%
Fair value per option      98.4p 66.1p
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three 
years. The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government 
bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The Gooch & Housego 2010 Value Creation Plan
Under the 2010 VCP , key employees were granted a one-off award of units from an agreed total. Three executive Directors were awarded 44 
units out of the total pool of 64 units and eight key employees hold the remaining 20 units. These units had no intrinsic value on grant but 
gave participants an opportunity to be awarded Company shares proportionate to the value created for shareholders above the threshold 
value at the third anniversary of the plan.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, on the third anniversary, being 7 January 2013 value created during the life of the plan, over and above 
a pre-determined threshold value based on a share price of £2.00, was calculated. A share of that value (approximately 12%) was distributed 
amongst the participating members of senior management of the Group in the form of nil-cost share options (UK participants) and share awards 
(US participants). Half of the awards made were exercisable immediately and the balance after twelve months, subject to certain conditions.
Details of the award are as follows:-
Total number of market value (151p) Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) share options awarded:   158,936
Total number of nil-cost share options and share awarded:      1,380,566
Out of the total options, the executive Directors’ were awarded 59,601 CSOP share options and 981,339 Nil-cost share options. The remuneration 
report provides further details on the share options awarded and exercised during the financial year. 
The 2010 VCP award was valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model. The expected volatility of 73.5% used in the model was based 
on the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the three years prior to 7 January 2010. The risk free rate of 2.1% was used. The 
total fair value of all the units granted to the participants in the 2010 VCP was £1,614,640.  GOOCH & HOUSEGO PL C

The Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan
On 9 April 2013 a new Long Term Incentive Plan was adopted. Under the plan, awards will be made annually to key employees based on a 
percentage of salary. Subject to the satisfaction of the required TSR performance criteria and EPS financial performance, these grants will 
vest upon publication of the results of the Company for the year ending 30 September 2015.
On 9 April 2013, 178,960 options were awarded under the 2013 L TIP plan to a number of key employees, including the three executive Directors 
of the Company. The remuneration report provides further details on the share options awarded and exercised during the financial year.
The 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan award was valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model. The expected volatility of 43% used in the 
model was based on the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the three years prior to 9 April 2013. The risk free rate of 2.7% 
was used. The total fair value of the award on 9 April 2013 was £429,795.

presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the annual report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently

knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

ANNUAL REPORT 2013 64
NOTES TO THE COMPANY BALANCE SHEET for the year ended 30 September 2013
1 COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of 
certain fixed assets and have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and the Companies Act 2006.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied over the period reported.
Pension schemes
The Company operates a money purchase pension scheme for Directors and staff. The assets of the scheme are held in separately administered 
funds. The pension charge represents contributions payable to the funds during the year. Expenses under the plan are charged to the profit and 
loss account as incurred.
Share options
The Company operates the Gooch & Housego PLC 2004 Company Share Option Scheme (the “2004 Scheme”), the Gooch & Housego 2010 Value 
Creation Plan (the “2010 VCP”) and the Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2013 L TIP).
These plans are subject to both market and non-market related vesting conditions. Option grants are measured at fair value which is then 
charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual 
forfeiture during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions. The fair value is 
determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the Gooch & Housego PLC 2004 Share Option Scheme and the Monte Carlo 
option pricing model for the Gooch & Housego 2010 Value Creation Plan, and the Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the group is treated as a 
capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the 
vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange 
differences which arise on the settlement of transactions and on the translation of other monetary assets and liabilities are dealt with in the 
profit and loss account.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historic purchase cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset 
and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost 
or valuation of the fixed assets, over their useful lives, at the following annual rates:
Freehold buildings  2-3% Straight line
Plant and machinery  10-20% Straight line
Fixtures, fittings and computers 10-33% Straight line
Capitalised software and licenses 25-33% Straight line
Investments 
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value. Where overseas borrowing is required to finance the investment in 
overseas subsidiaries, the investment is retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on all material timing differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is more likely 
than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have not been discounted.
Financial liabilities
Finance costs associated with financial liabilities are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the instrument. Issue costs are 
accounted for as a deduction against the gross borrowings received and are amortised over the life of the instrument.
Financial instruments
The Company has not used derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to currency risk. It has entered into an interest rate swap to 
hedge its exposure to interest rate movements, the fair value of which was a liability of £103,000 (2012: £223,000 liability) The Company 
does not apply hedge accounting to this swap. Amounts receivable or payable in respect of this derivative are recognised to interest expense over 
the period of the contract. Changes in the derivative’s fair value are not recognised.
2 COMPANY PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT
Gooch & Housego PLC has taken advantage of section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its own profit and loss 
account in these financial statements. The Company’s loss after tax was £1,978,000 (2012: £2,007,000). 
Fees payable to the Company auditors for the year amounted to £15,800 (2012: £15,800). GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC

15 SHARE OPTIONS
The Company operates the Gooch & Housego PLC 2004 Company Share Option Scheme (the “2004 Scheme”), the Gooch & Housego 2010 Value 
Creation Plan (the “2010 VCP”) and the Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2013 L TIP”).
The Gooch & Housego PLC 2004 Company Share Option Scheme
The Company has ceased granting share options under the 2004 Scheme. Options under this scheme are granted at market price on the date 
of grant with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of the grant. The contractual life of an 
option is 10 years and is subject to continued employment.
At 30 September 2013, one senior employee within the Group has 39,281 share options outstanding relating to the 2004 Scheme. These options 
were subject to specific performance criteria, namely that their subsidiary audited pre-tax profits for the relevant year were at least 
US$500,000 and the subsidiary pre-tax profits were not less than 95% of the agreed budget. It is unlikely these criteria will be fulfilled and 
the options expire in July 2014. The remuneration report details the executive Directors’ share options and the performance criteria which are 
needed to be met for them to exercise their options. 
The options under the 2004 Scheme were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value per option and the assumptions 
used in the calculations are as follows:
Grant date      8 Dec 2005 23 Jul 2004
Share price at grant date      272.5p 133.5p
Exercise price      272.5p 133.5p
Number of employees      2 5
Shares under option      250,000 1,313,275
Vesting period (years)      1-4 1-4
Expected volatility      38.1% 56.7%
Option life (years)      10 10
Expected life (years)      5.5 5.5
Risk free rate      4.23% 4.99%
Expected dividends expressed as dividend yield     1.49% 1.49%
Fair value per option      98.4p 66.1p
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three 
years. The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government 
bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The Gooch & Housego 2010 Value Creation Plan
Under the 2010 VCP , key employees were granted a one-off award of units from an agreed total. Three executive Directors were awarded 44 
units out of the total pool of 64 units and eight key employees hold the remaining 20 units. These units had no intrinsic value on grant but 
gave participants an opportunity to be awarded Company shares proportionate to the value created for shareholders above the threshold 
value at the third anniversary of the plan.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, on the third anniversary, being 7 January 2013 value created during the life of the plan, over and above 
a pre-determined threshold value based on a share price of £2.00, has been calculated. A share of that value (approximately 12%) was distributed 
amongst the participating members of senior management of the Group in the form of nil-cost share options (UK participants) and share awards 
(US participants). Half of the awards made are exercisable immediately and the balance after twelve months, subject to certain conditions.
Details of the award are as follows:-
Total number of market value (151p) Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) share options awarded:   158,936
Total number of nil-cost share options and share awarded:      1,380,566 GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT 2013 69
NOTES TO THE COMPANY BALANCE SHEET for the year ended 30 September 2013
Out of the total options, the executive Directors’ were awarded 59,601 CSOP share options and 981,339 Nil-cost share options. The remuneration 
report provides further details on the share options awarded and exercised during the financial year. 
The 2010 VCP award was valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model. The expected volatility of 73.5% used in the model was based on the 
historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the three years prior to 7 January 2010. The risk free rate of 2.1% was used. The total 
fair value of all the units granted to the participants in the 2010 VCP was £1,614,640. 
The Gooch & Housego 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan
On 9 April 2013 a new Long Term Incentive Plan was adopted. Under the plan, awards will be made annually to key employees based on a 
percentage of salary. Subject to the satisfaction of the required TSR performance criteria and EPS financial performance, these grants will 
vest upon publication of the results of the Company for the year ending 30th September 2015.
On 9 April 2013, 178,960 options were awarded under the 2013 L TIP to a number of key employees, including the three executive Directors 
of the Company. The remuneration report provides further details on the share options awarded and exercised during the financial year.
The 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan award was valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model. The expected volatility of 43% used in the 
model was based on the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the three years prior to 9 April 2013. The risk free rate of 2.7% 
was used. The total fair value of the award on 9 April 2013 was £429,795.

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Notes: 
1  Resolutions 1 to 12 (inclusive) are proposed as Ordinary 
Resolutions. This means that for those resolutions to be passed, 
more than half of the votes cast on such resolutions must be in 
favour of such resolutions. Resolutions 13 and 14 are proposed as 
Special Resolutions. This means that for those resolutions to be 
passed, at least three-quarters of the votes cast on such 
resolutions must be in favour of such resolutions.
2  A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to 
appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or any of the member’s 
rights to attend, speak and vote at the meeting (or any adjournment 
of the meeting). A proxy need not be a member of the Company. If 
a member appoints more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, 
each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a 
different share or shares held by that member. If a member submits 
more than one valid proxy appointment in relation to the same share, 
the appointment received last before the latest time for receipt of 
proxies will take precedence. A member may only appoint a proxy 
in accordance with the procedures described in notes 3, 4 and 5.
3  To appoint a proxy outside of the CREST system, a form of proxy is 
enclosed for use. To be valid, this form of proxy (and any power of 
attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed) must by 
duly completed and signed and sent to or deposited at the office 
of the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars Limited, Freepost 
RSBH-UXKS-LRBC, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent 
BR3 4TU so as to be received not less than 48 hours before the 
time for holding the meeting (or any adjournment of the meeting). 
Completion of a form of proxy does not preclude a member from 
attending and voting in person at the meeting if that member  
so wishes.
4  To appoint as a proxy a person other than the Chairman of the 
meeting, a member must insert the proxy’s full name in the box on 
the proxy form. If a member signs and returns a proxy form with no 
name in the box, the Chairman of the meeting will be deemed to 
be the member’s proxy. Where a member appoints as a proxy 
someone other than the Chairman, the member is responsible for 
ensuring that the proxy attends the meeting and is aware of the 
member’s voting intentions. If a member wishes a proxy to make 
any comments on the member’s behalf, the member will need to 
appoint someone other than the Chairman and give them the 
relevant instructions directly. 
5  To appoint a proxy or to give or amend an instruction to a 
previously appointed proxy via the CREST system, the CREST 
message must be received by the issuer’s agent by 11.00 a.m. on 
24 February 2014. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be 
taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to 
the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the 
issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message. After this time any 
change of instructions to a proxy appointed through CREST should 
be communicated to the proxy by other means. CREST Personal 
Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST 
Members who have appointed voting service provider(s) should 
contact their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) for 
assistance with appointing proxies via CREST. For further

please refer to the CREST Manual. The Company or its Registrars 
may treat as invalid a proxy appointment sent by CREST in the 
circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001. In any case your Form of Proxy must 
be received by the Company’s Registrars by no later than 11.00

6  A member which is a corporation is entitled to appoint one or more 
corporate representatives to exercise the same powers on behalf 
of the corporation as the corporation could exercise if it were an 
individual member. If a member which is a corporation appoints more 
than one corporate representative in relation to the meeting (or any 
adjournment of the meeting), each such corporate representative 
shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of that 
corporation as that corporation could exercise if it were an individual 
member, provided that if such persons purport to exercise those 
powers the same way, those powers shall be treated as exercised in 
that way, but if those persons purport to exercise those powers in 
different ways, those powers shall be treated as not exercised. In the 
case of a member which is a corporation, the proxy form must be 
executed under the corporation’s common seal or signed on its behalf 
by a duly authorised officer of the corporation or an attorney for 
the corporation.
7  Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001, the Company specifies that only those members 
entered in the Company’s register of members at 6.00 pm on 24 
February 2014 shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting 
in respect of the number of shares registered in their names at that 
time. Changes in the Company’s register of members after that 
time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person 
to attend and vote at the meeting. If the meeting is adjourned, the 
time which is 48 hours (disregarding any part of a day which is not 
a working day) before the time fixed for the adjourned meeting 
shall apply for the purpose of determining the entitlement of 
members to attend and vote at the adjourned meeting.

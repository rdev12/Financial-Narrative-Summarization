Results	 overview
Revenues from continuing operations were ahead 
by 1.3% on a constant currency basis and just 
1.0% lower at €1,313.8 million on a reported basis, 
with good growth from licensees and in the Budget 
branded business offset by the impact of currency 
translation in the Avis corporate business. We 
achieved a 0.7% increase in rental revenue per day 
on a constant currency basis. This improvement 
was mainly due to the benefits of previous 
investment in revenue management initiatives 
and pricing actions. Rental revenue per day on a 
reported basis was 1.2% lower due to translation 
impacts from sterling and Swiss franc revenue. 
We increased underlying operating profit on 
continuing operations to €112.7 million (2007: 
€106.5 million), reflecting the improvement in 
rental revenue per day on a constant currency 
basis, together with significant cost reductions as 
a result of strong actions taken by management 
and from translational foreign exchange benefits 
on the sterling element of the Group’s cost base. 
These cost reductions offset the negative impact of 
weaker used car markets on residual values. 
Net finance costs on continuing operations 
increased to €75.1 million (2007: €69.7 million) 
reflecting an increase in average net debt, offset  
by a reduction in the underlying effective finance 
rate from 6.7% to 6.2% per annum.
Underlying profit before tax on continuing 
operations increased to €38.0 million (2007: €37.6 
million). Earnings per share on the same basis were 
2.4 euro cents (2007: 2.9 euro cents). 
Total operating profit was €97.1 million (2007: 
€101.3 million), total net finance costs were €94.5 
million (2007: €68.9 million) and total profit before 
tax on continuing operations was €3.0 million 
(2007: €33.2 million). This is stated after a net 
exceptional charge before tax of €28.8 million 
(2007: €6.9 million) and certain re-measurement 
items and economic hedging losses of €6.2 million 
(2007: gains of €2.5 million). Exceptional items 
primarily relate to restructuring costs. Loss per 
share on the same basis was 1.2 euro cents (2007: 
earnings per share 1.6 euro cents). Overall profit 
before tax (including the discontinued operation) 
was €4.3 million (2007: €19.7 million). Loss per 
share on the same basis was 1.1 euro cents (2007: 
earnings per share 0.3 euro cents).
Currency	 effects
The 2008 results were affected by exchange 
rate movements, in particular the euro/sterling 
exchange rate, when compared with the prior year. 
The average sterling/euro rate for 2008 was 1.28 
compared to 1.47 in the prior year. From a trading 
perspective the strength of the euro had an adverse 
effect on inbound business from the US into Europe 
and UK outbound business into Europe, but a 
positive effect on the translation of the net cost of 
the Group’s UK activities. 
Dividends
In line with recent previous statements, and in view 
of the current difficult trading environment, the 
Board has not recommended payment of a dividend 
for the year ended 31 December 2008. The 
Board’s intention is to recommence the payment of 
dividends when the financial and trading position of 
the Group allows.
Strategic	 development
We will remain focussed on our key strategic 
priorities; brand leadership, service differentiation 
and geographic diversification; optimising the 
allocation of capital; and improving relentlessly 
our cost position and business model flexibility. At 
the same time we will place additional emphasis 
on certain elements of our strategy to adapt the

Chairman’s	statement
business to the present particularly tough economic 
outlook. In particular we will focus on opportunities 
in the current industry environment to protect our 
revenue, reduce capacity and raise prices. We are 
also developing further significant cost actions to 
defend the business from inflationary pressures, 
whilst continuing to adapt our business model.
Outlook	 Whilst we are anticipating lower volumes, we are 
tightening fleet capacity and planning a further 
improvement in pricing and a step-change 
improvement in utilisation. In addition, the benefit 
of last year’s restructuring together with the impact 
of further cost actions are now being realised. 
We have ensured that we have sufficient 
committed liquidity for the next 12 months and, 
from the actions outlined above, anticipate a 
positive free cash flow to face successfully the 
challenges of 2009. 
Employees	 and	 Directors
In my last statement, I welcomed Pascal Bazin, 
who was appointed Group Chief Executive 
on 1 January 2008. Additionally, we have 
strengthened the senior management teams with 
the appointment of both new Group Commercial 
and HR Directors and a new Managing Director in 
Spain. At the same time we have ensured that our 
management structure reflects the international 
nature of our business, an aim which we have now 
achieved with the Avis Executive Board. These 
new appointments, together with the experienced 
Avis management on the team, are providing 
the balance and capability necessary to manage 
the business through a very difficult trading 
environment. 
I would like to thank Gilbert van Marcke de 
Lummen and Malcolm Miller for their many 
contributions to the Company, following their 
retirement from the Board in May. In addition, 
Lesley Colyer retired as Group HR and Corporate 
Affairs Director and stood down from the Board in 
July after 19 years with the Group. I would like to 
thank Lesley for her substantial contributions to the 
development of Avis throughout her career with us. 
Finally, I would like to thank all our employees 
around the world for their continued hard work, 
enthusiasm, loyalty and professionalism. As always, 
it is their efforts on behalf of our customers that 
really make the difference and we have continued 
to achieve solid customer satisfaction scores this 
year, despite reducing staff numbers, again winning 
many industry awards in 2008.
Alun	 Cathcart
Chairman 	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2008  Following my appointment as Group Chief Executive 
on 1 January 2008, we undertook an initial review 
of our strategy and decided to place more emphasis 
on brand leadership and service differentiation, 
geographic and customer diversification, cost 
reduction and improving the flexibility of our 
business model. 
We also adopted a stronger operational approach 
with more emphasis on delivery and accountability, 
which are fundamental in a service, customer-facing 
and extensively networked business, as well as on 
accelerating benefits from recent investment in 
initiatives such as revenue management. 
During the year we made very good progress in 
implementing this strategy, but also in reacting very 
quickly, particularly in the second half, as the trading 
environment weakened.
Brand leadership and service differentiation, as well 
as our geographic and customer diversification, 
supported volumes in a weakening demand 
background. Group revenues were ahead by 
1.3% in constant currency and just 1.0% lower at 
€1,313.8 million on a reported basis. Our excellent 
and well balanced customer portfolio enabled us 
to compensate lower revenues in the less resilient 
Leisure segment with continued growth in the 
Corporate and Insurance/Replacement segments. 
The strength of our brand also supported our 
leading position with industry partners; we recently 
agreed a five-year global and exclusive partnership 
with British Airways, in addition to strengthening  
our partnerships with Iberia, KLM and Lufthansa. 
The renewal of our five-year exclusive partnership 
with SNCF and our preferred partner status with 
Eurostar also put us in an excellent position to share 
in the growth of the rapidly expanding high-speed 
rail networks.
We reinforced the differentiation of our brand by 
implementing further customer-oriented initiatives 
across the network, all designed to improve speed 
and quality of service. Our absolutely unique 
“3-minute promise”, for Avis Preferred members, 
is now rolled out across 600 stations in Europe 
and is serving customers with an exceptional 99% 
success rate. As a consequence we generated a 
very strong 18% increase in sign-ups to our loyalty 
programme, Avis Preferred, and achieved solid 
customer satisfaction scores. 
We placed a daily operational focus on achieving 
gains in constant currency rental revenue per day, 
our measure of pricing, to offset the pressures 
on costs. In particular we maximised the benefits 
from our recent three-year investment in revenue 
management, a series of tools and processes which 
help us maximise pricing, yields and utilisation. As a 
consequence, for the year as a whole, we achieved 
a 0.7% improvement in rental revenue per day at 
constant currency.
We took substantial and early actions to reduce 
costs to protect and indeed deliver an improvement 
in our operating margin. These included the 
enforcement of a rigorous recruitment freeze, faster 
release of seasonal staff and redundancies, which 
together saw a 9% reduction in full time employees 
in the second half. We also focussed on the 
rationalisation of property with the transfer of the 
staff of the UK business head-office into the Group 
headquarters building and the closing of low margin 
stations, as well as significant cuts in discretionary 
expenditure. Overall these actions delivered some 
cost benefits in 2008 and are expected to deliver 
savings of approximately €16 million annually 
thereafter. Since the year end we have implemented 
a salary freeze across the Group.
In terms of improving the flexibility of our business 
model we have ensured proactive management of

Chief	 executive’s	review
Overview
our fleet. We constantly optimised our fleet levels 
and reduced capacity to match demand, as soon 
as the trading environment began to weaken in the 
second half. As an example, in the fourth quarter 
of the year, we demonstrated this flexibility by 
reducing capacity by just under 5% and exiting 
December with utilisation ahead by 3.1%. 
Regarding funding, the credit markets are generally 
difficult at present, therefore we have ensured 
that we will have sufficient liquidity for the next 12 
months, with good headroom for our anticipated 
requirements. We continue to benefit from the 
flexibility of our business model, have strong capital 
and cash flow controls in place, and are focussed 
on improving asset returns. It is our intention to put 
further financing in place in good time for maturities 
that fall due from mid-2010.
In summary, these actions and results mean that 
we are well positioned to face the challenges and 
opportunities of 2009, as recessionary pressures 
intensify and the trading environment is expected to 
remain very difficult. 
Our key strategic priorities outlined above will 
remain unchanged, with a particular focus and 
emphasis on:
•  Protecting profitable revenue and leading the 
industry opportunity to change;
•  Developing further radical cost actions to defend 
the business from economic pressures;
•  Continuing to adapt our business model and its 
flexibility; and
•  Focussing on capital management and cash 
generation as key priorities.
We are developing further significant cost actions, 
whilst continuing to adapt our business model. 
We expect cost savings of around €22 million in 
2009, including the run-rate savings from 2008, 
and anticipate a further reduction in fleet capacity 
of around 5% to 10% as we target a step-change 
improvement in utilisation. These actions will help 
to maintain our flexibility in this difficult environment 
and ensure further progress in 2009.

Business	review	 Business description
The Group is an international vehicle rental services company and a market leader in many of its 
markets. Under the Avis and Budget brands, we operate more than 3,900 corporate and licensee 
locations throughout Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, which completed over eight million rental 
transactions in 2008 across the network. During the year, our corporately-owned locations employed 
some 5,960 staff (based on average full-time equivalent headcount) and had an average fleet of 
117,000 vehicles. 
We enjoy close commercial ties with Avis Budget Group, Inc., which owns the global rights to the 
two brands, as well as the Wizard rental and reservation system. Long-term agreements with Avis 
Budget Group, Inc. give the Group the rights to use the Avis and Budget names, brands and operating 
systems through master licensing agreements until 2036, whilst cross-marketing and joint promotional 
agreements are in place to provide customers with access to a global network. 
Our network comprises countries in Western Europe (the corporate countries), which operate their own 
directly-owned locations and also appoint local agencies and licensees plus a wider network of national 
licensee operations across the rest of Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. We also have joint 
ventures in China and France, and minority interests in operations in India and Malaysia.
Corporate locations are directly owned by the Group and employ Avis Europe’s staff, premises and fleet. 
Agency operations are owned and operated by third parties who rent the Group’s vehicles, but employ 
their own staff and use their own premises. Agency revenue is accounted for as Group revenue, with the 
agent receiving a percentage of revenue as commission. Licensed locations are owned and operated by 
licensees who pay fees in return for the use of the brand and operating system. In the latter case, we 
only include the licensee fee receivable in revenue.
In 2008, revenues from the Avis branded business represented 96% of overall revenue, and the Avis 
corporate countries accounted for approximately 93% of overall revenue. 
The Budget branded business in Europe, Asia and the Middle East serves customers through over 1,100 
rental locations in 66 countries. Corporate countries comprise France, United Kingdom, Austria and 
Switzerland. In 2008, the Budget branded business represented 4% of our overall revenue.
A description of the performance of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2008, and significant 
developments which occurred during the year, is set out in the Chairman’s statement on page 2, the 
Chief Executive’s review on page 3, and on pages 10 to 19 of this Business Review.

Geographic	 diversification 6	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
Operating	 environment	 Market	 size	 and	 growth	 There is little external data available regarding 
the car rental market on a European-wide basis, 
the latest being the Euromonitor IMIS Travel 
Database 2007. Euromonitor estimated the 
car rental revenue generated in the 10 main 
countries where we operate on a corporate basis 
(see below) was €8.81 billion during 2007. The 
largest countries by revenue were Germany 
(22%), the United Kingdom (18%), France 
(17%), Spain (16%) and Italy (12%). During this 
period, Euromonitor estimated that 44 million 
rentals were made and that a combined fleet of 
approximately 1.2 million vehicles was employed 
by the car rental industry.
Whilst there is no market data currently available 
for the car rental industry in 2008, growth has 
historically been closely tied to general economic 
activity levels and, in the case of rentals from 
airports, to airline passenger volume growth. 
The global economic environment deteriorated 
during 2008, particularly in the second half of 
the year, with The Economist Intelligence Unit 
reporting growth of 1.1 % in Euro-area GDP for 
2008, compared with growth of 2.6% in 2007. 
The International Air Transport Association 
(IATA) reported full year growth of 1.8% in Intra-
European passenger numbers, although there 
was significant variation between the first and 
second halves of the year. The growth rates in 
the car rental market in 2008 are likely to have 
been similar.
In 2009, the overall demand outlook in the 
Group’s main markets is expected to be 
challenging and uncertain. As at January 2009, 
The Economist Intelligence Unit was forecasting 
a 1.2% decline in Euro-area GDP in 2009 with 
growth of 0.5% in 2010, with UK GDP forecast to 
decline by 2.5% in 2009 and by 0.9% in 2010. 
Growth expectations for the airline sector tend 
to be higher than GDP growth, driven in part by 
structural trends, in particular by the continued 
growth of low cost airlines. IATA forecasts growth 
in passenger arrivals for flights within Europe of 
4.4% per annum for 2008 to 2011, marginally 
down from their previous forecast of 4.8%.

Market	 composition	 The car rental market is generally categorised 
either by the type of customer, (Leisure, 
Corporate, Insurance/Replacement) or by the 
location of rental (airport, non-airport). In 2007, 
Euromonitor estimated just under 54% of the 
market to be leisure, with approximately 40% 
being corporate and 6% being replacement 
business. During 2007, 42% of the industry’s 
revenue came from airport rentals, with 58% 
attributable to non-airport locations. 
Customer	 groups	 Reflecting the above, we recognise three key 
customer types, each with differing needs 
and expectations: Individuals, Corporate and 
Insurance/Replacement. 
Individual:
These customers are individual travellers booking 
directly or indirectly through travel companies, tour 
operators, partnership arrangements and brokers. 
The individual customer category is more seasonal 
than the corporate customer category, with 
demand peaking over the key holiday periods. 
Individual customers are principally attracted 
to Avis by its widespread network, quality of 
service, reliability, car choice, brand, website and 
competitive prices. 
Corporate:
Corporate customers book via negotiated 
arrangements with their employers and through 
vehicle replacement companies.

The corporate customer category displays a 
relatively even pattern of demand throughout 
the year. The key requirements of corporate 
customers are competitive prices, speed and 
quality of service, reliability, car choice,  
availability of management information and 
geographical coverage. 
Insurance/Replacement: 
These customers come through insurance and 
leasing companies, vehicle dealerships and repair 
shops with which Avis has a direct contractual 
relationship. 
This category also displays a relatively even 
pattern of demand throughout the year and 
customers’ requirements are similar to those in 
the corporate segment. 
 
Partnerships	 To support business from both individual and 
corporate customers we have an extensive 
portfolio of over 70 international partnerships with 
the world’s airlines, railway networks and other 
leading travel companies. 
Stations/locations	 Rental locations throughout the network are 
selected for their convenience to customers, with 
particular importance attached to representation 
at airports, rail locations and other major travel 
points. Whilst Euromonitor estimates that across 
the market as a whole, 42% of revenue comes 
from airport rentals, Avis benefits from a broadly 
even distribution of revenue from airport  
and non-airport locations due to its significant 
international network. 
Competition
The European car rental market is dominated  
by three large multinational companies that 
comprise around 60% of the overall market. The 
Euromonitor research referred to earlier shows 
that the Avis and Budget brands had the second 
highest aggregate market revenue share in our  
10 largest corporate countries in 2007 at 17.7%. 
The merger between Europcar and Vanguard 
(primarily National and Alamo brands) in 
November 2007 gave Europcar a leading position 
in the European market place with a reported 
share of 25.6%. Hertz is the third largest with a 
reported market share of 15.3% in 2007.
In specific markets we face competition from 
other car rental operators. For example, Sixt are 
a major competitor in Germany and Enterprise in 
the United Kingdom. There are a large number of 
smaller-scale operators with strength in particular 
markets (frequently the Mediterranean), examples 
being Maggiore in Italy and ADA in France. 
It is noteworthy that the Group operates two of 
the four established global brands, Avis, Budget, 
Hertz and Europcar (Vanguard).

the Budget branded business offset by the 
impact of currency translation in the Avis 
corporate business. We achieved a 0.7% 
increase in rental revenue per day
2
 on a constant 
currency basis. This improvement was mainly 
due to the benefits of previous investment in 
revenue management initiatives and pricing 
actions. Rental revenue per day on a reported 
basis was 1.2% lower due to translation impacts 
from sterling and Swiss franc revenue. 
We increased underlying operating profit on 
continuing operations to €112.7 million (2007: 
€106.5 million), despite the very tough economic 
environment. This reflected the improvement in 
rental revenue per day on a constant currency 
basis, together with significant cost reductions as 
a result of strong actions taken by management 
on the Group’s ongoing restructuring programme 
and from translational foreign exchange benefits 
on the sterling element of the Group’s cost base. 
These cost reductions offset the negative impact 
of weaker used car markets on residual values. 
Net underlying finance costs increased to 
€75.1 million (2007: €69.7 million) reflecting 
an increase in average net debt, offset by a 
reduction in the underlying effective finance rate 
from 6.7% to 6.2% per annum.
Underlying profit before tax on continuing 
operations increased to €38.0 million (2007: 
€37.6 million). Earnings per share on the same 
basis were 2.4 euro cents (2007: 2.9 euro cents). 
Total operating profit was €97.1 million (2007: 
€101.3 million), total net finance costs were 
€94.5 million (2007: €68.9 million) and total 
profit before tax on continuing operations  
was €3.0 million (2007: €33.2 million). This is 
stated after a net exceptional charge before  
tax of €28.8 million (2007: €6.9 million) and 
certain re-measurement items and economic 
hedging losses of €6.2 million (2007: gains of 
€2.5 million). Exceptional items primarily relate  
to restructuring costs. Loss per share on the 
same basis was 1.2 euro cents (2007: earnings 
per share 1.6 euro cents).
Overall profit before tax (including the 
discontinued operation) was €4.3 million (2007: 
€19.7 million). Loss per share on the same basis 
was 1.1 euro cents (2007: earnings per share  
0.3 euro cents).

lower in the second half overall. The market 
remained competitive in the first half, with some 
noticeable easing of competitive pressures 
on pricing towards the end of the year. Rental 
revenue per day on a reported basis was 1.2% 
lower following the translation of sterling revenue 
into euro at a weaker sterling exchange rate than 
in the prior year.
Our excellent customer portfolio balance 
supported our performance with continued growth 
in the Corporate and Insurance/Replacement 
segments, balancing lower revenues in the less 
resilient Leisure segment.
The analysis of rental revenue by customer  
type follows:
Individual
Billed days through individual direct customers 
were ahead in the first half, reflecting the strength 
of the brand, but were lower in the second half as 
economic conditions worsened. This led to overall 
revenue from this customer group being below 
prior year.
During the year we reduced the volume of 
business through the broker intermediary channel 
in order to both improve yields and hold the 
customer relationship directly. 
We achieved rental revenue per day gains in this 
segment, albeit weakening in the second half.
From a geographic perspective the market in 
Spain has been particularly difficult throughout 
2008 reflecting its early economic slowdown, with 
other main markets being relatively more resilient 
for most of the year.
Corporate
Overall rental revenue from this customer group 
was ahead of the prior year.
Billed days were up, largely driven by an increase 
in both rentals and average rental length, with 
flat rental revenue per day. Lower revenues in 
Spain and the UK, reflecting economic conditions 
in those markets, were offset by good growth in 
both Germany and Italy.
Insurance/Replacement
Overall rental revenue from this customer group 
was ahead strongly again, reflecting good 
performances in Italy, Germany and the UK. 
Rental revenue per day was below the prior year, 
partly driven by an increase in rental length.
Avis	 Licensee	 revenue
Overall revenue from licensee countries grew 
by 14.7% on a constant currency basis and by 
7.3% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact 
of the licensing of the Group’s operations in 
Greece, licensee revenues were 12.4% ahead on 
a constant currency basis and 4.9% ahead on a 
reported basis.
Budget	 Corporate	 revenue
Budget Corporate revenue of €43.2 million was 
1.4% ahead of prior year with volume growth in  
all corporate countries.
Budget	 Licensee	 revenue
Budget Licensee revenue of €13.0 million was 
€2.9 million ahead of prior year, with continued 
growth in network revenues across the EMEA 
region.

Revenue from the discontinued operation in Greece 
for the seven months of ownership in 2007, before 
being franchised, was €48.7 million.

more than offset higher fleet costs.
Business	 review
Currency effects
The 2008 results were affected by exchange 
rate movements, in particular the euro/sterling 
exchange rate, when compared with the prior 
year. The average euro/sterling rate for 2008 was 
1.28 compared to 1.47 in the prior year. From a 
trading perspective the strength of the euro had 
an adverse effect on inbound business from the 
US into Europe and UK outbound business into 
Europe, but a positive effect on the translation of 
the net cost of the Group’s UK activities.

flat, being ahead 0.4% on a constant currency 
and 1.5% lower than the prior year at €1,221.0 
million on a reported basis. 
For the full year we increased billed days

 volume 
by 0.1%, driven by an improvement in rental 
length. First half volume growth of 2.2% was 
offset by more difficult demand conditions in the 
second half when volumes were 1.7% lower, with 
later months being weaker. 
We achieved a 0.7% gain in rental revenue per 
day on a constant currency basis, despite the 
mix effect of continued strong volume growth in 
the Insurance/Replacement customer segment 
and overall longer rental length. Rental revenue 
per day was ahead by 2.0% in the first half, 
but began to reflect the weakening demand 
conditions referred to above in the third quarter. 
As a consequence, in October, we implemented  
a significant price increase in non-contracted 
business, thereby holding revenue per day flat  2 	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
Business	review	 Financial review continued
Underlying operating costs of continuing 
operations at €1,140.0 million were 2.0% lower 
than the prior year.
Cost of sales of €726.5 million was just  
€6.8 million or 0.9% higher than the prior year, 
despite fleet costs increasing by €16.4 million  
or 3.8%. These higher fleet costs were largely due 
to the weaker used car markets impacting residual 
values on non-repurchase cars, particularly in 
Spain and the UK, as well as purchase price 
inflation from the car manufacturers. Increased 
fleet costs were partly offset by savings in damage 
and insurance costs, foreign exchange translation 
benefits of fleet costs in the UK and a 0.2% 
improvement in utilisation

. Whilst utilisation was 
0.4% lower than the prior year in the first half, it 
was 0.8% higher in the second half despite the 
more difficult resale market conditions.
Selling costs were 7.4% lower, mainly benefiting 
from actions taken in the second half to minimise 
discretionary marketing expenditure. Rental related 
costs and revenue related costs were controlled 
tightly, being 3.1% lower and flat respectively.
Administrative expenses (which comprise staff 
costs and overheads) of €413.5 million, were 
€29.3 million lower than the comparative  
period. Staff costs were reduced by €7.5 million, 
reflecting both headcount reductions and  
exchange translation benefits. Overhead costs 
were €21.8 million lower, despite property disposal 
gains in the prior period, largely reflecting lower 
depreciation, benefits from the translation of 
sterling based overheads into euro, lower bad  
debt charges, and a reduction in operating  
taxation charges.

€1.8 million higher, reflecting inflationary  
increases and non-exceptional reorganisation 
costs. Consequently, the underlying operating

The increase in average net debt of continuing 
operations from €1,004 million to €1,183 million 
primarily resulted from a reduction in net fleet 
creditors, offsetting the benefit from disposing of 
the operation in Greece. The underlying effective 
finance rate on continuing operations was 6.2% in 
2008 (2007: 6.7%), reflecting lower market rates, 
lower interest receivable, and lower interest on 
tax charges. Underlying net finance costs on the 
discontinued operation were nil in the current year 
(2007: €5.5 million).

The cash cost in 2008 of exceptional items (pre 
taxation) was €21.1 million (2007: €11.7 million).
Restructuring costs of €27.6 million included €1.9 
million of costs incurred in the first half in respect 
of a redundancy programme that commenced in 
December 2007. Restructuring costs of €25.7 
million were then recognised in the second half 
reflecting a further rationalisation of operations 
in response to the deterioration in the trading 
environment, including redundancies, the closure 
of certain low margin rental locations, and the 
rationalisation of property with the transfer of 
the staff of the UK business head-office into the 
Group headquarters building. These restructuring 
costs include redundancy costs, onerous 
lease provisions, fixed asset impairments, and 
exceptional pension curtailments.
In the prior year, restructuring costs of €7.1 million 
were incurred with respect to the redundancy 
programme commenced in December 2007, 
and the final elements of a restructuring project 
commenced in 2005.
During 2008, the Group recognised an exceptional 
impairment provision against the goodwill arising 
on the acquisition of certain licensees in Holland. 
This followed a reappraisal of the business in 
conjunction with the restructuring referred to 
above. In the comparative year, the Group acquired 
the assets of a licensee in Germany and an 
impairment provision was made in respect of the 
goodwill arising.
During the current and prior years, the activities 
associated with the closure of the Centrus 
credit hire business were more successful than 
previously anticipated. The Group therefore 
partially reversed provisions recognised in prior 
years, resulting in a further exceptional credit of 
€0.3 million (2007: €0.7 million).    
 
In the prior year, the Group disposed of its 
subsidiary in Greece. The Group has recognised 
an exceptional credit of €1.3 million in the current 
year to reflect the final settlement of a warranty 
provision. 
Certain	 re-measurement	 items	 and	 economic	 hedges 
The following items have been recognised in 
the year and are excluded from underlying profit 
before tax: 
 Operating Finance Profit
€ million profit items before tax
Re-measurement gains/ 8.0 (18.4) (10.4)
(losses) on derivative 
financial instruments
Economic hedge adjustments 5.2 (0.5) 4.7
Foreign exchange loss  – (0.5) (0.5)
on borrowings
 13.2 (19.4) (6.2)
Re-measurement gains and losses on derivative 
financial instruments arise from the recognition 
in the Income Statement of movements in the fair 
value of certain derivatives under IAS 39, Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. 
The Group uses such derivatives to hedge its 
underlying economic positions, but only applies 
hedge accounting to those relationships where it  
is both permissible and practical to do so. 
Re-measurement gains and losses on derivative 
financial instruments are excluded from underlying 
profit. However, an economic hedge adjustment is 
then made to underlying profit to the extent that 
the re-measurement gain or loss economically 
hedges the movement in a related position that 
itself has been recognised in underlying profit.
During the year the Group experienced net gains 
on foreign exchange contracts, but experienced 
losses on interest rate swaps, caps and collars 
given falls in base interest rates.
Accounting standards as applied also restrict 
the recognition of borrowings as part of a net 
investment in foreign operations. Foreign exchange 
movements on certain short-term borrowings are 
therefore recognised in the Income Statement, but 
are excluded from underlying profit.

Overall when aggregating repurchase and risk 
vehicles, fleet cash outflows were broadly in  
line with prior year, with the benefit from lower 
fleet levels offset by reduced credit terms on 
certain finance lease vehicles following taxation 
rule changes.
The improvement in cash generated from 
operating activities is mainly attributable to the 
disposal of vehicles under repurchase agreements 
and a reduction in trade receivables. This is 
partially offset by the increase in cash used in 
investing activities, which includes the effect of the 
change in purchase structures on finance lease 
vehicles and a switch from operating lease vehicle 
financing to owned fleet in certain countries.
Net cash used in financing activities reduced due 
to the realisation of certain debt derivatives in the 
prior year in line with loan note maturities. Other 
movements in net debt resulting from cash flows 
primarily comprise additional tax settlements and 
interest payments. Other non-cash movements, 
including the effect of foreign exchange in the 
current year are primarily due to reductions in the 
fair values of debt related derivatives.

The average number of fleet units operated in

1% lower at 117,000 (2007: 118,000) vehicles, 
reflecting a 2.6% reduction in fleet levels in the 
second half in response to the weakening demand 
background. Within this total, vehicles under non-
repurchase (off-balance sheet) operating leases 
reduced by 3.0% to 9.5%. 
Return	 on	 capital	 employed	 ROCE
6
 for underlying continuing operations was 
slightly lower at 8.5% (2007: 9.0%). The higher 
underlying return achieved by the Group was 
offset by a higher average capital employed, 
particularly in the first half of the year.
Shareholders’	 funds	 and	 returns	 At the end of the year, shareholders’ equity in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet was €69.3 million 
(2007: €96.2 million). Movements in shareholders’ 
funds comprised the loss attributable to equity 
holders as recognised in the Income Statement, 
cash flow hedge losses of €9.6 million, actuarial 
gains in respect of the Group’s pension scheme of 
€11.2 million, and translation reserve adjustments 
of €19.3 million which arose from the translation 
of the UK asset base at the weaker closing 
sterling/euro exchange rate. 
The direct impact of foreign exchange (pre 
taxation) on shareholders’ equity was €9.4 million 
as the translation reserve adjustment of €23.1 
million together with the loss arising from foreign 
exchange on net debt of €0.5 million, were offset 
by the net gain on foreign exchange derivatives of 
€13.2 million. 
Shareholders’ equity in the unconsolidated  
Parent Company Balance Sheet at 31 December 
2008 was £314.6 million (2007: £421.5 million). 
The principal movement in the year was following 
a review of the Company’s investment in its 
subsidiaries. This review indicated that this 
investment carrying value should be reduced  
and, as a result, an impairment charge of £113.2 
million has been recognised in the unconsolidated 
Parent Company Financial Statements. This 
impairment is a non-cash charge and has no

The Group’s joint venture in China continued to

benefiting in part from the Beijing Olympics. 
The Group’s share of profit of joint ventures and 
associates is lower than prior year due to start-up 
costs of the Group’s OKIGO car club initiative in

The underlying effective rate of taxation on 
continuing operations rose to 43% (2007: 30%) 
as a consequence of results arising in different 
jurisdictions impacting both current and deferred 
taxation together with a reassessment of  
deferred taxation in the light of the current 
economic environment. 
The underlying tax charge in respect of 
discontinued operations was €nil in 2008 
compared to a tax credit of €1.1 million in 2007. 
The 2007 credit arose from a reduction of 
deferred tax liabilities following the lowering of  
the corporate tax rate in Greece in 2007.
The tax credit on exceptional, certain re-
measurement items and economic hedges in 
2008 was €2.0 million compared to a €6.5 million 
charge in 2007, reflecting the change in mix of 
exceptional items and the conservative approach 
adopted with respect to the deductibility of certain 
expenses.
Fleet
The majority of vehicles continue to be subject 
to manufacturer repurchase arrangements, 
which guarantee a disposal value at the end of 
the holding period, thereby reducing the Group’s 
exposure to residual value risk. The analysis of 
Business	review	 Financial review continued 	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2008 5
There have been no significant changes in the 
composition of net debt during the year. Whilst 
there has been a reduction in the level of finance 
leases reflecting lower fleet at 31 December 
2008, there has been a reduction in the value of 
fixed interest rate derivative debt instruments given 
the general reduction in market interest rates. 
Pensions	 We operate both funded and unfunded defined 
benefit pension and statutory termination 
schemes, as well as defined contribution schemes. 
Funded defined benefit schemes 
The principal funded scheme is that operated in 
the United Kingdom. The difference between the 
market value of all funded scheme assets and the 
actuarial value of the funded scheme liabilities at 
31 December 2008 was a deficit of €36.7 million 
(2007: €62.5 million). 
The fair value of the scheme assets has decreased 
by €49.5 million (2007: €6.3 million increase) in 
the year. This reflects the exchange translation 
loss as a result of the weakened sterling currency

and an experience loss on plan assets, offset by 
funding contributions from the Group. The present 
value of the scheme obligations has reduced by 
€75.3 million (2007: €11.3 million reduction),  
due to the effect of the weakened sterling 
currency noted above and a gain on the change of 
assumptions, being mainly an increased discount 
rate. Interest on scheme liabilities was €11.1 
million (2007: €11.2 million) and the net actuarial 
gain was €9.8 million (2007: €8.9 million). The 
non-contributory final salary section of the UK 
Plan was closed to future service accruals from  
1 April 2007 and future service benefits now 
accrue under the contributory Retirement Capital 
(cash balance) section of the Plan. 
Unfunded defined benefit schemes
The principal unfunded scheme is held in  
Germany and is closed to new entrants. The 
actuarial value of all unfunded scheme liabilities 
was €34.2 million (2007: €35.0 million). The 
reduction in the deficit is primarily due to actuarial 
gains related to the increase in the discount rate 
applied to liabilities.
The underlying charge in the income statement 
for defined benefit schemes was €9.6 million 
(2007: €10.2 million), the reduction being due 
to the closure of the United Kingdom final salary 
scheme part way through the prior year and 
changes in the entitlement rules related to the 
German pension scheme.
Treasury 
Financial risk management objectives and policies 
We have a centralised treasury function that is 
responsible for the management of the Group’s 
financial risks together with its liquidity and 
financing requirements. The treasury function is 
not a profit centre and its objective is to manage 
risk at optimum cost. Treasury operations are 
conducted within a regularly reviewed framework 
of policies and guidelines approved and monitored 
by a sub-committee of the Board. This framework 
facilitates the execution of Board-approved 
strategies. A discussion of the Group’s financial 
risk management objectives and policies, and 
exposure to various financial risks, is included in 
Note 27 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  6 	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
Current liquidity 
We fund the Group’s operations through a 
combination of retained earnings, working 
capital and borrowing facilities. The majority 
of borrowings are raised through Avis Finance 
Company plc, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary 
of the Company, and proceeds are used to 
finance the Group’s subsidiaries on an arm’s 
length basis. In order to ensure maximum 
flexibility to changing requirements, we seek 
to maintain access to a wide range of funding 
sources. Financing facilities therefore include 
bank borrowings, loan notes, finance leases and 
a commercial paper programme in Belgium. 
As at 31 December 2008 the Group had undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities of €608.0  
million (2007: €712.4 million) and additional 
uncommitted borrowing facilities available of 
€383.7 million (2007: €583.0 million). Of the 
undrawn committed facilities €300.3 million 
expire within one year (2007: €228.7 million), €nil 
between one and two years (2007: €54.6 million) 
and €307.7 million between two and five years 
(2007: €429.1 million).
In addition, as at 31 December 2008, the Group 
had outstanding loan notes and associated 
derivative financial instruments of €597.8 million 
(2007: €596.5 million). Of these, €51.6 million 
matures between one and two years, €460.6 
million matures within two and five years, and 
€85.6 million after more than five years (2007: 
€264.0 million between two and five years and 
€332.5 million after more than five years). The 
Group also held cash and cash equivalents of 
€24.7 million (2007: €52.1 million).
The Group’s committed bank facilities and loan 
notes are unsecured and contain a number of 
financial covenants including: a minimum EBIT 
level; a maximum limit to the ratio of total net 
financial debt to underlying EBITDA; and a 
minimum limit to the ratio of underlying EBITDA 
to net interest expense. Each of these covenants 
is measured at 30 June and 31 December each 
year and on a rolling 12-month basis on either 
an underlying IFRS or underlying UK GAAP 
basis. On an IFRS basis for the year ended 31 
December 2008, the ratio of total net financial 
debt to underlying EBITDA was 2.5:1 (2007: 
2.2:1) and the ratio of underlying EBITDA to 
net interest expense was 6.2:1 (2007: 6.1:1). 
We monitor compliance against all the Group’s 
financial obligations and manage the consolidated 
balance sheet and debt requirements so as to 
operate within the financial covenants. The first 
repayment on the Group’s committed borrowings 
is due in August 2010. This is a relatively small 
(€51.6 million) repayment of US private placement 
notes. Beyond this, the next borrowing repayment 
is not due until February 2011, the maturity 
date of the Group’s €580 million revolving credit 
facility. The Group therefore has no committed 
bank facilities or loan notes due for repayment 
within 19 months of the year-end.
 
Other funding arrangements 
Where commercially beneficial, we seek to 
optimise financing costs by entering into operating 
lease transactions where substantially all of  
the risks and rewards of ownership remain with 
the lessor. At 31 December 2008, the total 
commitment to pay operating lease rentals in 
future periods for land, buildings and vehicles  
was €250.0 million (2007: €190.4 million).  
At the end of the year, the Group has certain 
insurance, operating lease and station rental 
commitments which are backed by guarantees 
and letters of credit that have been issued by 
banks to third parties amounting to €80.0 million 
(2007: €86.5 million). 
Insurance 
We are legally obliged to provide all vehicle rental 
customers with insurance against accidents 
caused to third parties, and cover is also offered 
against theft and personal accident. In addition, 
we cover various risks arising from the normal 
course of business, including damage to property 
and general liability. Cover is arranged with a 
number of major insurance companies to cost-
effectively spread the risk. We also reinsure a 
limited amount of the risks through the Group’s 
captive insurance company, which in turn buys 
reinsurance to limit its own exposure. 
Principal	 risks	 and	 uncertainties	 Risk mitigation is a key part of the management 
of the Group and we have a well developed 
process to identify, manage and limit exposure 
to areas which may have a negative impact on 
the business. The process we have in place for 
managing risk is described in the Corporate 
Governance report on page 32. As would be 
expected the relative importance of certain risks 
has changed since the prior year end, particularly 
the effect of economic uncertainty on demand 
and residual values in used car markets. As a 
result we have taken actions to respond to these 
changes and will continue to monitor and respond 
to the changing climate.
Summarised below are some of the risk factors 
that may affect the Group’s business.

• Pricing and competitive pressures
• Fleet 
• Relationship with Avis Budget Group, Inc. 
• Insurance 
• Funding
• Interest and foreign currency
• Pensions 
International	 operations	 Given its extensive geographic coverage, the 
Group’s business is subject to various risks 
inherent in international operations. These 
risks include, amongst other things: regulatory 
requirements, differing legal and tax practice and 
interpretation, potential difficulties in managing 
foreign operations, different local accounting 
practices and potential political instability. 
Demand	 The Group faces various risks associated with 
the demand for its services, which in itself is 
highly seasonal. Disruption could occur during 
the peak summer season at the time when we 
increase staff levels and purchase more vehicles 
to accommodate the anticipated usual increase 
in demand. There may be disruptions in air travel 
patterns or a general decrease in air travel as a 
result of a significant event such as a terrorist 
incident or as a consequence of increased 
security measures being taken by the authorities 
in anticipation of such a threat. An economic 
downturn poses challenges for the Group given its 
capital intensity and short forward reservations, 
requiring careful management of the business to 
manage capacity, costs and profitability.
Pricing	 and	 competitive	 pressures	 The Group and its licensees are subject to 
competition from a wide range of other operators 
both directly and via intermediaries and brokers. 
Large European competitors compete with the 
Group in most customer categories, and mergers 
and acquisitions involving those competitors 
may result in increased competitive pressure. 
Local operators may have lower operating costs, 
enabling them to charge relatively low prices. In 
addition, the car rental industry faces pressure 
from increased pricing transparency as a result 
of the growth of internet travel portals, other 
forms of e-commerce and the rental brokers. This 
transparency has increased the prevalence and 
intensity of price competition.
Fleet 
Loss or material change in the terms on which we 
obtain fleet vehicles from major vehicle suppliers 
could harm the performance of the business. 
In the event that we could not procure all the 
required vehicles from current sources, vehicles 
could be obtained from other sources such as 
dealers. However, there could be risks to business 
volumes and to financial and operating results as 
we sought alternative supplier arrangements. 
The effective cost of vehicles is dependent on 
the new purchase price, the level of discount, the 
amount of any marketing contributions and the 
residual value of the vehicles, either on the pre-
agreed price for repurchase vehicles or the open 
market for non-repurchase vehicles. There is a 
risk that the effective cost of vehicles increases 
and because of competitive pressures, we will 
be unable to pass on such an increased cost of 
vehicles to rental customers.
Historically sales incentive and discount 
programmes offered by manufacturers to car 
rental companies have tended to keep the average 
cost of cars low for the car rental industry. In 
periods when the environment for new car sales 
improves or when manufacturers are trying 
to rebalance capacity for a downward shift 
in demand, they could decide to reduce their 
allocation of sales to fleet purchasers such as the 
Group, or to remove the incentives and discounts 
thereby increasing the average cost of vehicles. 
Vehicles not covered by repurchase programmes 
are sold on the open market. Residual values 
of these vehicles are exposed to an adverse 
movement in second-hand vehicle prices, which 
can be a result of a number of factors, including 
general economic conditions, tightening of 
availability of credit to potential buyers, model 
changes and changes in environmental legislative 
policy which cause short term uncertainty and 
prompt change in customer preference. Equally, 
a severe or persistent decline in the results of 
operations or financial condition of one of the 
major manufacturers supplying vehicles for 
the Group’s fleet could impact residual values. 
Any such movement in used vehicle prices or 
poor demand in the used vehicle market may 
hinder our ability to sell these vehicles and could 
adversely affect the Group’s results. 
Where difficulties are experienced in sourcing 
vehicles, or where prevailing economic conditions 
result in depressed used vehicle prices and 
reduced demand, these risks may be mitigated by 
extending the holding period of vehicles. However, 
extended holding periods may introduce new 
risks including increased maintenance costs, 
manufacturer warranty expiry, more uncertainty 
over residual values, higher CO
2
 emissions, and 
the potential impact of older vehicles on customer 
loyalty and safety considerations. 
Business	 review
If a decline in the results of operations or financial 
condition of a vehicle manufacturer (or other 
repurchase programme counterparty, such as a 
dealer) were so severe as to cause it to default on 
an obligation to repurchase vehicles covered by 
repurchase guarantees, we would have to find an 
alternative method for disposal of those vehicles, 
which could increase the Group’s expenses and 
decrease the proceeds from such disposals. Any 
such default might also leave the Group with an 
unpaid claim against the manufacturer or dealer 
with respect to repurchase vehicles that have 
been sold and returned but not yet paid for.
If governments across Europe introduce rapid 
changes to taxation or environmental regulations 
designed to encourage the use of vehicles with 
lower CO
2
 emissions this may result in lower 
current vehicle residual values and, at least 
in the short term, have an adverse impact on 
the Group’s performance until existing fleet is 
replaced. In addition, further legislative changes 
encouraging the use of vehicles with lower vehicle 
emissions could result in additional costs in the 
medium term if the fleet cannot be adapted to 
wholly mitigate these changes and any resultant 
higher costs recovered. 
Relationship	 with	 Avis	 Budget	 Group	 Avis Budget Group, Inc. (ABG) licenses the Avis 
and Budget brands to the Group for operation 
in specified territories through master licensing 
agreements which expire in 2036. 
The Group does not have any cross-shareholdings 
with ABG, yet through the close contractual 
and business relationship the two companies 
work together to provide a seamless service 
to customers of both the Avis and the Budget 
networks. We rely on ABG to operate its own 
business in a manner that both upholds the value 
of the global brands and allows the Group to 
provide a similar service in the locations in which 
it operates. We have joint marketing initiatives 
with ABG and share market and customer 
information where appropriate. It also provides 
joint services and cross-refers customers through 
a formalised agreement. The maintenance of 
a good management relationship with ABG is 
therefore important to the Group.
We use the Wizard rental and reservation 
system under license from ABG, pursuant to a 
long-term computer services agreement, which 
is subject to a five-year notice period. Wizard 
has been operational since 1972, and has been 
continuously enhanced and expanded since that 
time. It is a fully integrated reservation, rental 
and management information system that is  8 	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
Business	review	 Financial review continued
used by Avis Europe and ABG worldwide. We 
are obliged to contribute to the cost of upgrading 
and enhancing Wizard, therefore unanticipated 
costs could adversely affect the Group’s results. 
Should Wizard need to be replaced, process and 
execution issues could present a substantial risk 
to the Group’s operations. 
Any adverse changes to the terms of the 
agreements or any deterioration in ABG or its 
business or in the relationship with ABG is likely 
to have an adverse effect on the Group’s financial 
condition and results of its operations. 
Insurance 
We are legally obliged to provide statutory third 
party motor liability insurance to all customers. 
This insurance provides financial protection 
against claims from third parties where the 
Group’s customers are at fault in a road accident. 
In addition, sales of damage waivers and personal 
accident insurance are important sources of 
revenue. We also cover various risks arising in 
the normal course of business, including damage 
to property and general liability. Insurance 
policies are arranged with a variety of insurance 
companies and we are reliant on their continued 
credit standing. Certain of these insurance policies 
are supported by letters of credit provided by the 
Group the extent of which is partly dependent 
upon the insurer’s perceived credit standing of 
the Group. 
We also reinsure a limited amount of the risks 
through the Group’s own captive insurance 
companies, which in turn buy reinsurance to 
limit their own exposure to acceptable levels. 
Significant risks would exist to the stability of the 
Group’s business if access to primary insurance 
and/or reinsurance was constrained, denied or 
available only at increased costs that could not  
be passed on in increased prices.
Funding 
The Group’s operations are by their very nature 
capital intensive and are dependent on its various 
sources of funding. 
Terms of credit between the Group and its 
principal suppliers of fleet vary widely, depending 
both on the market in which the vehicles are to  
be used and on the supplier. Certain suppliers 
also provide vehicles on off balance sheet 
operating lease terms. Any material worsening 
of credit terms would result in a corresponding 
increase in debt funding requirements. 
We fund a substantial proportion of the Group’s 
vehicles with borrowings, including both on and 
off balance sheet leasing arrangements, and,  
as such, depend on access to the debt markets 
and other forms of financing to fund the Group’s 
fleet. If we are unable to access such debt 
facilities on commercially acceptable terms, 
or have difficulty meeting the terms of any 
financial covenants, the current business, results 
of operations, financial condition and future 
prospects may be adversely affected. 
In order to mitigate against these risks and to 
guarantee access to liquidity, we seek to ensure 
that the Group has a core level of long-term 
committed funding in place with maturities 
spread over a number of years. This core funding 
is supplemented with shorter-term committed 
and uncommitted facilities particularly to cover 
seasonal debt requirements. It is noteworthy that 
lease finance tends to be only available on shorter 
maturities than other forms of debt. All funding 
is arranged with a wide range of providers, on 
both a public and private basis. We maintain 
a regular dialogue with debt providers to keep 
them updated on the trading performance and 
prospects of the business.
Interest	 and	 foreign	 currency	 Interest rate risk arises from the Group’s 
borrowings which, after foreign currency risk 
hedging, principally arise in euro and sterling. 
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the 
Group to cash flow interest rate risk whereas 
borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the 
Group to fair value interest rate risk. To manage 
these risks, the Group is both financed through a 
combination of fixed and floating rate facilities and 
enters into various derivatives. As present debt 
facilities mature the Group is exposed to higher 
credit spreads on its borrowings.
The majority of the Group’s business is transacted 
in euros, sterling, US dollars and Swiss francs. In 
each country where the Group has a corporate 
operation, revenue generated and costs incurred 
are primarily denominated in the relevant local 
currency, so providing a natural currency hedge. 
In addition, intra-group trading transactions 
are netted and settled centrally. Any remaining 
material foreign currency transaction exposures 
are hedged as appropriate into either euro or 
sterling. Revenue recognised from licensees is 
primarily received in sterling.
With regard to translation exposures the policy is 
to match where possible the average assets of the 
Group to the equivalent average liabilities in each 
major currency and thus minimise any impact to 
the Group. To the extent that this does not occur, 
both foreign currency borrowings and forward 
exchange contracts are used. 
Pensions 
The Group has two principal defined benefit 
pension schemes, a UK scheme which is in 
deficit, and an unfunded scheme in Germany.  
The Group’s balance sheet liability against these 
schemes is subject to uncertainty concerning  
the risks and returns around the respective assets 
and liabilities of the UK scheme and the interest 
rate applied to the book reserve for the German 
scheme. In particular, volatility in interest rates 
has an impact on the amount by which future 
pension liabilities are discounted and affect the 
returns forecast to be earned. An actuarial 
valuation of the Avis UK Pension Plan was 
prepared as at 31 March 2008. This was the first 
valuation of the Plan carried out subject to the 
requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and, as 
anticipated, the funding level has deteriorated 
since the previous valuation as at 30 June 2005. 
This is mainly due to the reduction in the expected 
real rate of return and to an increase in the post-
retirement longevity assumption. As a result, the 
Group’s future cash contributions to fund the 
deficit will increase substantially as from July 2009. 
Going	 Concern
The Group’s business activities, together with 
the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in this 
Business Review. In addition, the financial 
position of the Group, including its cash flows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described above. In addition notes 27 and 28 to 
the Financial Statements explains the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes with respect 
to financial risk management; details the Group’s 
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk; and 
describes the Group’s financial instruments and 
hedging activities.
The Group is subject to a number of key business 
risks as described on pages 16 to 18. The nature 
of the car rental business model should mean that 
the Group has an ability to readily flex business 
size and hence funding requirements if required. 
As an example, due to the relatively short holding 
period (typically circa seven months) the Group 
is able to flex its vehicle fleet level relatively 
quickly to meet both fluctuations in demand 
or funding constraints. Also a relatively large 
number of temporary staff are employed for the 
seasonal peak; again this helps provide flexibility 
in managing costs. Furthermore, the Group 
can choose whether to franchise or corporately 
own its operations. The Group also benefits 
from significant diversification, in terms of its 
customers and suppliers, its geographic spread 
and its sources of funding. As a consequence, the 
Directors believe that the Group is well placed to  	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2008 9
manage its business risks successfully despite the 
present highly uncertain economic outlook.
As part of its normal business practice the Group 
regularly prepares both annual and longer-term 
plans. These plans include an estimate of the 
financing required over the respective period. 
Current forecasts indicate that the Group expects 
to operate within its committed facilities over the 
next 12 months together with sufficient operating 
lease lines. Furthermore, these forecasts also 
indicate that the Group is expected to be able to 
operate within its lenders’ financial covenants 
(described in this Business Review on page 16) 
over the same period. 
Specifically regarding sources of liquidity, and as 
detailed in note 26 to the financial statements, the 
Group has €45.1 million of borrowings due within 
one year which primarily consist of uncommitted 
overdraft facilities and commercial paper. Whilst 
the Group will seek the ongoing renewal of these 
facilities, the Group currently maintains sufficient 
headroom within its committed facilities should 
any of the uncommitted facilities not be renewed.
The Group uses finance leases as part of its 
funding, having €232.7 million of such leases due 
within one year at 31 December 2008, as detailed 
in note 25 to the financial statements. These 
are short-term committed facilities, provided 
by local financial institutions, secured on the 
applicable fleet, and are generally renewed on an 
annual basis. As at the date of these Financial 
Statements, sufficient committed finance lease 
facilities are in place to finance the current year 
peak requirement for vehicle fleet that is usually 
funded using these facilities. 
Regarding term-debt, the first repayment (€51.6 
million of US$ private placement notes) in respect 
of committed borrowing facilities is due in August 
2010. The next borrowing repayment is not due 
until February 2011, being the maturity date of the 
Group’s €580 million revolving credit facility. The 
Group therefore has no committed borrowings due 
for repayment within 19 months of the year-end. 
With respect to the longer term, the Group has 
commenced discussions with various financial 
institutions with respect to a variety of potential 
forms of future medium-term funding. In 
particular, the Group is investigating the possibility 
of further directly utilising the security and 
relatively liquid nature of its fleet in common with 
industry practice.
Therefore, whilst any consideration of future 
matters involves making a judgement at a 
Business	 review
particular point in time about future events  
which are inherently uncertain, the Directors, 
after making appropriate enquiries, as indicated 
above, have reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the 
Financial Statements.
Accounting standards and policies 
There were no significant changes in either 
accounting standards or policies which impacted 
the Group in the year.
Forward	 looking	 statements
Certain statements in this Annual Report are 
forward-looking. Although we believe that the 
expectations reflected in these forward-looking 
statements are reasonable, there can be no 
assurance that these expectations will prove  
to have been correct. Because these forward-
looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, 
actual results may differ materially from  
those expressed or implied by those forward-
looking statements.

Our	 impacts	 and	 actions

Our	 Corporate	 Social	 Responsibility	 (CSR)	 strategy	 is	 an	 integral	 part	 of	 our	 ‘We	 try	 harder.’	 philosophy.
With	 regard	 to	 the	 environment	 our	 strategy	 is	 to	 ensure	 we	 progressively	 reduce	 our	 CO

	 emissions	 in	 our	 premises,	 offset	 non-reducible	 emissions	 and	 continue	 to	 introduce	 less	 polluting	 vehicles	 onto	 our	 fleet	 where	 possible.	 Our	 European	 corporately-owned	 operations	 and	 some	 of	 our	 licensees	 are	 carbon	 neutral.	 We	 have	 guidelines	 in	 place	 for	 reducing	 energy	 use	 in	 our	 operations	 and	 in	 2008	 we	 completed	 environmental	 audits	 of	 a	 number	 of	 headquarters	 buildings	 and	 major	 rental	 locations	 in	 the	 Group’s	 main	 corporately-owned	 markets.

However,	 where	 possible,	 we	 have	 sought	 closer	 links	 with	 airport	 operators	 to	 maximise	 opportunities	 for	 joint	 environmental	 initiatives,	 particularly	 in	 relation	 to	 recycling.
On	 community	 matters,	 corporately-owned	 operations	 focus	 their	 efforts	 on	 the	 provision	 of	 vehicles	 for	 community	 purposes	 and	 local	 environmental	 improvements,	 whilst	 local	 management	 have	 discretion	 to	 support	 local	 staff	 volunteering	 and	 fundraising	 for	 causes	 of	 their	 choice.

Environmental	 impacts
We remain committed to reducing, where possible, 
our negative impacts on the environment, of which 
by far the greatest are greenhouse gas emissions. 
Our European corporate operations and some of 
our licensees are CarbonNeutral® and we continue 
to introduce less polluting vehicles onto our fleet. 
We measure our environmental impacts internally 
and our data is reviewed and analysed by the 
Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Management working 
with The CarbonNeutral Company. 
In 2008 emissions from our corporately-owned 
operations amounted to 14,648 tCO
2
e. 
Corporate	 operations
In 2008, our corporate operations focussed on 
developing and completing a series of initiatives 
to improve environmental performance, including: 
•  completing the integration of environmental 
reporting into financial reporting using a new 
finance system, which tracks utility use and 
business travel; 
•  undertaking a number of environmental audits 
of headquarters buildings and major rental 
locations in the Group’s main corporately-
owned markets;
•  beginning the implementation of the resulting 
recommendations to achieve emissions 
reductions;
•  making better use of resources and making 
all staff aware of what they can do to reduce 
energy use, including the use of e-learning to 
reduce travel; 
•  further increasing the use of videoconferencing 
between our Group headquarters in Bracknell 
and our other country corporate head offices 
with seven countries now participating, with a 
resulting reduction of over 25% in European 
travel; and
•  developing closer links with customer groups 
to help reduce their environmental impact, 
including the launch of a bookable “green 
fleet” and a carbon offset tool for corporate 
customers.
We offset our emissions in 2008 in conjunction 
with The CarbonNeutral Company. Around 90% 
of total emissions were offset through renewable 
energy, independently credited to the Voluntary 
Carbon Standard: the remaining offset was via 
tree planting; since 2000, we have offset over 
118,896 tonnes of CO
2
.
Corporate	social	responsibility 	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2008 2 Fleet	 operations
We seek to minimise emissions from our fleet 
by introducing more environmentally friendly 
vehicles in more locations. In 2008 they have 
included:
• Ford flexi-fuel cars in France 
• LPG fuelled Volkswagens in Italy 
•  BMW 1 series with stop-start technology in 
Spain, Germany, the UK and Belgium
•  Honda Civic hybrids in Germany, Portugal  
and Holland
• Toyota Prius in the UK 
As a result of these and other changes, a 
significant proportion of 2008 fleet purchases 
emitted below the European norm for CO
2
. 
In Paris the OKIGO initiative, undertaken jointly 
with Vinci Park, allows customers who pay a 
subscription to have an Avis car available 24/7 
in one of the many Vinci car parks. During 2008 
OKIGO was expanded to 100 cars in 25 stations, 
mainly based in Paris, with a three-fold increase 
in the number of members to 1,500. Studies 
show that sharing a car in this way effectively 
replaces up to eight individual cars. We have 
also signed a partnership with Vinci Park, the 
Paris Metro and SNCF (leading French railway 
company) to facilitate the operation of a public 
car sharing scheme with 4,000 vehicles in Paris 
in 2010. 
Avis Norway, Sweden and Spain maintained their

Workplace 
As challenging market conditions prevailed during 
2008, we focussed on increasing the flexibility 
and effectiveness of our organisation and 
maintaining and managing employee motivation 
and engagement.
Having achieved much improved results in our 
employee satisfaction survey in 2007, we needed 
to ensure we built on these improvements 
even through the difficult economic conditions. 
Therefore, despite making management and 
structural changes in many areas of our business, 
we have focussed efforts on celebrating our 
successes, keeping our culture alive, increasing 
communication with employees, continued 
employee development and an established 
programme of community involvement.
The	 ‘We	 try	 harder.’	 promise
We rely on our people to deliver the ‘We try 
harder.’ promise and appreciate that it is essential 
that we make Avis an enjoyable place to work 
where people can develop and grow. 
We operate in many different countries and 
therefore have employees with very different 
cultural backgrounds. Accordingly we ensure 
that every employee understands what ‘We try 
harder.’ means and takes pride in working for 
Avis, regardless of their role.
We keep the spirit of ‘We try harder.’ alive 
through Company induction programmes and 
through our communications and training 
programmes. We have a number of employee 
recognition programmes that are widely used, 
encouraging employees to celebrate teamwork 
and enjoy time away from the workplace 
with their colleagues. For example, every 
country recognises its ‘Station of the year’ 
and individual employees recognise colleagues 
who have demonstrated great commitment or 
service through a scheme known as ‘Making 
a Difference’. Every year Germany hosts an 
extremely popular weekend football competition 
known as ‘We kick harder’ which is attended by 
people from other countries and centres.
Recognising and celebrating success is a key 
feature of our culture. We positively encourage 
our people to raise their ideas for improvements 
and innovations by participating in our new 
ideas scheme, called ‘Winning Ideas’. We also 
continue to recognise and value long service 
within the organisation and have a tradition of 
public celebration of major service milestones 
in all countries and centres. In Budapest we 
celebrated the 5th anniversary of the Business 
Community
We aim to make a positive contribution to  
the quality of life in the communities where  
we operate. 
Our community investment guidelines provide that 
we focus on local environmental improvement and 
provision of free transport for community activities. 
In addition to this activity across our corporate and 
licensee network, we support UNICEF on a variety 
of projects. We also support initiatives which are 
particularly important to local staff.
Some of our 2008 projects have included:
•  supporting a road safety project for school 
children in Germany;
•  collecting food for Christmas on behalf of the 
NGO Caritas;
• fundraising for a cancer care charity in the UK;
• the renovation of a forest path in Hungary;
•  the establishment of a partnership with Action 
Aid in Italy; and 
•  fundraising for the Portuguese Community 
against Aids (Portugal).
In addition, we support employee volunteering  
and fundraising:
•  where staff commit to voluntary work for a 
charitable organisation in Barcelona, the Avis 
contact centre makes a quarterly contribution; 
and
•  in our headquarters we match sponsorship 
funding for individual and team efforts.
Corporate	social	responsibility	 continued
Support Centre, with special recognition for 
those employees who have been there since the 
centre’s opening.
Communicating	 with	 our	 people
In 2008 we have focussed on ensuring that 
all employees understand how the Group 
is performing, the impact of the external 
environment, and the role they play in delivering 
our success.
All countries and centres have delivered 
comprehensive communication strategies, 
including face-to-face time for all levels of 
employees with senior leaders and regular 
briefings on progress from their own managers. 
At our 2008 Licensee conference we focussed 
strongly on the theme of communicating with 
employees and keeping people motivated during 
difficult times.
Developing	 our	 people
Our Human Resources vision is to enable people 
to grow within our company – developing both 
themselves and our organisation.
Each country and centre carries out 
comprehensive training programmes for both 
front-line and head-office based employees. Much 
operational training takes place within stations 
using real-life situations. To support this, some 
countries, including France and the UK, have 
developed a programme where certain station 
employees undertake special training to enable 
them to act as coaches to other employees.
During 2008 we developed a comprehensive 
European-wide training programme, utilising 
e-learning and classroom training for Rental 
Sales Agents, which ensures that every country 
can train people to the same high standards. 
Comprehensive training and development 
programmes are in place in both support centres 
for all levels of employee and these are regularly 
reviewed and refreshed. 
Diversity
During 2008 we have continued to focus on 
developing a workforce which reflects the 
communities that we serve. In particular, we need 
to ensure our management structure reflects the 
international nature of our business, an aim which 
we have now achieved with the Avis Executive 
Board, which comprises five different nationalities. 
In our contact centre in Barcelona we employ 
some 30 nationalities. In our Group headquarters, 
we now have some 21 different nationalities 
working side by side.  	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2008 25
to recommend Avis to a friend, improved again, 
by 1%. The percentage of customer invoices 
which were adjusted in 2008 continued to reduce. 
The station performance score, which records 
the overall efficiency of the running of a station, 
improved by a further 1% against last year, 
primarily driven by greater satisfaction with the car 
pick-up service, following the introduction of the 
“3-minute promise”.
We also focussed our efforts on building on 
the progress made in differentiating the brand 
and making the rental process faster, simpler 
and clearer for customers. During the year we 
increased further the number of people signing 
up to the Avis Preferred service, underlining the 
improving trend in customer satisfaction and 
loyalty. Avis Preferred sign-ups increased by 
18%, while the number of active Avis Preferred 
customers increased by 15%. 
For Avis Preferred customers we continued the 
roll-out of our “3-minute Promise” programme. 
Under this programme we guarantee customers 
their keys and rental agreement within three 
minutes of entering the service station. If we 
fail, the customer receives a retail voucher for 
€30. The “3-minute Promise” is now available 
in France, Germany, Spain, UK, Portugal, 
Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands and Poland, 
and is providing real differentiation in the market 
place. Approximately 75% of all Avis Preferred 
rentals within Europe now take place at a  
3-minute location.
We achieved the ISO 10002 – CMSAS 86:2000 
standard for Quality Management Customer 
Satisfaction – Complaint Handling and were 
re-accredited at the beginning of 2008. The 
standard covers all our European offices and 
demonstrates that we follow best practice in all 
aspects of complaint management and continual 
improvement of performance. During 2008 Avis 
Germany was awarded the “Best Car Rental 
Company 2008” by the German Institute for 
Service Quality (DISQ GmbH & Co. KG). 
Awards remain a strong indication of how we 
are seen by our customers. Our achievements 
in 2008 included the following: British Travel 
Awards, Car hire company of the year 2008; 
British Travel Awards, Best leisure car hire 
company 2008; British Travel Awards, Best 
business car hire company 2008; World Travel 
Awards, Asia’s leading car hire company 2008; 
Leading car rental provider in Middle East 2008, 
Business Traveller Magazine; and Britain’s

Equal	 opportunities
We operate in many countries with diverse 
employment practices. Whilst respecting local 
circumstances, wherever we operate we follow 
the principles of equal opportunity in recruitment, 
development, remuneration and advancement.
Health	 and	 safety
We continued to focus on creating a robust health 
and safety culture across the Group, with each 
country and centre required to report quarterly on 
key statistics. 
The majority of countries have increased training 
in this area and many countries have taken 
actions locally to further improve performance.
Marketplace
We aim to make Avis first choice for our 
customers by continually improving our 
service and so ensuring customer satisfaction 
and loyalty. This is especially important in 
an increasingly price competitive market 
environment. We have made further good 
progress this year, in particular ensuring that our 
customer service levels have not been impacted 
by the staff and cost reductions made in 
response to the weaker economic background. 
We monitor customer satisfaction principally 
through customer surveys and the level of 
complaints and each country Managing Director 
takes personal responsibility for monitoring and 
improving customer satisfaction scores. Each 
month we distribute over 35,000 surveys and  
we receive over 6,000 replies. Of those returned, 
some 80% are received back in less than three 
days, enabling us to pass comments on to the 
relevant business area for appropriate action  
with minimal delay. In addition, Avis UK operates 
a ‘We try harder.’ blog, enabling customers to 
have an on-line dialogue with our marketing  
and customer service departments in the UK  
to continually review and improve the services  
we provide. 
Our four key measures of customer satisfaction 
remain:
• overall satisfaction; 
•  willingness of customers to recommend Avis 
(Net Promoter Score™); 
• customer complaints; and 
• perception of station performance. 
In 2008 we held “overall satisfaction levels” 
stable. This measure reflects customer satisfaction 
“overall with the rental experience”. The net 
promoter score, which measures the willingness

Code	 principles
Introduction
This report describes how the corporate governance principles set out in 
the Combined Code are applied by the Company. The role of the Board 
is collectively to provide clear and effective leadership of the Company by 
setting strategic objectives and providing the highest values and standards 
for the conduct of the Company’s business. The Board is also responsible 
for ensuring that sufficient resources are available to achieve the Company’s 
objectives, for ongoing review of management performance and for ensuring 
that a framework of prudent and effective controls is in place to enable risks 
to be properly assessed and managed.
Board of Directors
The Directors of the Company during the period 1 January 2008 to 3 March 
2009 are listed below: 
Pascal Bazin (appointed 1 January 2008)
Jean-Pierre Bizet 
Alun Cathcart (Chairman)
Lesley Colyer (retired 4 July 2008) 
Les Cullen 
Roland D’Ieteren
Benoit Ghiot
Gilbert van Marcke de Lummen (retired 28 May 2008)
Malcolm Miller (resigned 28 May 2008)
Simon Palethorpe (resigned 21 November 2008)
Dr Axel von Ruedorffer 
Pierre Alain De Smedt
Martyn Smith
On 1 January 2008, Pascal Bazin was appointed Chief Executive. On 28 May 
2008 Gilbert van Marcke de Lummen retired from the Board and Malcolm 
Miller resigned as a non-executive Director of the Company. On 4 July 2008, 
Lesley Colyer retired as Group HR and Corporate Affairs Director and stood 
down from the Board. On 21 November 2008 Simon Palethorpe resigned as 
Group Commercial Director and stood down from the Board.
Beniot Ghiot, Axel von Ruedorffer and Martyn Smith will retire by rotation  
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and, being eligible, will stand  
for re-election. 
As at 3 March 2009, the Board of Directors comprises the Chairman,  
three executive Directors and a further five non-executive Directors.  
The non-executive Directors include three Directors who have no other 
association with Avis Europe plc and are therefore regarded as independent, 
being Les Cullen, Axel von Ruedorffer and Pierre Alain De Smedt. A further 
two of the non-executive Directors, Roland D’Ieteren and Benoit Ghiot, in 
addition to one executive Director, Jean-Pierre Bizet, are appointed by s.a. 
D’Ieteren n.v. which has a shareholding of 59.6% in the Company. The 
obligations of the Directors appointed by s.a. D’Ieteren n.v., and of s.a. 
D’Ieteren n.v. as a shareholder, are set out in a Relationship Agreement 
entered into at flotation in 1997. These include an obligation for the 
D’Ieteren-appointed Directors to exercise their voting rights so as to maintain 
the independence of the Board as required by the Listing Rules, thus 
ensuring that all Directors take decisions objectively in the interests of the 
Company. Since 1998 the Board has adopted a policy that, notwithstanding 
the provisions of the Articles of Association, all Directors should stand for 
election at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment and 
re-election at least every three years thereafter. 
The Company considers that the non-executive component of the Board 
helps to provide an effective Board with a strong mix of industry-specific 
knowledge and general commercial experience. This balance enables the 
Board to bring informed and independent judgment to all aspects of the 
Company’s strategic development and performance. The role of the non-
executive Directors is viewed as especially important in reviewing business 
strategy and assisting the Board in the development of strategy. The non-
executive Directors also review and monitor the Company’s financial controls 
and risk management systems. The non-executive Directors have a key 
role in scrutinising management performance and the Company’s system 
for monitoring and reporting performance. They also have responsibility for 
determining appropriate remuneration levels and succession planning for the 
executive Directors. The Chairman meets with the non-executive Directors at 
least annually in order to facilitate the non-executive Directors’ contribution 
to the Board. The Company did not have a nominated Senior Independent 
Director during the period to 3 March 2009 but continues to keep this 
requirement under review. 
The Board meets a minimum of six times each year and more frequently 
when business needs require. There was one additional Board meeting in 
2008, as well as six scheduled meetings and two scheduled conference 
calls. All Directors attended all Board meetings, except that Lesley Colyer 
and Jean-Pierre Bizet each missed one meeting. The Chairman of each of 
the Nominations Committee, Remuneration Committee and Audit Committee 
attended the 2008 Annual General Meeting and were available to answer 
shareholders’ questions during and after the meeting. 
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and their respective 
responsibilities are defined in writing and approved by the Board. The 
Chairman’s key areas of activity are the leadership of the Board, including 
setting its agenda, ensuring that it receives clear, accurate and timely 
information and facilitating the contribution of the non-executive Directors. 
The Chairman is responsible for strategy, in particular for ensuring that 
effective plans are developed for the short-term and long-term development 
of the Group. In co-ordination with the Chief Executive, the Chairman 
is responsible for encouraging close and effective working relationships 
between all levels of operating country, licensee and Group level 
management. The Chairman is also responsible for corporate governance 
and for ensuring that the Company maintains effective communication with 
its shareholders and other stakeholders. The Chairman also chairs the 
Nominations Committee and has responsibility for ensuring that the Board 
evaluation processes are carried out and their results acted upon. 
To enable the Board to function effectively, full and timely access is given 
to all relevant information. The Board retains powers of decision on all 
matters of strategy, together with all significant commercial issues, including 
acquisitions and investments and capital expenditure in excess of a specified 
level. The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring that Board 
procedures are followed and for advising the Board, through the Chairman, 
on all matters of governance. All Directors have access to the Company 
Secretary whenever they require. In the event that any Director wishes to take 
independent professional advice on any point arising in connection with the 
exercise of their duties, in accordance with written procedure the Company 
Secretary will arrange this at the Company’s expense. The Company 
Secretary may only be removed by a resolution of the Board of Directors. 
Details of all Directors’ remuneration and service contracts are set out in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 34 to 42.

the Committee during the year are described in the Remuneration Report on 
pages 34 and 35. 
The members of the Remuneration Committee as at 1 January 2008 were 
Malcolm Miller (Chairman 1 January 2008 – 28 May 2008), Alun Cathcart, 
Les Cullen, Roland D’Ieteren and Axel von Ruedorffer. Pierre Alain De Smedt 
became a member of the Remuneration Committee with effect from 27 
February 2008. Malcolm Miller resigned from chairmanship and membership 
of the Committee on 28 May 2008, and was replaced as Chairman by Pierre 
Alain De Smedt with effect from 29 May 2008. There were no other changes 
to the composition of the Remuneration Committee between 1 January 
2008 and 3 March 2009. The Company recognises that Roland D’Ieteren 
is not regarded as an independent non-executive Director but considers it 
essential that s.a. D’Ieteren n.v., as the majority shareholder of the Company,

The Remuneration Committee held four scheduled meetings and two 
additional meetings during 2008. All Directors attended all meetings, except 
that Les Cullen missed one additional meeting due to a prior commitment.
The Remuneration Report to shareholders appears on pages 34 to 42. 
The Audit Committee assists the Board by ensuring that the Company 
presents a balanced and understandable assessment of its position with 
regard to financial reporting, including interim, preliminary and other formal 
announcements relating to the Group’s financial performance. 
Under its terms of reference, the Audit Committee monitors the integrity of 
the Group’s financial statements and the effectiveness and independence of 
the external audit process. It is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate 
relationship between the Group and the external auditors is maintained, 
including reviewing non-audit services and fees. It reviews the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control through a number of processes, as set out 
under the Internal control and risk management section below. This includes 
an annual review of the Group’s system of internal control and the processes 
for monitoring and evaluating risks facing the Group. The Committee reviews 
the effectiveness of the internal audit and risk management function and is 
responsible for approving, upon the recommendation of the Group Finance 
Director, the appointment and termination of the Director of that function. 
The Chairman of the Audit Committee provides a report to the Board after 
every Audit Committee meeting. In satisfying itself that sufficient and 
appropriate work has been performed, the Board as a whole considers the 
adequacy and scope of the reports it has received from the Audit Committee 
along with corroborative evidence where necessary. 
In 2008 the Audit Committee discharged its responsibilities by: 
•  reviewing prior to Board approval, the Group’s draft annual financial 
statements, interim results statement, interim management statements, 
internal control report and the external auditor’s report;
• considering, prior to release, any trading updates; 
•  reviewing regularly the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting policies 
and their compliance with appropriate International Financial Reporting 
Standards; 
Board Committees 
The Board Committees in place during 2008 were the Nominations 
Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee. Each 
Committee reviews its terms of reference and its effectiveness annually and 
recommends to the Board any changes required as a result of such review. 
The terms of reference of each Committee are available on the Company’s 
website at www.avis-europe.com. 
The Nominations Committee ensures that the Company has a formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors. 
The Committee periodically reviews the structure and composition of the 
Board to ensure the required blend of skills and experience appropriate to 
the Company’s needs. It sets objective criteria in recommending appointees 
to the Board, including being satisfied that appointees have sufficient time 
available to devote to the role, especially for chairmanships. The Committee 
is also responsible for ensuring that induction and training requirements 
are met both for new Directors and for the Board as a whole to ensure 
that Directors regularly update their skills and knowledge, including their 
knowledge of developments in the Company’s business. The Committee 
carries out reviews of the succession plans for the Board and for senior 
executives across the Group to ensure that continuing management capability 
is available to match the development needs of the business. 
During 2008, the Nominations Committee approved a number of changes to 
the structure and composition of the senior management team at the centre 
and in various business units in order to support the business needs of the 
Group going forward. 
The members of the Nominations Committee as at 1 January 2008 were 
Alun Cathcart (Chairman), Les Cullen, Roland D’Ieteren, Malcolm Miller, 
Axel von Ruedorffer and Pierre Alain De Smedt. Malcolm Miller resigned 
from the Committee on 28 May 2008. There were no other changes to the 
composition of the Nominations Committee between 1 January 2008 and 3 
March 2009. As recommended by the Combined Code, the membership of 
the Committee comprises a majority of independent non-executive Directors. 
The Nominations Committee met five times during 2008 and all members 
attended all meetings.
The Remuneration Committee determines broad policy on senior executive 
remuneration and terms of service and approves specific terms of 
appointment for the Chairman, executive Directors and senior management. 
The Committee is also responsible for the structuring and allocation of 
the Group’s share incentive schemes, including the setting of appropriate 
performance targets. Details of the advisers used by the Committee during 
2008 are set out in the Remuneration Report on page 35. 
In setting policy, the Committee ensures that appropriate incentives are 
provided to attract, retain and motivate executives of the appropriate calibre, 
to encourage performance and, in a fair and responsible manner, to reward 
individual contributions to the Group. The Committee takes account of 
market practice, the Group’s position relative to other companies and the 
pay and employment conditions of other Group employees. The Committee 
consults with the Chairman and/or Chief Executive, as appropriate, when 
determining the individual remuneration package of each executive Director. 
However, no Director is involved in deciding his/her own remuneration. The 
Committee reviews the terms of the executive Directors’ service contracts, 
particularly with regard to notice periods, termination payments and 
compensation commitments in the event of early termination. The activities of

Malcolm Miller resigned from the Committee on 28 May 2008. There were 
no other changes to the composition of the Committee between 1 January 
2008 and 3 March 2009. As recommended by the Combined Code, all the 
members of the Committee are independent non-executive Directors. 
The Audit Committee met four times in 2008 and all members attended 
all meetings except that Pierre Alain De Smedt was unable to attend 
one meeting. The Committee meets with executive Directors and senior 
management, as well as privately with both the external and internal auditors. 
Board evaluation
During 2008 the Board carried out a formal evaluation process which 
is designed to provide a rigorous annual evaluation of the Board’s own 
performance and that of its Committees. The evaluation process assesses 
the effectiveness of Board and Committee processes to provide a basis for 
feedback and development where required. As noted above, the Chairman 
has responsibility for the evaluation process and for taking any appropriate 
action based on the results of the evaluation.
The evaluation processes for Board performance are conducted via a set 
of structured questionnaires which ask each Board/Committee member to 
comment on a range of factors which contribute to the effectiveness of the 
Board or the relevant Committee. The results are reviewed by the Chairman 
and relevant feedback is provided to the Board and each Committee. 
Directors’ interests 
Details of Directors’ interests in the share capital of the Company are set out 
below and in the Remuneration Report. 
Jean-Pierre Bizet and Benoit Ghiot are Directors of D’Ieteren Car Rental 
s.a., an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of s.a. D’Ieteren n.v., which held 
548,586,255 ordinary shares of 1p each in the capital of the Company as 
at 31 December 2008. Details of significant contracts entered into with s.a. 
D’Ieteren n.v. are disclosed below. There have been no changes in the above 
Directors’ interests between 31 December 2008 and 3 March 2009. 
Except as noted above, none of the Directors had any interests in the shares 
of the Company or in any material contract or arrangement with the Company 
or any of its subsidiary undertakings. 
Conflicts of interest 
At the Company’s Annual General Meeting in 2008, the Company’s Articles 
of Association were amended following implementation of the relevant 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 to permit the Board of Directors to 
authorise a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest notified by a 
Director provided that the Board considers this to be in the best interests of 
the Company. 
Each of the Directors reviewed their individual positions prior to the 
implementation date for the new legislation of 1 October 2008 and the Board 
authorised a number of pre-existing potential conflicts of interest notified to 
it as a result. The company has put procedures in place via the Company 
Secretary whereby the Directors can notify any future conflicts or potential 
conflicts of interest that may arise so that the Board can consider whether 
authorisation is appropriate. 
Share capital 
The last Annual General Meeting authorised the Company to purchase up to 
92,052,404 of its own ordinary shares. This authority will expire, and is due 
to be renewed, at the next Annual General Meeting. The Company made no 
purchases of its own shares during 2008 pursuant to this authority. Details of 
the share capital of the Company are set out in Note 30 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
Substantial shareholdings
At 3 March 2009, the Company had been advised of the following notifiable 
interests in its issued ordinary share capital:
  % of issued share capital 
D’Ieteren Car Rental s.a. 59.59
Franklin Templeton Investments Corp 5.20
Odey Asset Management LLP 3.32
As noted above, an agreement governing the relationship between s.a. 
D’Ieteren n.v. and the Company was entered into in connection with the 
Company’s flotation in 1997. It includes restrictions on s.a. D’Ieteren n.v.’s 
power to appoint Directors and obligations on those Directors to ensure that 
the majority of the Board is independent of s.a. D’Ieteren n.v. It also provides 
that all transactions between the Company and s.a. D’Ieteren n.v. will be 
on an arm’s length basis. The agreement also contains certain anti-dilution 
rights for s.a. D’Ieteren n.v. provided that the D’Ieteren Group owns more 
than 30% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. 
During the year, the Group has entered into transactions with the D’Ieteren 
Group on an arm’s length basis with respect to the purchase and sale of 
vehicles and the provision of finance. Further details of these transactions are 
set out in Note 43 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Corporate	 governance 2 	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
The Audit Committee reviews all services being provided by the external 
auditors quarterly in order to consider the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditors, taking into account relevant professional and regulatory 
requirements, so that these are not impaired by the provision of permissible 
non-audit services. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were engaged by the Group for certain non-
audit activities, the fees for which are set out in Note 4 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. The nature and materiality of this work has been 
reviewed by the Audit Committee which is satisfied that there has been no 
conflict with the need for audit independence and objectivity. 
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the 
Company will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting. 
Internal	 control	 and	 risk	 management	 The Directors have continued to review the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of controls, including operational and compliance controls, risk 
management and the Group’s internal control arrangements. Such a system 
is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. These reviews have 
included an assessment of both financial and operational internal controls 
by the Group’s internal audit and risk management function, management 
assurance of the maintenance of control, and reports from the external 
auditor on matters identified in the course of its statutory audit work. A key 
part of the Group’s own internal control review is a declaration and annual 
certification process at the half year and year end by which the managers 
responsible confirm the adequacy of their systems of internal financial 
control, their compliance with Group policies, local laws and regulations and 
are also required to report any breakdown in control or occurrence of fraud 
that has come to light. The Group has procedures in place which incorporate 
the recommendations on internal control: guidance for directors on the 
Combined Code (Turnbull).
Internal control environment 
The Directors are responsible for the system of internal control and for 
regularly reviewing its effectiveness. 
The system of internal control includes but is not limited to: 
•  clear definition of the organisation structure and the appropriate delegation 
of authorities to management; 
•  maintenance of appropriate segregation of duties together with other 
procedural controls; 
•  strategic planning and the related annual budgeting and regular review 
process; 
•  monthly reporting and review of financial results and key performance 
statistics; 
•  adoption of accounting policies to help ensure the consistency, integrity 
and accuracy of the Group’s financial records; 
•  specific treasury policies and the regular reporting and review of all 
significant treasury transactions and financing activities; 
• procedures for the authorisation of capital expenditure;
As recommended by the Combined Code the Company carries directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance which is arranged under an umbrella policy 
effected by s.a. D’Ieteren n.v. The Company has entered into indemnities to 
the extent permitted by English law, indemnifying the Directors against claims 
brought against them. 
Shareholder relations 
The Board as a whole is responsible for maintaining regular dialogue 
with shareholders. The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director make 
presentations to institutional shareholders following the announcement of 
the interim and preliminary results each year, and are actively involved in 
an investor relations programme during the rest of the year. The Chairman 
is also responsible for maintaining a channel through which shareholders 
can express their views, and for communicating any shareholder issues or 
concerns to the Board as a whole. 
The Chief Executive makes a presentation at the Annual General Meeting 
highlighting key business developments during the year. All shareholders 
have the opportunity to put questions at the meeting or leave written 
questions, which will be answered in writing as soon as possible afterwards. 
A copy of the Chief Executive’s presentation may be requested at the Annual 
General Meeting or from the Investor Relations Department. The Company’s 
website at www.avis-europe.com provides current and historical information 
about the Group. 
Health and safety at work 
The Group has a health and safety policy approved by the Board. The  
Chief Executive is responsible for oversight of Group policy and each 
operating unit has a nominated member of senior management who has 
overall responsibility for setting goals and performance targets. Consistent 
measures of performance are reported on a quarterly basis, and include 
work-related accidents and ill health, health and safety training and risk 
assessment activities.
Charitable and political donations 
During the year, the Group made charitable donations totalling €29,000; 
£23,000 (2007: €52,000; £35,000). The Group made no political donations 
during the year (2007: nil).
Payments to creditors 
Given the number of countries in which the Group operates it is practice to 
agree the terms of payment at the start of business with each supplier and to 
pay in accordance with contractual and other legal obligations. The Company 
had no trade creditors at 31 December 2008 (2007: nil). At 31 December 
2008 the number of creditor days outstanding for the Company was nil 
(2007: nil).
Auditors 
The Audit Committee regularly monitors the non-audit services being 
provided to the Group by its external auditors, and has developed a formal 
independence policy to help ensure that there is no impairment to their 
independence or objectivity. The principles that underpin the provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditors are that the auditor should not: 
enter into arrangements with the Group which could compromise their 
independence as auditors; audit its own firm’s work; make management 
decisions for the Group; have a mutuality of financial interest with the Group 
(e.g. success fees) or provide legal and expert services to the Group in 
judicial or regulatory proceedings. Some types of service are proscribed while 
others that might be perceived to be in conflict with the role of the external 
auditor must be submitted to the Audit Committee for approval prior to 
engagement, regardless of the fees involved. 
Corporate	governance	 continued 	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2008  •  internal audit reviews and a schedule of annual finance reviews for all 
corporate businesses covering material local assets and liabilities; and
•  clearly defined Group policies and business standards, including the code 
of conduct, competition policy and covering key business areas. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal 
control through the following processes: 
• review of internal and external audit plans; 
• review of any significant reported unsatisfactory control matters; 
•  consideration of individual internal audit reports by the Chairman of the 
Committee; 
•  collective review of any control issues that arise from internal and external 
audits together with any additional matters brought to its attention; 
•  review of any significant risks identified by the Group’s risk management 
process; and 
•  discussions with management on any significant new risk areas identified 
by management and the internal and external audit processes. 
The Audit Committee has conducted a formal assessment of the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control through the review of an 
updated Internal Control Systems document prepared by the Group’s internal 
audit function. The document includes comprehensive descriptions of the risk 
management processes and controls environment, which together enable the 
Audit Committee to apply a structured approach to their review. 
The Board, with advice from the Audit Committee, has completed its  
annual review of the effectiveness of the embedded system of internal 
control in accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Report for the  
period since 1 January 2008 and is satisfied that this review is in 
accordance with that guidance. 
Assessment of business risk 
The Group views the active management of risk as a key management 
process and recognises that managing business risk to deliver opportunities 
is critical to the strategic development of the business. It is ensured that such 
business risks, covering strategic, operational, reputational, financial and 
environmental risks, are both understood and visible as far as practicable. 
The Group’s policy is to ensure that risk is taken on an informed rather than 
unintentional basis. 
The Group’s work in the area of risk management in 2008 was overseen 
by the Avis Executive Board, membership of which comprises heads of key 
business functions and of main corporate country operations and is chaired 
by the Chief Executive. 
The Group has a risk management framework which aims to ensure that 
the business understands the key risks it faces and has an embedded risk 
management approach to its activities; links risk management to business 
performance reporting and seeks improvement in the management of risk by 
sharing best practice throughout the organisation. The Group conducts an 
annual risk review across all operating units and updates its centrally held 
risk register with each risk’s impact, probability and mitigation actions. This 
approach forms the cornerstone of the risk management activities of the 
Group, the aim of which is to provide the Board with the assurance that the 
major risks facing the Group have been identified and assessed, and that 
there are controls either in place or planned to manage these risks. 
A summary of the principal risks facing the Group has been reviewed and 
approved by the Audit Committee and is provided in the Principal risks and 
uncertainties section of the Business Review on pages 16 to 18. 
Internal audit 
Avis Europe has an internal audit and risk management function, which is 
independent of the Group’s external auditors and which works in partnership 
with an outsourced provider, where specialist skills are required. The Audit 
Committee ensures that this function is appropriately staffed and that its 
scope of work is adequate in the light of the key identified risks facing 
the Group and the other monitoring functions in place. It also reviews and 
approves an annual internal audit plan and considers responses to an 
effectiveness questionnaire. 
The role of internal audit is to: 
•  assess the design and operating effectiveness of controls governing key 
operational processes and business risks; 
•  provide the Board with an assessment, independent of management, as 
to the adequacy of the Group’s internal operating and financial controls, 
systems and practices; 
•  assist the Board in meeting its corporate governance and regulatory 
responsibilities; and 
•  provide advisory services to management in order to enhance the control 
environment and improve business performance. 
Whistleblowing arrangements 
During the year, a Group-wide framework was in place enabling employees 
to raise any concerns. The arrangements are regularly reviewed by the Audit 
Committee and re-communicated periodically by management to ensure 
their continuing effectiveness. The process has been communicated to all 
employees across the Group and policy and procedures have been issued 
to management of all operating units providing guidance on how they are 
expected to respond. Matters can be raised anonymously, and employees are 
assured that they will have protection under the policy.
Corporate	 governance	 statement	 The Board of Directors confirm that the Company has complied throughout 
the financial year with the majority of the provisions set out in Section 1 of 
the Combined Code, except that the Company did not comply throughout 
the financial year with the following provisions: (1) the requirement that 
independent non-executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) should 
comprise not less than 50% of the Board; (2) the requirement that the 
Remuneration Committee should comprise the Chairman together with 
independent non-executive Directors; and (3) the requirement that a Senior 
Independent Director be nominated. The reasons for non-compliance in 
each of the relevant areas are explained within the review of the Company’s 
application of the principles of the Combined Code set out above. In the 
areas of non-compliance the Directors believe that current policy is in the 
best interests of the Company. 
Corporate	 governance 4 	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration Report and the Parent Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the Parent 
Company Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). The Consolidated and Parent Company Financial 
Statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group 
for that year. 
In preparing those Financial Statements, the Directors are required to: 
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; new 
accounting standards adopted in the year are set out in the Significant 
Accounting policies section of the Consolidated Financial Statements on 
pages 49 to 55; 
•  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
•  state that the Consolidated Financial Statements comply with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, and with regard to the Parent Company 
Financial Statements that applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
Financial Statements; and 
•  prepare the Consolidated and Parent Company Financial Statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group will continue in business, in which case there should be supporting 
assumptions or qualifications as necessary. 
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in 
preparing the Financial Statements. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the Consolidated 
Financial Statements and Remuneration Report comply with the Companies 
Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and the Parent Company 
Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the relevant requirements 
of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. The Board has given full 
consideration to the best practice provisions on Directors’ remuneration as 
set out in the Combined Code. As required by the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report Regulations, a resolution to approve the Remuneration Report will 
be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company at 
which the Financial Statements will be approved.

Membership 
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of non-executive Directors. 
Members during the period 1 January 2008 to 3 March 2009 are  
listed below: 
•  Pierre Alain De Smedt (Chairman from 29 May 2008; appointed to the 
Committee 27 February 2008) 
• Alun Cathcart
• Les Cullen
• Roland D’Ieteren
•  Malcolm Miller (Chairman 1 January 2008 – 28 May 2008; resigned from 
the Committee 28 May 2008)
• Dr Axel von Ruedorffer
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of the Chairman of the Board 
and four non-executive Directors. All the non-executive Directors on the 
Committee are regarded as independent, with the exception of Roland 
D’Ieteren, as explained on page 30 of the Corporate Governance report. The 
Committee met six times during the year and each member’s attendance at 
these meetings is shown in the Corporate Governance report on page 30. 
Advisers 
During the period under review the Chief Executive, the Group HR and 
Corporate Affairs Director (until her retirement on 4 July 2008) and thereafter 
the Group HR Director attended meetings by invitation and provided advice 
to the Committee to help it make informed decisions on matters relating to 
Directors’ performance and remuneration. No Director was present when his 
or her own remuneration was being discussed. External advice was received 
from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (share scheme rules) and Kepler 
Associates (executive remuneration). All advisers were appointed by the 
Company. Other than described above, no additional services were provided 
by the external advisers during the year. 
Remuneration	 policy
Introduction 
The Group’s policy relating to the remuneration and benefits of executive and 
non-executive Directors is reviewed periodically. The executive remuneration 
policy for 2009 is designed to attract, retain and motivate to ensure that the 
Company secures the appropriate competencies and experience the Group 
needs to meet its objectives and satisfy shareholder expectations. In general, 
in determining its policy, the Remuneration Committee takes account of 
market practice, the Group’s position relative to other companies and the pay 
and employment conditions of other Group employees. 
In 2008 executive salaries were frozen as part of a three-year programme 
implemented for 2006 – 2008 inclusive. Directors and members of the 
AEB received an annual incentive opportunity of up to 100% of salary and 
received a further grant under the Long Term Incentive Plan introduced in 
2007 and described below.
For 2009 executive salaries were again frozen and the AEB was given an 
annual incentive opportunity of up to 100% of salary linked to targets which 
will reflect the key challenges of the business.
Summary of executive Directors’ potential direct remuneration 
The Remuneration Committee believes that shareholder interests are 
best served by remuneration packages that have a large component of 
performance related pay. For 2009 the relationship between fixed and 
variable remuneration for achievement of maximum performance for the 
Chief Executive is 35% fixed, 65% variable, and for the Group Finance 
Director is 40% fixed and 60% variable. The variable element comprises 
the annual incentive scheme and an award under the Long Term Incentive 
Plan. The Deputy Chairman, who is also an executive Director, has a service 
contract with an annual fee only.
Salary 
The general policy on base salary is to benchmark using general market 
external surveys against the median of similar sized companies relevant to the 
appropriate marketplace. In considering whether to make any increase to base 
salaries, the Remuneration Committee takes into account the performance  
of individual executives and the general increases for employees across  
the Group. The next benchmarking exercise will be undertaken in 2009. 
Annual incentive bonus 
Annual incentive bonus plans for executive Directors and key senior 
management are based on achievement of targets approved by the 
Remuneration Committee and related directly to the annual profit plan 
approved by the Board. Targets and performance measures are quantitative 
and there is a financial threshold below which no bonus payment is made. 
In 2009, 90% of the bonus is based on stretching financial targets and 10% 
on achievement of quantitative individual objectives.
The base salary, bonus payments and value of benefits in kind for each 
Director are set out in the Directors’ emoluments table on page 39. Bonus 
payments, benefits in kind and cash allowances do not form part of 
pensionable earnings for Directors. 
Share	 incentive	 policy	 The Remuneration Committee sets policy with regard to share incentives with 
the objective of aligning incentive plans with the Group’s medium-term plan 
and shareholders’ interests.
Shareholding guidelines implemented in 2005 require executive Directors to 
build up their personal holdings of shares in the Company. The guidelines 
are 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for other 
executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee requires executives to 
retain 50% of any vested shares (net of tax and exercise costs) arising from 
any share or option plan until the shareholding requirement is achieved. 
Outstanding share plans 
Outstanding share plans are as follows: Long Term Incentive Plan (last award 
2008); Performance Share Plan (last award April 2004) and Share Option 
Schemes (last award April 2004). A description of each of these plans is set 
out below. The assessment of whether performance conditions have been 
met is verified by the Remuneration Committee at the time of vesting. 
Individual Directors’ share incentive awards are set out on pages 41 and 42. 
Long Term Incentive Plan 
The Long Term Incentive Plan comprises conditional awards which take the 
form of nil cost options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company, and was 
Corporate	 governance 6 	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
introduced by the Remuneration Committee in 2007. Awards vest three years 
after grant, providing certain performance conditions are met. It is intended 
that there will be annual grants of awards under this Plan.
The performance conditions required for vesting purposes are based 50% 
on the Group’s three-year growth in earnings per share (EPS) and 50% 
on return on capital employed (ROCE). If one or both of the performance 
targets are not met at the end of the performance period, 50% or 100% (as 
appropriate) of the award will lapse immediately. 
 
The performance targets for awards granted under the Plan in 2007 are set 
out below:

Percentage growth in EPS Percentage of award that vests
Less than RPI + 20% per annum None
RPI + 20% per annum 20%

out below:
EPS tranche of Award  
Percentage growth in EPS Percentage of award that vests
Less than 14.9% per annum None
14.9% per annum 20%

Less than 9.2% None
9.2% 20%

Between 9.2% and 9.6% Straight-line basis between 
 20% and 100%
EPS is calculated on an underlying basis i.e. excluding exceptional items, 
certain re-measurement items and economic hedge items. However, the 
Remuneration Committee has discretion to adjust for exceptional items 
it deems to be within management control, if appropriate, to ensure the 
outcome is fair to both shareholders and executives. The basis of the ROCE 
calculation is included in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The two measures of EPS and ROCE are considered by the Remuneration 
Committee to be the most relevant all-encompassing long-term performance 
measures for Avis Europe in that the ultimate aim of the business of the 
Group is to achieve a good economic return on renting its fleet of vehicles. 
The fleet represents the substantial majority of capital employed, and the 
Remuneration Committee wishes management to be focussed on improving 
the return the Company achieves on this capital. Management will focus 
on the key drivers of ROCE - asset turn and operating margin. EPS in turn 
represents a complete measure of bottom-line performance, capturing both 
interest and tax, and is closely tracked by many of the Company’s investors. 
Participation is at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion. In 2008 awards 
were made to all members of the AEB, which included three of the executive 
Directors, and to 20 senior managers. Maximum awards are capped at 
100% of salary (150% for the Chief Executive) (see page 41). In 2008 
awards at this maximum level were granted to new members of the AEB; 
the executive Directors and other AEB members received awards over one 
half the maximum level, and the senior managers received awards over one 
quarter of the maximum level. Dividends, as and when reinstated, will not 
accrue on the awards made to date, but it is anticipated that for awards 
granted in future, dividends would accrue and be paid only on shares that 
vest. Outstanding awards will vest and become exercisable on a change of 
control subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time. 
Performance Share Plan 
No awards under this Plan have been made since April 2004 and it is not 
anticipated that awards will be made in the future. The Performance Share 
Plan is a seven-year plan, and was designed to encourage executives to 
focus on longer-term performance and growth in shareholder value. A 
combination of performance targets was chosen for the measurement of 
the Company’s performance, being total shareholder return (TSR) and EPS 
in order to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders. EPS 
performance is calculated from the audited accounts and TSR is calculated 
by external remuneration consultants. 
Awards were determined by the Remuneration Committee and could not be 
greater than 100% of the qualifying participant’s total annual remuneration 
measured at the date of the award. No award granted to date has exceeded 
one times annual salary. Awards vest over a period of seven years from the 
date of the award. If the performance conditions are met at the third and fifth 
anniversary of the date of award, vesting accelerates to the extent of 25% of 
the award on each of these occasions. The extent to which an award vests 
is determined by the Group’s medium and long-term performance measured 
in terms of TSR. TSR was measured against a broad comparator group from 
the Transport and Support Services sectors. 
On a change of control the Remuneration Committee would take into account 
the performance conditions when determining the vesting of awards. 
Share option schemes 
No options have been granted under these schemes since April 2004,  
and it is not anticipated that awards will be made in the future.  
Further details of share options are set out in Note 32 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
The Group operates Inland Revenue approved and unapproved share option 
schemes which have an EPS based performance condition. An EPS condition 
is considered appropriate, as it requires improvement in the underlying 
Remuneration	report	 continued 	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2008 7
financial performance before options can be exercised. Employees may not 
normally exercise options earlier than three years, nor more than 10 years 
after the grant (seven years for grants made before April 2000 for the 
unapproved scheme). Options lapse upon cessation of employment. However, 
special conditions apply if employment ceases because of death, injury, 
disability, redundancy, retirement or because the employing business or 
company is transferred outside the Group, or for any other reason at the 
discretion of the Board. Outstanding options will vest and become exercisable 
on a change of control and with the exception of the UK Approved Share 
Option Scheme, any options vesting will, at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee, be subject to the satisfaction of any performance 
conditions at that time. 
Options (all of which were granted prior to 2004) become exercisable 
when real growth in EPS exceeds 3% per annum during any period of 
three consecutive years following the date of grant. The rules of the share 
option schemes limit the number of options that can be granted over new 
issue shares in a rolling 10-year period to 5% of issued share capital 
under discretionary share schemes, and 10% of issued share capital under 
all share schemes. The total number of share options outstanding at 31 
December 2008 is well within these dilution limits (see page 42). 
During 2008 all outstanding awards under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan 
and the Share Retention Plan were released. No awards remain outstanding 
under these schemes as at 31 December 2008. 
2006 Deferred Bonus Share Plan 
During 2006, the Avis Europe plc Deferred Bonus Share Plan was 
established as part of the Remuneration Committee’s decision to enhance 
bonus opportunities for 2006. There are no outstanding awards under  
this plan.
Share Retention Plan
This Plan was established as a one-off discretionary benefit to retain the 
services of Murray Hennessy (former Chief Executive) to January 2008 
and there were no performance conditions other than continued service to 
1 January 2008. The award vested in three equal tranches on 1 January 
2006, 1 January 2007 and 1 January 2008. In respect of the third tranche, 
the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion under the rules of 
the Plan to permit this award to vest on the date of Murray Hennessy’s 
termination of employment on 31 December 2007, and was exercised in 
March 2008. 
Avis Europe Employee Share Trust 
The Avis Europe Employee Share Trust was established in March 2000 to 
facilitate provision of shares for the Company’s share incentive schemes.  
The Trust may hold up to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company at 
any one time. 
At 31 December 2008, the Trust held 637,735 shares. It is intended that 
the shares in the Trust will be used to satisfy conditional share awards made 
under the Company’s various share incentive schemes as and when these 
awards vest. The awards outstanding under each of the relevant Plans at  
31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008 are set out below: 
 
  Conditional share awards  Conditional share awards  
 outstanding at   outstanding at
Share Incentive Scheme  31 December 2008 31 December 2007
Performance Share Plan  514,875 shares 702,727 shares
Long Term Incentive Plan  31,274,278 shares 4,908,092 shares
Share Retention Plan  – 238,600 shares
Deferred Bonus Share Plan  – 3,124,452 shares
Total  31,789,153 shares 8,973,871 shares
The Company periodically reviews the number of shares held by the Trust 
in light of the anticipated vesting dates and performance conditions under 
the various plans. The Company also regularly reviews its hedging policy 
but does not currently hedge any of these awards against potential Social 
Security costs that may be incurred across the Group as and when the 
awards vest. 
Total	 shareholder	 return	 (TSR)
The graph below illustrates the performance of Avis Europe plc and a “broad 
equity market index” over the past five years. As Avis Europe plc has been a 
constituent of the FTSE All Share Index throughout this five-year period, that 
index is considered the most appropriate form of “broad equity market index” 
against which the Group’s performance should be graphed. As required by 
legislation, performance is measured by total shareholder return (share price 
plus dividends paid). 
 
All dates at 31 December.
This graph shows the value, by the end of 2008, of £100 invested in Avis Europe plc on 31 
December 2003 compared with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE All Share Index. The other 
points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends. 
Non-executive	 Directors	 Non-executive Directors’ fees are positioned to attract non-executives 
with broad business and commercial experience and to be competitive in 
the marketplace. The Chairman’s fee is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee. The Chairman and the Chief Executive set the remuneration 
of non-executive Directors based on periodic review of current survey 
data. Policy is to pay an annual fee of £32,500 with an additional fee for 
chairmanship of a committee. Non-executive Directors do not receive awards 
under the Company’s share incentive schemes.

Service	 contracts
Executive Directors 
The Company’s policy is to employ each executive Director under a service 
contract which is subject to 12 months’ notice on either side and runs until 
terminated. The contract provides for salary to be paid for any unexpired 
period of notice in the event of termination by the Company. Compensation 
for contractual benefits and bonus for the unexpired period of notice is at 
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. There is no compensation for 
loss of rights under the share and pension schemes. All contracts contain 
mitigation provisions. There are no special contractual payments associated 
with change of control. 
All executive Directors have service contracts in line with policy as shown.

appointment is subject to the terms of the Relationship Agreement (see page 29).
2 Lesley Colyer retired as a Director on 4 July 2008.
3 Simon Palethorpe resigned as a Director on 21 November 2008.
The Board believes that it can be of benefit to Avis Europe plc if its executive 
Directors serve as non-executive Directors of other companies, and, subject 
to individual review, the general policy is that an executive Director may hold 
one non-executive directorship with another company and may retain the 
fees. During the year ended 31 December 2008, no executive Director held 
any external directorships. 
Non-executive Directors 
The Company’s policy is to engage non-executive Directors on renewable 
three-year terms, which can be terminated by either party at any time without 
penalty (subject to the terms of the Relationship Agreement in respect of 
Directors appointed by s.a. D’Ieteren n.v.). Non-executive Directors are 
required to offer themselves for election at the next Annual General Meeting 
following their appointment and thereafter for re-election every three years.

Retirement	 benefits
Executive Directors based in the UK can participate in the Avis UK Pension 
Plan. The Plan comprises two sections: the Final Salary section (defined 
benefit) and the Retirement Capital Plan section (cash balance). The non-
contributory Final Salary section was closed to new entrants from 1 July 
2003, and closed to future service accruals for active members from 1 
April 2007. New members to the Plan since 1 July 2003 have joined the 
contributory Retirement Capital Plan section and, from 1 April 2007, active 
members of the Final Salary section accrue their future service benefits 
under the Retirement Capital Plan section. 
Under the Retirement Capital Plan section, for those executive Directors who 
are members of the Plan, an allocation of 25% of their pensionable salary is 
made to a notional account. Each year the account balance is revalued by 
inflation up to 10%, although the Company may at its absolute discretion and 
subject to actuarial advice apply a greater rate of revaluation. At retirement 
the balance in the account will be used to purchase an annuity. Pensionable 
salary for executive Directors excludes bonus payments, taxable benefits and 
cash allowances. 
From 6 April 2006, the HM Revenue & Customs legislation relating to tax-
favoured retirement provisions took effect. From that date Avis introduced 
a scheme specific earnings cap for all members who joined the Plan on or 
after 1 June 1989. For the 2008-09 tax year, the cap is £117,600. Those 
executive Directors whose pensionable salary is subject to the cap receive a 
taxable cash allowance of 20% of base salary above the cap. 
During 2008 three executive Directors accrued benefits under the Avis UK 
Pension Plan and as at 31 December 2008, the retirement benefits are as 
follows. 
Lesley Colyer accrued benefits under the Final Salary section for pensionable 
service until 1 April 2007, and her pensionable service to that date continued 
to be linked to her pensionable salary until she withdrew from pensionable 
service effective 4 July 2008. From 1 April 2007 she accrued benefits in 
the Retirement Capital section until she withdrew from pensionable service 
effective 4 July 2008. Her pensionable salary was not subject to the scheme 
specific earnings cap.
Simon Palethorpe was a member of the Retirement Capital section in respect 
of all his pensionable service until he withdrew from the Plan effective 21 
November 2008. His pensionable salary was subject to the scheme specific 
earnings cap and he received a taxable cash allowance as described above. 
Martyn Smith withdrew from the Plan effective 5 April 2006 and has a 
preserved pension entitlement under the Final Salary section. From that 
date he receives a taxable cash allowance of 20% of base salary in lieu of 
Pension Plan membership. 
Pascal Bazin does not participate in any Avis occupational pension plan.

1 Alun Cathcart is no longer accruing a benefit in the Avis UK Pension Plan and has been in receipt of a pension from 12 September 2005. In the year to 31 December 2008 he received a pension of 
£310,016 (2007: £301,811). 
2 Lesley Colyer was a former member of the Final Salary section of the Avis UK Pension Plan and elected to join the Retirement Capital Plan section following the Plan changes on 1 April 2007. The 
Retirement Capital Plan section is a cash balance arrangement to which the Director and the Company contribute. Each year, an amount equal to 25% of basic salary is credited to a notional account.  
At 1 April each year after the first year, the account balance is revalued by the rate of inflation over the preceding calendar year, subject to a maximum of 10%. The Company may at its absolute 
discretion and subject to actuarial advice apply a greater rate of revaluation. At retirement the account will have been built up from each year’s annual credit plus the annual revaluation amount, and  
the balance in the account will be used to purchase an annuity on behalf of the Director. In the year to 31 December 2008 the value of the Company’s contribution to the Retirement Capital Plan  
section in respect of Lesley Colyer was £107,759 (2007: £37,488). Lesley Colyer retired on 4 July 2008 and received a lump sum of £149,198 and pension after reduction for early retirement of 
£91,822 per annum. 
3 Gilbert van Marcke de Lummen retired from the Board on 28 May 2008. He has not been accruing benefit in the Avis UK Pension Plan since 1 May 2002 from which date he has been in receipt of  
a pension. In the year to 31 December 2008 he received a pension of £145,481 (2007: £141,611). 
4 Simon Palethorpe was a member of the Retirement Capital Plan section of the Avis UK Pension Plan until his resignation on 21 November 2008. In the year to 31 December 2008 the value of the 
Company’s contribution was £4,545 (2007: £6,519). 
5 Martyn Smith left the Avis UK Pension Plan on 5 April 2006 and received a deferred pension of £6,160 per annum payable from age 62.

1 In respect of L Colyer and S Palethorpe, who left the Company on 4 July 2008 and 21 November 2008 respectively, the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion under the Plan rules to  
allow a proportion of their awards under the Plan to vest on the Vesting Date, subject to the performance conditions attached to the awards being satisfied.
Performance conditions
The performance conditions required for vesting purposes are based 50% on the Company’s three-year growth in EPS and 50% on ROCE, based on the 
Group’s results under the International Financial Reporting Standards. These targets are set such that shares will vest only if performance is between a 
minimum threshold level, where 20% of an award will vest, and the maximum level, where 100% of an award will vest. 
At 31 December 2008, 35 qualifying employees and qualifying former employees, including Executive Directors, held options over 31,274,278 shares in total 
under this Plan. The market price of the Company’s shares at 31 December 2008 was 3.93 pence. During the year, the market price ranged between 3.01 
pence and 40.5 pence. 
2006 Deferred Bonus Share Plan
The following awards were made under this Plan on 5 June 2007. The market price of the Company’s shares at that date was 60.25 pence. All awards vested 
on 19 March 2008 and were exercised within three months from that date as provided for under the Plan rules. There are no awards outstanding under this 
Plan.

Performance conditions
The performance conditions applying to the Performance Share Plan have been based on the performance of the Company in relation to the TSR of a peer 
group, together with an EPS underpin. 
For the awards to vest, TSR at the end of each performance period must be at least at the median in relation to the comparator group and there has to be a 
minimum real increase in EPS of 3% per annum over the relevant period. 
Corporate	 governance 42	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
Remuneration	report	 continued
If both these conditions are met, 50% of the award may vest. For full vesting, the EPS target must be met and the Group’s TSR must be in the top quartile of 
the comparator group over the seven-year period. TSR achievement between the median and 75th percentile results in vesting between 50% and 100% of the 
award on a pro rata basis. 
The comparator group for TSR for awards made in 2003 comprises the companies listed below: 
Arena Leisure plc, Arriva plc, Associated British Ports Holdings plc, Eurotunnel plc/Eurotunnel SA, First Choice Holidays plc, First Group plc, Go-Ahead Group 
plc, RAC plc, Minorplanet Systems plc, Mitie Group plc, MyTravel Group plc, National Express Group plc, Christian Salvesen plc, Stagecoach Holdings plc, TBI 
plc, Tibbett & Britten Group plc.

4 Gilbert van Marcke de Lummen retired from the Board on 28 May 2008.
5 Malcolm Miller resigned as a Director on 28 May 2008.
Performance conditions
The performance conditions applying to the share option schemes have been based on real growth in EPS. 
Options granted before 2004 become exercisable when real growth in EPS exceeds 3% per annum during any period of three consecutive years following the 
date of grant. Only options shown as having an exercisable date of March 2000 have satisfied this performance condition. 
Options granted in 2004 become exercisable when real growth in EPS during the three-year period 2004 to 2006 exceeds 10% per annum compound. For 
30% of the options to be exercisable there must be real minimum growth of 5% per annum compound. Vesting is on a straight-line basis for EPS growth 
between these targets. There is no re-testing and as the performance conditions relating to options granted in 2004 have not been met, these options have 
lapsed. 
At 31 December 2008, 201 qualifying employees held options over 2,899,221 shares. No options were granted in 2008. The market price of the Company’s 
shares at 31 December 2008 was 3.93 pence. During the year, the market price ranged between 3.01 pence and 40.5 pence.

Independent	Auditors’	Report	to	the	Members	of	Avis	Europe	plc	 Introduction
We have audited the Group Financial Statements of Avis Europe plc for the  
year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the 
Significant Accounting Policies and the related notes. These Group Financial 
Statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the Parent Company Financial Statements  
of Avis Europe plc for the year ended 31 December 2008 and on the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as  
having been audited.
Respective	 responsibilities	 of	 Directors	 and	 auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group 
Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union  
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group Financial Statements in accordance  
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared 
for and only for the Company’s Members as a body in accordance with Section 
235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any 
other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group Financial Statements 
give a true and fair view and whether the Group Financial Statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion  
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group 
Financial Statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes 
that specific information presented in the Business Review, the Corporate 
Governance Statement and the sections of the Remuneration Report that are 
referred to as audited that are cross referred from the Business Review section 
of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information 
specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions  
is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the Combined Code (2006) 
specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, 
and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the 
Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures 
or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider 
whether it is consistent with the audited Group Financial Statements. The other 
information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s 
Review, the Business Review, the Corporate and Social Responsibility Report, 
the Directors Listing, the Corporate Governance Statement, the Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities, the unaudited part of the Remuneration Report and 
the Five Year Summary. We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies  
with the Group Financial Statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to  
any other information.
Basis	 of	 audit	 opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes 
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and 
disclosures in the Group Financial Statements. It also includes an assessment 
of the significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the 
preparation of the Group Financial Statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and 
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group Financial 
Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group Financial Statements. 
Opinion
In our opinion:
•  the Group Financial Statements give a true and fair view, in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2008 and of its loss and cash flows for the year 
then ended;
•  the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
•  the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group 
Financial Statements.

Financial	 statements
Significant	Accounting	Policies
Applicable to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008
Basis	 of	 preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European 
Union, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 
interpretations and the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. Avis Europe plc is a public limited company incorporated, listed and 
domiciled in the UK. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention and are prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out below, which are consistent with those 
followed in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2007, except for the adoption of the following:
New standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards  
that are effective
IFRIC 11, IFRS 2, Group and treasury share transactions (effective from  
1 January 2008) provides guidance on applying IFRS 2. Where share-based 
payments involve an entity’s own equity instruments and the entity chooses  
or is required to buy its own equity instruments (treasury shares) to settle the 
share-based payment obligation, these should be accounted for as an equity-
settled share-based transaction under IFRS 2. This amendment has not had  
a significant impact on the treatment of the Group’s share-based payments.
IFRIC 12, Service concession arrangements (effective from 1 January 2008) 
provides guidance on the treatment of government service concession 
arrangements and is deemed not relevant to the Group’s operations.
IFRIC 14, The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements 
and their interaction (effective from 1 January 2008) provides guidance on  
the recognition of defined benefit assets in conjunction with minimum funding 
requirements (MFRs). The extent to which an asset may be recognised is 
dependent upon the entity’s entitlement to a future refund or reduction in 
contributions, and the existence of an MFR may give rise to an additional 
liability if contributions are not available to the entity once they have been paid. 
This amendment has not impacted on the amounts recognised under defined 
benefit schemes.
IAS 39 and IFRS 7 reclassification of financial instruments (applicable immediately 
and retrospectively) permit the reclassification of some financial assets. The 
amendments address the differences between the reclassification requirements 
of IAS 39 and US GAAP and are effective immediately. The amendments do not 
affect the classification of any of the Group’s financial assets.
Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are  
not yet effective
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards 
have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009 or later periods, but which the Group  
has not adopted early, as follows:
IFRIC 13, Customer loyalty programmes (effective from 1 July 2008) provides 
guidance on the treatment of customer loyalty programmes. An entity shall 
account for award credits which are granted as part of customer loyalty 
programmes as separately identifiable components of a sales transaction.  
The fair value of the consideration received or receivable in respect of the initial 
sale shall be allocated between the award credits and the other components  
of the sale. The Group believes that this amendment will not have a significant 
impact on the treatment of the Group’s customer loyalty programmes.
IFRIC 15, Agreements for the construction of real estate (effective from  
1 January 2009) addresses the accounting for revenue and associated 
expenses by entities that undertake the construction of real estate and is 
deemed not relevant to the Group’s operations.
IFRIC 16, Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (effective from  
1 October 2008) provides guidance on net investment hedging, including: 
•  which foreign currency risks qualify for hedge accounting and the amount 
that may be designated;
• where within the Group the hedging instrument may be held; and
•  the amount which is reclassified to the Income Statement upon disposal  
of the hedged foreign operation.
The Group anticipates that this amendment will have no impact upon its 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
IFRS 8, Operating segments (effective from 1 January 2009) requires an entity 
to adopt a “management approach” to segment reporting such that segmental 
information is the information which management uses internally for calculating 
segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to operating 
segments. This information may be different from that used to prepare the 
Income Statement and Balance Sheet. Management does not anticipate that 
the introduction of IFRS 8 will have a significant impact on the Group’s 
segmental disclosures. The Group will apply IFRS 8 from annual periods 
beginning 1 January 2009.
IAS 1 revised 2007 (effective from 1 January 2009) is mandatory for accounting 
periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009. Upon adoption, the Income 
Statement and Statement of Changes in Equity will be replaced by a Statement 
of Comprehensive Income. Other principal statements will also be renamed.
IAS 19 (Amendment), Employee benefits (effective from 1 January 2009),  
is part of the IASB’s annual improvements project published in May 2008.  
The amendment clarifies that a plan amendment that results in a change in  
the extent to which benefit promises are affected by future salary increases is 
a curtailment, while an amendment that changes benefits attributable to past 
service gives rise to a negative past service cost if it results in a reduction in 
the present value of the defined benefit obligation. The definition of return on 
plan assets has been amended to state that plan administration costs are 
deducted in the calculation of return on plan assets only to the extent that such 
costs have been excluded from measurement of the defined benefit obligation. 
The distinction between short-term and long-term employee benefits will be 
based on whether benefits are due to be settled within or after 12 months of 
employee service being rendered.
IAS 37, Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, requires 
contingent liabilities to be disclosed, not recognised. IAS 19 has been  
amended to be consistent. The Group will apply the IAS 19 (Amendment)  
from 1 January 2009.
IAS 23 (Revised), Borrowing costs (effective from 1 January 2009) removes the 
option of immediately recognising borrowing costs as an expense which relates 
to assets that take a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended 
use. This is not expected to have any material impact on the Group’s 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 50	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
IAS 32 (Amendment), Financial instruments: Presentation, and IAS 1 
(Amendment), Presentation of financial statements – Puttable financial 
instruments and obligations arising on liquidation (effective from 1 January 
2009) require certain instruments to be classified as equity puttable financial 
instruments. Such instruments include those that impose on the entity an 
obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the 
entity upon liquidation. The Group will apply the IAS 32 and IAS 1(Amendment) 
from 1 January 2009. This amendment is not expected to have any impact on 
the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
IAS 38 (Amendment), Intangible assets (effective from 1 January 2009)  
is part of the IASB’s annual improvements project published in May 2008.  
A prepayment may only be recognised in the event that payment has been 
made in advance of obtaining right of access to goods or receipt of services. 
The Group will apply the IAS 38 (Amendment) from 1 January 2009. The 
amendment is not expected to have any impact upon the Group’s Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
IAS 39 (Amendment), Eligible hedged items (effective from 1 January 2009): 
the current guidance on designating and documenting hedges states that a 
hedging instrument needs to involve a party external to the reporting entity and 
cites a segment as an example of a reporting entity. This means that in order 
for hedge accounting to be applied at segment level, the requirements for 
hedge accounting are currently required to be met by the applicable segment. 
The amendment removes the example of a segment so that the guidance is 
consistent with IFRS 8, Operating segments, which requires disclosure for 
segments to be based on information reported to the chief operating decision-
maker. This amendment is expected to have no impact upon the Group’s 
hedging activities.
IFRS 1 (Amendment) (effective 1 January 2009) and IAS 27 (Revised) (part of 
annual improvements – deletion of cost method) (effective from 1 July 2009) 
allows first-time adopters to use a deemed cost of either fair value or the 
carrying amount under previous accounting practice to measure the initial cost 
of investments in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates in the 
separate financial statements. The amendment also removes the definition of 
the cost method from IAS 27 and replaces it with a requirement to present 
dividends as income in the separate financial statements of the investor. The 
Group will apply IFRS 1 (Amendment) from 1 January 2009. The amendment 
will not have any impact on the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
The revised standard also requires the effects of all transactions with non-
controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control 
and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses and 
specifies the accounting when control is lost. Any remaining interest in the 
entity is re-measured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or 
loss. The Group will apply IAS 27 (Revised) prospectively to transactions with 
non-controlling interests from 1 January 2010.
IFRS 2 vesting conditions and cancellations (effective from 1 January 2009) 
deals with vesting conditions and cancellations. It clarifies that vesting 
conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only. Other 
features of a share-based payment are not vesting conditions. These features 
would need to be included in the grant date fair value calculation for 
transactions with employees and others providing similar services; they would 
not impact the number of awards expected to vest or valuation thereof 
subsequent to grant date. All cancellations, whether by the entity or by other 
parties, should receive the same accounting treatment. The Group will apply 
IFRS 2 (Amendment) from 1 January 2009, but it is not expected to have any 
impact on the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
IFRS 3 revised 2008 (effective from 1 July 2009) continues to apply the 
acquisition method to business combinations, with some significant changes. 
For example, all payments to purchase a business are to be recorded at fair 
value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments classified as debt 
subsequently re-measured through the Income Statement. There is a choice  
on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis to measure the non-controlling interest 
in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. All acquisition-related costs 
should be expensed. The Group will apply IFRS 3 (Revised) prospectively to all 
business combinations from 1 January 2010.
IFRS 5 (Amendment), Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued 
operations (and consequential amendment to IFRS 1, First-time adoption) 
(effective from 1 July 2009) clarifies that all of a subsidiary’s assets and 
liabilities are classified as held for sale if a partial disposal sale plan results  
in loss of control. Relevant disclosure should be made for this subsidiary if  
the definition of a discontinued operation is met. A consequential amendment 
to IFRS 1 states that these amendments are applied prospectively from the 
date of transition to IFRSs. The Group will apply the IFRS 5 (Amendment) 
prospectively to all partial disposals of subsidiaries from 1 January 2010.
Underlying	 measures
In addition to total performance measures, the Group discloses additional 
underlying performance measures, including underlying profit and underlying 
earnings per share. The Group believes that these underlying performance 
measures provide additional useful information on underlying trends. The term 
“underlying” is not defined under IFRS, and may therefore not be comparable 
with similarly titled profit measurements reported by other companies. It is not 
intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures of profit.
Underlying measures are calculated based on reported profit before exceptional 
items, certain re-measurement items and adjustments to reflect the realised 
gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts and accrued interest 
cash flows on certain derivative financial instruments (economic hedge 
adjustments). These are detailed below.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are material non-recurring items that derive from events  
or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group, and which 
individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, are separately disclosed by 
virtue of their size or incidence.
Certain re-measurement items
Items that represent re-measurement of underlying assets or liabilities  
(for example due to interest rate or exchange rate changes) are presented as 
certain re-measurement items. Events which may give rise to the classification 
of gains and losses as certain re-measurement items include the following:
a)  recognised fair value gains and losses on derivatives in accordance with  
the financial instruments and hedge accounting policy below;
b)  exchange gains and losses arising upon the translation of foreign  
currency borrowings at the closing rate; and
c)  actuarial gains and losses arising on defined benefit retirement  
benefit schemes.
Economic hedge adjustments
Under IAS 39, the Group applies hedge accounting to hedge relationships 
(primarily forward exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and 
interest rate swaps) where it is both permissible and practicable to do so.  
Due to the nature of its economic hedging relationships, in a number of

Financial	 statements
Associate undertakings
Investments in the associate undertaking are accounted for using the equity 
method and are initially recognised at cost. This is an undertaking over which 
the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanied by  
a share of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. The Group’s share of 
profit from the associate represents the Group’s share of the associate’s profit 
after tax. 
Segment	 reporting
The Group’s primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary 
format is geographical segments. A business segment is a component of the 
Group that is engaged in providing a group of related products and services, 
and is subject to risks and returns that are different from those other business 
segments. A geographical segment is a component of the Group that operates 
within a particular economic environment and this is subject to risks and 
returns that are different from those of components operating in other 
economic environments.
Revenue
Revenue includes vehicle rental income, fees from the provision of services 
incidental to vehicle rental (such as the sale of fuel, sub-licensee income and 
the provision of foreign exchange services to rental customers), fees receivable 
from licensees net of discounts and excludes inter-company sales, value added 
and sales taxes. 
When the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services (including 
the provision of licence rights) can be estimated reliably, revenue associated 
with the transaction is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of 
the transaction at the balance sheet date. The outcome of a transaction can  
be estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied:
a) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
b)  it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction  
will flow to the Group;
c)  the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can  
be measured reliably; and
d)  the cost incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the 
transaction can be measured reliably.
Cost	 of	 sales
Cost of sales includes selling, revenue and rental related costs (e.g. commissions 
and credit card fees) and vehicle costs. Contributions to vehicle costs from 
suppliers are credited over the holding period of the related vehicles. Any such 
contributions dependent on performance criteria are recognised in the Income 
Statement only to the extent that it is considered probable that the criteria will  
be met.
Administrative	 expenses
Administrative expenses are recognised as an expense in the period in which 
they are incurred and include staff costs, non-vehicle related rental charges 
and other overheads. 
Finance	 costs
Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they  
are incurred.
Share-based	 payments
Share-based payments are exclusively made in connection with employee 
share option plans (ESOPs). 
 
circumstances the Group is unable to apply hedge accounting to these 
derivatives. The Group continues, however, to enter into these arrangements  
as they provide certainty of the exchange rates applying to the foreign currency 
transactions entered into by the Group and the interest rate on the Group’s 
debt. These arrangements result in fixed and determined cash flows. The Group 
believes that these arrangements remain effective as economic hedges, and 
therefore adjustment is made to reported profit measures such that the 
underlying profit reflects full application of hedge accounting.
Functional	 currency
The functional currency of the Company is sterling. However, as a significant 
proportion of the Group’s revenues, costs, assets and funding arise in euro,  
the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group are presented in euro. 
Basis	 of	 consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise a consolidation of the 
accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. 
The accounting reference dates of certain of the Group’s subsidiary 
undertakings and its associated undertaking are governed by local 
requirements and are not coterminous with the Group’s 31 December year 
end. For those companies with non-coterminous year ends, management 
accounts for the relevant period to 31 December have been consolidated.  
The main subsidiary undertaking with such a non-coterminous year end is  
Avis Autonoleggio SpA (30 June). In the opinion of the Directors, the expense  
of providing additional coterminous statutory accounts, together with potential 
consequential delay in producing the Group’s Consolidated Financial 
Statements, would outweigh any benefit to the shareholders.
Subsidiary undertakings
Subsidiary undertakings are those entities in which the Group has, directly or 
indirectly, an interest of more than half of the voting rights or otherwise has the 
power to exercise control over the operations. Subsidiaries are consolidated 
from the date that control is transferred to the Group and are no longer 
consolidated from the date that control ceases. Subsidiaries are accounted for 
using the acquisition method of accounting. All inter-company transactions, 
balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are 
eliminated upon consolidation. 
Minority interests
The amount of profits or losses for a reporting period allocated to minority 
interests is adjusted (and separately disclosed in the Income Statement) 
against income of the Group for the year.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and one or more 
parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control. Joint 
control is when the strategic, financial and operating policy decisions relating  
to the activity require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Interests in joint ventures are recognised using the equity method. Unrealised 
gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures  
are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures.  
The Group’s investment in joint ventures includes goodwill on acquisition.  
The Group’s share of profit from joint ventures represents the Group’s share  
of the joint venture’s profit after tax. If the Group’s share of losses in a joint 
venture equals or exceeds its investment in the joint venture, the Group does 
not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the joint venture. 52	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
Significant	Accounting	Policies	 continued
Applicable to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008
IFRS 2, Share-Based Payment, is not applied to shares, share options or other 
equity instruments that were granted before or on 7 November 2002 nor for 
options issued after that date which had vested at or before 1 January 2005. 
Equity-settled ESOPs granted after that date are accounted for in accordance 
with IFRS 2, such that the fair value of the employee service received in 
exchange for the grant of the option is recognised in the Income Statement 
over the related performance period. The total amount to be expensed over  
the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options 
granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for 
example profitability growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are 
included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to 
become exercisable. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its 
estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.  
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates in the Income 
Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 
credited to share capital and the share premium account when the options  
are exercised.
Goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. 
The excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirer’s interest 
in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, 
recognised in accordance with IFRS 3, Business combinations, constitutes 
goodwill and is recognised as an asset. Where the interest in the net fair value 
of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the 
cost of the business combination, it is recognised immediately in the Income 
Statement. Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in “Goodwill”. 
Goodwill on acquisition of associates and joint ventures is included in 
“Investments accounted for using equity method”.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses, until disposal or termination of the previously acquired 
business. The profit or loss on disposal or termination will be calculated after 
charging the book amount, at current exchange rates, of any such goodwill 
through the Income Statement. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least 
annually and whenever there are indications that goodwill may have become 
impaired (including planned disposal or termination where there are indications 
that the value of the goodwill has been permanently impaired). Goodwill is 
allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.  
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or group of cash-
generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination  
in which the goodwill arose.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004, the date of transition 
to International Financial Reporting Standards, has been retained at the 
previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that 
date. The Group’s policy up to and including 28 February 1998 was to 
eliminate goodwill arising upon acquisitions to reserves. Under IFRS 1 and  
IFRS 3, such goodwill will remain eliminated against reserves and is not 
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Other	 intangible	 assets
Other intangible assets are valued at cost less any accumulated amortisation  
and any accumulated impairment losses. Costs that are directly associated with 
identifiable and unique software products which are controlled by the Group, and 
which have probable economic benefits exceeding the cost beyond one year, are 
recognised as intangible assets. Costs associated with maintaining computer 
software, or that are not directly associated with identifiable and unique software 
products, are expensed as incurred. Computer software programmes are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over periods varying between two and  
ten years.
Vehicles	 not	 subject	 to	 manufacturer	 repurchase	 agreements
Vehicles are initially measured at cost. This cost comprises the purchase  
price (including any import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after 
deducting trade discounts and rebates), plus any costs directly attributable to 
bringing the vehicle to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating. After initial recognition, the vehicle is carried at its cost less any 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Straight-
line depreciation is based on initial cost, after consideration of expected holding 
periods and estimates of residual values. Where the carrying amount of a 
vehicle is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. 
Other	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment
Other property, plant and equipment is initially measured at cost. This cost 
comprises the purchase price (including any import duties and non-refundable 
purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates), plus any costs 
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition 
necessary for it to be capable of operating. If applicable, initial estimates  
of the cost of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site are  
also included in the cost of the item. 
After initial recognition, the assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The depreciable amount 
of the item is allocated according to the straight-line method over its useful 
economic life. The main useful lives are as follows:
a) Buildings:  40 to 50 years;
b) Plant and equipment: 3 to 15 years;
c) Leased assets: depending on the length of the lease.
Where the carrying amount of a fixed asset is greater than its estimated 
recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in 
use and is determined for an individual asset. 
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are 
retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Operating leases for which the Group is the lessor
Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Unless 
the vehicles themselves are held under operating leases for which the Group is 
the lessee, vehicles leased out under operating leases are included in vehicles 
in the balance sheet. They are depreciated over their expected useful lives. 
Operating leases for which the Group is the lessee
Lease payments under operating leases (net of any incentive received from the 
lessor) are recognised as expenses in the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
Vehicles subject to manufacturer repurchase agreements
Vehicles subject to manufacturer repurchase agreements are not recognised as 
non-current assets since these arrangements are accounted for as operating  	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2008  53
Financial	 statements
leases (lessee accounting). The difference between the initial payment and the 
final repurchase price (the obligation of the manufacturer) is considered as a 
deferred charge and is classified as prepaid vehicle operating lease charges 
within trade and other receivables. At inception of the arrangement, a separate 
repurchase agreement receivable is also recognised within trade and other 
receivables for the final repurchase price. 
Finance leases for which the Group is the lessee
Leases of vehicles (including vehicles subject to manufacturer repurchase 
arrangements) and other property, plant and equipment, where the Group has 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as finance 
leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the  
lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and  
the finance charge so as to achieve a constant rate of return on the finance 
balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance 
charges, are included in interest-bearing liabilities. The interest element of  
the finance cost is charged to the Income Statement over the lease period.  
The leased assets are depreciated over their expected useful lives on a basis 
consistent with similar owned vehicles or other property, plant and equipment. 
If there is no reasonable certainty that ownership will be acquired by the end of 
the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and 
its useful life. 
Non-current	 assets	 held	 for	 sale
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will 
be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. 
This condition is met when the sale is highly probable, the asset is available  
for immediate sale in its present condition, management are committed to the 
asset disposal, and disposal is expected to be completed within 12 months. 
Non-current assets classified as held for sale cease to be depreciated and are 
measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less selling costs. 
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost 
of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other 
costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their location and condition at the 
balance sheet date. Items are valued using the first in, first out method. When 
inventories are used, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as 
an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognised. Provision 
for write-downs to net realisable value and losses of inventories are recognised 
as an expense in the period in which the write-down or loss occurs. Reversals 
are recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an 
expense in the period in which the reversal occurs.
Trade	 and	 other	 receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables  
is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able 
to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. 
The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows. The carrying 
amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount 
is recognised in the Income Statement within administrative expenses. When a 
trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account 
for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off 
are credited in the Income Statement within administrative expenses.
Cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents
Cash comprises cash in hand, demand deposits and bank overdrafts.  
Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts are shown within “borrowings” in 
“current liabilities” in the Balance Sheet.
Impairment	 of	 financial	 assets
At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether there is objective 
evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. If any 
such evidence exists for available for sale financial assets, the cumulative loss 
– measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair 
value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in 
profit or loss – is removed from equity and recognised in the Income Statement.
Trade	 and	 other	 payables
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions
A provision is recognised when there is a present obligation (legal or 
constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
If these conditions are not met, no provision is recognised. Provisions are 
measured at the value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle  
the obligation. Where the time value of money is material, provisions are 
discounted using an appropriate rate that takes into account the risks specific 
to the liability.
Uninsured losses are recognised when the underlying event occurs at the value 
of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. Accruals 
are made for uninsured losses notified and provisions are made for claims 
incurred but not reported at each year end. Recoveries of amounts claimed 
from insurers to settle expenses incurred are recognised when it is virtually 
certain that reimbursement will be received. Provisions are measured at the 
value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Retirement	 benefit	 obligations
The Group operates various defined benefit and defined contribution retirement 
benefit plans. Most of these plans are funded schemes, that is they are 
financed through a pension fund or an external insurance policy. The minimum 
funding level of these schemes is defined by national rules. 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an 
expense as they fall due. 
The Group’s commitments under defined benefit retirement benefit plans,  
and the related costs are valued using the “projected unit credit method”  
with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.  
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they 
occur. They are recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and 
Expense. Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the 
benefits have already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents 
the present value of the defined benefit obligation as reduced by the fair value 
of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past  54	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
Significant	Accounting	Policies	 continued
Applicable to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008
service cost, plus the present value of any refunds and reductions in future 
contributions to the plan. The current service costs and gains and losses  
on settlements and curtailments are included in operating expenses in the 
Income Statement.
Taxation
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes 
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years.  
It further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s 
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted  
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Current tax for current and prior periods, to the extent unpaid, is recognised  
as a liability. If the amount already paid in respect of current and prior periods 
exceeds the amount due for those periods, the excess is recognised as a 
current asset. The benefit relating to a tax loss that can be carried back to 
recover current tax of a previous period is recognised as an asset.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method, on 
temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities  
for financial reporting purposes and the corresponding tax bases for taxation 
purposes. Deferred taxes are not calculated on the following temporary 
differences: (i) the initial recognition of goodwill and (ii) the initial recognition  
of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit. The 
amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected basis of realisation 
or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax 
asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the unused tax losses and credits can  
be utilised. Deferred tax assets previously recognised are reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax is not recognised in relation to temporary differences associated 
with unremitted earnings of the Group’s overseas subsidiaries where the Group 
is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences 
and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Current and deferred tax are charged or credited to the Income Statement 
except when they relate to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
Foreign	 currency	 translation
The Group consolidation is prepared in sterling. Income statements of foreign 
operations are translated into sterling at the weighted average exchange rates 
for the period and balance sheets are translated into sterling at the exchange 
rate ruling on the balance sheet date. Goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as local currency assets 
and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing rate. 
Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange rate prevailing 
at the date of the transactions. Gains and losses resulting from the settlement 
of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income Statement. 
Exchange movements arising from the retranslation at closing rates of the 
Group’s net investment in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are taken 
to the translation reserve. The Group’s net investment includes the Group’s 
share of net assets of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, and certain 
inter-company loans. The net investment definition includes loans between 
“sister” companies and certain inter-company items denominated in any 
currency. Other exchange movements are taken to the Income Statement.
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign operations, the gains and 
losses relating to the effective portion of the hedging instrument is recognised 
in the translation reserve in equity. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective 
portion is recognised in the Income Statement. Gains and losses accumulated 
in equity are included in the Income Statement when the foreign operation is 
disposed of.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euro. The consolidated 
sterling assets and liabilities at each balance sheet date are recalculated into 
euro at the closing rate at that balance sheet date. The consolidated sterling 
income and expenses are recalculated into euro at the average monthly 
exchange rates. All resulting exchange differences arising after 1 January 2004 
are taken to the translation reserve. 
Equity
Where the Company (or its subsidiaries) re-acquires its own equity instruments, 
those instruments are deducted from equity as own shares held. Where such 
equity instruments are subsequently sold, any consideration received is 
recognised in equity. 
Dividend	 distribution
Final dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in which the dividends are 
approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised 
when paid.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 
incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method. 
Financial	 instruments	 and	 hedge	 accounting
In accordance with IAS 39, financial instruments are recorded initially at  
fair value. Subsequent measurement depends upon the designation of the 
instrument, as follows:
a)  non-current investments (other than interests in joint ventures, associates 
and fixed deposits) and short-term investments (other than fixed deposits) 
are normally designated as available for sale and are held at fair value; 
b)  fixed deposits, comprising principally funds held with banks and other 
financial institutions, and short-term borrowings and overdrafts are 
classified as loans and receivables and are held at amortised cost;
c)  derivatives, including interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts,  
cross currency interest rate swaps, callable interest rate swaps, forward 
rate agreements, options and embedded derivatives, are classified as 
derivative financial instruments and are held at fair value; and
d)  long-term loans are generally held at amortised cost. 
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined using a 
number of methods and assumptions based on prevailing conditions at the 
balance sheet date including market forward interest rates and exchange rates 
at the balance sheet date. Changes in fair value of derivative financial 
instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the 
Income Statement as they arise. 	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2008  55
Financial	 statements
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between 
the hedging instruments and hedged item, as well as its risk management 
objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group 
also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing 
basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly 
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or 
liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, 
and as a current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item 
is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset  
or liability.
Cash flow hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated 
and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity 
and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. 
If the cash flow hedge is a firm commitment or the forecast transaction results 
in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability 
is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had 
previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of 
the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset 
or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the Income Statement 
in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing  
in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast 
transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income Statement. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was 
reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Income Statement.
Fair value hedges
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value of a  
hedged item, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable 
to the risk being hedged with a corresponding entry in the Income Statement. 
Gains or losses from re-measuring the derivative, or for non-derivatives, the 
foreign currency component of its carrying amount, are also recognised in the 
Income Statement.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment 
to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method 
is used is amortised to the Income Statement over the period to maturity.
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts  
are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are  
not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are  
not carried at fair value. Embedded derivatives are held at fair value, with 
unrealised gains and losses recognised in the Income Statement as they arise.
Critical	 accounting	 policies	 and	 judgements
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and disclosure of 
contingencies at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements. If in the 
future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s 
best judgement at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, deviate 
from the actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be 
modified as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change.  
The following policies are considered to be of greater complexity and/or 
particularly subject to the exercise of judgement.
Goodwill
As required by IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, the Group regularly monitors the 
carrying value of its assets, including goodwill. Impairment reviews compare 
the carrying values to the higher of fair value less costs to sell or the present 
value of future cash flows that are derived from the relevant asset or cash-
generating unit. These reviews therefore depend on management estimates 
and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows 
and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those that, by virtue of their size or incidence, should  
be separately disclosed in the Income Statement. The determination of which 
items should be separately disclosed as exceptional items requires judgement.
Fleet
Given the nature of the Group’s business, the main asset in the balance sheet 
is the vehicle fleet. The majority of fleet is held under manufacturer repurchase 
arrangements, which guarantee a disposal value at the end of the holding 
period. However, a proportion of fleet has no such contractual protection and 
therefore the value at the end of the rental life will depend on the market for 
those vehicles at the time of disposal. Judgement is therefore required in the 
estimation of disposal value. 
Trade and other receivables
The Group regularly assesses the recoverability of its trade and other receivable 
balances. Where there is definitive evidence that the Group will not be able  
to collect all amounts outstanding, a provision for impairment is recognised. 
The Group utilises previous customer history, debtor ageing profiles and other 
relevant information in assessing the level of provision required.
Post-employment benefits
Application of IAS 19, Employee Benefits, requires the exercise of judgement  
in relation to setting the assumptions used by the actuaries in assessing the 
financial position of each scheme. The Group determines the assumptions to 
be adopted in discussion with its actuaries, and believes these assumptions to 
be in line with UK generally accepted practice, but the application of different 
assumptions could have a significant effect on the amounts reflected in the 
Income Statement and Balance Sheet in respect of post-employment benefits. 
The sensitivity of principal scheme liabilities to changes in the assumptions 
used by actuaries is set out in Note 24.
Provisions
The Group continues to carry balance sheet provisions in a number of areas 
against exposures that arise in the normal course of trading. These provisions 
cover areas such as uninsured losses, termination and reorganisation activities 
and property dilapidation reserves. Judgement is involved in assessing the 
exposures in these areas and hence in setting the level of the required provision.
Taxation
The Group is subject to taxation in a number of jurisdictions. Significant 
judgement is required in determining the Group’s provision for tax. There are 
many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain during the ordinary course of business. As a result, the exercising of 
judgement is required in order to assess the exposures in these areas and set 
the appropriate level of provision. 56	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
1	 General	 information
The Company is a public limited company and has a primary listing on the London  
Stock Exchange. The address of its registered office is Avis House, Park Road, Bracknell, 
Berkshire, RG12 2EW. The Company’s ultimate majority shareholder is s.a. D’Ieteren n.v. 
which is incorporated in Belgium. The ultimate controlling party of s.a. D’Ieteren n.v.  
is the D’Ieteren family.
This set of Consolidated Financial Statements was approved for issue on 3 March 2009.
2	 Revenue
The Group is an international vehicle rental services company and a market leader in 
many of its markets. Revenue, as disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Income 
Statement, is derived entirely from continuing activities. Revenue from Avis Greece, the 
discontinued operation in the prior year, is disclosed separately in Note 39. The Group 
experiences a natural increase in demand from leisure customers over the European 
summer holiday months. This seasonality generally results in lower revenue generated  
in the first half of the year as compared to the second half, together with an increase  
in the number of vehicles acquired in the period leading up to the summer months.
3	 Business	 and	 geographical	 segments
The dominant source and nature of the Group’s risks and returns govern whether its 
primary segment reporting is by business segment or geographical segment. The  
Group is subject to significant variations in risks and rewards between undertaking its 
operations through corporately-owned businesses, compared to the licensing of such 
operations to third parties. Given the nature of the separate brands, the Group is also 
subject to significant variations in risks and rewards between the Avis branded 
businesses and the Budget branded businesses. These variations contrast with more 
limited differentials between the risk and reward profile of operations in different 
geographical locations. The Group’s primary reporting format is therefore by business 
segment, and the secondary reporting format is geographical. Discontinued relates 
entirely to Avis corporately-owned activities in Greece in the prior year.

There has been no change in the basis of segmentation or the basis of measurement of 
segment operating profit since the last Annual Report. No adjustment is made between 
segments to recharge the value of Avis/Budget goodwill, brand, licence rights, or to 
allocate the value of goodwill written off to reserves in previous periods. Avis goodwill  
of €1,080.4 million arising before 1 March 1998 was fully written off to reserves, and 
Budget goodwill of €33.9 million arising on 12 March 2003 has been fully impaired and 
charged to the Income Statement in previous periods. Had the value of goodwill, brand  
or licence rights been charged to the segments, the individual segment results would be 
materially affected.

a)  Restructuring costs of €27.6 million included €1.9 million of costs incurred in the  
first half in respect of a redundancy programme that commenced in December  
2007. Restructuring costs of €25.7 million were then recognised in the second half 
reflecting a further rationalisation of operations in response to the deterioration in the 
trading environment, including redundancies, the closure of certain low margin rental 
locations, and the rationalisation of property with the transfer of the staff of the UK 
business head-office into the Group headquarters building. These restructuring  
costs include redundancy costs, onerous lease provisions, fixed asset impairments 
(see Note 14) and exceptional pension curtailments (see Note 24). In the prior year, 
restructuring costs of €7.1 million were incurred with respect to the redundancy 
programme commenced in December 2007, and the final elements of a restructuring 
project commenced in 2005.
b)  During 2008, the Group recognised an exceptional impairment provision against the 
goodwill arising on the acquisition of certain licensees in Holland (see Note 38). This 
followed a reappraisal of the business in conjunction with the restructuring referred  
to above. In the comparative year, the Group acquired the assets of a licensee in 
Germany and an impairment provision was made in respect of the goodwill arising.
c)  During the current and prior years, the activities associated with the closure of the 
Centrus credit hire business were more successful than previously anticipated.  
The Group therefore partially reversed provisions recognised in prior years, resulting  
in a further exceptional credit of €0.3 million (2007: €0.7 million).
d)  In the prior year, the Group investigated potential malpractice in Portugal. Associated 
independent investigation costs and certain directly related employee termination 
amounts were recognised.
e)  Following the Group’s decision in 2004 to terminate an agreement with an IT 
contractor upon the conclusion of a legal case, a net exceptional credit was 
recognised in the prior year.
f)  During the second half of 2007 the Group reviewed its methodology for calculating 
the level of provision required in respect of third party motor liability losses, including 
those not yet reported. The provision re-assessment resulted in an exceptional credit 
to the Income Statement of €5.7 million.
g)  In the prior year, the Group disposed of its subsidiary in Greece. The Group has 
recognised an exceptional credit of €1.3 million in the current year to reflect the final 
settlement of a warranty provision (see Note 39). 	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2008  59

3  Economic hedging arrangements have been entered into for which the Group is unable to apply 
hedge accounting under IAS 39. Interest payable on bank loans and overdrafts, to the extent that 
IAS 39 does not permit hedge accounting, therefore reflects actual interest rates applicable to 
debt, regardless of any accrued cash flow paid at contracted rates within hedging derivatives.

After adjusting for own shares held, the weighted average number of shares in issue for 
the year was 918,921,314 (2007: 918,499,740).
Options have been granted to certain Directors and employees over ordinary shares of 
the Company. These options constitute the only category of potentially dilutive ordinary 
shares but these did not increase the weighted average number of shares in either 2007 
or 2008. These options were not dilutive as either the option exercise prices were in 
excess of the prevailing market share price, or exercise of the options is subject to 
performance conditions which had not been fully satisfied by the year end.
b) Underlying
Underlying earnings per share is based on the underlying earnings for the year and the 
weighted average number of shares in issue for the year attributable to equity holders  
of the Company.

Goodwill of €1,080.4 million arising before 1 March 1998 is fully written off to reserves 
(see Note 33).
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, the Group 
ordinarily completes a review of the carrying value of goodwill at each year end.  
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing,  
each of these representing the Group’s investment where the goodwill originally arose. 
The impairment review is conducted to ensure that the carrying values of the assets 
within cash-generating units for which goodwill has been allocated are stated at no  
more than their recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell  
and value in use. 
After a reassessment of the long-term business plan for Avis Holland, the Directors 
concluded at 31 December 2008 that the recoverable amount (determined by reference 
to their value in use) of the goodwill attaching to the licencee businesses was less than 
its carrying amount. As a consequence, an impairment provision of €1.5 million was 
recognised to write down the goodwill to nil. There was no cash flow impact arising from 
this impairment provision.
Accumulated impairment provisions represent amounts provided in respect of acquired 
former Budget licensee operations in France, and certain former Avis licensee operations 
in France, Germany and Holland.
The Directors also review at each year end the carrying values of the remaining capitalised 
goodwill relating to the new licensee acquisition in France (see Note 38) and the joint 
venture in China (see Note 15). This review (undertaken by calculating value in use) did 
not result in the need for any impairment provision to be recognised as at 31 December 
2007 or 31 December 2008.
In determining the value in use, the Directors calculated the present value of the estimated 
future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of the assets using post-tax 
discount rates based upon the Group’s weighted average cost of capital with appropriate 
adjustment for the relevant risks associated with the businesses. Estimated future cash 
flows are based on management’s three-year plans for each cash-generating unit, with 
extrapolation thereafter based on long-term average nominal growth rate of 4.0%.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary 
differences where it is probable that these assets will be recovered. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there 
is an intention to settle the balances net.
At the year end, the Group had unused tax losses of €204.8 million (2007: €93.6 million) 
available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in 
respect of €44.1 million (2007: €29.1 million) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has 
been recognised in respect of the remaining unused tax losses of €160.7 million  
(2007: €64.5 million) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Deferred tax has not been recognised in respect of other temporary differences which 
would give rise to deferred tax assets of €11.6 million (2007: €8.8 million) due to the 
unpredictability of future profit streams.
At the year end, the aggregate amount of other temporary differences associated with 
unremitted earnings of the Group’s overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities 
have not been recognised was €252.8 million (2007: €264.4 million). No liability has 
been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to 
control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Temporary differences arising in 
connection with interests in the joint ventures and associate are insignificant.

Credit risk with regard to vehicle related receivables is concentrated with the main 
European vehicle manufacturers, whilst concentrations of credit risk with respect to non-
vehicle related receivables are limited through to the diversity of the Group’s customers. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class 
of receivable mentioned above. Balance sheet amounts are stated net of any provisions 
made for bad and doubtful debts, and accordingly, the Directors believe that the 
maximum credit risk exposure is the carrying amount of the receivables in the balance 
sheet, as shown below. 
The main categories of trade and other receivables that are subject to credit risk are: 
other vehicle receivables (after the end of vehicle holding period), amounts due from 
leasing companies, other trade debtors and other debtors. These categories are analysed 
on an aged basis as follows:
  	 	 	 2008 2007
	 	 	 	 	 €m €m
Trade and other receivables subject to credit risk    500.3	 488.8 
Neither past due nor impaired      (390.8)	 (384.6)
Past due      109.5 104.2 
Provision for bad and doubtful debts     (19.7)	 (24.0)
Past due but not impaired      89.8	 80.2 
As at 31 December 2008, €89.8 million (2007: €80.2 million) were past due but not 
impaired as there had been an improvement in ageing of post three months overdue  
and no previous history of default. The ageing analysis of past due but not impaired  
is as follows:
  	 	 	 2008 2007
	 	 	 	 	 €m €m
Up to three months past due      84.9	  73.6 
Three to six months past due      4.8   6.4 
Over six months past due       0.1   0.2 
        89.8	  80.2 
 
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The provision for bad and doubtful debts has been determined by reference to  
past experience. Irrecoverable trade and other receivable expense of €2.4 million  
(2007: €6.1 million) has been recognised in the Income Statement in the year.

Cash and short-term deposit balances are floating rate assets which earn interest at 
various rates set with reference to the prevailing EURIBID and LIBID or equivalent.
Short-term deposits mature within three months (2007: three months) and include  
€2.7 million (2007: €3.7 million) of deposits required by insurers to be held by  
Aegis Motor Insurance Limited (a subsidiary of the Group) to settle claims.

23	 Provisions	 continued
 Uninsured losses represent provisions for losses under third party liabilities or claims 
primarily in respect of third party motor liability and insurance programmes. Due to the 
timescales and uncertainties involved in such claims, provision is made based upon the 
profile of claims experience, allowing for potential claims for a number of years after 
policy inception.
Dilapidation and environmental represents provisions to cover the costs of the 
remediation of certain properties held under operating leases. These provisions are 
primarily euro denominated and non-interest bearing, and the ultimate expenditure is 
expected to be coterminous with the underlying remaining lease periods (see Note 41).
For further information on the warranty provision see Note 39.
Other trading provisions have been discounted where applicable at the rate 
commensurate with the underlying risk, and comprise:
a)  Reorganisation and employee termination provisions of €2.1 million  
(2007: €3.6 million) that are expected to crystallise within the next five years. 
b)  Other provisions of €7.7 million (2007: €6.7 million), which primarily comprise 
provision against the future redemption of benefits under customer loyalty 
programmes and provision against legal claims that arise in the normal course of 
business. These provisions are expected to crystallise within the next five years. In the 
Directors’ opinion, after taking appropriate legal advice, the outcomes of these legal 
claims are not expected to give rise to any significant loss beyond amounts provided 
at 31 December 2008.
24	 Retirement	 benefit	 obligations
a) Retirement benefit schemes operated
Where applicable, subsidiaries contribute to the relevant state pension scheme. Certain 
subsidiaries operate schemes which provide retirement benefits, including those of the 
defined benefit type, which are in most cases funded by investments held outside the Group. 
b) Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates funded defined benefit pension schemes for qualifying employees in 
the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Austria. In addition, the Group operates unfunded 
defined benefit pension schemes for employees in Germany, an unfunded defined benefit 
statutorily determined termination scheme for employees in Italy and also previously in 
Greece. The principal schemes are in the United Kingdom and Germany.
The valuations used have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations available, 
updated by the scheme actuaries to assess the liabilities of the scheme and the market 
value of the scheme assets at each of the balance sheet dates.

– other       5.7%  4.4% 	 n/a  n/a
– weighted average       6.6%  6.5%  n/a  n/a
The expected rates of return on plan assets are based on market expectations at the 
beginning of each year for returns over the entire life of the related obligation.  
The expected return on bonds is based on long-term bond yields. The expected return  
on equities is based on a wide range of qualitative and quantitative market analysis 
including consideration of market equity risk premiums. 
The key demographic assumption is mortality. By its very nature, mortality can be  
difficult to predict. Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on 
advice from actuaries, published statistics and experience in each territory. In 2006,  
the mortality assumption for the principal funded scheme was updated to reflect the 
“2000” series tables along with certain improvements (known as “medium cohort”) 
which makes allowances for increases in longevity projections. Within the context of 
increasing life expectancy, the Group further strengthened the mortality improvement 
assumption in the principal funded scheme in 2007 by introducing a 1% per annum 
minimum level of improvement within the medium cohort allowance. The longevity 
assumption in the principal funded scheme applied a post retirement life expectancy  
for a member aged 65 in 2008 of 21 years (2007: 21 years) for males, and 24 years 
(2007: 24 years) for females. The post-retirement longevity assumption in the principal 
unfunded scheme applied a life expectancy for a member aged 65 in 2008 of 18 years 
(2007: 18 years) for males, and 22 years (2007: 22 years) for females.

Cumulative actuarial losses recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and 
Expense since 1 January 2004 (the date of adoption of IAS 19) are €15.9 million  
(at 31 December 2007: €27.1 million). 
The contributions paid by the Group into funded schemes during 2008 were €11.4 million 
(2007: €12.3 million), which includes payments to fund the net actuarial obligations  
over time. The best estimate of the cash contributions expected to be made by the  
Group into funded schemes during the 2009 annual period is €7.5 million, which 
includes payments to fund the net actuarial obligations over time.
The indicative sensitivity of principal scheme liabilities as at 31 December 2008 to 
changes in the above assumptions is as follows:
     Change	 in	 Indicative 	 increase	 in
	 	 	 	 	 assumption	 scheme 	 liabilities	 (€m)

The sensitivity of non-principal scheme liabilities to the changes in the assumptions 
shown above is not material to the Group.

It is the Group’s policy to fund certain of its vehicles (including some vehicles held under 
repurchase arrangements) and some plant and equipment under finance leases. The 
average lease term is less than one year. For the year ended 31 December 2008 the 
average effective interest rate was 5.0% (2007: 4.5%). All finance leases are on a fixed 
repayment basis and interest rates are fixed at the contract date. No arrangements have 
been entered into for contingent rental payments. 
The fair value of the Group’s obligations under finance leases approximates to their carrying 
amount, and is secured by the lessors either having legal title or charges over the leased 
assets. In the prior year, collateral was held against certain of the leases (see Note 16). 	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2008  67

The US$ loan notes bear interest at an average fixed rate of 6.3% (2007: 6.3%).  
The euro denominated loan notes issued prior to July 2006 bear interest at an average 
fixed rate of 5.8% (2007: 5.8%). These loan notes are at fixed rates such that their 
contractual repricing profile is coterminous with their maturity profile.
The €250.0 million Senior Floating Rate Notes bear interest at EURIBOR plus 2.625%. 
These notes reprice EURIBOR quarterly and include a call option, permitting the Group to 
repay the notes with effect from 31 July 2008. This option is separately recognised as  
an embedded derivative at fair value (see Note 27).
Proceeds from the loan notes issued in August 2000 totalling US$48.0 million (2007: 
US$48.0 million) are swapped to a fixed rate euro liability. Proceeds from the loan notes 
issued in June 2004 totalling US$240.0 million (2007: US$240.0 million) are swapped  
to a euro liability at a floating rate of interest until June 2005 and a fixed rate thereafter. 
Proceeds of the Senior Floating Rate Notes issued in July 2006 totalling €200.0 million 
(2007: €200.0 million) are swapped into a fixed rate euro liability.
Further details are provided in Note 27.

The liability is denominated in sterling, attracts an interest rate of 8.0% (2007: 8.0%) 
fixed for 29 years (2007: 30 years) and is repayable in annual instalments (including 
interest) of £1.9 million.
27	 Financial	 risk	 management
a) Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s financial risk management objective is to reduce the financial risks and 
exposures facing the business with respect to changes in interest and foreign exchange 
rates, and to ensure constant access to sufficient liquidity. To achieve this the Group 
undertakes an active hedging policy, including the use of derivatives (interest rate and 
foreign exchange swaps, options, forward rate agreements and caps and collars), which 
are entered into under policies approved and monitored by a sub-committee of the 
Board, chaired by the Group Finance Director. These transactions are only undertaken  
to reduce exposures arising from underlying commercial transactions and at no time are 
transactions undertaken for speculative reasons.
Foreign	 currency	 risk
The majority of the Group’s business is transacted in euros, sterling, US dollars and 
Swiss francs. The principal commercial currency of the Group is the euro. The Group 
seeks to manage currency exposure wherever possible.
In each country where the Group has a corporate operation, revenue generated and 
costs incurred are primarily denominated in the relevant local currency, so providing  
a natural currency hedge. In addition, intra-group trading transactions are netted and 
settled centrally. Any remaining material foreign currency transaction exposures are 
hedged as appropriate into either euro or sterling.
With regard to translation exposures the policy is to match where possible the average 
assets of the Group to the equivalent average liabilities in each major currency and thus 
minimise any impact to the Group. To the extent that this does not occur, both foreign 
currency borrowings and forward exchange contracts are used. Long-term borrowings 
undertaken to benefit from the liquidity of the US dollar denominated capital markets are 
swapped into euros. 68	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
Notes	to	the	Consolidated	Financial	Statements	 continued
for the year ended 31 December
27	 Financial	 risk	 management	 continued
Interest	 rate	 risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from the Group’s borrowing which, after foreign 
currency risk hedging, principally arises in euro and sterling. Borrowings issued at 
variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk whereas borrowings issued 
at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
To manage these risks, the Group is financed through a combination of fixed and floating 
rate facilities and enters into various derivatives. The Group’s policy is to ensure that the 
proportion of fixed rate debt to the annual average net debt (defined for this purpose to 
include the net book value of fleet under operating leases) for the next three years will be 
maintained in the range of 65% to 85%, 55% to 80%, and 45% to 75% respectively. 
Liquidity	 risk
The seasonal nature of the business necessitates higher fleet levels in the summer 
months and hence proportionately higher debt requirements. Consequently, the Group 
ensures that it has a core level of long-term funding in place, with maturities spread over 
a wide range of dates, supplemented by shorter term and committed revolving facilities 
to cover requirements through the year. 
Capital	 risk	 management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the ability to continue as 
a going concern, ensure shareholder returns and appropriate benefits for stakeholders. 
The Group seeks to maintain an optimal debt and equity structure to minimise the overall 
cost of capital. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may issue new 
shares or acquire/sell assets to adjust debt levels where appropriate.
The Group monitors the use of capital on the basis of return on capital employed 
(“ROCE”) and average fleet utilisation. The Group’s ROCE is based on the underlying 
operating profit of the business plus the operating result of joint ventures and associates. 
Underlying operating profit is adjusted to reverse: any non-exceptional goodwill 
impairments; the interest cost of pension liabilities; and the expected return on pension 
assets. Capital employed is based on net assets with adjustment for: all debt and related 
interest balances; all derivative financial instruments; tax balances; pension deficits;  
and capitalised goodwill, and is an average of the current and previous two period end 
closing balances. This definition of ROCE may not be comparable to other similarly titled 
measures used by other companies. Average fleet utilisation is calculated as the average 
period of time during which vehicles are on rent as a percentage of their holding period.
Other	 price	 risks
As part of the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires disclosures on how hypothetical 
changes in risk variables affect the price of financial instruments. Important risk variables 
include stock exchange prices or indices. As at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 
2008 the Group did not hold any material investments to be classified as available for sale.
Credit	 risk
The Group’s principal financial assets comprise: non-current assets held for sale; other 
financial assets held for trading; derivative financial instrument assets; trade and other 
receivables; and cash and short-term deposits which in aggregate represent the Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk at each year end.
The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities and certain financing 
activities. This risk is controlled from a treasury perspective by only entering into 
transactions involving financial instruments with authorised counterparties of strong  
credit quality, and monitoring such positions regularly. With regard to trade and other 
receivables, outstanding debts are regularly monitored at an operational level. Bad debt 
provisions are made against known credit risks.
The credit rating of vehicle manufacturers, the key suppliers, is monitored separately. 
With respect to certain vehicle manufacturers, the Group has a natural hedge to its 
exposure to credit risk as vehicle receivables (see Note 20) are ordinarily less than 
vehicle payables (see Note 22) for the majority of the year.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the balance sheet values of the 
original loans and receivables that are carried in the balance sheet, including derivatives 
with positive market values. Where derivatives are settled gross, International Swaps and 
Derivatives Association (ISDA) based agreements are applied which include close-out 
netting provisions which are effective if the counterparty defaults. At the reporting date 
there were no other significant global offsetting agreements that reduce credit risk,  
nor were there any significant financial guarantees for third-party obligations that 
increase this risk.

Non-hedging derivatives (excluding the embedded derivative) are classified as a current 
asset or liability. The full fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-current 
asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, 
and as a current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less  
than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability.  
The embedded derivative is classified as a non-current asset consistent with the  
maturity of the borrowing in which it is embedded. 	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2008  69
Financial	 statements
27	 Financial	 risk	 management	 continued
Fair values of the derivative financial instruments are determined using a number of 
methods and assumptions based on conditions at the balance sheet date as none are 
traded in an active market. The fair values of interest rate swaps, forward rate 
agreements and cross currency interest rate swaps are calculated as the present value  
of future estimated cash flows. The fair value of the embedded derivative, callable 
interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and collars are valued using option valuation 
techniques. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using forward 
exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. 
Hedging	 instruments
The effectiveness of hedging relationships is tested by means of statistical methods using 
either regression analysis (for forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency 
interest rate swaps), or the closest offset method (for interest rate swaps). This involves 
defining the performance of the hedged item as the independent variable and the 
performance of the hedging item as the dependent variable. A hedging relationship is 
classified as effective when the value of the hedging item moves between 0.8% and 
1.25% for each 1.0% movement in the hedged item. All hedging relationships, having 
been tested using statistical methods, were effective at the reporting date.
Forward foreign exchange contracts
Forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2008 with aggregate values  
of US$7.8 million (2007: US$4.1 million), South African rand 79.6 million (2007: South 
African rand 58.0 million), Israeli shekel 9.6 million (2007: Israeli shekel nil), Norwegian 
krone 10.5 million (2007: Norwegian krone nil), and Swedish krona 10.1 million (2007: 
Swedish krona nil) were used to hedge expected foreign currency income of US$7.8 
million (2007: US$4.1 million), South African rand 79.6 million (2007: South African rand 
58.0 million), Israeli shekel 9.6 million (2007: Israeli shekel nil), Norwegian krone 10.5 
million (2007: Norwegian krone nil), and Swedish krona 10.1 million (2007: Swedish 
krona nil) into sterling of £13.4 million (2007: £6.0 million).
Forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2008 with aggregate values  
of US$20.8 million (2007: US$ nil), Hungarian forint 2,038.0 million (2007: Hungarian 
forint 1,160.0 million), and sterling £3.0 million (2007: sterling £2.9 million) were used 
to hedge expected foreign currency income of US$20.8 million (2007: US$ nil), and 
expected foreign currency payments of Hungarian forint 2,038.0 million (2007: 
Hungarian forint 1,160.0 million), and sterling £3.0 million (2007: sterling £2.9 million) 
into euro of €15.4 million (2007: € nil), €7.7 million (2007: €4.6 million), and €3.8 
million (2007: €4.1 million) respectively.
These forward exchange contracts and corresponding foreign currency receipts will 
mature within 12 months of each year end. Movements in the fair value of these forward 
foreign exchange contracts are recognised as cash flow hedges in the hedging reserve 
within equity. These amounts are then transferred to the Income Statement when the 
amounts are received at various dates between one and 12 months after the year  
end. There was no material ineffectiveness of these hedges recorded as at the balance 
sheet date.
Interest rate swaps
Interest rate swaps of aggregate notional principal amounts of €200.0 million (2007: 
€200.0 million) with average fixed interest payable of 4.03% (2007:4.03%) were used  
to hedge variable quarterly interest payments arising under the Senior Floating Rate 
Notes due 2013. The aim of the hedge relationship is to transform the variable interest 
borrowing into a fixed interest borrowing, and result in cash flow hedges of €8.5 million 
(2007: €(4.5) million). Credit risks do not form part of the hedge. There was no material 
ineffectiveness of these hedges recorded as at the balance sheet date.
Cross currency interest rate swaps
Cross currency interest rate swaps of aggregate notional principal amounts of US$288.0 
million (2007: US$288.0 million) were used to hedge the Group’s US$ denominated loan 
notes (see Note 26).
Fair value hedge adjustments of €(9.6) million (2007: €(8.0) million) arise from the 
hedging of the principal value of the exposures to euro denominated liabilities. Equivalent 
(but opposite) fair value differences have been recognised on the hedging cross currency 
interest rate swaps for the same underlying risk. The whole of this adjustment in both the 
current and prior years relate to hedged items due for settlement after one year. Cash 
flow hedges of €5.4 million (2007: €9.0 million) arise from the conversion of the semi-
annual US$ denominated interest payments to euro denominated interest payments. 
Amounts recognised within equity are released to the Income Statement when the 
underlying fixed interest payments occur at various dates between the year end and 
2014. There was no ineffectiveness of these hedges recorded at the balance sheet date.
Non-hedging	 instruments
In certain circumstances, transactions to reduce economic exposure do not qualify for 
hedge accounting.
Forward foreign exchange contracts
Forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2008 were in place to convert the 
following foreign currency notional amounts into sterling balances totalling £178.7 million 
(2007: £140.3 million); Swiss francs 54.3 million (2007: Swiss francs 50.7 million); 
Singapore dollar 13.0 million (2007: Singapore dollar 5.4 million); Hungarian forint  
400.1 million (2007: Hungarian forint 229.8 million); US$2.5 million (2007: 
US$1.5 million); and €241.3 million (2007: €228.6 million). 
Forward foreign exchange options
Forward foreign exchange option contracts as at 31 December 2008 were in place to 
convert expected foreign currency income of: US$19.3 million (2007: US$35.3 million) 
into €12.4 million (2007: €24.9 million). These option contracts will mature within 
12 months of each year end. 
Interest rate swaps
The notional principal amount of outstanding interest rate swap contracts not qualifying 
for hedge accounting as at the year end was €50.0 million (2007: €50.0 million) and  
£nil (2007: £30.0 million) with fixed interest rates payable at 4.4%. The notional  
principal amounts of outstanding interest rate caps and collars as at the year end was 
€100.0 million (2007: €100.0 million).
In 2008 the Group had in place forward start variable principal interest rate swaps with 
aggregate average notional principals of €102.2 million which commence in 2009,  
will run for three years and convert the prevailing floating interest rate to an average  
fixed rate of 5.6%.
In addition, in 2007 the Group had in place forward start interest rate swaps with aggregate 
notional principals of €100.0 million which commenced in 2008 and ran for one year. 
These swaps converted the prevailing floating interest rate to an average fixed rate of 6.0%.
Callable interest rate swaps
In 2008 the Group had in place forward start variable principal callable interest rate 
swaps with aggregate average notional principals of €76.7 million which commence in 
2009 and may run for up to six years. In each case the swap has an initial term of three 
years at the end of which the counterparty has the option to extend the swap at no 
additional cost for another three years. The swaps convert the prevailing floating interest 
rate to an average fixed rate of 5.2% if the swaps are not extended and 5.4% if the 
extension option is exercised.
Forward rate agreements
In 2008 the Group had outstanding forward rate agreements with aggregate notional 
principals of €450.0 million (2007: €1,250.0 million) covering various three month 
periods during 2009 (2007: 2008 and 2009). These convert the prevailing floating 
interest rate to an average fixed rate of 6.1% (2007: 6.1%).
Embedded derivative
The €250.0 million Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2013 include a call option permitting 
the Group to repay the notes with effect from 31 July 2008. Under the option, the notes 
may be redeemed at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of 
principal amounts) if repaid during the 12 month period beginning on 31 July 2008: 102%; 
31 July 2009: 101%; 31 July 2010 and thereafter: 100%. In accordance with IAS 39, 
this option is separately recognised from underlying Senior Floating Rate Notes as an 
embedded derivative. 70	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
The sensitivity of profit after tax, translation reserve and cash flow hedge reserve to a 1% 
change in the interest rate are detailed in the table below:
	 Profit	 after	 tax	 Translation 	 reserve	 Hedging 	 reserve
  2008	 2007	 2008 2007 2008 2007
  €m €m €m  €m  €m €m
Loss arising from 1%  
increase in interest rates  
(post tax)  1.9 3.1 – – 6.8  7.3
The decrease in total profit after tax partly arises due to the revaluation of non-hedging 
derivatives. The decrease in underlying profit after tax to a 1% increase in market interest 
rates is €2.0 million (2007: €1.7 million). Given the seasonality of the Group’s debt, the 
Group’s average net debt is ordinarily higher than the Group’s year end net debt. If the market 
interest rates applied to the Group’s average net debt in the year had been 1% higher, 
underlying profit after tax would have been lower by €1.9 million (2007: €2.2 million).

c) Risk and sensitivity analysis
Foreign	 currency	 risk
In accordance with IFRS 7 , foreign currency risk sensitivities are calculated by reference 
to the currency profile of the Group’s balance sheet as at each year end, with all other 
variables kept constant. These sensitivities do not therefore reflect any trading impacts 
arising from changes in exchange rates during the year, or any impacts arising from the 
translation of monthly non-euro Income Statement results. 
The table below details the sensitivity of the Group’s total profit after tax from continuing 
operations, translation reserve, and cash flow hedge reserve to a hypothetical 10% 
strengthening of the euro against sterling, US$ and Swiss francs from a translation 
perspective. Sensitivities to a 10% strengthening of the euro has been selected given the 
current level of exchange rates, exchange rate volatility observed on a historic basis and 
market expectations for future movements. Similar but opposite sensitivities would arise 
upon a 10% weakening of the euro against sterling, US$ and Swiss francs:
	 Profit	 after	 tax	 Translation 	 reserve	 Hedging 	 reserve
  2008	 2007	 2008 2007 2008 2007
(Profit)/loss  €m €m €m  €m  €m €m
Euro/sterling   (4.8) 2.9 9.4 6.8 (0.3)  0.2
Euro/US$   1.3 0.9 – – (1.3) (0.5)
Euro/Swiss francs   (4.0) (1.8) 2.2 2.0 –  –
Profit after tax sensitivities primarily arise from the revaluation of non-hedging derivatives 
comprising forward foreign contracts where the Group has not applied hedge accounting. 
The sensitivities thereby primarily impact amounts excluded from underlying, rather than 
the Group’s underlying profit after tax. Translation reserve sensitivities effectively arise 
from the retranslation of the net assets of head office and trading operations in the UK, 
and trading operations in Switzerland, from sterling and Swiss francs respectively,  
into euro. Hedging reserve sensitivities to sterling balances arise from the hedging of 
forward foreign exchange contracts, whilst the US$ sensitivities arise from both forward 
foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps.
Interest	 rate	 risk
To manage interest rate risk the Group is financed through a combination of fixed and 
floating rate facilities and enters into various interest rate derivatives. In accordance with 
IFRS 7, interest rate sensitivities are calculated by reference to the interest rate profile  
of the Group’s balance sheet as at each year end, with all other variables kept constant. 
Sensitivities to a 1% increase in interest rates have been selected given the current level 
of market interest rates, interest rate volatility observed on a historic basis and market 
expectations for future movements. Similar but opposite sensitivities would arise upon  
a 1% reduction in interest rates. The interest rate sensitivities are calculated based on 
the following:
(a)  Changes in the market interest rates of non-derivative financial instruments with fixed 
interest rates only affect income if these are recognised at their fair value. As such,  
all financial instruments with fixed interest rates that are carried at amortised cost  
are not subject to interest rate risk as defined in IFRS 7.
(b)  Changes in the market interest rate of financial instruments that were designated as 
hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge, to hedge payment fluctuations resulting from 
interest rate movements, affect the cash flow hedge reserve in shareholder’s equity 
and are therefore taken into consideration in the equity related sensitivity calculations.
(c)  Changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of non-
derivative variable interest financial instruments. As a consequence, they are included 
in the calculation of income related sensitivities, other than where the interest 
payments are designated as part of a cash flow hedge against interest rate risk. 
(d)  Changes in the market interest rate of interest rate derivatives (interest rate swaps, 
callable interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, caps and collars) that are not 
part of a hedging relationship as set out in IAS 39, affect other financial income or 
expense (net gain/loss from remeasurement of the financial fair value) and are 
therefore taken into consideration in the income related sensitivity calculations.
(e)  Currency derivatives are not directly exposed to interest rate risks and therefore do not 
affect the interest rate sensitivities.

The net impact of derivatives in 2008 of €(75.8) million (2007: €(51.3) million), 
comprises the recognition of the fair value of the debt-related derivative financial 
instruments of €(66.2) million (2007: €(43.3) million), adjusted for the fair value hedge 
adjustment of €9.6 million (2007: €(8.0) million) (see Note 27).
The above fixed/floating rate analysis excludes the impact of interest rate caps and 
collars. Including the impact of such caps and collars, €100.0 million (2007:  
€100.0 million) of net debt would be classified as fixed rate.

The Directors consider that the book value of non-current assets – available for sale 
investments; trade and other receivables; current assets – held for trading; cash and 
cash equivalents; and trade and other payables, approximate to their fair value. 
The fair value of obligations under finance leases approximates to their book value as the 
majority of these obligations are due within one year (see Note 25).
The fair value of borrowings and deferred consideration for disclosures are based either 
on tradable market values, or where such market values are not readily available are 
estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest 
rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.

Own shares are held by the Avis Europe Employee Share Trust, a discretionary trust,  
to partially satisfy options and awards granted under a number of the Group’s share 
schemes. The Company’s own shares have a nominal value of 1 pence per share.
At 31 December 2008, the Trust held 637,735 shares (2007: 3,811,301 shares), which 
have been recognised as a reduction in shareholders’ funds. The reduction in own shares 
held during the year relates to the exercise of awards for the 2006 Deferred Bonus Share 
Plan. The market value of the remaining shares as at 31 December 2008 was 3.9 pence 
per share (2007: 40.5 pence per share). None of the shares held at the year end are 
under option to employees, nor have they been conditionally gifted to them. The Avis 
Europe Employee Share Trust has not waived its right to any dividends on these shares.

IFRS 2, Share-Based Payment, requires that the fair value of all share options issued 
after 7 November 2002 is charged to the Income Statement. Certain options from the 
approved and unapproved schemes were issued before 7 November 2002 and therefore 
the fair values of these granted options are not recognised. For options issued after 
7 November 2002, the fair value of the option must be assessed on the date of each 
issue. The Group uses a stochastic valuation model at each issue date re-assessing the 
input assumptions on each occasion. The weighted average of the assumptions used  
in each valuation and the resulting weighted average fair value per option, for options 
issued in the year, were as follows:
	 	 Long-Term	 	 Long-Term
	 	 Incentive 	 Plan	 2008	 Incentive 	 Plan	 2007

Fair value per option (pence)     8.5   n/a  58.4	  58.4 
Expected volatility was determined by reference to the volatility in the share price using 
rolling one year periods for the five years immediately preceding the grant date. The risk 
free rate of return is based upon UK gilt rates with an equivalent term to the options granted.
For options issued prior to July 2003, an expected dividend yield of 6.4% was applied, 
based on historic dividend yield performance. For options issued after July 2003, future 
dividend assumptions were aligned to the dividend expectations publicly announced by 
the Group.

39	 Disposal
Disposal of subsidiary
In the prior year, the Group disposed of its subsidiary in Greece, Olympic Commercial  
and Tourist Enterprises SA, which was classified as a discontinued operation. The net 
consideration was €14.4 million after deducting a warranty provision of €7.8 million and 
the net assets at disposal were €23.2 million. Accordingly, the total loss on disposal was 
€8.8 million. A goodwill impairment charge of €7.1 million was recorded prior to the 
disposal. The loss on disposal and the goodwill impairment charge are excluded from the 
underlying result.
The Group has recognised an exceptional credit of €1.3 million in the current year to 
reflect the final settlement of a warranty provision (see Note 6).
In the prior year, the financial results and cash flows of the discontinued operation were 
considered to be a separate major line of business and were therefore separately 
disclosed as follows:

40	 Contingent	 liabilities
The Company and certain subsidiaries have provided unsecured guarantees to certain 
third parties within the normal course of business, the majority of which were in favour  
of certain lenders in respect of some of the Group’s loan notes and borrowing facilities, 
together with guarantees provided to vehicle suppliers and property lessors. As at 
31 December 2008, these guarantees totalled €1,045.9 million (2007: €953.7 million). 
Certain Group companies are defendants in a number of claims and legal proceedings 
incidental to their operations. The Directors do not expect that any of these contingencies 
will have a material negative impact on the results or financial position of the Group.
Save as disclosed herein and excluding intra-group indebtedness and guarantees,  
no member of the Group had at the close of business on 31 December 2008 any 
outstanding loan capital (including loan capital created but unissued), term loans or any 
other borrowings or indebtedness in the nature of borrowings, including bank overdrafts, 
liabilities under acceptances (other than normal trade bills) or acceptance credits,  
hire purchase commitments, obligations under finance leases, guarantees or other 
contingent liabilities.

Financial	 statements
We have audited the Parent Company Financial Statements of Avis Europe plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the Parent Company 
Balance Sheet, the Parent Company Cash Flow Statement, the Significant 
Accounting Policies and the related notes. These Parent Company Financial 
Statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
that is described as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the Consolidated Financial Statements of  
Avis Europe plc for the year ended 31 December 2008. 
Respective	 responsibilities	 of	 Directors	 and	 auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the Parent Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Parent Company Financial Statements and  
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared 
for and only for the Company’s Members as a body in accordance with Section 
235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any 
other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Parent Company Financial 
Statements give a true and fair view and whether the Parent Company 
Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to  
be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report is consistent with the Parent Company Financial Statements. 
The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information 
presented in the Business Review, the Corporate Governance Statement and 
the sections of the Remuneration Report that are referred to as audited that  
are cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept  
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law 
regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider 
whether it is consistent with the audited Parent Company Financial Statements. 
The other information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief 
Executive’s Review, the Business Review, the Corporate and Social 
Responsibility Report, the Directors’ Listing, the Corporate Governance 
Statement, the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the unaudited part of 
the Remuneration Report and the Five Year Summary. We consider the 
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies with the Parent Company Financial Statements.  
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis	 of	 audit	 opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on  
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts  
and disclosures in the Parent Company Financial Statements and the part  
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors 
in the preparation of the Parent Company Financial Statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information  
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Parent Company 
Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to  
be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the Parent Company Financial 
Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
•  the Parent Company Financial Statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, 
of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2008;
•  the Parent Company Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
•  the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the  
Parent Company Financial Statements.

Parent	Company	Cash	Flow	Statement
for the year ended 31 December 80	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
Basis	 of	 preparation
The Company’s functional currency is sterling, and the Balance Sheet,  
Cash Flow Statement and related notes are presented in sterling.
The Parent Company Financial Statements set out on pages 78 to 82 have  
been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with 
applicable UK accounting standards and the Companies Act 1985. A summary 
of the principal accounting policies is set out below, which are consistent with 
those followed in the preparation of the Company’s Financial Statements for 
the year ended 31 December 2008.
Fixed	 asset	 investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for any impairment 
where the recoverable amount is less than cost. Fixed asset investments are 
initially stated at cost, being their purchase cost together with any incidental 
expenses of acquisitions. The carrying values of fixed asset investments are 
reviewed at each year end and if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. Any impairment of fixed asset 
investments is charged to the Profit and Loss Account in the year in which  
it arises.
Debtors
Debtors are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for 
impairment. A provision for impairment of trade debtors is established when 
there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of the debt. The amount of the 
provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows. The carrying amount is reduced 
through the use of an allowance account, and the amount is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account. When a trade debt is uncollectible, it is written off 
against the allowance account for trade debtors. Subsequent recoveries of 
amounts previously written off are credited in the Profit and Loss Account.
Creditors
Creditors are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Deferred	 taxation
Deferred tax is provided using the incremental liability approach and is 
measured on a non-discounted basis at the average tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, 
based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences that have originated 
but not reversed by the balance sheet date except that:
a)  Deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets 
such as property unless a binding sale agreement exists at the balance 
sheet date. Where rollover relief is available on an asset then deferred tax  
is in any case not recognised.
b)  Deferred tax is not recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures unless dividends have been 
accrued as receivable or there is a binding agreement to distribute past 
earnings at the balance sheet date.
c)  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as 
recoverable. Assets are regarded as recoverable when it is regarded as 
more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which 
the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
d) Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences.
Foreign	 currency
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange 
ruling at the year end. Transactions during the year are recorded at rates of 
exchange in effect when the transaction occurs. 
Dividend	 distribution
Final dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in 
the Financial Statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by 
the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Share-based	 payments
Share-based payments are exclusively made in connection with employee 
share option plans (ESOPs). 
FRS 20, Share-Based Payments, is not applied to shares, share options or 
other equity instruments that were granted before or on 7 November 2002  
and which had not vested at 1 January 2005. Equity-settled ESOPs granted 
after that date are accounted for in accordance with FRS 20, such that the  
fair value of the employee service received in exchange for the grant of  
the option is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account over the related 
performance period. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period  
is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding 
the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example profitability 
growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions 
about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. At each 
balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options 
that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the 
revision of original estimates in the Profit and Loss Account, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 
credited to share capital and share premium when the options are exercised.
Financial	 guarantees
Financial guarantees, other than those previously asserted by the entity to be 
insurance contracts, are initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently 
measured at the higher of: (a) the unamortised balance of the related fees 
received and deferred; and (b) the expenditure required to settle the 
commitment at the balance sheet date.

Details of the Company’s principal subsidiaries are provided in Note 45 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Directors review at each year end the carrying value of the fixed asset investments  
in the principal subsidiaries by undertaking a value in use calculation. In determining  
the value in use, the Directors calculated the present value of the estimated future cash 
flows expected to arise based on management’s latest three-year plans, with 
extrapolation thereafter. The calculated value in use is sensitive to a number of 
assumptions which are discussed in turn below. These potential changes in key 
assumptions fall well within historic variations experienced by the business and are 
therefore considered reasonably possible:
EBIT margin – The long-term EBIT margin is fixed by reference to management’s 
estimated EBIT margin as at 2011. An increase/(decrease) in the EBIT margin by 50 
basis points in 2010 only would result in a (decrease)/increase in the impairment 
provision of £(4) million/£4 million. An increase/(decrease) in the long-term EBIT margin 
by 50 basis points in 2011 and beyond would result in a (decrease)/increase in the 
impairment of £(76) million/£76 million.
Discount rate – Future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of  
10.2%. An increase/(decrease) in the discount rate of 50 basis points would result in  
an increase/(decrease) in the impairment provision of £109 million/£(113) million.
Long-term growth rate – Cash flows beyond an initial three-year period are extrapolated 
using a long-term average nominal growth rate of 4.0% (2007: 4.0%) comprising a  
real growth rate of 2.0% and inflationary rate of 2.0%. A (decrease)/increase in the 
nominal growth rate of 1.0% to 3.0%/5.0% would result in an increase/(decrease) in the 
impairment provision of £29 million/£(33) million.
Exchange rate – The value in use calculation is performed in euros in line with the 
majority of the cash flows of the Company’s subsidiaries. The resultant euro valuation is 
translated into sterling at the closing exchange rate. The main forecasted non-euro cash 
flows are denominated in sterling and are converted to euro based on a long-term euro/
sterling exchange rate expected to be in place at the time of the forecast transaction. 
Most sterling cash flows are forecast to be converted into euro at a forecast exchange 
rate of 1.27. An increase/(decrease) in the euro/sterling exchange rate by one euro cent 
would result in an increase/(decrease) in the impairment provision of £5 million/£(5) 
million arising upon the translation of sterling cash flows. This analysis excludes any 
trading impacts which may arise from changes in exchange rates.

13	 Contingent	 liabilities
The Company and certain subsidiaries have provided unsecured guarantees to certain 
third parties within the normal course of business, the majority of which were in favour  
of certain lenders in respect of some of the Group’s loan notes and borrowing facilities, 
together with guarantees provided to vehicle suppliers and property lessors. As at  
31 December 2008, these guarantees in relation to drawn balances totalled  
£998.0 million (2007: £682.6 million).
Certain Group companies are defendants in a number of claims and legal proceedings 
incidental to their operations. The Directors do not expect that any of these contingencies 
will have a material impact on the results or financial position of the Company.

2010 Highlights the Group’s uK stores (other than Field & t rek) supply 
a wide range of competitively priced sports and leisure 
equipment, clothing, footwear and accessories, under 
a mix of brands. We stock third party brands including 
adidas, nike, reebok and puma. Group owned brands 
include dunlop, slazenger and lonsdale and we also  
use licensed in brands. 
a significant proportion of the revenue in the stores is 
derived from the sale of the Group owned and licensed 
in branded products, which allows the retail business 
to generate higher margins, whilst at the same time 
differentiating the Group’s stores from its competitors, 
both in terms of the range of products on sale and the 
competitive prices at which they are offered. 
Field & t rek operates out of 19 stores in the uK,  
selling a wide range of camping and outdoor equipment, 
waterproof clothing and footwear, including leading  
brands such as Berghaus, Merrell and salomon. 
the acquisition of Field & t rek gave the Group an entry 
into the outdoor market, which had been identified as a 
strategic opportunity for the Group, and that has been 
strengthened following the acquisition of universal  
cycles by the introduction of a range of cycle products  
in both stores and online.
as at 25 april 2010 the Group operated out of 387 stores 
in the united Kingdom (excluding northern ireland). the 
majority of stores trade under the sportsdirect .com 
fascia, although Field & t rek stores trade under their  
own fascia.
 
Where we are 
the Group has retail interests outside the uK and has 
a flexible approach to entry into new markets. these 
interests include wholly owned retail outlets (in Belgium, 
Holland, luxembourg and slovenia trading as sports 
direct), joint ventures with other retailers (such as in 
Heatons stores in northern ireland and the republic of 
ireland) stores within another retailer’s store  
(as in cyprus).
section 1 // OVERVIEW // 
What we do
sports direct is the uK’s leading 
sports retailer by revenue and 
operating profit, and the owner of a 
significant number of internationally 
recognised sports and leisure brands. 
sports direct at a glance
a brief overview of our business sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.3
the Group’s portfolio includes a wide variety of 
internationally recognisable sport and fashion brands.  
the Group’s retail division sells products under these 
Group brands in its stores, and the Brands division exploits 
the brands through its wholesale and licensing businesses.
the Brands division wholesale business sells the  
brands’ core products, such as dunlop tennis rackets  
and slazenger tennis balls, to wholesale customers  
and distributors throughout the world, obtaining far  
wider distribution for these products than would be  
the case if their sale was restricted to Group stores.  
the wholesale business also wholesales childrenswear 
and other clothing. 
the licensing business licenses third parties to apply 
Group owned brands to non-core products manufactured 
and distributed by those third parties, and third parties  
are currently licensed in different product areas in over  
100 countries. the Brands division is closely involved in  
the development of licensed products and monitors 
licensees and their manufacturers to ensure product 
quality, presentation and consistency with the appropriate 
brand strategy. 
the Brands division continue to sponsor a variety of 
prestigious events and retain a base of globally recognised, 
high profile sports men and women. 
in tennis, slazenger continues to be the official ball 
supplier for the Wimbledon championships and dunlop’s 
professional tour team continues to grow, with the recent 
additions of Fernando Verdasco and nikolay davydenko, 
both ranked in the world’s top 10 tennis players.
Golfers darren clarke and in particular lee Westwood 
continue to shine in major tournaments under the 
sponsorship of dunlop.
international cricket captains paul collingwood & Michael 
clarke continue to be sponsored by slazenger whilst other 
sports such as badminton and squash continue to provide 
brand exposure for carlton and dunlop respectively. 
the portfolio of boxing brands within the Group remains 
strong as lonsdale celebrates 50 years and everlast 100 
years as specialists in manufacturing combat sports 
equipment and apparel. Both brands have a stable of 
sponsored boxers and mixed martial arts fighters that 
continues to grow.
our Brands
RETAIl
87% of Group sales
BRANDS
13% of Group sales in common with other sectors of the economy, market 
conditions in sports retail remained challenging 
throughout the period under review. our focus remained 
firmly fixed on doing what we do best – providing 
consumers with the widest possible range of the best 
products at the most competitive prices available. our 
aim is to offer quality footwear, clothing and equipment 
for every category of customer from the fashion conscious 
to serious competitors. the Group has a robust business 
model, whose worth has been proved once again this year 
in the delivery of strong results from the Group.
in addition to exceeding our expectations outlined 12 
months ago in terms of both profit performance and debt 
reduction, we are pleased with our sales performance both 
in the stores themselves but also with the increased sales 
in our growing internet business. We continued to develop 
our international store network and were pleased with 
progress made in changing the balance of sales mix from 
wholesale to licensing in the Brands division. We made 
significant progress in our debt reduction programme 
during the year, paying down £119m, and intend to 
continue to reduce debt further in the coming year. this  
is a key consideration in the decision not to pay a final 
dividend this year. 
partnerships with world famous suppliers such as nike 
and adidas, to name only two, are critically important 
to our business and we value such relationships highly. 
We are delighted to be creating a unique nike t raining 
academy at our shirebrook headquarters in partnership 
with nike where sports direct staff will benefit from 
extensive, specialist training in the current nike range  
as well as likely future developments. this is the first 
time nike has joined with a retail partner in such a facility 
anywhere in the world. We welcome this innovative 
extension of our relationship with a valued third party 
supplier as well as the opportunity to take our staff 
training standards on to a new, industry leading level. 
the announcement in august 2009 of the competition 
commission’s interest in our acquisition of 31 stores from 
JJB sports plc and the potential investigation into our 
affairs by the office of Fair t rading and the serious Fraud 
office caused concern and reflected adversely on our share 
price. We were pleased, but not surprised, by our complete 
exoneration by the competition commission in March 2010 
and are doing all that we can to help and facilitate the 
other regulatory bodies to reach the same conclusion as 
soon as possible. 
We have provided the sFo with all the information they 
have requested to date and we have reason to hope the 
investigation may be concluded in the autumn.
as previously announced, the Board is sorry to lose 
non-executive director Malcolm dalgleish who has 
decided to stand down at the next aGM. We thank him 
for his contribution and will miss his wise counsel. We 
are pursuing the appointment of a replacement and will 
update shareholders in due course. 
Management remains determined to provide the best 
products at the most competitive price in the market place. 
We will continue to expand the number of stores, develop 
further strategic partnerships and enhance our product 
range and customer experience. We are determined to 
strengthen our position as the uK’s leading sports retailer 
and will expand our foothold on mainland europe. 
Finally, on behalf of the Board, i would like to thank all our 
employees whose commitment and expertise have helped 
us to meet our 2010 targets and to deliver a strong set of 
results in what continues to be a challenging economic 
environment. on a personal note, i am delighted to join 
such a talented and hard working team and am confident 
that significant further Group success lies ahead.

Nike Academy // Shirebrook Training Centre chief executive’s report
it is good to be able to report on another year of strong 
growth for sports direct, achieved by delivering what 
we said we would. the resilience of our business model 
continues to add significant value to our operations by 
providing customers with an unrivalled depth and breadth 
of product choice at the best available prices, across all 
categories and in all stores for serious sportsmen  
and women. 
With a number of new stores opened during the year in 
the uK and europe, we are taking our offer to an ever 
increasing customer base which is responding positively 
to stronger in-store marketing and promotional initiatives. 
We are proud of our reputation for quality and remain as 
determined as ever to strengthen our position as the clear 
market leader in the uK sports retail sector. 
i am especially pleased that our people will benefit from 
their contribution to Group success through our meeting 
the first year’s target for the employee Bonus share 
scheme introduced last year. 
 
Group 
in the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 (the Year) we 
increased Group revenue 6.2% to a record £1,452m 
compared with revenue of £1,367m for the 52 weeks 
ended 26 april 2009. the increase was due to a strong 
performance in the retail division where revenues rose 
10.9% to £1,261m (2009: £1,137m). the Brand division 
revenues decreased as planned,17.4% to £190.5m  
(2009: £230.5m).
Group gross margin in the Year fell by 20 basis points 
from 40.8% to 40.6%. retail division margin fell by 50 
basis points to 40.8% (2009: 41.3%), while Brands division 
margin increased 60 basis points to 38.9% (2009: 38.3%).
Group operating costs increased 1.4% to £431.0m (2009: 
£425.0m). retail division operating costs were well 
controlled and increased by only 3.3% in the Year, despite 
an increase in floor space of 5.2% and a rise in sales of just 
under 11%. 
Brands division operating costs were down 23.4% to 
£54.2m (2009: £70.8m) due to a combination of the 
reduction in costs in line with turnover and operational 
efficiencies. also included within Group operating costs 
is a £10.8m (2009: nil) charge in respect of the employee 
Bonus share scheme and p erformance share plan. this 
charge has been taken centrally and, except in note 4 
to the accounts, is not reflected in divisional (retail and 
Brands) numbers in this report. 
We grew Group underlying eBitda for the Year by 17.3% to 
£160.4m (2009: £136.8m). Within this underlying eBitda, 
the retail division increased 27.2% to £151.4m (2009: 
£119.0m) and the Brands division increased 11.2% to 
£19.8m (2009: £17.8m).
Group underlying profit before tax increased 49.8% to 
£102.1m (2009: £68.2m), as a result of the £23.6m increase 
in eBitda together with a £12.8m reduction in interest 
payable and a £1.8m increase in depreciation.
underlying eps for the Year increased by 56.2% to 12.39p 
(2009: 7.93p).
debt reduction remains a priority for the Group. in 
december 2009, we announced a target to reduce net debt 
levels to below £400m by april 2010. in fact, we actually 
reduced net debt to £311.9m (2009: £431.3m). this was 
achieved by:
• growing underlying eBitda from £136.8m to £160.4m 
• reducing inventory levels through the year from £262.3m 
to £218.8.m
• reducing levels of capital expenditure by approximately 
50% to £19.4m as targeted last year
• reducing financing costs by £12.8m as a result of 
ongoing low interest rates and lower level of debt from 
£22.5m to £9.7m 
• saving the cost of the 2009 final and 2010 dividends
in the current financial year and beyond, we will target to 
reduce levels of debt further to a range between one and 
1.5 times underlying eBitda by april 2011.

uK retail
uK retail revenues growth was primarily driven by our 
retail and logistics skills – providing the best products at 
the best prices with universal availability.
uK retail sales were up 11.0% to £1,118m (2009: £1,007m). 
there were no major acquisitions or disposals within uK 
retail during the Year. sales in the second half of the Year 
were up 7.2% to £531.7m (2009: £496.2m) against strong 
comparatives. the sales increase in the second half of the 
Year was better than expected, but was at the expense of a 
lower than anticipated margin. 
online revenue continues to grow strongly and we will 
look at opportunities to develop this revenue stream 
further. order fulfilment and state-of-the-art information 
technology solutions are developed in-house with full 
back-up support from our national distribution centre 
resources in shirebrook, derbyshire. the website has 
benefited from the increased recognition of the online 
brand with approximately 90% of core store fascias now 
branded sportsdirect .com. online sales represented 
4.5% of total uK retail sales (2009:1.5%). Between March 
and June 2010, we ran our first television advertising 
campaign. We saw a subsequent increase in both product-
specific and new customer web traffic. a second campaign 
is likely to be launched in the autumn.
overall uK retail gross margin for the Year fell by 120 
basis points to 41.3% (2009: 42.5%). Margin for the second 
half of the Year was 40.9% (2009: 39.6%), impacted by 
comprehensive promotions and clearance of stock in 
advance of the FiFa 2010 World cup (“World cup”).
at the time of the Group’s interim results in december 
2009, we expected sales in the second half to be lower than 
for the same period in 2009, with margin for the Year as a 
whole to be at a similar level to 2009. the actual margin for 
the second half was lower than expected (as noted above) 
but this was more than compensated for by higher than 
expected sales partly arising from the sales generated 
ahead of the World cup.
uK retail like-for-like gross contribution increased by 
3.4% over the 12 month period.
operating costs increased 1.9% to £323.5m (2009: 
£317.6m) in spite of the uK minimum wage increase, an 
increase in floor space and a rise in sales of just over 11%.

The Boot Room // Sportsdirect.com store, Shirebrook underlying eBitda for uK retail was £138.7m (2009: 
£107.0m). this increase was driven by a £37.7m increase 
in gross margin (including wholesale), offset by a £5.9m 
increase in operating costs.
during the Year, the office of Fair t rading (oFt) 
investigated our acquisition of stores from JJB sports plc 
(“JJB”), and concluded that in five locations they raised 
some concerns. the oFt subsequently referred the matter 
to the competition commission. on 18 March 2010, the 
competition commission cleared the acquisition of the 31 
stores from JJB and ruled that there was not a substantial 
lessening of competition as a result of those acquisitions, 
nor any adverse effects on customers. We are still dealing 
with the oFt & serious Fraud office (sF o) enquiries. While 
we have heard nothing from the oFt, we have provided the 
sFo with all the information they have required to date, 
and we have reason to hope that the investigation may be 
concluded in the autumn of this year.
the Group’s retail businesses performed strongly in a very 
difficult economic environment. our retail model, offering 
outstanding value to our customers, proved as resilient as 
we expected it to be, both in the uK and internationally.
throughout the Year, we continued to focus on our 
fundamental approach of offering the customer the most 
comprehensive product range and the best availability 
while reducing our costs wherever possible. as ever, store 
portfolio was constantly under review, the performance 
of each store and ways of maximising performance being 
closely examined. We continued to develop our store layout 
and to incentivise our store staff in ways that encourage 
better customer service and performance. our industry 
leading national distribution centre at shirebrook 
continued to deliver efficiencies. By way of example of 
cost control, in our corporate responsibility report we 
describe some of the steps successfully taken to reduce 
our energy consumption at a time when energy costs were 
increasing significantly.
during spring 2010, we started construction work on an 
extension to our national t raining Facility at shirebrook, 
which is located within the on-site store. this exciting 
project involved a complete reorganisation of the store 
layout with new attractive specialist areas being refitted. 
net sales area space increased from 18,000 sq ft to 
25,000 sq ft. the store is now the blueprint for a roll-
out programme of updating our core stores across the 
uK. capital expenditure for this roll-out is included 
in the expected Group capital expenditure for FY11 of 
approximately £35.0m (2010: £19.4m). 
We continued to work well with our major third party  
brand suppliers. nike, umbro, adidas, reebok and puma 
all have their own offices in our shirebrook head office 
which enables us to work very closely with them on a day 
to day basis. 
We were delighted to achieve a notable first with the 
creation of a purpose-built nike t raining academy at the 
shirebrook site. this is the first time nike has entered 
into such a partnership with a retail partner anywhere in 
the world. We are proud to host such a magnificent facility 
which will have its first open day on 21 July 2010 for up to 
300 of our national retail team. 
the academy demonstrates our commitment to develop 
our training of staff in close partnership with our key 
third party brands. We plan to have all permanent sales 
staff attend a training session in the academy within 12 
months of its opening as part of their on-going training and 
personal development. our goal is to have the best trained 
and most knowledgeable staff in uK sports retail.
We continued to build on our store-in-store concept for 
certain key categories where we want to develop our role 
as the destination of choice for serious sportsmen and 
women. our approach to the running category typifies how 
we are doing this, constantly seeking to develop our retail 
offer. since october 2007, we have owned a 25% share in 
Brasher leisure ltd, trading as “sweatshop”, one of the 
leading specialist running retailers in the uK. the strategy 
for the running category within sports direct is to develop 
with sweatshop an attractive new sales area branded 
as “she runs He runs” catering to the growing “main 
stream” runner. these areas deliver on range, availability, 
price, clear merchandising and self help (if preferred) and 
will be further enhanced by the training initiatives being 
driven from our national t raining centre.
installation progress has been swift with 50% of our 300 
core stores already having “she runs He runs” sections. 
the roll-out programme to other stores continues. 
additionally, 75% of stores now feature our specialist 
football “boot room” display area.
the strategy outlined on developing our running category 
will also be applied to certain other sporting areas, many 
of which are in different stages of development. these 
include golf, outdoor and cycling.
on 17 March 2010, the Group made an indicative, non 
binding offer for the entire issued and to be issued share 
capital of Blacks leisure Group plc (“Blacks”) with a view 
to seeking that company’s recommendation. We were 
disappointed that this was not forthcoming.

October 2009 // Dunlop Brand Ambassador lee Westwood 
celebrates winning the portugal Masters. on 29 March 2010, sports direct announced that it had 
approached the board of Blacks to advise that it was 
seriously considering a material increase in the level 
of its indicative offer. However, the Group also advised 
that it had become aware of indications that some 
key Blacks suppliers would not supply the company if 
the sports direct offer was successful. sports direct 
requested confirmation of, and the details underlying, 
any such supplier indications to Blacks. in the event, this 
information was neither provided nor denied. accordingly, 
sports direct determined that it would not be in its 
shareholders’ interests formally to submit an offer. 
Blacks subsequently raised additional capital from its 
shareholders. 
We did not participate in this fundraising, believing it not to 
be the best use of the Group’s funds.
as of 25 april 2010, we operated 387 stores in the uK 
(excluding northern ireland), a total retail sales space of 
circa 3.7m sq ft (2009: circa 3.5m sq ft).
during the course of the Year, we opened 34 stores, 
including nine core stores, and closed six, one of which 
was core. We have taken advantage of the weaker property 
market during the Year by taking 19 of the 25 new non-core 
stores on initial temporary lease/licence arrangements. 
this has enabled us to work very closely with landlords 
to exploit opportunities, with a view to converting initial 
temporary stores into long term lease agreements where 
appropriate. 
We currently operate 306 sportsdirect .com fascias, 
19 Field & t rek, three lillywhites and 59 other stores 
(Gilesports, Hargreaves, etc).

in the 12 months to 25 april 2010, 53 rent reviews have 
been agreed on stores. the average increase in rent was 
9.9% (1.91% annual equivalent). there are currently 80 
rent reviews outstanding with a further 50 falling due in 
2010-11. 
For a number of years, our uK retail division has occupied 
32 stores which are owned by Mike ashley, the Group’s 
major shareholder, under the terms of a five year lease 
dated March 2007. the management intend to discuss with 
shareholders and Mr ashley the possibility of obtaining 
a year’s extension to the current term together with an 
option to purchase these properties during the extension 
period at a price no more than original cost. the option 
would require non-related party shareholder approval and 
would contain terms whereby it would be exercised only if 
it were demonstrably in the Group’s interest to do so.
in the current financial Year, we are targeting to open 
between six and ten new core stores in the uK, excluding 
northern ireland. 
We will continue to open temporary non-core stores as 
suitable opportunities arise and convert as many of these 
as is justified to long term deals. 
 
international retail
international retail sales were up 17.2% to £119.9m  
(2009: £102.3m). on a currency neutral basis, the increase 
was 11.0%.
international retail grew gross margin by 40 basis points 
due to improved stock control.
operating costs within international retail increased by 
16.1% to £42.5m (2009: £36.6m). the increase was less 
than the £8.1m increase in gross margin and, together with 
a £1.5m decrease in income from associates, resulted in 
an increase in underlying eBitda of 5.8% to £12.7m

internationally, as at 25 april 2010 we operated 44 stores 
in Belgium, 12 in slovenia, four in Holland, three in cyprus, 
one in France and one in luxembourg. all of these stores 
are operated by companies wholly owned by the Group. 
We opened seven new stores in europe, including two 
relocations in the period including our first store in France. 
We closed four smaller stores during the Year. as at 25 
april 2010, international retail operated from a total retail 
sales space of c.650,000 sq ft (2009: c.620,000 sq ft.)

countries where we currently trade. 
 
Brands 
Brands total revenue reduced 17.4% to £190.5m (2009: 
£230.5.m), driven by our deliberate strategy to change the 
mix of sales from predominantly wholesale to licensing.
Wholesale revenues were down 17.8% to £167.3m (2009: 
£203.6m), in line with this strategy to focus on contribution 
rather than revenue. this strategy is well illustrated by our 
north america market move from wholesale to licensing in 
dunlop Golf.
the market for our Wholesale businesses in the uK, 
europe and the us remain challenging and the customer 
base has been restructured to eliminate unprofitable 
business. 
licensing revenues were down 13.8% to £23.2m (2009: 
£26.9m) which was in line with our expectations and, in 
light of our decision to cancel one significant everlast 
licence, with the attendant costs.
t ough market conditions, particularly in north america, 
resulted in decreased licensing income during the Year 
with key licensees leading to a fall in the level of income in 
excess of the licence minimums. We continue, however, to 
lay the foundations for future growth. during the Year, we 
signed new licence agreements with 71 licensees, covering 
multiple brands and product categories, with minimum 
contracted values of $87m over the terms of  
the agreements.  
longer term, we regard licensing as the key driver for the 
Brands division profitability and growth of the business. 
our resources have been adjusted in order to focus on this 
objective. the main growth areas are expected to be asia 
pacific and the americas.
Brands gross margin improved to 38.9% (2009: 38.3%), 
reflecting the improved mix of sales and a slight 
improvement in wholesale gross margin to 30.4% (2009: 
30.2%). 
operating costs decreased by 23.4% to £54.2m (2009: 
£70.8m), partly as a result of the lower revenue. the 
consolidation of the Brands division management into 
shirebrook continued and costs were tightly controlled as 
systems and working practices were standardised. payroll 
costs in the division reduced significantly.
our continued aim is to limit costs in the 2011 financial 
year such that the wholesale contribution covers operating 
costs and all licensing income is retained as profit.
underlying eBitda increased 11.2% to £19.8m (2009: 
£17.8m) as the decrease in costs of £16.6m was greater 
than the decrease in gross profit of £14.3m.
cash flow in the division was strong with tight working 
capital management resulting in a reduction in stock and 
debtors of £15.1m and £19.6m respectively.
the business continues to sponsor and receive 
endorsements from leading players and tournaments 
including slazenger’s 107th year as the official ball 
supplier for the Wimbledon championships. We believe 
this to be one of the longest continuous sponsorship 
arrangements anywhere in the world. slazenger continues 
to sponsor Matt prior and p aul collingwood and we 
congratulate paul as england’s captain at the recent icc 
World t wenty20 cricket competition where england  
scored a notable victory over australia to win the 
tournament, who were also captained by slazenger 
endorsee Michael clarke.
dunlop has recently signed nikolay davydenko and 
Fernando Verdasco, both ranked in the world’s top 10 
tennis players. lee Westwood, number 3 in the world 
rankings, continues to shine in the world’s top golf

 like-for-like gross contribution for uK retail is the percentage change in successive 
12 month periods. like-for-like gross contribution is adjusted to eliminate the impact 
of foreign currency movements. a like-for-like store is one that has been trading for the 
full 12 months in both periods, and has not been affected by a significant change such as 
a refit. store gross contribution is the excess of sales revenue (net of Vat) over the cost 
of goods sold. this Kpi excludes online sales revenue. the gross contribution would only 
be adjusted if a significant promotion affected the comparison.

contracts essential to the  
business of the Group
the Group has long established relationships with nike 
and adidas, the major suppliers of third party branded 
sporting goods, particularly footwear, and considers that 
continued supplies from these companies is critical to the 
business of the Group. 
 
the Group’s retail businesses will undoubtedly be affected 
by the economic climate and changes therein. Movements 
in interest rates and exchange rates affect the businesses 
directly and consumer confidence and spending is affected 
by a wide range of factors including employment, tax and 
interest rates, house prices and the general ‘feel good 
factor’, factors beyond the Group’s influence. We are 
relieved that the Government has given plenty of warning 
that the Vat increase to 20% will not take place until 4 
January 2011.
all of the above apply equally to our Brands businesses, 
both wholesale and licensing. reduction in customer 
demand is reflected in the wholesaling and licensing 
business, as orders and royalties are affected. Moreover, in 
difficult economic times, suppliers come under increasing 
pressure to reduce their prices to their customers and all 
suppliers run the risk of their customers ceasing to trade, 
reducing demand for their products. difficult economic 
conditions can also make it difficult for suppliers to obtain 
credit insurance in respect of some customers, leaving 
the supplier with a difficult question of whether or not to 
supply and, if they do, with the attendant risk of bad debts.
later in this report, we comment on risks and 
uncertainties that relate to the Group’s businesses and 
while we manage to reduce risks, where possible, the 
likelihood of their occurring and their impact if they do, 
they are factors that could influence the Group or part of it.
the Group is now applying hedge accounting, which is in 
line with other major retailers. this will reduce an element 
of potential volatility in reported profit.
 
environmental matters 
a review of the assessment of the Group’s impact on the 
environment is included in the corporate responsibility 
report on page 58. 
 
employees 
in no small measure, the progress we continue to make 
is down to the dedication and expertise of over 17,000 
staff throughout the business. i am delighted to take 
this opportunity to thank everyone in the team for their 
outstanding contribution and i look forward to working with 
them towards our further growth and success. 
Key performance indicators
Main trends and factors likely to 
affect the future development and 
performance of the Group’s businesses
section 2 // THE BUSINESS REVIEW //
chief executive’s report
continued sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.17
Nike football // Sportsdirect.com store, Belgium We intend to incentivise staff further by enabling them to 
share in the Group’s success through a new Bonus share 
scheme for which we will seek approval at the a GM. the 
Bonus share scheme is focused on underlying eBitda. it 
is designed to motivate colleagues, help improve retention 
of key employees and to align the interests of employees 
and shareholders. the share scheme is also aligned with 
the Group’s business plan.
all permanent uK employees in uK retail, Brands and 
Head office with at least one year’s service participated in 
the 2009/10 Bonus share scheme. 
the bonus is in two stages. the first bonus is 25% of base 
pay in shares of £1.00 per share. the first bonus target was 
underlying eBitda of £155m in 2009-10 and was achieved  
in the Year. the first bonus will vest in two years’ time and 
is subject to continuous employment until then. the bonus 
targets are stretch targets and are net of scheme costs.
the second bonus is 75% of base pay in shares of £1.25 per 
share. the second stage of the bonus is conditional upon 
the first bonus target being met in 2009-10, which has 
already been achieved, and the second bonus targets are 
underlying eBitda of £195m in 2010-2011, and underlying 
eBitda/net debt ratio of two or less at the end of 2010-11. 
the shares vest, subject to continuous employment until 
then, two years after the second bonus targets are met. 
proposals will be put forward to shareholders at the 
forthcoming aGM to extend and revise the Bonus share 
scheme for subsequent periods.
 
shirebrook campus
the Group continues to invest in infrastructure, and the 
process of consolidating the Brands business, including 
acquired businesses, at shirebrook continues.
 
risks are an inherent part of the business world. the 
Group has identified the following factors as potential risks 
to, and uncertainties concerning, the successful operation 
of its business.
suppl Y cHain 
any disruption or other adverse event affecting the 
Group’s relationship with any of its major manufacturers 
or suppliers, or a failure to replace any of its major 
manufacturers or suppliers on commercially reasonable 
terms, could have an adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, operating profit or overall financial condition.
ForeiGn excHanGe risK 
the Group operates internationally and is exposed to 
foreign exchange risk arising from various currency 
exposures, primarily with respect to the us dollar and 
euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial 
transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are 
denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s 
functional currency, as exchange rates move. 
as explained previously, in the Group’s case, the majority 
of foreign exchange contracts relating to the sourcing 
of Group branded goods are denominated in us dollars, 
and a strengthening of the dollar or a weakening of the 
pound sterling makes those goods more expensive. 
these expenses are hedged via forward foreign currency 
contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.
the Group also holds assets overseas in local currency, 
and these assets are revalued in accordance with currency 
movements. this currency risk is not hedged.
interest rate risK 
the Group has net borrowings, which are principally at 
floating interest rates linked to bank base rates or liBor. 
credit risK 
the Group, primarily through its Brands division, could 
have a credit risk if credit evaluations were not performed 
on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount. 
the Group does not require collateral in respect of 
financial assets. 
FundinG and liquiditY risK 
Funding and liquidity for the Group’s operations are 
provided through bank loans, overdrafts and shareholders 
funds. the object is to maintain sufficient funding and 
liquidity for the Group’s requirements, but the availability 
of adequate cash resources from bank facilities and 
achieving continuity of funding in the current financial 
climate could be a risk to the Group in future years.

Karrimor sponsored climber, Dave pickford inVestMent risK 
the Group also holds shares in publicly listed companies 
and fluctuations in their share prices will have a financial 
impact on the business results.
reliance on non uK ManuF acturers 
the Group is reliant on manufacturers in developing 
countries as the majority of the Group’s products are 
sourced from outside the uK. the Group is therefore 
subject to the risks associated with international trade and 
transport as well as those relating to exposure to different 
legal and other standards.
pensions
some subsidiaries in the Group make contributions to 
certain occupational defined benefits pension schemes. 
an increase in the scheme’s funding needs or changes 
to obligations in respect of the schemes could have an 
adverse impact on its business.
MarKet F orces 
the sports retail industry is highly competitive and the 
Group currently competes at national and local levels with 
a wide variety of retailers of varying sizes who may have 
competitive advantages, and new competitors may enter 
the market. such competition continues to place pressure 
on the Group’s pricing strategy, margins and profitability.
operational
any significant disruption to the operations of the Group, 
divisional head offices and the national distribution centre 
at shirebrook, or interruption to the smooth running of 
the Group’s fleet of vehicles, might significantly impact its 
ability to manage its operations, distribute products to its 
stores and maintain its supply chain.
any long term interruption of the Group’s it systems 
would have a significant impact on the Group’s operation, 
particularly in the retail division.
Business continuitY and acts oF terrorisM 
the majority of the Group’s revenue is derived from the 
uK and accordingly any terrorist attacks, armed conflicts 
or government actions within the uK could result in a 
significant reduction in consumer confidence, which would 
in turn have an adverse affect on sales in stores. 
leG al
the Group’s trade marks, patents, designs and other 
intellectual property rights are central to the value of 
the Group brands. third parties may try to challenge the 
ownership or counterfeit the Group’s intellectual property. 
the Group may need to resort to litigation in the future to 
enforce its intellectual property rights and any litigation 
could result in substantial costs and a diversion of 
resources. 
the Group believes that its licensees, suppliers, agents 
and distributors are in material compliance with 
employment, environmental and other laws. the violation, 
or allegations of a violation, of such laws or regulations, 
by any of the Group’s licensees, suppliers, agents or 
distributors, could lead to adverse publicity and a decline 
in public demand for the Group’s products, or require 
the Group to incur expenditure or make changes to its 
supply chain and other business arrangements to ensure 
compliance.
sales
the Group’s retail businesses are subject to seasonal 
peaks. the incidence and participation in major sporting 
events will have a particular impact on the uK retail 
business. prolonged unseasonal weather conditions or 
temporary severe weather during peak trading seasons 
could also have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
businesses.
consuMers
the Group’s success and sales are dependent, in part, on 
the strength and reputation of the brands it sells, and are 
subject to consumers’ perceptions of the Group and of its 
products, which can fall out of favour. adverse publicity 
concerning any of the Group brands or manufacturers 
or suppliers could lead to substantial erosion in the 
reputation of, or value associated with, the Group
enVironMental 
environmental disasters such as the recent volcanic ash 
cloud have highlighted how it is impossible to predict how 
an environmental occurrence will affect businesses.
the Group constantly updates systems to mitigate any 
delay or loss of goods in transit or the absence of any 
employee or large numbers of employees that they may or 
may not be altered by acts of nature. 
 
research and development
the Group’s success depends on the strength of the Group 
brands and, to a lesser extent, the licensed-in brands. the 
Group’s efforts to continually develop or obtain brands in a 
timely manner or at all may be unsuccessful.

the Group’s business (continued)
section 2 // THE BUSINESS REVIEW //
chief executive’s report
continued sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.21
Nike shoe wall // Sportsdirect.com store, liverpool the identification and management of risk is a continuous 
process, and the Group’s system of internal controls and 
the Group’s business continuity programmes are key 
elements of that. the Group maintains a system of controls 
to manage the business and to protect its assets. We 
continue to invest in people, systems and in it to manage 
the Group’s operations and its finances effectively and 
efficiently.
the Group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to 
risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. credit evaluations 
are performed on all customers requiring credit over 
a certain amount, and concentration of credit risk is 
managed. investment of cash surplus, borrowings and 
derivative investments are made through banks and 
companies which have credit ratings and investment 
criteria approved by the Board.
the Group’s follows policies of forging long term 
relationships with suppliers and of utilising two leading 
supply chain companies to procure much of the Group’s 
own branded goods is described on page 61 in the 
corporate responsibility report. 
Many risks relating to the supply chain, reliance on non-uK 
suppliers, and to the reputation of the Group’s brands are 
managed and mitigated by the implementation of those 
policies.
close monitoring of the market, competitors, the economy, 
consumer confidence, participation in major sporting 
events, the weather, companies in which the Group 
holds strategic stakes, the behaviour of licensees, and 
of possible infringement of intellectual property, and the 
development of contingency plans and rapid response 
to changing circumstances manages and does much to 
mitigate the risks caused by these factors.
the Group maintains close contact with its bank and made 
contact with other banks so as to begin to address the 
renewal of its facilities during 2010/11. the Group is cash 
generative and taken steps to reduce the level of debt 
and has no reason to believe that refinancing will not be 
available on acceptable terms.
the business continuity programme addresses the risk 
of disruption to the shirebrook campus. accordingly the 
Board is confident that as far as is practical the risks and 
uncertainties that face the Group are being monitored and 
managed and that where required appropriate action is 
being taken.
We are confident that the Group is well placed to deliver 
significant further growth in the future. our focus remains 
strongly on growing the core uK retail business by 
continuing to drive efficiencies and deliver the unrivalled 
value for money which our growing customer base has 
come to expect, while developing our offering in specialist 
sports categories. We have established an excellent 
platform for growth which we will build on with our 
proposed eBitda related share bonus scheme. 
outside the uK, our Brands business will focus on 
licensing opportunities and will continue to restructure 
the wholesale businesses. We will continue to invest in our 
brands through advertising and promotion. 
We believe that acquisitions and strategic investments in 
other related businesses are beneficial to the Group and 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities as they arise 
while, for the time being, remaining mindful of the priority 
to reduce debt.
 
current trading/FiFa World cup 2010
 
the build up to the World cup started during spring 2010 
with the launch of the umbro “away” red shirt on 3 March. 
t rade in this period was as strong as expected culminating 
in the strongest trading day that the company has ever 
experienced on the day of the usa match. We continue to 
offer the most comprehensive range of england branded 
products including special edition shirts as well as name 
and number personalisation. also, this was the first FiFa 
World cup for the online store and both traffic and sales 
have grown significantly.
unfortunately, the period during the tournament was less 
successful and sales correlated with the poor performance 
of the england team and the negative mood this created 
amongst fans and consumers. 
our buying team had followed the seedings and we were 
confident of at least a “last eight” outcome for england, 
so exiting the tournament before that meant in effect that 
we were one game short (although this was exacerbated 
by the disappointing performance in the four games). 
therefore, the negative impact of clearing the excess stock 
will offset some of the positive pre-tournament trade. 
nevertheless, current uK retail trading remains well 
ahead of the same period last year.

the directors believe that underlying eBitda, underlying 
profit before tax and underlying earnings per share 
provide the more useful information for shareholders 
on the underlying performance of the business than the 
reported numbers and are consistent with how business 
performance is measured internally. they are not 
recognised profit measures under iFrs and may not be 
directly comparable with “adjusted” profit measures used 
by other companies.
eBitda is earnings before investment income, finance 
income and finance costs, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation and, therefore, includes the Group’s share 
of profit of associated undertakings and joint ventures. 
underlying eBitda is calculated as eBitda before the 
impact of foreign exchange, and any exceptional and other 
non-trading items.

exceptional items, which decreased profit by £10.0m, 
realised exchange profit/loss and iFrs revaluation of 
foreign currency contracts, which decreased 2010 profits 
by £39.8m and increased profit by £37.7m respectively,

selling, distribution and 
administration costs 
selling, distribution and administration costs for the Group 
decreased as a percentage of revenue. this was as a result 
of cost and efficiency savings offsetting inflation.
 
the Group manages the impact of currency movements 
through the use of forward fixed rate currency purchase 
and sales contracts. the company’s policy has been to 
hold or hedge up to four years (with generally a minimum 
of one year) on anticipated purchases in foreign currency. 
the exchange loss of £39.8m (2009: £14.2m gain) included 
in administration costs have arisen from:
a) accepting dollars and euros at the contracted rate; and
b) the translation of dollars and euro denominated 
assets and liabilities at the period end rate or date of 
realisation.
the exchange gain of £37.7m (2009: £12.6m gain) included 
in finance income substantially represents the reduction 
in the mark-to-market provision made (under iFrs) for 
the forward contracts at 26 april 2009. a number of the 
forward contracts outstanding at 25 april 2010 qualify 
for hedge accounting and the fair value gain on these 
contracts of £10.9m has been credited to equity through 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
the Group has sufficient us dollar contracts to cover all 
purchases in uK retail for the 2011 financial year. these 
hedged contracts are at an average rate of 1.617. 
the sterling exchange rate with the us dollar was $1.471

We have previously reported that some of our strategic 
stakes were held by Kaupthing singer & Friedlander 
(KsF) and partly financed by them. on 8 october 2008, 
KsF went into administration and we were in dispute 
with the administrators concerning the ownership of the 
shares they held. in the 2009 financial statements we 
concluded that we may not directly “control” the shares 
for accounting purposes and, therefore, treated them as 
having been derecognised. 
on 21 February, the company entered into an agreement 
with the administrator of KsF to acquire any rights which 
may be determined they hold.
on 13 May, the judgement of the court proceedings which 
commenced on 26 april 2010 was handed down. the court 
determined that the Group acquired a beneficial interest in 
12,153,071 ordinary shares in Blacks leisure and 5,775,255 
ordinary shares in Jd sports on 8 october 2008. this 
acquisition is reflected in these financial statements. the 
judgement also meant that the Group regained control of 
the shares.
the administrator of KsF has now appealed the decision, 
but sports direct’s ownership of the shares is no longer in 
dispute. Were KsF to be successful in their appeal, then 
sports direct would be required to pay an amount of  
c. £14.7m, which is currently held in escrow and included 
in other debtors. this amount represents the difference 
in value of the shares between 8 october 2008 and 21 
February 2010.
the Group also has a claim submitted with the 
administration for the shares in amer sports, Blacks and 
Jd that were not in KsF’s possession and also for the 
dividends and Group funds held by KsF. this amounts to 
approximately £9.1m in total and the latest information 
from the administrator suggests a distribution of around 
70%. this amount is included in other debtors.
the respective shareholdings at 25 april 2010 and 26 
april 2009 (not reflecting the derecognition for accounting 
purposes) were as follows:
At 25 April 2010 26 april 2009 
shares ‘m Holding Shares ‘m Holding
Blacks leisure Group 12.153 28.50% 12.728 29.85%

Jd sports Fashion 5.775 11.97% 6.475 13.31%
JJB sports - - 11.944 4.76%
 
on 24 May 2010, Blacks leisure issued 39,281,011 new 
ordinary shares as part of a fundraising in which the Group 
did not participate. as a result, the Group’s interest in 
12.153m shares now represents 14.5% of Blacks’ share 
capital.

position as at the end of the Year are shown in the attached 
Financial statements, and discussed further in the chief 
executive’s report and Business review and in the 
Financial review on pages 6 to 24 and 26 to 34 respectively.
 
Business review and future 
developments
the statutory Business review required by the companies 
act 2006 (the 2006 act) is included in the chief executive’s 
report and Business review, and in the corporate 
responsibility report on pages 6 to 24 and 58 to 63 
respectively. a review of Group activities during the 
Year, together with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and conditions, is included in

6 to 24. the financial position of the Group, its cash flow, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the Financial review on page 34. the chief executive’s

reports on environmental matters, including the impact of 
the Group’s businesses on the environment, the Group’s

Going concern
as highlighted in note 22 to the Financial statements, the 
Group finances its day to day working capital requirements 
and has made investments and conducted a share  
buy-back programme in the past, using a facility with 
the Bank of scotland that is due for renewal in april 
2011. the current economic conditions however, create 
some uncertainty in the economy and particularly in 
respect of the exchange rate between sterling and the us 
dollar which impacts on the cost of the Group’s products 
manufactured in the Far east and the availability of bank 
finance in the foreseeable future.
results for the Year
section 3 // MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE //
directors’ report sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.39
the Group’s forecast and projections, taking account of 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance,  
show that the Group should be able to operate within 
the level of the current facility. the Group has opened 
negotiations with bankers and at this stage has not sought 
any written commitments. no matter has been drawn to 
its attention to suggest that a facility would not be made 
available to the Group on acceptable terms. indeed, the 
directors expect an adequate facility to be made available 
on acceptable terms. 
the directors have thoroughly reviewed the Group’s 
performance and position relating to historical results, 
current trading, forecast performance, cash reserves 
and financing arrangements. additionally, the directors 
have also considered the Group’s reliance upon its key 
stakeholders including customers and suppliers and 
found no over reliance on any particular stakeholder. 
the directors are therefore confident that the Group will 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. on this basis, the directors continue to adopt the 
going concern basis for the preparation of the financial 
statements.
 
appropriations
the Group has agreed not to recommend a final dividend 
this Year.
 
Group structure and operations
during the Year the Group acquired the remaining minority 
interest of antigua enterprises inc. the usa golf, sporting 
and leisure goods wholesaler and delisted it from the 
t oronto stock exchange. it also acquired a further 7% 
interest in Warrnambool, the parent company of the irish 
retail chain Heatons to take the company shareholding to 
50%.
 
share capital
the authorised share capital of the company is 
£100,000,000 divided into 999,500,010 ordinary shares of 
10p each and 499,990 redeemable preference shares of 
10p each. 
the ordinary shares have all the rights that usually attach 
to such ordinary shares, including the right to receive 
dividends (if paid or declared), to receive notice and attend 
and vote at meetings of shareholders and (subject to 
what is said concerning redeemable preference shares) 
to receive a share of the assets of the company on any 
winding up.
the redeemable preference shares do not carry any right 
to receive a dividend or to participate in any distribution of 
the profits or assets of the company, or to vote at meetings 
of shareholders, but holders of redeemable preference 
shares have the right to receive notice and attend meetings 
of shareholders and on any winding up of the company 
the redeemable preference shares are redeemed at par 
in priority to any distribution to the holders of ordinary 
shares. no redeemable preference shares are in issue.
there are no specific restrictions on the transfer of shares 
which are governed by the provisions of the articles of 
association and prevailing legislation.
during the Year the Group increased the issued share 
capital by 50,000, so that 640,502,369 ordinary shares of 
10p are in issue and fully paid of which 64,000,000 are 
currently held in t reasury. 
the directors are not aware of any agreements between 
holders of the company’s shares that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting 
rights.

out on page 51 to 53. no votes are cast in respect of the

equal opportunities details of directors, their roles, responsibilities, 
achievements and significant external commitments are 
set out on pages 36 and 37 and, in respect of directors 
standing for reappointment, in the annual General Meeting 
notice, which is sent to shareholders with this report. 
the appointment, retirement and reappointment of 
directors are governed by the company’s articles of 
association, the combined code, the companies act  
and related legislation. the articles may be amended  
by special resolution of the shareholders. the powers  
of directors are described in the Board’s t erms of 
reference and in the corporate Governance statement  
on pages 43 to 46.
the Board believes that each director standing for 
reappointment continues to demonstrate commitment, is 
an effective member of the Board, and contributes to the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience identified by 
the Board as being required. the Board is satisfied that 
the chairman is not precluded from devoting sufficient 
time to his duties to the company by reason of his other 
commitments. the Board recommends reappointment of 
the directors standing for reappointment.
information on service contracts and details of the 
interests of the directors and their families in the share 
capital of the company at 25 april 2010 and at the date of 
this report is shown in the directors’ remuneration report 
on pages 53 and 56 respectively. copies of the service 
contracts of executive directors and of the appointment 
letters of the chairman and non-executive directors are 
available for inspection at the company’s registered office 
during normal business hours and at the annual General 
Meeting.
no director has a directorship in common or other 
significant links with any other director (except in the case 
of executive directors holding directorships of subsidiary 
companies of the company). 
 
directors conflicts of interest
the Board has put in place procedures to deal with 
directors’ conflicts of interest. during the Year the Board 
reviewed and, where appropriate, approved certain 
situational conflicts of interest that were reported to it by 
directors, and a register of those situational conflicts is 
maintained and reviewed. also during the Year the Board 
noted any transactional conflicts of interest concerning 
directors that arose and were declared. no director took 
part in the discussion or determination of any matter in 
respect of which he had disclosed a transactional conflict 
of interest.
the company has entered into deeds of indemnity for 
the benefit of each director of the company and for the 
benefit of each person who was a director during the Year, 
in respect of liabilities to which they may become liable 
in their capacity as director of the company and of any 
company in the Group. these indemnities are qualifying 
third party indemnity provisions within the meaning given 
to that term by sections 234 and 235 of the 2006 act, and 
all these indemnities remain in force.

corporate Governance report
the Board of directors of the company is committed to 
maintaining high standards of corporate governance and 
to managing the affairs of the Group in accordance with 
the provisions of the listing rules and of the combined 
code on corporate Governance, issued by the Financial 
reporting council in June 2008 (the “combined code”).  
a copy of the combined code is available on the Financial 
reporting council’s website at www.frc.org.uk. the 
Board has reviewed the company’s corporate governance 
processes and policies, and has concluded that during the 
52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 (the “Year”) the company 
complied with the provisions of the combined code except 
as set out below. 
the combined code (code provision a3.2) recommends 
that at least half of the Board of directors of a uK listed 
company, excluding the chairman, should be comprised 
of non-executive directors determined by the Board to be 
independent in character and judgement and free from 
relationships or circumstances which may affect, or could 
appear to affect, the director’s judgment. prior to the 
appointment of the non-executive chairman, dr Hellawell, 
the company did not comply with this provision of the 
combined code. the Board is currently made up of the 
non-executive chairman, three executive directors and 
three independent non-executive directors. the company 
will continue to remain compliant until the retirement of 
Malcolm dalgleish at the a GM in september 2010.
the combined code also provides (code provisions 
B2.1 and c3.1) that each of the remuneration and audit 
committees of the Board should comprise of at least 
three independent non-executive directors. the code 
also provides that, in respect of the remuneration 
committee, the company chairman may also be a 
member, but not chair the committee if he or she was 
considered independent on appointment as chairman. 
until 23 november 2009 these committees comprised 
two independent non-executive directors and the acting 
chairman and as such did not comply with the code. 
From 24 november 2009 and the appointment of the 
non-executive chairman the acting chairman reverted to 
non-executive director and the company complied with 
the code.
the combined code provides (code provision a.4.1) that 
the majority of the members of the nomination committee 
should be independent non-executive directors. until 
23 november 2009 the committee comprised the acting 
chairman and two non-executive directors and did not 
comply with the code. the committee is now compliant 
with the provisions of the code due to the appointment of 
the non-executive chairman. 
 
the company has in the past used recruitment consultants 
to search for a chairman and for additional independent 
non-executive directors and the nomination committee 
has approved job descriptions for those roles.
during the Year the company appointed dr Keith Hellawell 
as non-executive chairman. a search for a new chairman 
through recruitment consultants had previously been 
unsuccessful. upon the recommendation of an institutional 
shareholder, dr Hellawell was interviewed and appointed 
to the Board.
Following the departure of Malcolm dalgleish at the 2010 
annual General Meeting, the company will continue 
to seek his replacement based on the job description 
approved by the remuneration committee.
the Board currently believes, however, that the Board and 
its committees as currently constituted are working well, 
and that in a period of challenging economic conditions it 
may be difficult to recruit an appropriate person to be an 
independent non-executive director of the company. the 
nomination committee and the Board will, continue to 
actively look to fill this appointment.
 
the Board
during the Year the Board comprised a non-executive 
chairman, three executive directors, and three non-
executive directors. the names and short biographies of 
the non-executive chairman and other directors are set 
out on pages 36 and 37.
the non-executive chairman, Keith Hellawell and the 
non-executive directors are considered by the Board to 
be independent. the Board considers that an independent 
director is one who is independent in character and 
judgment, and where there are no circumstances that 
are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, his or her 
judgement. relationships or circumstances that could 
affect judgement include having been an employee of 
the company or of any Group company during the past 
five years, having had a material business relationship 
or having been a partner, shareholder, director or senior 
employee of a body with a material business relationship 
with the company or any Group company in the past three 
years, receiving remuneration from the company other 
than directors’ fees, participating in any share option or 
bonus schemes or in a company pension scheme, having 
had close family ties with any of the company’s advisors, 
directors or senior employees, having cross directorships 
or significant links with any other director, representing a 
significant shareholder, or serving on the Board for more 
than nine years.
corporate Governance simon Bentley resumed his position as senior independent 
non-executive director and is available to shareholders 
if they have concerns which have failed to be resolved 
through the normal channels of chairman, executive 
deputy chairman, chief executive, or Group Finance 
director, or for which such channels are inappropriate. 
the company has entered into a relationship agreement 
with Mike ashley, the executive deputy chairman, whose 
wholly owned company, MasH Holdings ltd currently 
holds approximately 71.2% of the issued share capital of 
the company (excluding treasury shares), this agreement 
is described in the directors’ report on page 40. 
Given the structure of the Board and the terms of the 
relationship agreement, the Board believes that no 
individual or small group of individuals can dominate the 
Board’s decision making. 
the Board has established a nomination committee to 
ensure a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure 
for the appointment of new directors to the Board. the 
composition of that committee and a description of its 
terms of reference are set out on page 48.
details of executive directors’ service contracts and of the 
chairman’s and the non-executive directors’ appointment 
letters are given on page 53. copies of service contracts 
and of appointment letters are available for inspection at 
the company’s registered office during normal business 
hours and at the annual General Meeting.
executive directors normally retire on reaching the 
age determined by the Board from time to time as the 
retirement age for executive directors.
non-executive directors are appointed for an initial 
term of three years from the annual General Meeting 
following their joining of the Board, and, subject to 
performance, there is an expectation of reappointment 
for a further period of three years. exceptionally a non-
executive director may be invited to serve for a further 
and final three year term. non-executive directors’ fees 
are determined by the Board in the absence of the non-
executive directors other than the chairman. 
all directors appointed by the Board are appointed after 
consideration of the recommendations of the nomination 
committee, and those so appointed must stand for 
reappointment at the following annual General Meeting. 
every director must retire at least once every three 
years, and in addition at least one third of the continuing 
members of the Board must retire by rotation each year. 
retiring directors may seek reappointment if willing and 
eligible to do so and if so recommended by the nomination 
committee. the chairman will, when proposing the 
reappointment of a director, confirm that following formal 
performance evaluation, the director’s performance 
continues to be effective and he or she continues to 
demonstrate commitment to the role.
Malcolm dalgleish will retire at this year’s a GM and will 
not put himself forward for re-election. Having been 
appointed since the last annual General Meeting, Keith 
Hellawell will retire from the Board and being eligible 
will offer himself for election. Mike ashley will retire by 
rotation, and being eligible will seek reappointment. 
the Board has adopted a formal process for the 
performance evaluation of the Board, its committees 
and individual directors. every year each director has an 
opportunity to express his or her views on the organisation 
and operation of the Board and its committees, their 
effectiveness and contribution to the business, and on 
any other matter they consider relevant. these views are 
expressed in response to a questionnaire prepared and 
circulated by the secretary, who holds the comments of 
individual directors in confidence. the results of these 
questionnaires are consolidated and reported to the 
chairman and, in so far as they relate to the chairman, to 
the senior independent non-executive director, and, in so 
far as they relate to the Board as a whole or to any of its 
committees to the Board as a whole. the chairman has 
begun a process of evaluation which he will complete in 
the next financial year.
Given the current small size of the Board, the Board 
does not consider the use of independent consultants 
appropriate or useful. 
in addition the chairman will meet with individual 
directors privately at least once in every year, to review 
the contribution of that director to the Board and his or 
her development needs. the chairman has completed his 
evaluation for the 09/10 financial year. the chairman will 
meet with the non-executive directors as a group and 
in the absence of any executive directors at least twice a 
year, and as part of the Board evaluation programme the 
non-executive directors, led by the senior independent 
non-executive director, will review the performance 
of the chairman, having taken account of the views of 
the executive directors. the senior independent non-
executive director will undertake his first review of the 
chairman in the coming year.
the Board (continued)
section 3 // MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE //
corporate Governance report
continued sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.45
the Board and the nomination committee will consider 
the output from the evaluation programme in their 
evaluation of the skills, knowledge and experience of the 
Board, and in formulating development plans.
the Board provides corporate governance training for 
those directors appointed to the Board for whom it is 
their first appointment to a listed company board, and 
provides a tailored induction programme for all directors 
on appointment. in addition the Board is made aware 
of material changes to laws and regulations affecting 
the Group’s business from time to time. all directors 
have access to the advice and services of the company 
secretary, and each director and each Board committee 
may take independent professional advice at the 
company’s expense, subject to prior notification to the 
other non-executive directors and the company secretary. 
the company maintains appropriate directors and officers 
insurance.
the division of responsibilities between the non-executive 
chairman, the executive deputy chairman and the chief 
executive is in writing and has been agreed by the Board. 
the chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, 
for ensuring its effectiveness, and for ensuring that all 
directors are able to play a full part in the activities of 
the company. He ensures effective communication with 
shareholders, and that the Board has an understanding of 
the views of major investors. the chairman is available to 
provide advice and support to members of the executive 
team. the executive deputy chairman is an ambassador 
for the company, and takes the lead in the strategic 
development of the company, formulating the vision and 
strategy in conjunction with the chief executive. the chief 
executive is responsible for leading the management team, 
the running of the Group’s business, for the delivery of 
the strategy approved by the Board, and for implementing 
specific decisions made by the Board. no one individual 
has unfettered power of decision.
the Board currently plans to meet on a formal pre-planned 
basis six times during each year with up to four additional 
strategy meetings at convenient time throughout the year 
when broader issues concerning the strategic future of the 
company will be discussed. the Board will meet on other 
occasions as and when the business demands. during the 
Year the Board met on nine occasions. 
the Board is collectively responsible for the success of the 
company, and has a programme to enable it to discharge 
its responsibility of providing effective and entrepreneurial 
leadership to the company within a framework of prudent 
and effective controls. an agenda is established for each 
meeting, and appropriate documentation is provided to 
directors in advance of them. 
For regular meetings the agenda will include reports 
from the chief executive and the Group Finance director, 
reports on the performance of the business and current 
trading, reports on meetings with investors, reports 
from committees of the Board and specific proposals 
where the approval of the Board is sought. presentations 
are also given on business or strategic issues where 
appropriate, and the Board will consider at least annually 
the strategy for the Group. Minutes of the meetings of 
committees of the Board are circulated to all members of 
the Board, unless a conflict of interest arises, to enable all 
directors to have oversight of those matters delegated to 
committees, and copies of analysts’ reports and brokers’ 
notes are provided to directors. 
attendance by directors at Board and committee meetings 
during the Year and the total number of meetings that 
they could have attended are set out in the table below. 
all directors attended all meetings of the Board and of 
committees of the Board of which they were members 
unless prevented from doing so by prior commitments.

the Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for 
decision by it. Matters so reserved include the approval 
of the strategic plan and long-term objectives of the 
Group, the annual budget and the allocation of resources 
to achieve that budget, decisions relating to unbudgeted 
expenditure over certain limits, significant acquisitions, 
disposals and joint ventures, other material contracts, 
changes to the corporate structure of the Group, the 
appointment and removal of the company secretary, 
approval of accounting policies and practices and approval 
of the annual report. the Board delegates management of 
the businesses of the Group to the executive management, 
and delegates specific responsibilities to Board 
committees.  the Board believes that the appointment of executive 
directors to be non-executive directors of other listed 
companies benefits the Group, through the additional 
experience and knowledge gained by such an appointment, 
and accordingly, executive directors are permitted to 
accept one such appointment where no conflict of interest 
arises, and to retain the fees received. currently none of 
the executive directors holds such an appointment.
all non-executive directors disclose to the Board prior to 
appointment their significant other commitments and they 
are required to notify and have notified any changes to or 
additional commitments from time to time. simon Bentley 
is chairman of Global Brands sn, Maypole Group plc and 
deputy chairman of the leadership t rust. He is also a 
director of Brasher leisure and chairman of cash on the 
Move. dr Hellawell is currently non-executive director 
of Mortice plc, a singapore based facilities management 
company. the Board is satisfied that dr Hellawell and 
simon Bentley meet their obligations to the company. all 
non-executive directors are available to meet with major 
investors. 
 
Board committees
there are three principal Board committees, all of which 
have written terms of reference. summaries of the terms 
of reference and details of the membership of committees 
are set out below. copies of the terms of reference 
are available from the company secretary and on the 
company’s website. only members of each committee are 
entitled to attend the meetings of committees, although 
each committee may invite other directors, managers 
and advisors to attend and have done so. Membership of 
Board committees will be regularly reviewed. Given the 
current size of the Board, and the terms of reference, all 
non-executive directors are members of every Board 
committee. 
it is, however, the Board’s intention that, when the number 
of independent non-executive directors appointed to the 
Board permits, the chairman of the remuneration 
committee will not serve on the audit committee, and vice 
versa. the Board is satisfied that currently no one director 
exercises a disproportionate influence.
attendance at meetings of committees is set out on the 
previous page.
 
directors who served on the committee during the Year 
were:
simon Bentley (chairman) 
Malcolm dalgleish  
Keith Hellawell 
dave singleton 
the chairman of the committee is a chartered accountant, 
and has recent and relevant financial experience.
the committee met on four occasions during the Year.
the committee’s programme is pre-planned to ensure that 
each aspect of its responsibilities is discharged as part of 
an annual cycle during the company’s financial year. the 
main responsibilities of the audit committee are:
• assisting the Board with the discharge of its 
responsibilities in relation to internal and external audits 
and controls.
• Monitoring the financial reporting process and the 
integrity and clarity of the Group’s financial statements, 
including making recommendations on judgments they 
contain and the financial reporting process.
• agreeing the scope of the annual audit and the annual 
audit plan and monitoring the same. 
• reviewing and monitoring the independence of the 
external auditors and relationships with them and in 
particular agreeing and monitoring the extent of the 
non-audit work that may be undertaken by external 
auditors.
• advising on the appointment, reappointment and 
removal of external auditors.
• reviewing accounting and financial reporting policies, 
terms of engagement and remuneration of the external 
auditors, and any changes thereto and the method of 
accounting for unusual transactions.
reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of the internal 
control and risk management policies and systems in 
place within the Group and ensuring that appropriate 
arrangements are in place under which employees 
can raise concerns about possible financial or other 
impropriety which are then appropriately investigated.
during the Year the committee considered the matters 
that fell within its area of responsibility above and in 
particular the arrangements for monitoring the 
effectiveness of internal controls, and also considered  
the current economic climate and its likely impact on  
the Group.
the Board (continued)
section 3 // MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE //
corporate Governance report
continued
audit committee sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.47
the audit committee will normally meet not less than 
three times a year.
the external auditors attend meetings of the committee, 
other than when their appointment is being reviewed. the 
Group Finance director also attends as appropriate. the 
committee will meet with the auditors in the absence of 
executive management at least twice a year.
the audit committee considers annually the 
reappointment of the auditors and their remuneration, and 
makes recommendations to the Board, and the auditors 
are reappointed each year at the annual General Meeting. 
the committee will consider the level of service provided 
by the auditors and their independence annually.
the committee has approved a policy on the engagement 
of the external auditors for non-audit work, in order to 
ensure that the objectivity of the auditor’s opinion on the 
Group’s financial statements is not or may not be seen 
to be impaired, and has established a process to monitor 
compliance with that policy.
the policy identified three categories of potential work. 
Firstly, those tasks that the auditors may not provide, as 
to do so would represent a real threat to independence. 
that work includes the preparation of accounting 
entries or financial statements, it systems design and 
implementation, management of projects and tax planning 
where the outcome would have a material impact on the 
financial statements or where the outcome is dependent 
upon accounting treatment.
secondly, types of work that the auditors may undertake 
with the consent of the chairman of the audit committee. 
included in this category are certain corporate finance 
services, acquisition due diligence, management 
consultancy and secondment of staff other than for the 
preparation of accounting entries or financial statements.
thirdly, there are services that the auditors may provide as 
the work is clearly audit related and there is no potential 
threat to independence, including regulatory reporting and 
acting as reporting accountants. the company is satisfied 
that its policy falls within the requirements of the auditing 
practices Board.
every engagement of the auditors for non-audit work is to 
be reported to the next meeting of the committee.
the combined code recommends that the audit 
committee is made up of at least three non-executive 
directors, independent in character and judgement and 
free from any relationship or circumstance which may, 
could or would be likely to, or appear to, affect their 
judgement. 
the audit committee currently consists of three 
independent non-executive directors and the  
non-executive chairman. upon the resignation of  
Malcolm dalgleish the company intends to appoint  
another independent non-executive director to the Board. 
 
remuneration committee
directors who served on the committee during the Year 
were:
dave singleton (chairman) 
simon Bentley  
Malcolm dalgleish  
Keith Hellawell 
the main responsibilities of the remuneration committee 
are to:
• determine the company’s policy on executive 
remuneration, including the design of bonus schemes, 
and targets and payments made thereunder.
• determine the levels of remuneration for the chairman 
and each of the executive directors.
• Monitor the remuneration of senior management and 
make recommendations in respect of thereof.
• agree any compensation for loss of office of any 
executive director.
• the committee met on five occasions during the Year.
during the Year the committee reviewed directors and 
senior manager’s remuneration arrangements, and 
considered bonus schemes, in particular the Bonus share 
scheme and the proposed executive Bonus share scheme, 
approval of which will be sought at the annual General 
Meeting of the company in september. 
the committee considered directors’ salaries and 
determined not to increase them. the committee decided 
whether any payments were due to executive directors 
under the 2007-08 annual Bonus scheme, and decided 
not to operate an annual Bonus scheme for executive 
directors for 2010-11 due to the participation in the Bonus 
share scheme. 
the committee also reviewed the p erformance share plan 
and resolved to terminate it upon approval of the executive 
Bonus share scheme.  a report on the remuneration of directors appears on 
pages 50 to 56. the combined code recommends that 
the remuneration committee is made up of at least three 
non-executive directors, independent in character and 
judgement and free from any relationship or circumstance 
which may, could or would be likely to, or appear to, 
affect their judgement. the committee currently consists 
of three independent non-executive directors and the 
chairman and complies with the recommendations set out 
in the combined code. 
upon the resignation of Malcolm dalgleish the company 
intends to appoint an additional independent  
non-executive director to the Board who will also be 
appointed a member of the remuneration committee.
 
nomination committee
Members of the nomination committee during the Year 
were: 
Keith Hellawell (chairman) 
simon Bentley 
Malcolm dalgleish  
dave singleton 
the committee met on three occasions during the Year. 
the main responsibilities of the nomination committee 
are to:
• review the Board’s structure.
• review the composition and make up of the Board, 
including evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience of the members of the Board.
• Give consideration to succession planning for directors.
• prepare a description of the role and capabilities 
required for any Board appointment.
• Make recommendations to the Board concerning the 
standing for reappointment of directors.
• identify potential candidates to be appointed as 
directors, and make recommendations to the Board as 
the need may arise.
the nomination committee also determines succession 
plans for the chairman and the chief executive, who will 
not be present at meetings when such matters are being 
discussed.
the nomination committee will meet at least once a year 
and will also meet when appropriate.
during the Year the committee considered the 
appointment of the non-executive chairman and a further 
non-executive director or directors, and also considered 
the standing for reappointment of directors retiring by 
rotation.
dave Forsey, as chief executive, will normally attend 
meetings of the nomination committee, save where the 
nomination committee is dealing with matters relating to 
him or with the appointment of his successor.
the combined code recommends that a majority of the 
nomination committee be non-executive directors, 
independent in character and judgement and free from any 
relationship or circumstance which may, could or would be 
likely to, or appear to, affect their judgement. 
upon the retirement of Malcolm dalgleish the company 
intends to appoint an additional independent  
non-executive director to the Board who will also be 
appointed a member of the nomination committee.
 
share dealing code
the company has a code of securities dealings in relation 
to its shares and other securities which is based on, and 
is at least as rigorous as, the Model code as published in 
the listing rules. the code applies to the directors and to 
other appropriate employees of the Group.
 
internal controls and risk 
management
the directors have overall responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control and risk management and for 
reviewing their effectiveness. the systems of internal 
control and risk management are designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failing to achieve 
business objectives. 
such a system can, however, provide only reasonable, and 
not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or 
loss.
Members of the Board have responsibility for monitoring 
the conduct and operations of individual businesses 
within the Group. this includes the review and approval of 
business strategies and plans, the setting of key business 
performance targets and the analysis of risk.

section 3 // MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE //
corporate Governance report
continued sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.49
the executive management responsible for each business 
is accountable for the conduct and performance of their 
business within agreed strategies.
Business plans and budgets for each business include 
financial and strategic targets against which performance 
is monitored. Monitoring includes the examination of 
and changes to rolling annual and quarterly forecasts, 
monthly measurement of actual achievement against key 
performance targets and plans, and weekly reviews of 
performance.
the Group has clear procedures for the approval and 
control of expenditure. strategic investment decisions 
involving both capital and revenue expenditure are subject 
to formal detailed appraisal and review according to 
approval levels set by the Board. operating expenditure 
is controlled within each business with approval levels 
for such expenditure being determined by the individual 
businesses.
the Group has a formal whistle blowing policy for 
employees who wish to raise any issues or concerns 
relating to the company’s or Group’s activities on a 
confidential basis.
executive management is responsible for the identification, 
evaluation and management of the significant risks 
applicable to their areas of business and for the 
development of a disaster mitigation and recovery 
programme.
the Group operates a retail support unit which provides 
strong operational internal audit services in the retail 
division, and there are procedures in place in the Brands 
division to monitor and control licensees.
the audit committee assists the Board in fulfilling its 
oversight responsibilities, reviewing the reporting of 
financial and non-financial information to shareholders 
and the audit process, satisfying itself that appropriate 
systems of internal control and risk management are in 
place and are serving to identify and manage risk. 
the auditors attend all meetings of the audit committee, 
save for those parts of any meeting when the committee 
reviews the performance of the auditors and when the 
committee is having separate discussions with the Group 
Finance director.
With the exception of Heatons, the Group’s only material 
associate, the Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management and its effectiveness is monitored 
and reviewed by the Board, the audit committee and 
management, and the Board believes that the Group has 
maintained throughout the Year and up to the date of 
approval of the annual report and accounts an effective 
embedded system of internal control and has complied 
with the t urnbull guidance.
 
social, environmental and ethical 
matters
the Group has for many years, recognised the benefits that 
accrue from responsible employment, environmental and 
community policies. details of the Group’s activities in this 
area are set out in the corporate responsibility report on 
pages 58 to 63. this report has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of regulation ii and schedule 8 of the large 
and Medium-sized companies and Groups (accounts 
and reports) regulations 2008 (the regulations) and of 
the combined code on corporate Governance 2008 (“the 
combined code”). 
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
the remuneration committee
during the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 (the Year), 
the members of the remuneration committee (the 
committee), were: 
dave singleton (chairman) 
simon Bentley  
Malcolm dalgleish  
Keith Hellawell
simon Bentley, dave singleton and Malcolm dalgleish are 
independent non-executive directors, Keith Hellawell is 
non-executive chairman. 
the main responsibilities of the committee are 
summarised in the corporate Governance report on  
pages 47 and 48.
 
advisers
the committee has sought the advice and services of 
Freshfields llp when drafting the 2009 Bonus share 
scheme in which the executives currently participate 
and charles russell llp and deloittes in relation to the 
proposed new executive Bonus share scheme.
dave Forsey, the chief executive, Bob Mellors, the Group 
Finance director, and Mike ashley, the executive deputy 
chairman, have also advised or materially assisted the 
committee when requested.
 
remuneration policy
the committee has endorsed the provisions of section 1B 
of the combined code, and has had those provisions in 
mind when determining remuneration policies for the past, 
current and future years. policies and practice in respect 
of remuneration inevitably evolve over time and, while it is 
currently believed that the policies described in this report 
will apply in future years, they will be subject to regular 
review. 
the Group operates in a highly competitive retail 
environment, and the committee seeks to ensure that 
the level and form of remuneration is sufficient to attract, 
retain and motivate directors and senior managers of the 
quality and talent required to run the Group successfully. 
in order to maintain the Group’s historic focus on growth, 
the committee has adopted a strongly performance based 
remuneration policy for executive directors, under which 
a large proportion of their remuneration will be dependent 
upon the Group’s performance, and be paid in shares. 
accordingly, for executive directors other than Mike 
ashley, basic salaries have been set at a level below the 
lower quartile for a business of the size and complexity 
of the Group. during the Year the performance related 
elements of the remuneration packages consisted of 
participation in the Bonus share scheme and p erformance 
share plan. 
executive directors do not participate in a company 
pension arrangement in respect of which the company 
makes a financial contribution, and do not have the use of 
a company car or other similar benefits often available to 
executive directors.
the committee has reviewed the current incentive 
arrangements and in support of the above policy is 
recommending the establishment of a new executive 
Bonus share scheme. the executive Bonus share scheme 
has been designed to incentivise and reward executive 
directors in a way that is consistent with the Group’s 
strategy of earnings growth and long term shareholder 
value. 
Full details of the proposed new executive Bonus share 
scheme are contained in the circular to shareholders 
accompanying this report and shareholders will be invited 
to approve the new executive share Bonus scheme at the 
forthcoming annual General Meeting. 
if the establishment of the executive Bonus share scheme 
is approved then it will replace the performance share 
plan and Bonus share scheme. in addition, a condition 
of participation in the proposed executive Bonus share 
scheme will be that the Bonus share scheme awards 
for executive directors for 2009-10 and 2010-11 will 
not be made; and all subsisting awards held under the 
performance share plan by the executive directors will 
lapse. 
if the committee were to change its policy on basic 
salaries and bonus strategy, then the committee’s 
remuneration policy as set out above will not necessarily 
apply to any new appointment to the Board, or the existing 
Board going forward.
section 3 // MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE //
directors’ remuneration report sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.51
Mike ashley has agreed that he will not receive a salary 
for his role as executive deputy chairman, nor does 
he participate in the Bonus share scheme, and he will 
not participate in the executive Bonus share scheme if 
approved.
the committee intends to establish and thereafter 
maintain contact with major shareholders and 
representative groups where appropriate concerning 
remuneration matters.
the committee is at all times mindful of the company’s 
social, ethical and environmental responsibilities, and is 
satisfied that current remuneration arrangements do not 
inadvertently encourage irresponsible behaviour.
the committee has reviewed the salaries, other 
remuneration and other employment conditions of senior 
and middle managers throughout the Group, and has taken 
them into account in considering directors salaries and 
the creation of new incentive schemes in order to create 
a sense of common purpose and sharing of success. the 
proposed executive Bonus share scheme targets mirror 
that of the Bonus share scheme which applies to all 
uK permanent employees of the Group in the uK retail, 
Brands and Head office on the same basis, including 
applying the same performance conditions, irrespective of 
seniority. 
the committee’s remuneration policy in respect of the 
non-executive directors is to pay annual fees which reflect 
the responsibilities and duties placed upon them, whilst 
also having regard to market practice.
 
Basic salary
Basic salaries are reviewed annually. there was no 
increase in executive directors’ salaries in the review in 
2009 and in april 2010 the committee decided again not 
to alter executive directors’ salaries. executive directors’ 
salaries have now been at the same level since 2002.
 
annual Bonus scheme
the committee has determined that no annual Bonus 
scheme will be operated for executive directors while the 
Bonus share scheme or proposed new executive Bonus 
share scheme is being operated. 
Mike ashley did not participate in the annual Bonus 
scheme for the Year, and will not participate in the Bonus 
share scheme or proposed new executive Bonus share 
scheme.
 
Bonus share scheme
the Bonus share scheme was approved at the company’s 
annual General Meeting in september 2009 to motivate 
and help improve the retention of employees, to encourage 
employee participation in the shares of the company, to 
align the interests of employees and shareholders, and to 
drive underlying eBitda in line with company strategy. 
all permanent uK employees in uK retail, Brands and 
Head office with not less than one year of service at the 
beginning 2009-10 participated, irrespective of seniority. 
the bonus was structured in two stages. the first bonus is 
25% of base pay in shares at a notional share price of £1.00 
per share. the bonus target for 2009-10 was underlying 
eBitda of £155m (net of the cost of the scheme) and will 
vest after two years subject to continuous employment 
until then. 
the second bonus is 75% of base pay in shares at a 
notional share price of £1.25 per share. the second stage 
of the bonus is conditional upon the first bonus target 
being met in 2009-10, and the second bonus targets are: 
• underlying eBitda of £195m (net of the cost of the 
scheme) in 2010-2011, and
• underlying eBitda/net debt ratio of 2 or less at the end 
of 2010-11
the second bonus will vest, subject to continuous 
employment until then, 2 years after the second bonus 
target is met. 
the committee will adjust reported underlying Group 
eBitda each year during which the scheme is running 
for the purpose of the scheme to ensure consistency in 
the calculation of underlying eBitda and to ensure that 
underlying eBitda is a fair comparison year by year, for 
example, by eliminating the impact of acquisitions where 
the cost of acquisitions is not reflected in underlying 
eBitda.
underlying eBitda is as defined on page 26 and is not at 
constant foreign currency exchange rates. as outlined previously, the committee has determined 
that, if the proposed executive Bonus share scheme 
is approved at the company’s annual General Meeting 
in september 2010 and implemented with effect from 
the beginning of the current financial year, then this 
will replace the Bonus share scheme for the executive 
directors. in this case, the Bonus share scheme awards 
for executive directors for 2009-10 and 2010-11 will not be 
made.
 
the p erformance share plan
the p erformance share plan was adopted at the time of 
the admission of the company to the official list and to 
trading on the london stock exchange in 2007. 
the maximum number of shares that an executive director 
may acquire pursuant to share awards granted to him 
in any financial year may not have an aggregate market 
value, as measured at the date of grant, exceeding 400% of 
his annual basic salary. 
there are currently three grants of awards in respect of 
the periods 2007 to 2010, 2008 to 2011 and 2009 to 2012 
under the performance share plan. the vesting of 50% of 
the awards is subject to a performance target based on the 
earnings per share (“eps”) growth of the company over a 
three year performance period. the remaining 50% of the 
awards are subject to a performance target based on the 
company’s total shareholder return (“tsr”) over the same 
performance period when compared against a group of 
comparator companies. 
the number of shares that will vest under the eps tranche 
of each award will be determined as follows:
EpS Growth
percentage of 
shares in EpS 
tranche that vest
Below 19% per annum 0
19% per annum 
(“threshold”)
25
24% per annum (“t arget”) 50
29% per annum (“stretch”) 100
 
shares comprised in the eps tranche will vest on a 
straight-line basis for performance between threshold and 
t arget and between t arget and stretch.
the percentage of the shares comprised in the tsr 
tranche that vest will be determined by reference to the 
company’s tsr ranking within the comparator group at 
the end of the performance period as follows:
TSR Ranking
percentage of 
shares in TSR 
tranche that vest
upper quartile 100
Median 25
Below median 0
 
shares comprised in the tsr tranche will vest on a 
straight-line basis for performance between median and 
upper quartile.
the initial comparator group comprised the following 
companies
• Marks & spencer plc
• Kingfisher plc
• next Group plc
• Home retail Group plc
• dsG international plc
• the carphone Warehouse Group plc
• signet Group plc
• Kesa electrical plc
• debenhams plc
• n Brown Group plc
• Galiform plc
• carpetright plc
• Halfords Group plc
• W H smith plc
• JJB sports plc
• HMV Group plc
• Jd sports Fashion plc
• Blacks leisure Group plc
• Mothercare plc
 
Mothercare plc has replaced umbro plc in the comparator 
group following its acquisition by nike and subsequent 
delisting. 
subject to satisfaction of applicable performance 
conditions and continued employment, awards will vest 
at the end of the performance period and vested share 
awards will be released to participants automatically as 
soon as practicable after the date the shares vest.
Bonus share scheme (continued)
section 3 // MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE //
directors’ remuneration report
continued sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.53
the committee determined that, upon the vesting of 
any award, a participant will receive additional shares 
representing the gross value of dividends as if they had 
been paid on those shares and reinvested during the 
performance period.
in the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement (other 
than a scheme to create a new holding company for the 
company having substantially the same shareholders as 
the company) or voluntary winding-up of the company, 
share awards will vest following such an event to the 
extent the performance conditions have been met but 
on a time pro-rated basis. share awards may also by 
agreement, be exchanged for equivalent share awards or 
options over shares in the acquiring company.
as outlined previously, the committee has determined 
that, if the proposed executive Bonus share scheme is 
approved at the company’s annual General Meeting in 
september 2010 and implemented with effect from the 
beginning of the current financial year, then this will 
replace the performance share plan. in this case, all 
subsisting awards held under the performance share plan 
by the executive directors will lapse.
 
pension 
executive directors are entitled to participate in a 
stakeholder pension scheme under which the company 
makes no contribution. 
 
share ownership policy 
the committee believes it to be important that executive 
directors have a significant holding in the capital of the 
company. 
the executive directors’ currently each own 1 million 
shares in the company. in order to participate in the 
proposed executive share Bonus plan, the executive 
directors will be required to maintain a level of 
shareholding in the company equivalent to one year’s 
salary while they remain employed by the company.
 
contracts of service
on 11 February 2007, each executive director entered 
into a new service agreement with the company. the 
agreements became effective on admission. 
these contracts reflect the committee’s policy on the 
duration of executive directors service contracts and on 
notice periods and termination payments.
each executive director’s employment is terminable by 
either party on 12 months’ written notice. the company 
may elect to terminate the employment of dave Forsey 
and/or Bob Mellors by making a payment in lieu of notice 
equal to the basic salary that the director would have 
received during the notice period or, if notice has already 
been given, during the remainder thereof.
the company may elect to pay any payment in lieu of 
notice by monthly instalments during the outstanding 
notice periods, and if the director obtains alternative 
employment or provides services pursuant to a 
consultancy agreement while such payments are being 
made (the director being obliged to use his best efforts 
to obtain such employment), each instalment falling due 
after the commencement of such employment or provision 
of services is reduced by one twelfth of the annual 
remuneration or fees received by the director in respect of 
that alternative employment or consultancy. 
any entitlement to benefits under any share related 
incentive scheme are determined in accordance with the 
rules of that scheme.
each executive director’s service contract automatically 
terminates on the date that the director reaches such age 
as is determined by the Board from time to time as the 
retirement age for executive directors.
the non-executive directors have each entered into a 
letter of appointment with the company, which became 
effective in the case of simon Bentley, on admission, and 
in the case of Malcolm dalgleish, dave singleton and 
Keith Hellawell on execution. details of the letters of 
appointment are set out below:

simon Bentley received an annual fee of £144,000 as 
acting chairman. as from 24/11/2009 receives £50,000 as 
a non-executive director.  non-executive directors do not and are not entitled to 
participate in any bonus or share scheme. 
each non-executive director’s appointment (other than 
the chairman) is for an initial period that expires on 
the date of the company’s first annual General Meeting 
after appointment. the appointment of simon Bentley 
was renewed at the aGM on 9 september 2009 and will 
continue for a term of three years from then and then 
terminate unless renewed prior to the expiry of that term. 
Malcolm dalgleish, who is scheduled to retire at the next 
aGM has made it known that he does not intend to seek  
reappointment.
notwithstanding renewal for a three year term, the 
appointment of each of simon Bentley, Malcolm dalgleish 
and dave singleton may be terminated at any time by 
either party on one months’ written notice. 
each of the appointments of the non-executive directors 
may also be terminated in accordance with the articles of 
association of the company, and immediately in certain 
prescribed circumstances (including the bankruptcy of the 
non-executive director). 
non-executive directors are subject to confidentiality 
undertakings without limitation in time. non-executive 
directors are not entitled to receive any compensation on 
the termination of their appointment. 
 
non-executive directorships
the Board recognises that executive directors may be 
invited to become non-executive directors of other 
companies, and that the experience and knowledge 
gained as a result of such appointments are of benefit to 
the company. accordingly, the Board has agreed that the 
executive directors may accept one such appointment, 
and retain any fees payable in respect thereof, subject to 
there being no conflict of interest. no executive director 
currently holds any such appointment. 
 
the following graph, required by the regulations, 
shows the company’s total shareholder return since 
admission against that of the Ftse 250 index (excluding 
investment trusts). the committee considered this an 
appropriate index against which to compare the company’s 
performance as it is widely accepted as a national measure 
and includes the companies that investors are likely to 
consider alternative investments.

directors responsibilities
the directors are responsible for preparing the annual 
report and the company and Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year which give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the 
Group as at the end of the financial period and of the 
profits or loss of the Group for that period. under that law 
the directors are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with international Financial 
reporting standards as adopted by the european union 
(iFrss)
the directors have elected to prepare the company 
financial statements in accordance with united Kingdom 
Generally accepted accounting practices (uK G aap). 
in preparing each of the company and Group financial 
statements, the directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether 
applicable iFrss have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statement;
• for the company financial statements, state whether 
applicable uK accounting standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concerns 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
company and Group will continue in business.
the directors are responsible for keeping proper 
accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy 
the financial position of the company and the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the companies act 2006 and article 4 of 
the ias regulation. they have general responsibility for 
the system of internal control, taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
company and the Group and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities. 
under applicable law and regulations, the directors 
are also responsible for preparing a directors’ report, 
directors’ remuneration report and corporate 
Governance report that comply with that law and those 
regulations.
in so far as each of the directors are aware:
• there is no relevant audit information of which the 
company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the directors have taken all steps that they ought to have 
taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditors are aware 
of that information.
the directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the company’s website. legislation in the 
uK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
 
responsibility statement
t o the best of our knowledge:
(a) the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the company and of the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
and 
(b) the management report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.
 
on behalf of the Board
Dave Forsey   Bob Mellors 
chief executive  Group Finance director
22 July 2010
directors’ responsibilities
and responsibility statement the Board recognises the importance of balancing the 
interests of all its key stakeholders, including customers, 
employees, shareholders, suppliers and the communities 
in which it operates. a formal corporate responsibility 
policy was adopted last year and the Board is committed 
to applying and developing this policy at every level of the 
business.
last year we reported that the focus of our corporate 
responsibility activities were in five key areas, employees, 
Health and safety, customers, the environment and the 
community, and this remains the case. the Group has 
developed Key performance indicators (Kpis) in respect of 
these areas, which are further discussed in this report and 
in the chief executive’s report and Business review on 
page 8. these Kpis are based solely on our uK operations.
this report examines each key area in turn, reviewing the 
current situation, the facts, figures and our successes to 
date, and the opportunities for the present year and for the 
future.
 
employees
the Group currently employ 16,017 in the uK and 1,343 
elsewhere in the world. as the business continues to grow 
it is the skill and enthusiasm of these employees that are 
key to its success.
in the uK, 94% of our employees work in our stores and in 
store management. 5.9% of the uK workforce work at our 
shirebrook campus, of which 3.0% work in our national 
distribution centre, and 2.0% in the Group Head office, 
Finance, Buying, Brands, retail and it departments. of our 
uK Workforce 58% are male and 42% female.
employee retention is one of our key Kpis. this Year 17.0% 
of our uK employees left the business; the vast majority of 
them were from our stores. 
retention of employees is extremely important both 
in terms of retaining expertise, and as a measure of 
employee satisfaction. the Board receives a monthly 
report on the turnover of employees. 
the Group believes in rewarding employees with fair 
salaries together with the opportunity to earn additional 
pay in the form of bonuses. We monitor our rates of pay 
against national statistics on an annual basis. We believe 
that performance based rewards are beneficial to the 
business and foster greater employee involvement in it, 
and this policy starts at the Board and flows down to all 
levels of the business. 
the Bonus share scheme, described in the directors’ 
remuneration report on page 51, is intended to motivate 
further the Group’s uK permanent employees in uK retail, 
Brands and Head office, provide them with a direct and 
substantial link between Group performance and their 
remuneration, and encourage employee participation in 
the shares of the Group.
there is continuation of the staff Forum that was 
established in shirebrook, comprising elected 
representatives from across departments and 
representatives of management. the Forum meets 
monthly and discussions cover issues ranging from pay, 
holidays, hours, health and safety, working conditions, 
equipment needs and developments in and the 
performance of the business. the Forum encourages open 
discussion and a Board member will attend at least once a 
year. Minutes of the Forum’s meetings are posted on notice 
boards and representatives are encouraged to seek and 
reflect the views of their constituents.
the Group recognises the right of employees to 
membership of a trade union and has entered into an 
agreement with the trade union unite in respect of 
collective bargaining of pay, hours of work and holidays of 
certain groups of employees in the national distribution 
centre.
the Group is committed to the equal treatment of its 
employees and has formal policies in place that are 
reviewed on a regular basis. the equal opportunity and 
diversity policies ensure that employees are treated as 
individuals, fairly and with respect providing fair and 
equal opportunities to employees regardless of age, 
gender, ethnicity, social background, religion, disability or 
sexuality. 
every effort is made to provide disabled people with 
equal opportunities for work, training and promotion. 
applications for employment by disabled persons are given 
full and fair consideration for all vacancies in accordance 
with their particular aptitudes. Where an existing employee 
becomes disabled the business makes every effort to 
provide continued employment in the same or similar 
job or by offering retraining in order that the employee’s 
employment within the Group may continue.
We continually review and update all our policies and 
procedures. a new employee handbook that has been 
tailored for each department continues to be rolled out 
during 2010.
section 3 // MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE //
corporate responsibility report sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.59
the Group places great importance in the training and 
development of employees. We want them to be able to 
perform their duties to the best of their abilities while 
wanting to retain these skills within the business.
2010 will see the international t raining centre at 
shirebrook extended. the aim of the staff t raining and 
development department is to use the t raining centre 
to provide the best, state of the art facilities for our team 
to achieve their best. our goal is to give every employee 
the opportunity to be inspired, stimulated, motivated and 
empowered to do a better job.
comprehensive induction training for managers and area 
managers takes place at shirebrook covering health and 
safety, environmental awareness, customer service and 
the day to day running of a retail unit. during 2009, 172 
managers and assistant managers attended this training 
and the beginning of 2010 has seen 52 attendees.
each retail unit ensures that all its employees receive 
induction training. the Group’s training strategy is to 
train managers who are then tasked to ensure that all 
their employees receive training that is tailored to the 
circumstances of their own business unit. We monitor how 
well training is being filtered down into the workplace by 
undertaking surveys of our store employees. 
the management training programme that was introduced 
in 2008 has continued. the programme covers interview 
skills, communication, people skills and this year it has 
focused on employment law at work. during the Year 175 
employees attended the programme compared to 113 last 
year. 
the Group, as reported last year, has introduced refresher 
training as part of a rolling programme, to ensure that all 
employees reinforce their existing skills and update their 
knowledge and practices. 
the specialist training programme has continued during 
the year. areas covered by our specialist training are 
footwear, rackets, cricket and golf. since inception the 
footwear master class has seen 178 employees attend.
Brand training was launched in october 2009 it saw 410 
employees attend a one day product training session 
regarding nike merchandise over 13 separate days. again 
in March 2010, 365 employees attended training where 
particular focus was on the FiFa World cup. the training 
days allow our business partners to promote the features, 
advantages and benefits of their product to the public 
through our employees. 
all national distribution centre employees are given 
appropriate training upon joining the Group, on health and 
safety matters, communication and relevant aspects of 
employment law. english is not the first language of many 
of these employees, and the Group acknowledges that as 
it recruits from a diverse talent pool the needs of these 
employees must be addressed. accordingly, training often 
involves the use of interpreters, and training materials, 
policy documents and building signage are usually in 
multiple languages.
the Group promotes and fosters a culture of personal 
development for all. the Group’s policy is to always look for 
internal promotion before external recruitment.
 
Health and safety
the Group is committed to appropriate standards of 
health and safety performance. the Board has ultimate 
responsibility for Group health and safety performance, 
and receives updates on incidents from the Head of retail 
operations on these matters. 
there were no environmental prosecutions or work 
related fatalities in the business during 2009/10. during 
the Year 1,428 (2009: 1,397) accidents across the Group 
were reported to Head office, and of these 59 (2009:45) 
were reportable to the Health and safety executive. 94% 
of accidents were slips, trips and minor lacerations that 
occurred within the stores. the increase in accident figures 
has coincided with an increase in the store portfolio but 
the number of accidents per store has decreased by 5%. 
the continued emphasis on health and safety training 
within the business has improved awareness of reporting 
procedures and recording of incidents under health and 
safety legislation.
during the Year the stores have had an electronic reminder 
system introduced. this ensures that amongst other things 
Health and safety checks are carried out before the store 
can physically close at the end of the working day. this 
will, again, increase the profile of Health and safety while 
improving the recording of such checks and procedures.
t raining is undertaken in house by a team of qualified 
and experienced health and safety officers. Going forward 
the health and safety team will continue to train store 
employees and monitor health and safety standards, and 
the Group is committed to maintaining these standards. the Group aims to ensure that all its customers enjoy a 
quality customer service and that they are provided with 
products that are safe and fit for purpose. the business 
recognises that customers have diverse needs and works 
constantly towards meeting them.
Monitoring customer satisfaction and responding to 
correspondence is a continuous process. customer service 
teams collate management information on service levels 
and this is circulated to the Board on a monthly basis. all 
written complaints are recorded, including an analysis of 
the nature of the complaint so that trends can be assessed 
and appropriate action taken. this Year 5,020 complaints 
were logged with our customer service team, an increase 
of 4% on last year. last year we reported that we were 
implementing an online customer contact form, which 
was successfully rolled out during the Year. the online 
contact form reduces the time it takes for our customers 
to contact us and has increased the volume of contact from 
our customers. online communication reduces the amount 
of time it takes for us to respond to their queries thereby 
increasing our service levels, whilst reducing the print and 
postage costs for both the Group and customers.
the Group is constantly working on ways to improve 
customer service at all levels within the company from  
the retail stores, head office and through our website. 
 
environment
as a Group we are aware that our operations impact 
the environment in a number of ways and it is our 
responsibility to manage effectively the areas we have 
direct control over while attempting to influence the 
actions of other areas that are outside of our control. We 
seek to reduce the negative impact the Group has on the 
environment while working towards compliance with the 
Government’s carbon reduction commitment. Building 
upon investigations last year we have identified property, in 
particular energy usage in our stores, transport and waste 
management at both our shirebrook facility and in stores  
as areas, where we can make a difference. 
during the Year the Group was awarded the carbon 
t rust standard in recognition of progress made in the 
management of the carbon footprint of the Group.
as reported last year, the single most significant element 
of the carbon footprint of the Group is the usage of 
electricity. electricity usage contributes to approx 85% of 
the footprint. 
during the Year the Group has made positive steps to 
ensure that the good results achieved in the previous year 
were built upon and the monitoring of the stores energy 
performance was bought in house, to allow a greater level 
of management focus. 
‘smart meters’ have been rolled out to almost all smaller 
stores during the Year which has increased the number of 
stores being constantly and remotely monitored from 188 
to 358. 
investments have been made in the majority of the least 
efficient stores to bring their performance up to the 
expected standard. this has contributed to a pro rata 
saving across the largest 189 stores of 8.7%. this saved 
the equivalent of 3,607 t onnes co
2
.
When compared with the base year of FY08 the total 
reduction in energy usage across the largest 189 stores is 
15.6%. 
 
Improvements in Energy Efficiency (largest 189 stores)
 
 
 
 
the emphasis continues to be on good housekeeping, 
supported with targeted investment to ensure that high 
standards are maintained. energy consumption reduction 
continues to be a key performance measurement.

the second biggest contributor to our co

 emission is the 
fleet of vehicles that service the stores. t ransport fuel 
accounts for approximately 14% of the carbon footprint. 
We continue to drive down our emissions in this area by 
adjusting the frequency of re-supply to shops according to 
size and seasonality, monitoring vehicle load factors, and 
ensuring that the fleet is regularly updated with the most 
modern fuel efficient vehicles.
the business has made further progress with its recycling 
and reducing the amount of waste that is put into landfill. 
during the Year the Group increased the quantity of 
recyclable materials collected from shops, and diverted 
waste streams from the Head office and central 
warehouse operations from using landfill to a local waste 
to power scheme.
Where possible we recycle electrical waste, ink toners, 
redundant it equipment and light bulbs. this Year we 
recycled 1,539 (2009:1,148) units of electrical equipment.
the Group recycles waste paper, cardboard, metal, and 
plastic. during the Year 33 tonnes of waste paper, 5,847 
tonnes of cardboard, 124 tonnes of metal and 385 tonnes of 
plastic were recycled. 90% of the recycled plastic had been 
back filled from stores. Where possible we also recycle 
the wood that we collect at our distribution centre. in the 
past all wood was sold for recycling, but it has now been 
determined to be cost effective to repair pallets, and a 
programme of repair began in 2009/10.
the Group has always kept its transit packaging to a 
minimum by the use of metal roll cages. Where it is 
necessary to send transit packaging to shops e.g. to 
ensure cleanliness of clothing, it is returned to the centre 
for re-use or recycling as appropriate.
as reported last year all stores now use biodegradable 
carrier bags and provide the option of a bag for life.
our aim for the coming years are to further implement 
utility smart metering, improve energy efficiency across 
the stores and to continue to minimise waste.
 
community
We recognise that consumers and stakeholders are 
becoming increasingly interested in where we source our 
products. 
the Group continues to procure merchandise from 
manufacturers who can show that they uphold ethical 
employment and trading practices. 
the Group has a code of ethics that it requires every 
supplier to adhere to. amongst other matters the code 
provides for fair treatment of workers ensuring products 
are made in a safe environment and in accordance with 
all the relevant local and national laws, by workers who 
are treated with respect and are paid fairly for what they 
do. it ensures there is no child labour and no use of illegal 
means or materials in the production of goods.
the Group has worked for many years with two leading 
supply chain companies in singapore and in south Korea to 
procure much of its own brand goods. 
the Group believes that using their local knowledge, 
expertise and experience, benefits the business and 
the communities in which they operate more effectively 
than would be the case if the Group carried on its own 
procurement activities in those countries. Both companies 
have the highest social and business ethics codes which 
match our code of ethics, the Bsci code of conduct (which 
is based upon the united nations universal declaration of 
Human rights), iso9001 and the social accountability 8000 
(sa8000) code.
the Group relies on those supply chain companies to 
inspect all suppliers and manufacturers premises. 
Frequent inspections are carried out randomly at short 
notice to ensure that the goods meet the Groups’ quality 
standards as well as assessing continued compliance 
with sa8000 and the Group’s code of ethics. We cease 
immediately to work with suppliers who do not meet our 
criteria. 
the Group complies with an internationally recognised list 
of chemicals that are banned for use in fabrics. the supply 
chain companies conduct random tests on fabric which are 
then taken to a recognised laboratory for quality testing 
and to check that these banned chemicals are not being 
used.
the Group has forged long term relationships with 
suppliers who have demonstrated that their work practices 
are consistent with the Group’s standards. approximately 
40% of the Group’s current suppliers have been working 
with Group companies for 10 years or more.
the Group endeavours to promote the participation in a 
wide range of sporting activities primarily for children 
that would not normally have access to the expertise or 
equipment needed for the sport.  slazenger are the exclusive cricket equipment supplier 
to the country’s most recognised grassroots cricket 
development programme, ‘chance to shine’, which is 
run through the english cricket Board’s charitable arm, 
the cricket Foundation. ‘chance to shine’ is a national 
campaign delivered through individual projects throughout 
england and Wales. each project provides a structured 
coaching and competition programme for a group of 
schools that would not normally have the chance to 
participate in the sport. the schools are supported by 
professional qualified coaches, who are specifically trained 
to work in a school environment, as well as providing 
equipment and training for teachers. 
in 2009, ‘chance to shine’ benefitted 384,105 children and 
3,343 schools. it provided over 109,332 hours of coaching 
along with cricket equipment to the value of £130,000, 
supplied by slazenger, to enable the programme to run 
successfully. 
one million children have now been involved in ‘chance to 
shine’ since its introduction 5 years ago.
in addition, dunlop’s global “d squad” talent support 
programme continues to increase participation and 
performance levels of the most talented juniors in tennis 
from around the world. 
over 800 children are continuing to benefit from the 
programme as a result of sporting equipment provided by 
dunlop. dunlop has supported the development of its most 
talented junior players through the provision of £27,000 
worth of tennis equipment in the past year.
the Group also continues to supply the international 
t ennis Federation with tennis equipment to their Junior 
development programme which promotes tournaments 
for young people aged between 14-18 years old in central 
america, the caribbean, south america, eastern europe, 
africa, asia and the p acific regions. dunlop donated in the 
region of £5,000 of equipment during the Year.
in the united states, everlast one of the Group’s specialist 
boxing brands supports numerous initiatives. everlast 
assists in running the new York Golden Gloves, the most 
prestigious amateur boxing tournament in the country by 
providing products such as gloves and personal protective 
equipment.

consolidated statement of changes in equity
for the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 the consolidated financial statements of sports direct international plc (the “company”) and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) have 
been prepared in accordance with international Financial reporting standards as adopted by the european union (“iFrs”).
the Group has adopted ias1 (revised 2007) and iFrs 8 during the year. the adoption of ias 1 (revised 2007) does not affect the financial 
position or profits of the Group but does give rise to additional disclosures. the measurement and recognition of the Group’s income and 
expenditure is unchanged. a third balance sheet has not been presented on the adoption of ias 1 (revised 2007) because the information 
is unchanged from previously published financial statements. iFrs 8 has been adopted and segments are identified based on the 
internal management reports used by the Board. 
no other iFrss, international reporting interpretations committee (iFric) interpretations and amendments have been adopted in the 
financial statements.
Basis oF preparation  
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with iFrs as adopted for use in the european union (including 
international accounting standards (“ias”) and international Financial reporting interpretations committee (“iFric”) interpretations) 
and with those parts of the companies act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under iFrs as adopted for use in the european union. 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified to include fair valuation of 
financial assets and derivative financial instruments. 
 
consolidation
the consolidated financial statements consolidate the revenues, costs, assets, liabilities and cash flows of the company and its 
subsidiaries, being those entities in relation to which the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, 
generally achieved by a share of more than 50% of the voting rights.
on acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of 
acquisition. any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. any 
deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is credited to the consolidated income 
statement in the period of acquisition. the interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion of the fair values of the 
assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective 
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
 
associates and Joint Ventures 
associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanied by a share of between 20% 
and 50% of the voting rights. 
a joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a long term basis and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one 
or more other ventures under a contractual agreement.
the Group’s share of the results of associates and joint ventures is included in the Group’s consolidated income statement using the 
equity method of accounting. investments in associates and joint ventures are carried in the Group’s consolidated balance sheet at cost 
plus post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associates, less any impairment in value. the carrying values 
of investments in associates and joint ventures include acquired goodwill.
if the Group’s share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the associate or joint venture, the 
Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations to do so or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint 
venture.
unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the 
entity.
 
inVestMents 
available-for-sale investments are initially recognised at fair value. Where fair value is different to cost, this is recognised in the income 
statement on initial recognition. subsequent gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity through 
the statement of comprehensive income, until the security is disposed or de-recognised at which time the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in equity is included in the consolidated income statement for the period. 
1. accounting policies
section 4 // FINANCIAl STATEMENTS //
notes to the Financial statements
for the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.71
if an available-for-sale investment is determined to be impaired, the cumulative loss previously recognised in equity is included in the 
income statement for the period.
contracts for difference are a type of financial instrument and therefore gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of these 
investments are recognised directly in the income statement.
 
Good Will 
Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually or when a change in 
circumstances or situation indicates that the goodwill has suffered an impairment loss. any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the amount of goodwill relating to that business. 
When the minority interests of an existing subsidiary are acquired the carrying value of the minority interests in the balance sheet is 
eliminated. the excess of consideration over the carrying value of the minority interests is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill 
and is not amortised.
 
otHer intanGiBle assets  
Brands, trade marks and licences that are internally generated are not recorded on the balance sheet. acquired brands, trade marks 
and licences are initially carried on the balance sheet at cost. the fair value of brands, trade marks and licences that are acquired by 
virtue of a business combination is determined at the date of acquisition and is subsequently assessed as being the deemed cost to the 
Group.
no amortisation is charged on brands, trade marks or perpetual/renewable licences with an indefinite life as the Group believes that 
the value of these brands and trade marks can be maintained indefinitely. the Group carries out an impairment review of indefinite 
life intangibles, at least annually, or when a change in circumstances or situation indicates that those intangibles have suffered an 
impairment loss. impairment is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the intangible asset as part of the cash generating unit 
(cGu) with the recoverable amount of the cGu, that is, the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is 
calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows, using a discount rate based on an estimate of the rate that the market would 
expect on an investment of comparable risk. 
amortisation is provided on brands, trade marks and licences with a definite life over their useful economic lives of 10 to 15 years and is 
accounted for within the selling, distribution and administrative expenses category within the income statement. 
 
propertY, plant and equipMent  
property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation less any recognised impairment losses. cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of these items. subsequent costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the costs can 
be measured reliably. all other costs, including repairs and maintenance costs, are charged to the income statement in the period in 
which they are incurred. 
depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land and is calculated on a reducing balance basis or 
straight-line basis, whichever is deemed by the directors to be more appropriate, to allocate cost less assessed residual value, other 
than assets in the course of construction, over the estimated useful lives, as follows: 
Freehold buildings 2% per annum
leasehold property over the term of the lease
plant and equipment between 5% and 33% per annum
the assets’ useful lives and residual values are reviewed and, if appropriate, adjusted at each balance sheet date. 
the gain or loss arising on disposal or scrapping of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds, net of selling 
costs, and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.  iMpairMent oF assets otHer tHan Good Will and intanGiBle assets WitH an indeFinite liFe  
at each balance sheet date, the directors review the carrying amounts of the Group’s tangible and intangible assets, other than goodwill 
and intangible assets with an indefinite life, to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment 
loss. if any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss, if any. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
if the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount 
of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. an impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, 
unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. 
impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to which goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the carrying 
amount of goodwill. any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior periods. a reversal of an 
impairment loss is recognised in the income statement immediately. 
 
reVenue recoGnition  
revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and sales related taxes. 
 in the case of goods sold through retail stores, revenue is recognised when goods are sold to the customer, less provision for returns. 
accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of the sale. retail sales are usually in cash, by debit 
card or by credit card. 
in the case of income generated from trade marks and licences, revenue is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the 
relevant agreements or on a transactional basis when revenue is linked to sale or purchase volumes. 
revenue from property related transactions is recognised when the relevant service is provided.
 
exceptional iteMs 
the Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement those significant items of income and expense which, 
because of their size, nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to 
understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods to assess trends in 
financial performance more readily.
 
interest incoMe 
interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying 
amount. 
 
GoVernMent Grants and siMilar incoMe 
income from government grants and similar income such as landlord contributions and inducements that compensate the Group for 
the cost of an asset are recognised in the balance sheet as a deduction in arriving at the carrying amount of the related asset. this 
is considered to reflect the true cost of the asset to the Group. the amount is recognised in the consolidated income statement over 
the life of the depreciable asset by way of a reduced depreciation charge. t o date the Group has not received government grants in 
compensation for expenses charged in the consolidated income statement.

section 4 // FINANCIAl STATEMENTS //
notes to the Financial statements
for the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 
continued sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.73
ForeiGn currencies  
the presentational currency of the Group is sterling. Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling using the exchange 
rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions. exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the 
retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income statement for the period. exchange differences arising on the retranslation 
of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement for the period except for differences arising on the 
retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary 
items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. all differences are taken to the income 
statement. 
on consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations which have a functional currency other than sterling are translated 
into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. the revenues and expenses of these subsidiary undertakings 
are translated at average rates applicable in the period. all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of 
equity. 
When a foreign operation is sold, combined exchange differences that have been recognised as a separate component of equity are 
recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
in order to mitigate its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts (see chief executive’s report 
and cash flow hedging accounting policy on page 18).
 
inVentories 
inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value. cost includes the purchase price of the manufactured products, 
materials, direct labour, transport costs and a proportion of applicable overheads. cost is calculated using FiF o (first in, first out). net 
realisable value is based on the estimated selling price less all estimated selling costs. 
 
l oans and receiV aBles  
loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost under 
the effective interest method less provision for impairment. provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. the amount of the impairment is 
the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original 
effective interest rate.
 
c asH and casH equiV alents  
cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held on call, together with other short term highly liquid investments. 
 
trade and otHer pa YaBles  
t rade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective 
interest method. 
 
deFerred taxation  
deferred taxation is calculated using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred tax arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time 
of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. deferred tax on temporary differences 
associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by 
the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. in addition, tax losses available to be carried forward 
as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets. deferred tax is determined using 
tax rates and laws that have been enacted (or substantially enacted) by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the 
related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
deferred tax liabilities are provided in full. 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.  changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they 
relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to 
equity. 
 
pensions 
the Group operates pension plans for the benefit of certain employees, including both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. 
in relation to its defined contribution plans, the Group makes contributions to independently administered plans, the contributions being 
recognised as an expense when they fall due. the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to make any further payments to the 
plans other than the contributions due. 
in relation to its defined benefit schemes, the Group recognises in its balance sheet the present value of its defined benefit obligations 
less the fair value of plan assets. the current service cost is charged against operating profit. interest on the scheme liabilities is 
included in finance costs and the expected return on scheme assets is included in finance income. 
the defined benefit obligation is calculated at each period end by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. the 
present value of the obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and which have terms to maturity approximating 
the terms of the related pension liabilities. actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are reflected in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they arise. 
 
Borro WinGs and Borro WinG costs  
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and subsequently at amortised cost. any difference 
between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the 
borrowings using the effective interest method. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months from the balance sheet date. 
Borrowing costs, being interest and other costs incurred in connection with the servicing of borrowings, are recognised as an expense 
when incurred. 
 
pro Visions 
a provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
the Group provides for dilapidations costs following advice from chartered surveyors and previous experience of exit costs. the 
estimated cost of fulfilling the leasehold dilapidations obligations is discounted to present value and analysed between non-capital 
and capital components. the capital element is recognised as a decommissioning cost and depreciated over the life of the asset. the 
non-capital element is taken to the income statement in the first year of the lease where the cost it represents is of no lasting benefit 
to the Group or its landlord. ‘Wear and tear’ costs are expensed to the income statement. provisions for onerous lease contracts are 
recognised when the Group believes the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be 
received under the lease. 
 
leases 
leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as 
finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present 
value of the minimum lease payments. each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a 
constant rate on the finance balance outstanding. the asset subject to the finance lease is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life 
and the lease term. the corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included as a liability. 
leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group does not have substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are 
classified as operating leases. payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term. incentives provided by the lessor are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease 
term.

section 4 // FINANCIAl STATEMENTS //
notes to the Financial statements
for the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 
continued sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.75
rental income from operating leases where the Group acts as a lessor is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. 
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term.
 
deriV atiVe Financial instruMents and HedGe accountinG 
the most significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations relates to purchases made in foreign currencies, principally the us 
dollar. the Group’s policy is to reduce substantially the risk associated with purchases denominated in foreign currencies by using 
forward fixed rate currency purchase contracts, taking into account any foreign currency cash flows. 
derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses 
on remeasurement are immediately recognised in the Group income statement. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, 
recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
in order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document from inception the relationship between the item being 
hedged and the hedging instrument. the Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship 
between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. this 
effectiveness testing is performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
 
c asH Flo W HedGinG  
derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows  
that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or highly probable forecast purchases.
the effective element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in equity.
the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the Group income statement in the same period 
or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the Group income statement. the classification of the effective portion 
when recognised in the Group income statement is the same as the classification of the hedged transaction. any element of the 
remeasurement of the derivative instrument which does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is recognised immediately in the 
Group income statement within finance income or costs. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. at that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in 
equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. if a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss 
recognised in equity is transferred to the Group income statement.
 
treasurY sHares 
the purchase price of the Group’s own shares that it acquires is recognised as ‘t reasury shares’ within equity. the difference between 
the market value and the average purchase price of shares sold out of t reasury is transferred to retained earnings.
 
eMplo Yee BeneFit trust 
the cost of shares acquired by the sports direct employee Benefit t rust is recognised within ‘own share reserve’ in equity. 
 
sHare Based pa YMents  
the Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain directors and employees. these are measured at fair value at the date 
of grant which is expensed to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with the corresponding 
credit going to equity.
Fair value is based on the market share price on the grant date, the likelihood of meeting the vesting targets and the expected number 
of staff who will leave the company prior to the vesting date. the expected staff numbers used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. a share based 
payment charge of £10,767,000 was recognised in selling, distribution and administrative expenses for the 52 weeks ended 25  
april 2010.
  equitY instruMents  
an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs. 
 
diVidends 
dividends are recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements and as a deduction from equity in the period in which the 
dividends are declared. Where such dividends are proposed subject to the approval of shareholders, the dividends are regarded as 
declared once shareholder approval has been obtained.

at the date of authorisation of these consolidated financial statements, the international accounting standards Board (“iasB”) and 
international Financial reporting interpretations committee (“iFric”) have issued the following standards and interpretations which

for the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 
continued sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.77
the critical accounting estimates and judgements made by the Group regarding the future or other key sources of estimation, 
uncertainty and judgement that may have a significant risk of giving rise to a material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are: 
iMpairMent oF Good Will  
the calculation for considering the impairment of the carrying amount of goodwill requires a comparison of the present value of the 
cash-generating units to which the goodwill has been allocated, to the value of goodwill and associated assets in the balance sheet. the 
calculation of present values requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating units and the 
selection of a suitable discount rate. the key assumptions made in relation to the impairment review of goodwill are set out in note 15.
 
iMpairMent oF otHer intanGiBle assets  
the calculation for considering the impairment of the carrying amount of other intangible assets with an indefinite life, specifically 
brands, trade marks and licences, requires a comparison of the present value of the related cash flows to the value of the other 
intangible assets in the balance sheet. the calculation of present value requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise 
from the other intangible assets and the selection of a suitable discount rate. the key assumptions made in relation to the impairment 
review of other intangible assets are set out in note 15.
 
useFul econoMic liFe oF intanGiBle assets  
For intangible assets which have a finite life, the directors revisit their estimate of useful economic life at each period end and revise 
accordingly. licences and trade marks typically have a life of between 10 and 12 years. 
 
identiFication and V aluation oF acquired intanGiBle assets  
on acquisition, each material separable intangible asset is identified and valued by the directors with assistance from a professional 
third party. any such calculation is judgmental in nature as it is based on a valuation methodology. 
Brand valuations are typically valued using the relief from royalty valuation methodology. 
the nature and carrying amounts of these assets are set out in note 15.
 
pro Vision F or oBsolete, slo W MoVinG or deFectiVe inVentories  
the directors have applied their knowledge and experience of the sports retail industry in determining the level and rates of provisioning 
required in calculating the appropriate inventory carrying values. the nature and carrying amounts are set out in note 18.
 
Financial position oF retireMent BeneFit plans  
the net defined benefit pension plan assets or liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet. the determination of the financial 
position requires assumptions to be made regarding inter alia future salary increases, mortality, discount rates and inflation. the key 
assumptions made in relation to the pension plan are set out in note 23. 
 
pro Vision F or dilapidations and onerous lease contracts  
the basis of the estimation of the provisioning for dilapidations and onerous lease contracts is detailed in the provision accounting policy 
and note 25. 
estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience, external advice and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
 
pro Vision F or costs relatinG to reGulatorY enquiries 
provision has been made for legal costs incurred in the period relating to ongoing regulatory enquiries.
 
leG al dispute surroundinG a VailaBle-F or-sale Financial assets 
no provision has been made against the recoverable of £14.7m which is detailed in note 17.
2. critical accounting estimates and judgements the Group’s current activities result in the following financial risks and set out below are management’s responses to those risks in 
order to minimise any resulting adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. 
ForeiGn excHanGe risK  
the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk principally via:
a) t ransactional exposure from the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency 
other than the functional currency of the purchasing company. t ransactional exposures that could significantly impact the income 
statement are hedged. these exposures are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts which are designated as cash flow 
hedges. the notional and fair value of these contracts is shown in note 27.
b) net investment exposure, from the fair value of net investments outside the uK. We hedge our investments in our international via 
foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies.
c) loans to non-uK subsidiaries. these are hedged via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which 
are not formally designated as hedges, as gains and losses on hedges and hedged loans will naturally offset.
 
interest rate risK  
the Group has net borrowings, which are principally at floating interest rates linked to bank base rates or liBor. the Group does not 
use interest rate financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate movements. the Group regularly monitors and reacts 
accordingly to any exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the impact on its monetary assets and liabilities. 
 
credit risK  
the directors have a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. credit evaluations are 
performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount. the Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets. 
at each balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented 
by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet. 
investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through banks and companies which must fulfil credit 
rating and investment criteria approved by the Board.
 
liquiditY risK  
the availability of adequate cash resources is managed by the Group through utilisation of its revolving bank and other facilities together 
with equity and retained profits thereby achieving continuity of funding and short-term flexibility.
 
c apital Mana GeMent 
a description of the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are included in the financial review on page 18 of 
this report.

ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares, 568,455,000 (2009: 568,452,000), is adjusted to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares under the Group’s bonus share schemes, being 37,348,000 (2009:nil), to give the 
diluted weighted average number of shares of 605,803,000 (2009:568,452,000).

12. t axation underlying earnings per share
the underlying earnings per share reflects the underlying performance of the business compared with the prior year and is calculated 
by dividing underlying earnings by the weighted average number of shares for the period. underlying earnings is used by management 
as a measure of profitability within the Group. underlying earnings is defined as profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the 
parent for each financial period but excluding the post tax effect of certain exceptional items.
the directors believe that the underlying earnings before exceptional items and underlying earnings per share measures provide 
additional useful information for shareholders on the underlying performance of the business, and are consistent with how business 
performance is measured internally. underlying earnings is not a recognised profit measure under iFrs and may not be directly 
comparable with “adjusted” profit measures used by other companies.

section 4 // FINANCIAl STATEMENTS //
notes to the Financial statements
for the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 
continued sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.89
the Group tests the carrying amount of goodwill and assets with an indefinite life annually for impairment or more frequently if there are 
indications that their carrying value might be impaired. the carrying amounts of other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if 
there is an indication of impairment. 
impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying amounts to the value in use derived from discounted cash flow projections for the 
cash generating units (cGu) to which the intangible assets are allocated.  
Value in use calculations are based on 5 year management forecasts with a terminal growth rate applied thereafter, representing 
management’s estimate of the long term growth rate of the sector served by the cGu’s.
the key assumptions, which are equally applicable to each cGu, in the cash flow projections used to support the carrying amount of 
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives as at 25 april 2010 were as follows:
retail and Brands 
• annual sales growth for the first five years of between 0% and 7% depending on the constituent elements of the cGu, followed by 
terminal sales growth of 2-4%.
• Gross margin of between 30% and 47% depending on the constituent elements of the cGu.
• annual maintenance expenditure of between £nil and £1.0m per annum depending on the individual entity’s circumstances.
• discount rates are estimated at a risk adjusted pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of between 12.6% and 17.3%.
the key assumptions are based on management’s historical experience and future plans for each cGu. 
a reasonably possible change in any key assumption would not cause the carrying value of any cGu to exceed its recoverable amount. 
the intangible assets that have an indefinite life are brands and trading names and are considered to have an indefinite life on the 
grounds of the proven longevity of the brands and trading names and the Group’s commitment to maintaining those brands.
in 2009 an impairment charge £14,832,000 was recognised, mainly due to an increase in discount rates to reflect specific risk factors and 
a decrease in forecast sales growth as a result of the tough economic climate. no impairment charge was recognised in 2010.

on 16 april 2010, the Group acquired a further 7.5% of Warrnambool, a private unlimited company incorporated in the republic of 
ireland which is the ultimate parent undertaking of Heatons, a private unlimited company. the excess of fair value acquired over 
consideration paid has been credited to the income statement as shown above.
this takes the Group’s interest in Warrnambool to 50%. the business activity of Heatons is that of household, sporting and leisure goods 
retail. Heatons operates in the republic of ireland and northern ireland. the directors do not consider that they have control over the 
financial and operating policies of Warrnambool and so will continue to account for the company as an associate.
the Group’s share of associates’ assets, liabilities and income statement, which is included in the consolidated financial statements, is 
as follows:

We have previously reported that some of our strategic stakes were held by Kaupthing singer & Friedlander (KsF) and partly financed 
by them. on 8 october 2008, KsF went into administration and we ware in dispute with the administrators concerning the ownership 
of the shares they held. in the 2009 the financial statements we concluded that we may not directly “control” the shares for accounting 
purposes and therefore treated them as having been derecognised. this derecognition resulted in the trasfer of historic losses, 
previously recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense, of £53,156,000 into the income statement in the year ended 
26 april 2009. on 21 February 2010 the company entered into an agreement with administrator of KsF to acquire any rights which may be determined 
that they hold.
on 13 May 2010 the judgement of the court proceedings which commenced on 26 april 2010 was handed down. the court determined 
that the Group had acquired beneficial interest in 12,153,071 ordinary shares in Blacks leisure and 5,775,255 in Jd sports on 8 october 
2008. this acquisition is reflected in these financial statements. the judgement also resulted in the Group regaining control of the 
shares.
the administrator of KsF has now appealed the decision. sdi’s ownership of the shares is no longer in dispute, but were KsF to be 
successful in an appeal then sdi would be required to pay an amount of c£14.7m, which is currently held in escrow and included in other 
debtors. this amount represents the difference in value of the shares between 8 october 2008 and 21 February 2010.
the Group has also submitted a claim to the administrators for the shares that are claimed to be owned by the Group in amer sports, 
Blacks leisure Group plc and Jd sports and Fashion plc, but were not in KsF possession. the Group is also claiming for the dividends 
on the these shares and Group funds held KsF. this amounts to approximately £9.1m in total and the latest information from the 
administrator suggests a pay out of around 70%. accordinly, a receivable of £6.3m has been recognised.
the financial assets at 25 april 2010 relate to strategic investments held of between 12.0% and 28.5% in share capital. the directors do 
not consider that they have significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investees as they have no representation 
on the Board of directors, have no participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends or other 
distributions, have no material transactions with the investees and do not interchange any managerial personnel. 
on 25 april 2010 the Group had one investment in excess of 20% of share capital, that being 28.5% (2009: 29.9%) of the ordinary share 
capital of Blacks leisure Group plc, a company incorporated in england and Wales. the aggregate of its share capital and reserves and 
loss for the years ended 27 February 2010 and 28 February 2009 are as follows:

MJW ashley made a £50,000 cash payment to the company as a permanent contribution to capital on 8 February 2007 under a deed of

the capital redemption reserve arose on the redemption of the company’s redeemable preference shares of 10p each at par on 2 March 
2007.
Between 5 october 2007 and 11 March 2008 the Group cancelled 79,547,631 of shares acquired as part of the share buy back

the Group expects to contribute £1,210,000 to its defined benefit pension plans for the 52 weeks ended 24 april 2011.
the assumptions used to determine the expected return on assets reflects the underlying asset allocation at each period end. the plan

the overall expected rate of return on the scheme’s assets has been derived by considering the expected rate of return on each major 
asset class of investments at the start of the year and weighting these rates of return by the proportion of the total investments that the 
class represents at the start of the year.

the dilapidations provision is the best estimate of the present value of expenditure expected to be incurred by the Group in order to 
restore its leasehold premises to the condition required under the lease agreements at the end of the lease discounted at 7% per 
annum. the provision is expected to be utilised over the period to the end of each specific lease. 
the provision in respect of onerous lease contracts represents the net cost of fulfilling the Group’s obligations over the terms of these 
contracts discounted at 7% per annum. the provision is expected to be utilised over the period to the end of each specific lease. a 
number of leases previously assigned to third party tenants have reverted to the Group this year as the tough economic conditions have 
led to those third party tenants being unable to meet their commitments.
the unwinding of the discount on provision passes through the income statement.

carrying values do not materially differ from fair value.
Fair value hierarchy 
the Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
• level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly 
or indirectly; and
• level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data. unlisted equity investments are included in level 3. the fair value of the embedded derivative is determined using the 
present value of the estimated future cash flows based on financial forecasts.
as at 25 april 2010, the only financial instruments measured at fair value were derivative financial assets and a vailable-for-sale 
financial assets and these are classified as level 1.
 
(B) deriV atiVes: F oreiGn currenc Y ForW ard purcHase contracts  
the most significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations relates to purchases made in foreign currencies, principally the us 
dollar. the Group’s policy is to reduce substantionally the risk associated with purchases denominated in foreign currencies by using 
forward fixed rate currency purchase contracts, taking into account any foreign currency cash flows. the Group does not hold or issue 
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, however if derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting they are accounted for 
as such and accordingly any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.

at 25 april 2010 £210m of forward us dollar purchase contracts qualified for hedge accounting and the gain on fair valuation of these 
contracts of £10,942,000 has therefore been taken straight to equity through the statement of comprehensive income.
Forward foreign currency purchase and sale contracts generally have a maturity at inception of approximately 12 months. at 25 april 
2010 no purchase contracts and no sale contracts had a maturity at inception of greater than 12 months (2009: £nil million of purchase 
contracts).

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
the Group’s principal foreign currency exposures are to us dollars and the euro. the table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity 
of the Group’s reported profit and equity to a 5% increase and decrease in the us dollar/sterling and euro/sterling exchange rates at 
the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged. the figures have been calculated by comparing the fair values of 
outstanding foreign currency contracts at the current exchange rate to those if exchange rates moved as illustrated.
positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity:

  interest rate sensitivity analysis
the table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Group’s reported profit and equity to a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest 
rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged. 
the analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions:
• For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been 
outstanding for the whole year.
• Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.
positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.

as a matter of course the Group undertakes action in numerous parts of the world to protect its trade mark registrations and in 
connection with the Group’s licensees. such actions are usually resolved in the ordinary course of business. the Group is, however, party 
to a dispute and since 2007 has provided for an amount representing the financial estimation of the potential loss if the outcome was not 
to be in its favour. the Group believes that to provide further information would be seriously prejudicial to the case.

the accompanying accounting policies and notes form part of these financial statements.
the financial statements were approved by the Board on 22 July 2010 and were signed on its behalf by:
 
Bob Mellors 
director  notes to the company Financial statements
these accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable united Kingdom accounting standards. a summary of the more 
important accounting policies adopted are described below.
 
Basis oF accountinG 
the accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
as permitted by section 408 of the companies act 2006, a profit and loss account of the company is not presented. the company’s loss 
after taxation for the 52 week period 25 april 2010 was £10,364,000 (2009 £27,694,000 profit).
 
inVestMents 
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
cost represents cash consideration or the amount of ordinary shares issued by the company at nominal value after taking account of 
merger relief available under s612 of the companies act 2006 plus related acquisition costs capitalised at fair value.
 
deFerred taxation 
deferred tax is provided for on a full provision basis on all timing differences, which have arisen but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date. no timing differences are recognised in respect of gains on sale of assets where those gains have been rolled over into 
replacement assets. a deferred tax asset is not recognised to the extent that the transfer of economic benefit in future is uncertain.
deferred tax is calculated on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
 
ForeiGn currencies 
items arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the 
transaction. at the balance sheet date all monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing 
rate or at the rate of exchange at which the transaction is contracted to be settled in the future. all exchange differences are dealt with 
in the profit and loss account.
 
diVidends
dividends on the company’s ordinary shares are recognised as a liability in the company’s financial statements, and as a deduction from 
equity, in the period in which the dividends are declared. Where such dividends are proposed subject to the approval of the company’s 
shareholders, the dividends are only declared once shareholder approval has been obtained.
 
equitY instruMents 
an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. 
equity instruments issued by the company, with the exception of those accounted for via merger relief available under s612 of the 
companies act 2006, are recorded at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
 
incoMe FroM Group undertaKinGs 
income from Group undertakings is recognised when qualifying consideration is received from the Group undertaking.
 
related partY transactions 
the company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in Frs 8 and has therefore not disclosed transactions or balances with 
wholly owned subsidiaries which form part of the Group.
 
sHare Based pa YMents  
the company has applied the requirements of Frs 20, “share based p ayment”. the company issues equity-settled share based 
payments to certain directors and employees of the company and its subsidiaries. these are measured at fair value at the date of grant 
which is expensed to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate 
of shares that will eventually vest.
1. accounting policies
section 4 // FINANCIAl STATEMENTS // sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.113
Fair value is measured by use of a Monte carlo method. the expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s 
best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. a share based payment charge 
of £10,767,000 was recognised for the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 based on the directors’ best estimate of the number of shares that 
will vest. £10,446,000 of this share based payment was recharged to subsidiary undertakings of the company.

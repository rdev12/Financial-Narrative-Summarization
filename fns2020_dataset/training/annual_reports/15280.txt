Overview
Overview
In a challenging environment, Synthomer delivered a resilient set of results 
in 2012, achieving a second successive year of record proﬁt before tax. 
This was achieved despite poor economic conditions in Europe, weakening 
of the euro against sterling and challenging trading conditions for our Asian 
nitrile latex business, where additional capacity and competitive behaviour 
impacted our performance.
2012 was the ﬁrst full year of trading since the transformational acquisition 
of PolymerLatex in March 201 1 and the completion of our divestiture 
programme. The Group beneﬁted from increased scale, an enhanced 
product portfolio, stronger market positions and greater efﬁciencies 
delivered from the PolymerLatex integration. To reﬂect the Group’s 
subsequent transformation into a focused specialty chemical company, 
we changed the Group’s name to Synthomer plc towards the end of 
the year. We trade under the Synthomer brand around the world and 
the name is widely recognised and respected by our customers. 
Full year performance 
During the year, Group sales declined by 12% to £1,111.8 million 
(201 1 pro-forma £1,268.8 million). Volumes were 5% lower than 
the previous year, as a result of weaker European demand. 
Operating proﬁts were broadly ﬂat at £109.0 million (201 1 pro-forma 
£109.7 million). The beneﬁt of synergies and margin management offset the 
adverse impact of the poor economic conditions in Europe, the weakness 
in the euro and the challenging trading conditions in our nitrile latex business.
Group proﬁt before tax was £98. 1 million (201 1 pro-forma £96.0 million). 
Despite the economic difﬁculties of recent years, this is the 6th consecutive 
year that we have increased underlying Group proﬁt before tax.
Earnings per share were 22.0p (201 1 underlying 18.8p), an increase of 
17%, with the beneﬁt of the ﬁrst whole year’s trading since the PolymerLatex 
acquisition in March 201 1.
Strategy
We continue to focus on being a leading producer of aqueous polymers. 
Our strategy is to deliver growth through geographic expansion in emerging 
markets, where mega-trends including population growth, urbanisation 
and increasing wealth are driving demand for our products across the 
region. In these high-growth regions, we are able to beneﬁt from the 
leading technologies, R&D and manufacturing capabilities which we have 
developed in European markets to give us a strong competitive advantage 
in new geographies.
Our European business remains highly cash generative, allowing us to 
invest in emerging market opportunities. Our new 70,000 tonne nitrile latex 
capacity expansion in Pasir Gudang, Malaysia, which was completed at 
the end of the year and was commissioned during January 2013 represents 
one such opportunity. We anticipate having SBR latex manufacturing 
capability in Malaysia from the middle of this year, something we have 
been targeting for several years. We continue to look for further investment 
opportunities to expand our footprint in Asia.
Integration process and synergies
The integration of PolymerLatex is now essentially complete. Synergies 
delivered in the year were £19 million, a year-on-year improvement of 
£16 million over the £3 million delivered in 201 1. At the beginning of 
2012 we committed to a higher synergy target of £25 million, and we 
remain conﬁdent of delivering the balance of the synergies in 2013. 
Balance sheet
Net debt was slightly lower than the start of the year at £156 million. 
This represents a net borrowing to EBITDA ratio of 1.2, which the Board 
considers to be a prudent leverage position. 
Dividend
The Board has recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 3.3p per share, making 
a total dividend for the year of 5.5p. The Board committed to this level of 
dividend in our interim results announcement on 28 August 2012, together 
with an undertaking to move the dividend cover to three times by 2015. 
The full year dividend of 5.5p represents an increase of 57% over the 
previous year.
Safety, health and environment
The Group is absolutely committed to the continuous improvement of its 
performance in respect of safety, health and the environment. I am pleased 
that almost all of the metrics that we measure in this area showed good 
improvement over the prior year.
People
The Group has achieved a great deal in recent years with its transformation 
to a focused specialty polymers business. None of this could have been 
achieved without the hard work and dedication of the Group’s employees 
and I thank all of them for their support and hard work during this period.
Board composition
We have strengthened the Board this year with a number of appointments. 
Just Jansz and Jinya Chen respectively bring extensive knowledge of 
the Chemical Sector and Asian markets and operations. Ishbel Macpherson 
who joined the Board in May 2012 has indicated that, in order to focus in 
other areas, she does not intend to stand for re-election and I should like 
to thank Ishbel for her contribution during her time with us.
Current trading and outlook
We have made a solid start to the year. Nevertheless, we expect the 
macro-economic environment in Europe to continue to result in challenging 
trading conditions through 2013. Our expectations for the Asian nitrile 
market remain unchanged, with improvements expected from the end of 
this year. With our non-nitrile capacity in Asia fully utilised, we will continue to 
invest in capacity in emerging markets to build our platform for future growth 
beyond 2013. We expect demand growth in our emerging markets to 
remain strong and overall the Board remains conﬁdent in the Group’s 
long-term prospects and strategy.

Overview
2012 was the ﬁrst full year of trading since the PolymerLatex acquisition 
in 201 1. The Group is now a larger, more focused specialty chemical 
company, with the scale and capability to grow in chosen markets. 
We are now focused on being one of the world’s leading aqueous polymer 
producers, with our market leading positions in Europe and expanding 
business in Asia enabling us to add value to our customers and generate 
returns for our stakeholders. 
During the year we largely completed the integration work associated with 
the acquisition of PolymerLatex. Synergies from that integration reached 
approximately £19 million in the year, a £16 million year-on-year increase. 
A further £6 million of annualised synergies are anticipated in 2013 to reach 
a total of £25 million.
Two years into the integration, the broader business beneﬁts are very clear. 
We now have a stronger management team and enhanced capability 
in the areas of product development and process know-how, combined 
with a more modern and cost effective asset base and state-of-the-art 
R&D facilities.
Business performance 
2012 was a very challenging year from a trading perspective. Demand in 
Europe was weak on the back of the eurozone crisis, and we saw volume 
reductions of 8% in our Europe & North America (ENA) segment. However, 
we compensated for the volume declines through higher unit margins, 
which we continue to manage actively to optimise proﬁtability. The weaker 
euro also affected the translation of European results into sterling with an 
adverse effect of £5.5 million on operating proﬁt. Synergy delivery was 
predominantly in Europe, and overall therefore, operating proﬁt in our 
ENA segment was strongly ahead of 201 1. 
In Asia and Rest of World (ARW), our non-nitrile businesses delivered very 
good growth with EBIT up 20%. In nitrile, excess capacity and consequent 
aggressive pricing behaviour by regional competitors served to substantially 
lower results. In our interim results we stated our expectations that we 
do not expect any substantive improvement in these conditions for 
12- 18 months. Since then the market has stabilised, and is performing 
broadly in line with our expectations at the interim results, and we continue 
to expect improvements towards the end of 2013. 
Looking further ahead, we, and our customers, continue to expect to see 
demand growth of 10- 15% over the coming years for nitrile latex. With our 
leading share of approximately one third of the market, and our position as 
the only current local supplier, we continue to anticipate substantial future 
proﬁts from this business as the environment improves.
We continued to invest in our business during the year, with net capital 
expenditure in the year of £38. 1 million, up from £21.9 million in 201 1. 
Alongside the capital invested to facilitate site closures as part of the 
synergy delivery, we have been investing heavily to support the future 
organic growth of the business. We completed a substantial expansion 
of our nitrile facility in Pasir Gudang, Malaysia and ongoing investment 
in the same facility will enable us to produce SBR to sell into the region – 
an objective we have been pursuing for several years and which will 
provide us with enhanced operational ﬂexibility. In Europe we have invested 
in our Lithene
®
 business to improve our product offering and to launch 
our new Lithene
®
ultra range of products. We also recently commenced 
an investment to support growth in our specialty Alcotex business – 
a business where we are global No. 1, and product manufactured in 
the UK is shipped to PVC manufacturers around the world.
We have had a number of successful product launches during the year, 
and we remain very focused on tailoring and deploying our existing 
western technology to support growth in emerging markets – particularly 
in the areas of Construction & Coatings and Functional Polymers.
Raw materials, as in recent years, remained volatile. Prices strengthened 
through the ﬁrst few months of the year, before easing back and were 
relatively stable over the last quarter. This pattern was similar to what we 
saw in 201 1. We continue to manage these price movements effectively 
through our general approach to margin management.
Divisional performance 
We manage the business in two segments. ‘Europe & North America’ 
(ENA) and ‘Asia & Rest of World’ (ARW). The reported results are on an 
‘origination basis’ , meaning the segmental sales and operating proﬁts are 
reported based on where the product is manufactured. We export many 
specialty products from Europe to Asia. Looking at sales on a destination 
basis, Europe & North America comprises 63% of Group turnover with 
Asia & Rest of World accounting for 37%.

Investing in high growth markets






















 11 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012
Business review
Operating proﬁt in our ENA business was ahead by 15%, despite volumes 
for the year being down 8%. Demand generally softened in the second half 
of the year, as the eurozone crisis continued to affect the region. Demand 
was weakest for sales into the construction market. This particularly 
impacted our Construction & Coatings and Functional Polymers 
business units.
ENA beneﬁted from synergies, with the £16 million year-on-year 
improvement attributable principally to Europe, but this was somewhat 
offset by the translation effect of the weaker euro against sterling which 
adversely impacted operating proﬁt in ENA by £5.5 million. As part of the 
synergy delivery we announced the closure of three plants in ENA. Two were 
closed during the course of 201 1. The third plant, in Batley, UK, is expected 
to close in the second quarter of 2013, when capital investment to facilitate 
this is concluded at our Stallingborough dispersions facility. This will bring 
to a close the rationalisation of the European manufacturing network. 
There were multiple product launches in ENA during the year. These 
included several new pressure sensitive adhesive grades, new grades for 
textile print adhesives and a new thermo-mouldable carpet latex product. 
We also developed a new range of Lithene
®
 products, marketed under 
the brand of Lithene
®
ultra, which we expect to see good growth from 
during 2013.

ﬁnancial review.
Operating proﬁt in our ARW segment was lower by 42%. Non-nitrile 
businesses in ARW, which are predominantly in our Construction & 
Coatings business unit, were strongly ahead in 2012, with operating proﬁt 
up by 20%. As previously highlighted, our nitrile business was affected by 
aggressive pricing in the market, driven largely by excess manufacturing 
capacity. Overall volumes in ARW were ahead by 4%.
Since we reported on the turbulence in the nitrile market at the half year, the 
business has generally stabilised and developed as we expected, although 
we are not anticipating any substantive improvement until towards the end 
of 2013. We continue to invest in this high growth sector, and at the end 
of 2012 we completed our 70,000 tonne expansion of our nitrile facility 
in Pasir Gudang. We also commenced work on converting one of our 
NBR lines to facilitate SBR production, which we will use to supply up to 
70,000 tonnes of SBR into Asia.
A key part of the Group’s strategy is to add value through our technology 
and know-how by deploying it into Asia and other emerging markets. 
We had several new product launches in the region in 2013. These included 
additives for polyester resin moulding, a high water resistant wood adhesive 
product and an improved self crosslinking nitrile latex grade. We also have 
two major product launches in the nitrile latex sector scheduled for 2013.

Leveraging technology in emerging markets
A key part of the Group’s strategy is to exploit its 
technology into applications in emerging markets, 
in line with mega-trends affecting these economies. 
Alongside superior performance and quality, 
this includes the trend to “green” products, with 
the elimination of APEO and formaldehyde from 
products in these regions. These include products 
sold under our Plextol, Revacryl and Emultex trade 
names and a range of customer speciﬁc grades. 
In South East Asia, Synthomer now offers products 
that can be formulated to meet the most demanding 
regional environmental standards, such as the 
Malaysian Eco-label and the Singapore Green Label, 
in all interior and exterior coating applications. 
New offerings that use Synthomer core technology 
are continually in development, with products such 
as the recently launched Revacryl 4370 for premium 
interior paints.
Markets in South Africa are also moving to more 
environmentally friendly coating systems. A growing 
application is the use of gypsum-based plasters that 
are applied over conventional plasters to achieve an 
ultra-smooth ﬁnish. This requires that a pigmented 
plaster primer be applied over it to ensure adhesion 
of subsequent water-based topcoats. Traditionally 
these primers have been based on solvent-based 
products, as conventional water-based primers 
cannot meet the performance requirements. 
Synthomer has developed Revacryl 8000, 
an emulsiﬁed system that can be formulated into 
water-based coatings using conventional thickeners 
and can eliminate the use of white spirits. 
This innovative solution has allowed access to 
this growing market sector with a product that 
both matches the performance of solvent 
systems whilst delivering a signiﬁcantly reduced 
environmental burden.
Revacryl 8000 replaces solvent-based 
systems in plaster primers.
Revacryl 4370 is an APEO free styrene 
acrylic polymer dispersion with a wide

Business review
Income statement
The acquisition of PolymerLatex in March 201 1 substantially changed 
the size of the Group. To allow a meaningful comparison of the results 
for 2012 with 201 1, the table below shows pro-forma results by adjusting 
the underlying performance of the Group in 201 1 to include results of 
PolymerLatex for Q1 201 1, and to allow for an estimated interest cost of 
£2. 1 million for that quarter. The underlying pro-forma results provided 
the most meaningful comparison of year-on-year performance.

Sales, operating proﬁt and proﬁt before tax – 
underlying non pro-forma
Total sales decreased by 0.4% to £1,111.8 million, with underlying volume 
declines and currency translation effects, broadly offset by the beneﬁt of 
one extra full quarter of turnover from the PolymerLatex acquisition in the 
year. Group operating proﬁt increased by 13%, mainly due to the extra 
quarters proﬁt from the PolymerLatex acquisition, whilst proﬁt before tax 
increased by 16% to £98. 1 million on an underlying (non pro-forma) basis.
Tax and EPS – underlying non pro-forma
The Group’s underlying tax rate of 22% (201 1 23%), remains low, reﬂecting 
the beneﬁts of pioneer status (extended tax holiday) on our nitrile business 
in Malaysia, and a zero rate in the UK. The Group does not expect to pay 
tax in the UK for the foreseeable future due to brought forward losses and 
deﬁcit contributions to the UK pension scheme, which are tax deductible.
Proﬁt attributable to minority interests was £1.8 million (201 1 £1.6 million).
As a result, overall, the underlying earnings per share for 2012 was 22.0p, 
compared to 18.8p per share for 201 1. This is an increase in underlying 
earnings per share of 17%. 
Dividend
The Group committed to a full year dividend of 5.5p for 2012, at the time of 
the interim announcement with an interim dividend of 2.2p. A ﬁnal dividend 
of 3.3p per share is therefore recommended, payable on 5 July 2013 to 
shareholders on the register on 7 June 2013. The total dividend of 5.5p 
represents an increase of 57% over 201 1.
Special items and IFRS
The Group reports its ﬁnancial results according to International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, to provide a clearer indication of the 
Group’s underlying performance, a number of special items are split out 
and shown in a separate column of the consolidated income statement 
due to their one-off or non-economic nature, and are excluded from the 
comments on underlying performance above and throughout the Chief 
Executive’s review of business performance. Special items comprise:
 Restructuring costs associated with delivering the synergy targets for 
the PolymerLatex acquisition of £6.7 million (£6.0 million cash costs and 
£0.7 million non-cash costs). At the time of the acquisition the Group 
announced an estimated total cash expenditure of approximately 
£20 million to deliver these synergies. Cash costs of £15.8 million 
were expensed in 201 1 together with £4.4 million of non-cash costs. 
 Various cross-currency and interest rate swaps for hedging purposes, 
which involve maturities of up to ﬁve years. IFRS requires that where the 
strict requirements of IAS39 are not met, changes in the market value 
should be recognised annually in the income statement. However, such 
ﬁnancial instruments are maintained by the Group for the length of the 
contract and over their lifetime have a fair value of nil. Hence the notional 
annual adjustment, a loss of £1.7 million (201 1 loss £3.3 million) is 
segregated from the underlying performance. 
 Amortisation of intangibles of £27 .4 million (comprising £25.8 million in 
the Company and subsidiaries and £1.6 million in share of joint ventures). 
IFRS acquisition accounting requires an explicit number to be placed 
on certain intangibles and amortised through the consolidated income 
statement, with the balance of the excess of the purchase price over 
the physical assets being carried as goodwill, which is subject to annual 
impairment testing. The amortisation expense arising from this has been 
treated as a special item and will continue to be so as the associated 
intangible assets are fully amortised. 
 Tax credits of £17 .3 million, of which £8.6 million was in respect of the 
release of notional deferred tax associated with the amortisation of 
acquired intangibles and £1.6 million represented the tax relief from 
restructuring and site closure costs. Additionally, a deferred tax asset 
of £7 . 1 million was recognised for the UK and has been included in 
special items. 
Balance sheet
Goodwill decreased to £240.9 million at the end of 2012 from £244.7 million 
at the end of 201 1 due to translation. 
Acquired intangible assets which arose as a result of the PolymerLatex 
acquisition decreased to £135.6 million at 31 December 2012 from 
£165.4 million in the prior year. This movement reﬂects regular annual 
amortisation of £25.8 million reported in special items, and currency 
translation.
Property, plant and equipment increased to £199.6 million at 
31 December 2012 compared to £183.6 million at 31 December 201 1. 
Additions during the year comprised £40.3 million of capital expenditure 
(net £38. 1 million).
The net deferred tax liability has decreased to £40.7 million from 
£61.4 million during the year. The decrease is primarily due to the 
recognition of a deferred tax asset of £7 . 1 million in the UK, the beneﬁt of 
which was reported in special items, and £8.6 million of notional deferred 
tax associated with acquired intangibles, reported in special items.

Pensions
In the main UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme the majority of investments 
are in equities. All asset classes performed well over the course of 2012, 
with a total return on assets (excluding cash) of 14. 1%. The yield on 
high-quality corporate bonds decreased slightly during the year, which 
increased liabilities. The Company made cash contributions to the fund 
in the year of £18.8 million, of which £10 million is a prepayment of 2013 
contributions. The overall effect of these changes was that there was a 
small decrease in the deﬁcit of the scheme, which stood at £69.5 million 
at the end of 2012 (201 1 £73.9 million). 
An actuarial valuation for 2012 will be ﬁnalised by mid 2013. Due to the 
prepayment, cash contributions in 2013 are expected to be of the order 
of £5 million.
The UK scheme was closed to future accrual during 2009 and there are 
no active members in the scheme.
Overseas net pension liabilities increased to £50.2 million (201 1 £44.0 million) 
reﬂecting a lower discount rate in Germany. The non-UK schemes are 
primarily traditional German unfunded ‘on balance sheet’ arrangements.

Underlying net borrowings reduced during the year to £155.8 million.
Group management EBITDA increased to £127 .4 million reﬂecting the effect 
of a full year ownership of PolymerLatex (201 1 nine months from 1 April). 
Net capital expenditure increased substantially in 2012 to £38. 1 million 
net (£40.3 million gross), due to organic expansion in Malaysia and spend 
to facilitate the delivery of the acquisition synergies.
Pension funding in excess of IAS19 charge of £17 .3 million includes a 
£10 million prepayment to the UK pension fund. This will result in lower 
cash contributions in 2013.
Underlying working capital outﬂow for the year was £1.3 million.
Financing and liquidity
As at the end of 2012, the Group had the following drawn term (over one 
year to maturity) funding in place:
£m
Euro denominated bank loan maturing March 2015 145.4
US private placements 56.9
Less: Associated currency hedges and costs (8.0)
Total 194.3
This compares to a net borrowing position of £155.8 million. The Group 
had an undrawn £60 million revolving loan facility maturing March 2015, 
and a net cash position (cash and cash equivalents less short term 
overdrafts and factoring debt) of £32.9 million.
In arriving at the Group’s net borrowings, £20.4 million of non-recourse 
off balance sheet factoring has been added back as a special item. 
Excluding this adjustment net borrowings would have been £135.4 million. 
This factoring facility expired at the end of December 2012 and settled 
over January and February 2013 – though, as this is adjusted back into 
net borrowings, its termination has no impact on the Group’s stated 
net borrowings.
Underlying net borrowings to EBITDA, the Group’s key leverage metric, 
was 1.2 at the end of 2012 (201 1 1.2).

Business review
Introduction – SHE performance and achievements during 2012
2012 was another year of signiﬁcant progress for Synthomer plc in 
environmental and safety performance. On nearly all of our environmental 
metrics the Group improved again and continues to comfortably beat the 
targets we set for ourselves in 2005 for our environmental performance. 
The consolidation of Group operations, following the acquisition of 
PolymerLatex in 201 1, has given signiﬁcant environmental gains. This is 
most notable in the Group’s emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds 
(VOCs) which fell sharply, by over 26%, on a per tonne of production basis, 
during the year. 
The Group is also very pleased to be able to report that the ‘over 3-day’ 
accident rate approximately halved in 2012 to give the Group its best ever 
performance for personal safety. The fall in the accident rate meant that our 
employees had a chance of being injured at work of less than one quarter 
of the rate in 2000. Two sites had notable achievements: Oulu in Finland 
achieved 4,000 days (1 1 years) without a single day lost due to an accident; 
and the NBR Pasir Gudang site in Malaysia achieved 1,000 days, especially 
remarkable given the number of contractors on site for the major expansion 
projects. The improvement in the accident rate was achieved by a major 
programme of employee engagement during the year culminating in 
a Group-wide Safety Week in October. This programme was strongly 
supported, and indeed led, by Worker’s Councils and Site Safety Committees 
throughout the company, with regional meetings for safety representatives 
to share experiences and help drive improvement on all our sites. 
Only one key measure did not improve in 2012: water use per tonne of 
production, which had fallen by 26.5% in 201 1, rose by 2.7% in 2012. 
Despite the increase, usage per tonne is easily the second best result for 
Synthomer and is still nearly 25% below the 2010 ﬁgure. Energy use in the 
year fell again by 3.5% compared to 201 1 and this was accompanied by a 
fall in carbon dioxide emissions of 4.6% per tonne of production. As noted 
above, the improvement in energy performance was accompanied by a 
sharp reduction in the releases of VOCs which fell by 21% in absolute terms 
during the year. Together the improvements in energy consumption and 
VOC release meant that the Group reduced its releases of greenhouse 
gases by 8% in 2012. 
The improved energy performance was partly achieved by a sharp 
reduction in the use of oil as a fuel and this in turn led to a further reduction 
of 25% in the Group’s sulphur dioxide emissions on a per tonne basis. 
This fall followed a reduction of 77% in 201 1 and means that the Group has 
now achieved a 99.9% reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions since 2000. 
Although production at William Blythe increased, our discharges of heavy 
metals per tonne of production reduced for the fourth year in a row giving 
the best ever performance of only 0.096 gms per tonne of production.
Despite one off waste arising associated with plant closure, Synthomer’s 
production of waste fell signiﬁcantly during the year. The fall in hazardous 
waste was particularly marked: falling from 21,646 tonnes in 201 1 
to 8,461 tonnes in 2012, though this was assisted by the sale of the 
pharmaceutical division. Overall waste per tonne of production fell 
by over 51%, from 28kg in 201 1 to 14kg per tonne in 2012. 
Under the auspices of the European Chemical Industries Council (Ceﬁc), 
Synthomer has been involved in a 3 year comparative study of the carbon 
footprint of polymer products. The study, discussed further below, has 
shown that Synthomer and the European polymer industry as a whole 
have improved their energy efﬁciency since the last study was done in 1999. 
Whilst the results depend on the product mix of each individual company, 
we are pleased to report that Synthomer performs well compared to the 
rest of the industry. 
During the year the Company maintained its strong focus on process 
safety. A further 50 members of staff went through the IChemE’s 
week-long, assessed training course on the subject and a programme 
of improved metrics is being introduced to give the Board and Executive 
Committee better insight into the Company’s performance. Whilst it is 
pleasing to be able to report that there was only one serious process 
safety incident in 2012 (which was handled without safety or environmental 
consequences) the Company is mindful of the need for continuing – 
and indeed ever improving – vigilance in this area.
Our policy commitments
Following discussions at all levels in the company, Synthomer’s Safety, 
Health and Environment (SHE) policy was revised during 2012. 
The revisions are aimed at ensuring our fundamental commitment to 
good SHE performance is well understood across the Company’s 
operations in all regions. Our three long-term goals are:
 to minimise any environmental burden created by our activities;
 to have no accidents or incidents; and
 to have no adverse impact on the health of those who work in, or live 
near, our operations, nor on the health of those who use our products.
These goals are embedded in the Company’s SHE management system 
and in the annual SHE improvement plans which each site prepares 
each year.
The Group remains committed to both the global chemical industries’ 
Responsible Care
®
 initiative and to the principles of Sustainable 
Development (SD) as set out in the UK Chemical Industries Association 
(CIA) SD guiding principles. Responsible Care
®
 aims to improve and 
enhance the chemical industry’s SHE performance, year on year. 
Synthomer has been a signatory to Responsible Care
®
 since the 1990s and 
we remain committed to both the principles and the practice of Responsible 
Care
®
. All Synthomer sites are required to adhere to these principles and 
actively support the Group’s efforts to achieve continuous improvement 
in our SHE performance.
The Synthomer Group has been committed to the CIA’s SD guiding 
principles since they were published in 2005 and we use these principles 
in guiding the contents of our annual report. When the principles were 
set out, improvement targets were set for the UK chemical industry 
and we have continued to use those targets to judge our performance 
improvements, year on year. Our continuing involvement in both 
Responsible Care
®
 and Sustainable Development was conﬁrmed in 
2012 when the Chief Executive and the Chairman of the Synthomer Board 
re-signed the two sets of principles. The principles include a strong 
commitment to open reporting of environmental performance and this is 
reﬂected in this Annual Report. The SD principles, including full respect for 
the people and communities amongst whom we work, are followed by the 
Group’s sites around the world. 
Corporate social responsibility report 16 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012
The two sets of principles are used together to form the core of Synthomer plc’s 
adherence to global corporate social responsibility. The policies that we 
have in this area are being extended throughout our supply chain to 
ensure all our partners understand our rejection of practices such as the 
employment of child labour or unfair discrimination, and our acceptance 
of rights such as that to join any lawful worker’s association or trades union.
Synthomer plc set itself the target of achieving accreditation of the whole 
Company to the environmental management standard ISO 14001 by 
the end of 2014. The ﬁrst steps towards this were achieved in 2012 
by the successful accreditation of both our central environmental 
management system and a number of individual sites to a new matrix 
model. The accreditation will be extended to further sites during 2013 
and is on schedule to be completed by the end of 2014.
As noted in the discussion of our energy performance, the chemical 
industry is energy intensive and is therefore heavily affected by the need to 
reduce the release of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). In Europe the drive for 
reduction is principally set out in the European Union’s Carbon Reduction 
Commitment (CRC). This commitment requires a very signiﬁcant absolute 
reduction in carbon dioxide release over the period to 2020 and then a 
minimum of an 80% reduction by 2050. The control of other GHGs is also 
essential and for Synthomer these are almost entirely the VOCs used in our 
processes. We have for some time reported our overall GHG releases in our 
annual report and we expect to have no signiﬁcant problems in complying 
with the UK Government’s requirement for all publicly quoted companies 
to report their GHG releases from next year. Synthomer plc is committed 
to the control of all GHG releases. We continue to take low carbon energy 
(electricity) from the Stallingborough waste incinerator and remain 
committed to seeking to decarbonise our energy supply by using 
low carbon or carbon-neutral energy supply options where feasible.
Synthomer plc has been a member of FTSE4Good for a number 
of years and is committed to maintaining membership of that index.
Managing safety and environmental performance
The management of SHE performance in Synthomer has continued to 
evolve, through modiﬁcation, extension and improvement of the existing 
company systems. The focus during 2012 has been on involvement of 
staff at all levels and changes are being made in response to suggestion 
for improvements or sometimes concerns, which have come from 
Synthomer staff. However, it remains one of our principles that safety and 
environmental performance is the responsibility of all Synthomer staff and 
that all staff are expected to be responsible for their own safety and to 
take care of those around them. Likewise all staff have a role to play in the 
environmental performance of our sites, whether it is in recycling, energy 
conservation or managing their site’s environmental discharges. The 
management of safety and environmental performance is fully integrated 
into Synthomer’s management structure with all staff having responsibility 
for those who report to them.
Synthomer has two principal systems to assist in the management of SHE. 
All accidents (events which cause personal injury) and incidents (events 
which cause property damage, environmental release, cause complaints 
or result in other harm) are recorded in the Group’s AIMS (Accident and 
Incident Management System) database. AIMS has been in place for 
over 10 years and the system is used to record and categorise, and then 
to manage the investigation of all accidents and incidents. The system 
is also used to record and manage “near misses”: events or hazardous 
situations which under other circumstances could have caused an accident 
or incident. The system provides a way of tracking events and examining 
what is happening on our sites for trends or common failings.
The second system is a set of management policies, standards and 
procedures which make up the Synthomer SHE Management System 
(SHEMS). SHEMS continues to be extended to cover new areas and is 
currently being shifted to the company-wide document controller system, 
which will make it more widely available and help manage documents to 
ensure they are kept up to date. The elements of SHEMS set the standards 
sites are expected to achieve and provide guidance on how they should 
achieve those standards. SHEMS covers most areas of SHE performance 
with comprehensive coverage of the procedures Synthomer expects all 
sites to have in place. The system is now supported by guide packs: 
documents which set out the principal steps sites have to take to comply 
with SHEMS elements. Sites are expected to operate to SHEMS standards 
and procedures, or to demonstrate that they have their own equivalent 
standards and procedures already in place. 
SHE performance is always the primary duty for management at all levels 
in the Group. The practices adopted in previous years remain a cornerstone 
of our efforts towards continuous improvement in SHE performance. 
The practices include:
 SHE performance is discussed in all management meetings, as the ﬁrst 
agenda item;
 Synthomer conduct regular, in-depth SHE audits of all sites to assess 
performance and identify opportunities for improvement. The results 
of the audits are discussed both with the site involved and with wider 
management, for example at the Group Executive committee. 
An overview of the results of the audit process is reported to the 
Board at least half yearly;
 The Group AIMS system is used to collect and analyse data on all 
accidents, incidents and “near misses” on our sites. The system ensures 
that all of these are appropriately investigated, with the most serious 
or potentially serious incidents being fully investigated to root causes. 
The system is then used to ensure that the identiﬁed actions to prevent 
recurrence are put in place using an action management tracking 
system. “Lessons learned” are produced from the investigation reports 
and circulated to all sites, with a positive feedback system to ensure the 
lessons have been considered and implemented;
 Sites are expected to implement policies, procedures and practices 
in line with the Group’s SHEMS, and to provide training for all their staff 
to ensure that these are used by staff at all times. Working towards 
this Group requirement, William Blythe have introduced a competence 
management system in line with UK guidance and successfully passed 
a part ‘A’ competence check inspection by the UK regulator (HSE). 
The lessons from this will be incorporated into SHEMS during 2013;
 Key measures (leading and lagging indicators) of SHE performance 
are collected monthly or quarterly as appropriate and reported to the 
Group Executive and to the Board. This process is mirrored at company 
and site level to give management and staff a clear picture of current 
performance;
Corporate social responsibility report
continued 17 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012
Business review
 Key leading performance indicators, covering items such as inspections 
and engineering performance metrics, are collected and reported to 
senior management to assess both equipment and management 
performance. Synthomer’s internal inspections and audits are designed 
to identify bad news and ensure it gets to the top management allowing 
time to address matters before a potential incident occurs. In line with 
this key element, Stallingborough site is introducing an Asset Integrity 
Management System designed to focus attention on critical plant and 
ensure protective devices are reliably maintained. Once complete this 
system will be rolled out to all sites in the Group;
 Senior managers have SHE targets as part of their annual objectives. 
These SHE targets are cascaded to give all employees supporting 
objectives, either on an individual or a site basis; and
 Central SHE staff regularly visit sites to carry out training and 
development of key staff, to ensure all sites are aware of their legal 
obligations and current good practice, and to monitor and guide current 
SHE performance.
Health, safety and accident performance
Despite all the difﬁculties with accurate reporting and the fact that it is a 
lagging indicator, ‘over 3-day’ – or ‘Reportable’ – Lost Time Accident 
(RLTAs) rates remain a widely used comparative measure of occupational 
safety across a range of industries. Synthomer has for many years used 
RLTAs as a key measurement so it is pleasing to report a signiﬁcant 
improvement in the Group’s performance on RLTAs, with the best ever 
annual ﬁgure being achieved; beating the previous record low in 2009. 
There were 12 RLTAs in the year and the Group’s RLTA frequency rate 
dropped to below 0.23 per 100,000 hours worked for 2012 (100,000 hours 
is, very broadly, a working lifetime). A Synthomer employee was less than 
one quarter as likely to have an ‘over 3-day’ accident in 2012, than they 
were in 2000. The number of accidents resulting in less than 3 days lost 
time (LTAs) dropped from 13 in 201 1 to 8 incidents in 2012 and the all 
lost time accident rate fell to 0.37 . This compares to the most recently 
reported frequency rate for all lost time accidents quoted by the European 
Chemical Industry Confederation (Ceﬁc) in their Responsible Care report 
which is 0.66. 
The UK chemical industry remains amongst the safest manufacturing 
industries in the world and Synthomer’s objective is to achieve 
UK standard performance in all our operations around the world. 
Our target for RLTAs is to achieve a performance which is better than the 
average for CIA member companies. However our performance goals go 
beyond these more serious accidents and from 2013 we will be widening 
the range of injuries we report on annually to include all injuries requiring 
more than ﬁrst aid treatment.

Process safety and reportable safety incidents
The topic of process safety has continued to grow in importance for the 
chemical industry, exempliﬁed by the well attended conference between 
the European and American chemical industry associations in 2012, 
discussing common reporting standards for process safety incidents; 
and by the OECD publication “Corporate Governance for Process Safety” 
produced with American, European and SE Asian participation. We 
participated in the conference to ensure our understanding of the emerging 
metrics, and the OECD report was discussed at both Executive and Board 
level, culminating in a special Board session on the subject. Process safety 
failures, whilst rare given the scale of the process industries, can have 
devastating consequences, as was seen in a number of serious events 
around the world in 2012. We recognise that we have to manage the 
operation of our plants to ensure that our process safety – the set of 
procedures and practices which ensure that our processes are safe 
to operate – matches the hazards of what we do.
Because process incidents have the potential to be very damaging to 
people, plant and the environment our aim is always to have defences 
in depth to prevent serious incidents. We use our AIMS system to record 
and monitor even minor process incidents and upsets as we recognise they 
could lead to signiﬁcant incidents under different circumstances. These 
records are analysed and the lessons shared, internally and externally. 
There were two reportable chemical process safety incidents in 2012 – 
a release of methylethylketone in the Durban plant and a small ﬁre in the 
drains of the Kluang Dispersions plant. Neither caused any injury or any 
lasting environmental damage. The two other incidents noted in the graph

Process safety is a key section of SHEMS, indeed the ﬁrst section after our 
policies have been set out. The procedures in SHEMS have been written 
learning from the work done by regulators such as HSE & TÜV, international 
standards, and competent organisations such as SAFed and EEMUA. 
It has also been made a focus in the Group SHE audit, with sites now 
receiving explicit feedback on their performance in this area. We are 
developing and improving our process safety performance indicators, 
to ensure they are well understood and that they provide appropriate 
information to senior management on the workings of the process 
safety system. 
We continue to work to improve the understanding of process safety at all 
levels of the Company using the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) 
Process Safety Course. The full 5-day course is used with operations and 
engineering staff, with a 2-day course for senior managers used with the 
most senior managers in Synthomer. Two process safety training courses 
were run in-house in 2012, one in the UK and one in Germany, attended by 
staff with 9 different native languages from Europe, Africa and Asia. Staff in 
Malaysia and South Africa also attended the IChemE public courses in 
those countries. Hazard & Operability study (Hazop) training courses were 
held in Europe and Malaysia in 2012 extending process safety awareness 
through the operational teams. Process safety and Hazop training is part 
of our development programme and Synthomer intends to roll out such 
training to all relevant personnel in the organisation: two process safety 
courses and one Hazop course are currently programmed for 2013.

Occupational health & hygiene
Synthomer has a challenging goal in occupational health; to have no 
adverse impact on the health of those who work in, or live near, our 
operations, nor to those who use our products. In 2012 there was just 
one case of occupational disease reported by our sites. This was a case 
of dermatitis to a worker in the Kluang natural rubber plant. The individual 
fully recovered following relocation to alternative work within the site.
During the year we started to bring together the best of occupational health 
practice from around the Group, using learning from our Group SHE audits. 
As an example, the biological monitoring programme at our Filago site 
prompted a full medical review of this type of monitoring for all our sites, 
especially those where we have bulk storage of raw materials with high 
health hazards. All sites are expected to have systems in place to limit 
the exposure of staff to hazardous materials and these expectations are 
detailed in our occupational health standard written in conjunction with our 
medical experts. Given the nature of our chemistry, it will never be possible 
to remove all hazardous chemicals from our sites. We therefore need 
secure risk assessments to demonstrate that we are properly controlling 
potential exposure, wherever possible by engineering means, though 
always backed up by the use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment 
(PPE). To assist sites in the thorough assessment of the risk from exposure 
to chemicals hazardous to health, the Group has continued to extend the 
coverage (geographical and by substance) of our electronic assessment 
programme, which is based on the principles of the UK Control of 
Substances Hazardous to Health regulations. This system is currently 
being extended to make it available to staff in the languages used on 
their own site.
During health and safety week, all sites joined in a wide range of health 
promotion initiatives, nearly all from employee ideas. These included: 
a pedometer walking challenge at the Harlow site, concept housekeeping 
at Oss, managing stress workshops at the Durban site, and a visit to the 
German Occupational Safety Exhibition in Dortmund by Marl employees.
We were delighted to be invited to attend the launch of the CIA Sustainable 
Health Metrics Tool in April 2012. This tool has provided us with a credible 
process to assess and benchmark how well health programmes at site 
level are meeting corporate requirements. Review of the 14 key health 
performance elements will enable us to raise standards by identifying 
priorities and tracking improvements. Our aim is to explore how our sites 
manage their occupational health programmes using sustainable health 
leading indicators, and check on the health performance of our organisation 
using performance lagging indicators. We have continued to enhance our 
comprehensive range of medical arrangements for each site: staff who 
work with breathing apparatus in the UK now undergo additional medical 
surveillance to assess their ﬁtness to wear such equipment and this will be 
rolled out Group-wide. We encourage all staff to report health concerns 
which could have been caused by a work activity, and occupational health 
professionals monitor the overall health of our staff, drawing any potential 
problems to our attention whilst always respecting medical conﬁdentiality. 
With this in mind, we are committed to supporting conﬁdential health 
and well-being employee assistance programmes around the Group.  19 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012
Business review
Audit programme
Synthomer has an internal audit regime which is designed to provide 
management at all levels with an insight into the SHE and process safety 
performance of our sites. The audits use an internal team of experienced 
chemists and engineers to visit all our operating sites on a 3-year cycle. 
The audits, which incorporate a scoring system developed from the 
principles of the CIA’s Responsible Care
®
 management system, are 
demanding, with 3 or 4 auditors visiting the sites for a week long audit. In 
order to share learning, spread best practice and enhance performance, 
site managers, SHE managers and site engineers from other sites join the 
audit team to add cross-site auditing experience to the work of the central 
team. The audits include a detailed questionnaire with several hundred 
questions, covering areas from SHE policy to environmental performance, 
and from healthcare to engineering standards. The questionnaires are 
reviewed annually and modiﬁed where necessary to ensure they remain 
effective for use on all the sites in the Group, especially as operational 
practices and equipment evolve.
After the audit, the audit team produces a comprehensive report which 
includes not only their assessment of the site’s current performance but 
also a set of detailed recommendations setting out the actions which need 
to be taken by the site over the period before the next audit. These reports 
are discussed by management both to give a consistent view of the SHE 
performance of Group operations and to guide improvement plans to 
ensure improving performance across the Group. The results of the 
audits are monitored closely by the Group Executive Committee who 
are committed to achieving high standards of SHE performance on 
all Synthomer sites. An overview of the outcome of the audits is also 
discussed by the Synthomer Board.
In 2012 the audit process concentrated on the sites which had joined the 
Group over the preceding two years and by the year end all sites except 
one had been audited. In 2013 the audits will cover sites which have been 
part of the Group for a number of years. 
Asset protection and insurance inspections
The Company had no major insured losses in 2012 and this good record 
has enabled us to continue to control the costs of our insurance. This cost 
control has been aided by our property insurers having an improved 
estimation of the risk control measures which the Company has in place. 
These measures are surveyed by our property insurers in biennial insurance 
surveys carried out by their surveyors working with Synthomer’s internal 
SHE teams. They are also reviewed on a Company-wide basis in the twice 
yearly meetings held with the insurer’s risk management team to review 
the Group’s risk proﬁle and to discuss progress in dealing with any issues 
identiﬁed during the insurance surveys. The surveys and meetings are 
also useful opportunities for Synthomer to discuss current standards and 
thinking with an external team.
Regulatory affairs: REACH and GHS
Although there were no major deadlines to meet in 2012, activity to 
deal with both REACH (the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation 
and restriction of Chemicals regulations) and GHS (the UN’s Globally 
Harmonised System for chemical classiﬁcation and labelling) continued 
at a high rate throughout the year. Preparatory work continued for the next 
round of REACH registrations in 2013, though it now seems that the costs 
are likely to be lower than previously projected with only two materials 
needing to registered by our polymer companies. Work has also continued 
on integration of all the regulatory affairs work for our polymer business in 
one expert group, to ensure that consistent, accurate information is always 
available to all our customers. To facilitate this work, our global SAP system 
is being made available in a consistent form to all of our locations, the ﬁrst 
site to beneﬁt from this was Filago in Italy which went live towards the end 
of 2012. This has entailed work on ensuring the accuracy of Safety Data 
Sheets (SDS) and ensuring they align with the data on the SDS of 
raw material suppliers, across all our suppliers and across all countries. 
The beneﬁts of the work done so far will be seen as the system is rolled out 
across all sites over the next few years.
The initial implementation of GHS only applied to single chemicals, with 
mixtures not due to change until 2015 in the EU. However some countries 
outside the EU have gone for a faster introduction and materials sold 
in China, Japan and Korea, for example, will need to be labelled to 
GHS standards in 2013/14. Preparatory work for the implementation 
of GHS to mixtures – which are the majority of our polymer products – 
started in 2012 and will be a major focus for Regulatory Affairs throughout 
2013, continuing up to the 2015 deadline. 
The work of the Regulatory Affairs has impacts both inside and outside 
the company with the provision of accurate information, including SDS, 
to our customers being an essential part of our business offering. Feedback 
from customers on the information provided continues to be very good. 
The safety information stored in the systems used by our central team 
is also used to give up-to-date safety information to our operational 
employees, enabling them to ensure that proper handling systems are in 
place to handle the materials used to manufacture our products. These 
systems are currently going through an upgrade to make information 
available in multiple languages, ensuring that chemical hazard information is 
easily available in the local language of the great majority of our operational 
staff worldwide. 20 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012

Sustainable Development Performance report 
Managing our environmental responsibilities
The Synthomer Group treats its responsibility to protect the environment 
as one of our core values. Where possible we will exceed our statutory 
obligations and our revised SHE policy includes a commitment to 
“Work effectively with local regulators to ensure legal compliance and where 
technically and economically practicable exceed requirements”. We are 
also committed, as signatories to the Sustainable Development (SD) goals 
put forward by the UK Chemical Industry Association (CIA) in 2005, to 
improving our environmental performance year on year. Synthomer plc 
(as Yule Catto) has, over the past 10 years, monitored the environmental 
performance of all the Company’s site activities, and has generated 
a record of signiﬁcant improvement. In all the areas we monitor, we are 
comfortably exceeding the targets set as part of our SD commitment. This 
has been achieved by signiﬁcant investment in both process improvement 
– avoiding the production or release of environmental pollutants – and in 
abatement equipment where some releases are inevitable. Signiﬁcant 
investments required for environmental reasons in 2012 have included 
a €12 million monomer recovery plant in Kluang, initially reducing and then 
essentially eliminating the Group’s biggest VOC release, and investment in 
new or substantially improved efﬂuent treatment plant in Vietnam, Malaysia 
and the UK.
Synthomer were one of the ﬁrst signatory companies to the CIA’s 
Sustainable Development principles in 2005. Signing up to the principles 
was accompanied by the setting of demanding improvement targets 
for the Group’s environmental performance over the ﬁrst decade of the 
21st century. We have carried those targets on into a second decade as a 
benchmark against which we can measure our improvement. Achievement 
against the targets is monitored by the Synthomer Board on a quarterly 
basis and more frequently by operational management up to Group 
Executive level. Environmental management is integrated into the 
Company’s SHE Management System (SHEMS) but the commitment to 
environmental excellence is underlined by the intention to have all the sites 
at present in the Group, accredited to ISO 14001 by the end of 2014. 
Whilst the releases which are most likely to have an impact on the 
environment are recorded in the graphs presented in this report, we monitor 
a number of other measures internally. All of these other measures also 
show very signiﬁcant improvement over the last 10 years and most are 
continuing to improve year on year. As examples: our releases of nitrogen 
oxides to air have fallen by more than 70% per production tonne since 
2000; our releases of phosphorous to water have fallen by over 90% since 
2000; and our releases of heavy metals are down from 4.5 gm/tonne to 
0.096 gm/tonne, a better than 97% reduction. These have been achieved 
by investment in better systems for environmental control; the development 
of better processes; better process control focusing on avoiding releases 
and other losses; and incremental improvement in the operational systems 
on our sites. All of this is underpinned by the performance of our site staff, 
who have driven improvement and whose aims are to produce better 
quality product, using more carefully husbanded resources, whilst 
producing less waste.
This record of success is reﬂected in the formally reported SD measures, 
all but two of which improved in 2012 and all of which have improved very 
considerably since 2000. All of the SD targets set for the Group have been 
comfortably bettered. The two cases where the Group performed less well 
in 2012 compared with 201 1 were water usage and the production of 
nitrous oxides (NOx) which increased for the second year in a row. In 2012 
the Group improved its energy performance and regained its long-term 
trend. For our continuing operations waste production per tonne of product 
was down as quality and ‘right ﬁrst time’ production improved. On VOCs 
there was a signiﬁcant decrease (21%) in the absolute quantity released 
despite an 8% increase in production tonnage compared to 201 1.
EPDLA LCI project
The European Polymer Dispersion and Latex Association (EPDLA) is 
a focused interest group which operates under the auspices of Ceﬁc, 
the confederation of the European chemical industry. EPDLA undertook 
an intensive study in 1999 to calculate the carbon footprint of the polymers 
being produced by the group’s members. The study has been repeated 
as a full Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) study over the last couple of years and 
Synthomer has contributed to the new study, as constituent companies 
of Synthomer did to the original study. The methodology of the LCI study 
was set by PwC, who also provided external validation. This was a detailed 
study and required a very high quantity and quality of data with all the major 
producers in Europe contributing to the project. Coverage was between 
55% and 70% of the European tonnage produced, varying slightly by 
product family.
The study found that the main contributors to the environmental impact of 
the polymers being produced are the monomers used in their manufacture. 
Monomers account for 80-90% of the total impact for both global warming 
potential and total primary energy content of the polymers produced. 
This was true for all the polymer groups studied, whether based on 
styrene, butadiene, acrylics or vinyl acetate; environmentally the impact 
of the different polymer groups was not distinguishable. However, the 
environmental impact of the polymers studied had reduced signiﬁcantly 
since the ﬁrst study: a 5% reduction in overall global warming potential since 
1999; and even higher reductions in the total primary energy used, ranging 
from a 15% reduction for SBR polymers to 20% for pure acrylic or vinyl 
acetate polymers. For Synthomer in particular, the LCI study showed that 
our products gave results which are either better than or at the same level 
as the industrial average. This positive result for Synthomer is no reason 
for complacency and we continue to work on reducing our future 
environmental impact both as an end in itself and to keep up with 
improvements in our industry in general.  21 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012
Business review
Energy
By its nature the chemical industry is a heavy energy user, though as the 
Ceﬁc sponsored study discussed above has shown, the carbon footprint 
of our products is dominated by the energy embedded in the monomers 
we use. Not withstanding this, energy use by the Group remains a key 
performance indicator and we continue to target a 4% improvement in 
speciﬁc energy consumption year on year. Speciﬁc energy consumption 
in 2012 was helped by the different technologies brought into the Group 
following the acquisition of PolymerLatex in 201 1, though this was partly 
offset by lower production volumes on some sites. Overall, speciﬁc energy 
consumption across the Synthomer Group fell by 3.5% compared with 
201 1, and was 13.7% lower than in 2010. The long-term trend shows the 
Group used less than half the energy per tonne that was used in 2001. 
Consumption in 2012 was 38% better than the extrapolated 2012 target. 
It should be noted that the Group’s energy consumption quoted here 
includes allowances for energy embedded in site services such as 
compressed air or cooling water when these are bought in rather than 
generated by our own plant.
Despite the improvements achieved, the cost of energy remains a 
signiﬁcant challenge to Synthomer. Synthomer achieved an 1 1% reduction 
in the cost of energy per tonne of production compared to 201 1. The most 
signiﬁcant energy cost is electricity which accounts for 43% of the Group’s 
total energy bill. 
The reduction in speciﬁc energy use has improved the Group’s carbon 
dioxide (CO
2
) emissions per tonne and this is reﬂected in the global 
warming burden discussed below. The CO
2
 release ﬁgure quoted in the 
environmental KPI section includes both direct release from carbon fuels 
burned on site and the calculated release from electricity consumed 
(including that embedded in site services).
In line with DEFRA advice and as in previous years, releases of CO
2
 from 
electricity generation have assumed generation efﬁciency and CO
2
 releases 
rates in line with the average for the UK national grid. However, in line 
with our goal of decarbonising the Group’s energy use, we are exploring 
different energy supplies with the aim of reducing CO
2
 releases faster than 
improvements in our energy consumption. To this end we have signed 
a long-term contract to buy electricity from Drax power station in the UK 
which already uses over a million tonnes of biomass as fuel, reducing its net 
CO
2
 production by nearly 2 million tonnes in 201 1. Drax will fully convert one 
of its six combustion units to biomass in 2013, reducing their net releases. 
We also recognise that the electricity supplies we use in different countries 
have different thermal efﬁciencies and rates of CO
2
 production. In line with 
the UK Government’s requirement for full reporting of Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) Emissions from next year, we are exploring more accurate ways of 
calculating our GHG emissions, given the wide range of countries in which 
we operate.
In December 2012, Langelsheim (Germany) successfully gained 
certiﬁcation for their energy management system through the DIN EN 
50001 Energy Management Standard. The goals of the standard are to 
increase overall energy efﬁciency using a systematic approach to energy 
management across the site. Langelsheim is the ﬁrst of a number of sites 
seeking this accreditation.

Global warming
There are two signiﬁcant releases from Synthomer companies which 
contribute to global warming: CO
2
 released during energy generation; 
and the release of VOCs. The improvement in energy consumption has 
been discussed above and this led to a 4.6% improvement in CO
2
 releases 
per tonne of product. Total VOC releases reduced by 21% for 2012 
compared with 201 1, partly due to the closure of the Stallingborough Latex 
plant which was the second largest emitter of VOC in the Group, and partly 
due to reductions in the releases from the Latex plant in Kluang. The 
combination of these two improvements meant that the global warming 
burden of the Group’s activities improved in 2012 by some 8%, giving the 
Group its best ever performance for the second year running. Overall 
performance was 65% better than in 2001 and the Group was 28% below 
the extrapolated target for 2012. 
After examining different options, a scheme to recover a large proportion of 
the VOCs released from the NBR plant at Kluang was developed in 2010/1 1 
and the equipment was installed in 2012. This equipment, costing some 
€12 million, is now being commissioned and is designed to recover over 
65% of the VOCs being released by the Kluang NBR plant. This will lead to 
very signiﬁcant further reductions in VOC release during 2013, once the 
recovery plant is running. This scheme will be followed, hopefully also during 
2013, by a further scheme which will burn the residual VOCs with full energy 
recovery, to give a plant with low overall VOC releases. 22 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012

NB – The releases of VOCs from the Kluang NBR plant were incorrectly calculated 
and signiﬁcantly overstated in 2011. The ﬁgures have been recalculated and are 
now given on a consistent basis, both in the data table at the end of this section 
and in the graph above.
Atmospheric acidiﬁcation
Having already achieved such large reductions in atmospheric emission of 
acid gases, further reductions are becoming harder to achieve. Our direct 
emissions are now almost entirely sulphur oxides either from burning oil 
for steam raising, or from using diesel fuel to generate electricity in areas 
where the grid supply is not reliable. This means that our performance is 
signiﬁcantly dependent on matters beyond our control. However, by using 
low sulphur fuels and because electrical supplies were more reliable in 
2012 emissions were again reduced. The amount of sulphur dioxide (SO
2
) 
fell by over 25% compared to 201 1 to a little over 8 tonnes in total for the 
year. This is less than one third of the ﬁgure for 2010 and the Group’s 
emissions of SO
2
 per tonne of production are now 0. 13% of what they 
were in 2000 and 0.3% of the extrapolated 2012 target.

Water use
Water consumption across the Synthomer Group saw a slight increase 
from 201 1, increasing by 2.6% compared to the year before on a per tonne 
of product basis. However this slight rise still gave the second best 
performance ever, nearly 25% better than 2010 which was then the Group’s 
best. The increase reﬂects the change in product mix during 2012, with the 
closures of Mouscron and of Latex production in Stallingborough, and the 
start of transfer of production from the Batley site. On the other hand, many 
of the Company’s sites continued to reduce their annual consumption 
during 2012. Water use per tonne of production has reduced by nearly 
two thirds since 2000 (63% reduction) and is less than 50% of the 
extrapolated target for 2012. Despite the slight increase in usage, 
the cost of water fell by 2% overall.
Water remains a vital resource for society as a whole and for industrial 
development. For our operations water is vital to our production processes, 
both to provide safety in reactor operation and as an essential part of 
our polymer dispersion products. We are fortunate that most of our 
plants operate in areas where water supply is not currently signiﬁcantly 
constrained, and where rainfall is relatively abundant. On our Kluang, 
Malaysia site we have an on-site water collection system which provides 
the great majority of our water. Given the increasing production on this 
site and previously unexpected dry periods, the on-site supply has been 
strengthened by the provision of boreholes and a piped supply from 
off-site sources.
Two sites in particular operate in areas with constrained water supply, 
Dammam (Saudi Arabia) and Durban (South Africa). Dammam now relies 
on external piped water, which occasionally has to be supplemented 
by water in tankers, and in Durban increasing population and rising living 
standards are putting pressures on the available supply. We also recognise 
that existing supplies on other sites may become constrained if weather 
patterns change with global warming. The Group continues to target a 
4% reduction in water use per tonne each year and further initiatives to 
reduce water usage are underway, with trials to, for example, reduce water 
use in reactor washing, and to reuse more water on-site for cleaning or 
other purposes.

Waste disposal
The total amount of hazardous waste produced in 2012 was markedly less 
than in 201 1, reducing by over 46% despite production increasing by 8%. 
Of this hazardous waste, 57% was able to be recycled, recovered, or burnt 
as a fuel – in a cement kiln for example. The most difﬁcult of the remaining 
hazardous wastes have to be incinerated, which is energy consuming and 
can be environmentally unpopular. In 2012, the amount needing incineration 
was reduced by 3,387 tonnes (66%) despite the increased production 
compared with 201 1. The absolute quantity of hazardous waste sent to 
landﬁll was only ~20% of the 2002 amount, despite production having 
more than doubled.

10 year target Actual
The absolute quantity of non-hazardous waste produced fell by 20% 
in 2012 and the speciﬁc quantity is now less than 10% of the quantity 
disposed of to landﬁll in 2000. This has been achieved through recycling, 
recovery and reuse of waste materials. 
The use of imaginative, environmentally friendly disposal routes has been 
so successful that for a number of Synthomer’s sites the net production 
of waste is now zero – all their waste is recovered, recycled or reused. 
The lessons learned by these sites are being shared with other sites in the 
Synthomer Group, to reduce the quantity of waste requiring ﬁnal disposal 
still further.
Unfortunately, in the UK, the previously composted polymer waste from 
the Stallingborough site is now going for municipal treatment following 
the UK Environment Agency’s decision to remove the permit to recycle 
this material. This decision is being actively discussed with the authorities 
and it is hoped that recycling will be resumed during 2013.

Environmental incidents
The number of environmental incidents which were reportable to the 
authorities and led to a release of material to the environment was 14 in 
2012, an increase on previous years. All of the incidents were associated 
with the operation of the two Efﬂuent Treatment Plants (ETPs), which 
service the Company’s site in Kluang, Malaysia. None of the incidents were 
found to have caused more than transitory environmental harm. These two 
plants have been under-performing for some time and they have each been 
the subject of a signiﬁcant upgrade during the year. On the site’s NBR plant, 
the investment has focused on the monomer recovery plant (discussed 
earlier under VOC releases) which will signiﬁcantly reduce the pressure 
on the ETP , especially by removing acrylonitrile residues from the water 
to be treated. The second ETP , which serves the rest of the site, has had 
to deal with a very diverse inﬂow and investment has focused on better 
pre-treatment at individual plant level. Both of these investments were 
completed in late 2012 and will be commissioned in early 2013; 
improvements should be seen over the next year. 
Other environmental projects in 2012 included the completion of a new 
combined chemical and biological ETP at Synthomer’s Vietnam plant, 
to meet tightened release limits to the local environment. This plant is 
currently being fully commissioned. Additional solid separation was also 
commissioned in Stallingborough to reduce COD loading on that site’s ETP . 
The new ETP planned for the Company’s Durban site was again delayed, 
but the site operated within its consent limits throughout the year. A new 
ETP for the Dammam site in Saudi Arabia is currently being constructed 
and will come into operation in the ﬁrst half of 2013.
There were a number of smaller, non-reportable environmental incidents 
during the year, which caused no environmental damage but which were 
reported internally and investigated to determine their cause. In each case 
appropriate preventive or mitigation measures were put in place to prevent 
any future environmental harm.

Environmental KPIs
The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) published guidelines for reporting environmental key performance indicators in 
2006. The key measures suggested were energy use, emissions to air, waste disposal and water consumption, on an absolute and a per tonne basis. 
Synthomer has reported on these indicators for a number of years, and to aid transparency in environmental reporting we adopted DEFRA’s preferred 
format in 2008 for the report on our 2007 performance. This format is used in the table below which gives the data for the period 2010-2012.

Employment policies
The Group gives every consideration to applications for employment 
from disabled persons. Employees who become disabled are given every 
opportunity to continue employment under normal terms and conditions 
with appropriate training, career development and promotion wherever 
possible. The Group seeks to achieve equal opportunities in employment 
through recruitment and training policies.
Authority to purchase own shares 
The Company has a general authority, which expires at the conclusion of 
the 2013 Annual General Meeting, to make market purchases of not more 
than 33,988,076 of the Company’s ordinary shares in accordance with the 
terms of the special resolution passed at the 2012 Annual General Meeting. 
A resolution will be tabled at the 2013 Annual General Meeting to renew 
this authority.
Employee involvement
The Group encourages employee involvement in its affairs and makes 
use of an intranet system to promote such involvement and to aid 
communication with employees. The Group is currently implementing a 
project in order to establish whether its current communication procedures 
can be improved. An annual management conference is held to bring 
senior managers together to share ideas and develop policy and values. 
Dialogue takes place regularly with employee representative groups to 
make employees aware of the ﬁnancial and economic factors affecting 
the performance of the Group. Performance related bonus schemes are 
in operation throughout the Group.
A new long-term share incentive plan for directors and senior executives 
was introduced in 201 1 with the approval of shareholders.
UK pension funds
The trustees have reviewed the independent investment management 
of the assets of the Company pension schemes in the UK and assured 
themselves of the security and controls in place. In particular, it is the 
trustees’ policy not to invest in Synthomer plc shares nor lend money 
to the Company.
Creditor payment policy
The Group’s policy is to make payments to creditors and other suppliers 
in accordance with terms of payment agreed at the time the contract of 
supply is made, subject to all the terms and conditions of the order being 
satisﬁed by the supplier. The Company signed up to the UK Prompt 
Payment code in January 2013. Trade creditor days of the Company for 
the year ended 31 December 2012 were 22 days (201 1 28 days) based 
on the ratio of trade creditors at the year end to the amounts invoiced during 
the year by trade creditors.
Charitable donations
Charitable donations in the year amounted to £62,000 (201 1 £53,500). 
There were no political donations during the year (201 1 £nil).
Statement as to disclosure of information to auditor
Each director of the Company conﬁrms that, so far as he is aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware and that he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as 
a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information. 
For these purposes, relevant audit information means information needed 
by the Company’s auditor in connection with preparing their reports on 
pages 41 and 79. 
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with 
Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Corporate governance
The Corporate governance report is set out on pages 30 to 34 and forms 
part of the report of the directors.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The directors have appropriately considered the Group’s principal risks 
and uncertainties including the following:
 Conditions in the global economy, economic ﬂuctuations in customer 
industries and volatility and cyclicality of the global chemicals and 
polymers markets may adversely affect the results of operations, 
ﬁnancial condition and cash ﬂows of the Group;
 Volatility in raw material prices and energy prices may adversely 
affect the proﬁtability of the Group and its working capital position;
 The failure of the Group to procure key raw materials may lead to 
production interruptions that may adversely affect the proﬁtability 
of the Group and its working capital position;
 The markets in which the Group operates are highly competitive 
and the Group may lose market share to other producers or sellers 
of water-based polymers or to other products that can be substituted 
for the products of the Group;
 The Group operates in a number of different geographies which may 
present different legal and regulatory risks. In addition, the Group 
operates in a number of different tax regimes, which may increase 
the volatility of the effective tax rate and cash tax rate of the Group;
 The ability of the Group to compete is highly dependent on its ability 
to develop technological innovations, to introduce new products and 
to protect its intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how. Failure 
to do so could have an adverse affect on the Group; 
 The Group may be liable for damages based on product liability claims 
brought against its customers in end-use markets. In addition, 
compliance with extensive environmental, health and safety laws and 
regulations could require material expenditure, changes in the operations 
of the Group or site remediation;
 The manufacture, storage and transportation of chemicals is inherently 
dangerous and any incidents relating to the hazards which the Group 
faces may adversely affect its ﬁnancial condition, results of operations 
and reputation;
 Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may signiﬁcantly impact the 
results of the operations of the Group and may signiﬁcantly affect the 
comparability of ﬁnancial results between ﬁnancial periods;
 Credit market conditions and credit ratings may restrict the ability of the 
Group to obtain credit facilities or to reﬁnance its existing debt facilities 
in the longer term. In addition, interest rate ﬂuctuations and increases 
in bank lending margins may increase the Group’s costs of borrowing 
in the longer term; and 
 The Group has funding risks relating to deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes 
and any deterioration in the value of assets in which the pension scheme 
has invested as against the ﬁnancial obligations to make payments to 
members of the schemes could have an adverse affect on the Group.
Report of the directors 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 29 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012
 Governance 
Not all these risks can be managed or substantially mitigated. The Group 
has a number of key processes to effect reduction and some mitigation 
of operational risks where reasonably practical, including:
 Active management processes to manage margins and recover input 
cost increases from customers;
 Sourcing strategies to access multiple sources for key raw materials;
 Actively managed innovation processes;
 Product quality control and testing processes;
 A centralised internal audit function dedicated to SHE issues, and 
programmes for continuous improvement across all major 
SHE areas; and 
 Internal audit and business performance review processes, the format 
of which were enhanced in 2012.
Financial risks are partly mitigated through currency and interest rate 
hedging and the Group has a policy on leverage limits and seeks to ensure 
it has adequate borrowing headroom on a twelve month forecast basis.
Going concern
The directors have acknowledged the latest guidance on going concern 
and in reaching their conclusions have taken into account factors including:
 the Group’s euro denominated £150 million term loan facility and 
£60 million multicurrency revolving credit facility the termination dates 
of which were extended from 13 December 2013 to 31 March 2015 
on 22 December 201 1.
 the second repayment under the 2004 series private placement notes 
of US$70 million due in September 2014.
Further discussion on liquidity and ﬁnancing is provided in the Financial 
review.
After making enquiries and taking account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, the directors have concluded that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the annual report and accounts.
Key performance indicators
Management monitors a number of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial key 
performance indicators, which are disclosed within the Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer’s report, the Financial review and Corporate social responsibility 
report. These key performance indicators include divisional sales and 
underlying operating proﬁt, net borrowings, reportable safety incidents, 
energy usage and water consumption.
Cautionary statement
The purpose of this report is to provide information to the members of 
the Company. It contains certain forward-looking statements with respect 
to the operations, performance and ﬁnancial condition of the Group. 
By their nature, these statements involve uncertainty since future events 
and circumstances can cause results and developments to differ materially 
from those anticipated. The forward-looking statements reﬂect knowledge 
and information available at the date of preparation of this report and the 
Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking 
statements. Nothing in this report should be construed as a proﬁt forecast.
Independent auditors
A resolution to appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s 
auditor will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting 
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 1 1.00 am on 
Thursday 16 May 2013 at Manor of Groves Hotel, High Wych,

Report from the Chairman
Dear Shareholder
As well as achieving a second successive year of record proﬁtability 2012 
also saw an enhancement in our standards of corporate governance.
I succeeded Peter Wood as Chairman of the Board in May 2012 and 
during the course of the year three new independent non-executive 
directors were recruited to regain Board balance following the retirement 
of Peter and Sandy Dobbie at the 2012 Annual General Meeting. The 
appointment of Just Jansz, Ishbel Macpherson and Jinya Chen widened 
the general diversity, skills and business background of the Board and 
I was delighted to welcome them to the Company. Ishbel Macpherson 
has subsequently announced her intention not to stand for election at 
the forthcoming AGM. 
Our chairman of the Audit Committee, Jez Maiden, highlights the work of 
that Committee later in this report which included a tender process for the 
Group’s audit services and implementation of an internal audit programme. 
I took over as chairman of the Remuneration Committee in February 2013 
and a report on all matters relating to remuneration and the work 
performed in 2012 under the chairmanship of Sandy and subsequently 
Ishbel is also set out separately. Considerable work will be required 
in 2013 to adapt to the new UK government proposals for reforming 
directors’ remuneration and associated reporting and I will oversee the 
implementation of these important changes.
The Nomination Committee, which I have chaired since March 2012, 
had a very busy year as a result of the recruitment referred to above. 
The Committee will now manage the process for the appointment of 
a further independent non-executive director following the vacancy that 
will arise in May and will seek to ensure that an appropriate mix of skills, 
experience and diversity is maintained.
There is little compulsory change required to corporate governance 
reporting for 2012 however your Board is monitoring closely the signiﬁcant 
developments which are expected to impact on reporting for 2013. 
As a number of these developments still require ﬁnalisation we have only 
adopted the anticipated changes to a limited extent in this year’s annual 
report. 2012 is the last year in which we report against the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (“the Code”) which was published in June 2010 by the 
Financial Reporting Council following the publication of a revised Code in 
September 2012 which is applicable to our reporting for 2013.
Our full statements on compliance and the application of the main 
principles of the Code are set out in the following sections of this report.
Neil Johnson
Chairman
Statement of compliance
The Company considers that it has complied throughout the ﬁnancial year 
ended 31 December 2012 with the provisions set out in the Code except 
in relation to the composition of the Board and its Nomination Committee. 
Further details on these matters are set out in this report.
Application of the Code
The main principles of the Code were applied as follows:
Leadership and effectiveness
Operation of the Board
The activities of the Company are controlled by the Board which, 
during 2012, comprised two executive directors and seven to eight 
non-executive directors. In anticipation of the retirement of Mr P S Wood 
and Dr A A Dobbie at the 2012 Annual General Meeting and the 
appointment of Mr N A Johnson as Chairman three new independent 
non-executive directors were recruited during the course of the year: 
Dr J J C Jansz, Ms I J S Macpherson and Mr J Chen. The roles of 
Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer are clearly divided between 
Mr Johnson who heads the Board in his capacity as non-executive 
Chairman and Mr A M Whitﬁeld who has responsibility for the running 
of the Company’s business as Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. The non-executive 
directors all have wide business and boardroom experience gained in 
a broad range of business sectors.
The Board has reserved to itself a schedule of matters which includes 
setting long-term objectives for the Group and the strategies to be 
employed in achieving them, setting policies in the areas of safety, health 
and the environment, recruitment and employment, risk management 
and treasury and, subject to materiality thresholds, decisions on the raising 
of capital, ﬁnancial commitments, capital expenditure, acquisitions and 
disposals and the prosecution, defence and settlement of litigation.
During 2012 the Board held six scheduled meetings to review current and 
projected performance and to determine strategic issues. The directors 
receive in advance full information on all matters to be discussed at Board 
meetings as well as a detailed review of performance prepared by the 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. The Board has established Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration committees which are discussed below.
In addition arrangements are made each year for the Board to visit 
up to two of the Group’s operational sites and meet local management. 
Ad hoc site visits are facilitated for individual non-executive directors 
on request. During 2012 the Board held a meeting at the ofﬁces of its 
Malaysian businesses in Kuala Lumpur. In conjunction with that Board 
meeting presentations were given by local senior management and the 
directors visited the Group’s Malaysian plants.
The Board has delegated to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer responsibility for 
the development and preparation of the business plan for the Group and 
the annual Group budget for recommendation to the Board. As the senior 
executive director, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is responsible for all aspects 
of day-to-day operational control of the Group and execution of the Group 
strategy. The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer has established and chairs an 
Executive Committee (whose other members are the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, 
the Chief Operating Ofﬁcer, the Chief Counsel and Company Secretary, 
the Vice President – Human Resources, the Vice President – Europe, 
Middle East & Africa, the Vice President – South East Asia, the Vice 
President – Finance and the Vice President Operational Excellence & 
Engineering) to assist him in the performance of his duties and which 
meets once a month. The Chairman has available to him the minutes of the 
Executive Committee and all directors receive a monthly trading summary 
and commentary from the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and an update report from 
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer.

Board membership and balance
The Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Senior Independent Director 
are identiﬁed on page 26. The Chairmen and members of the Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees are identiﬁed below. The Board 
considers Mr J K Maiden, Dr J J C Jansz, Ms I J S Macpherson and 
Mr J Chen are independent in accordance with the provisions of the Code.
For some ﬁve months of 2012 the Company was not in compliance with 
the requirement of Code provision B.1.2 for half the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, to comprise independent non-executive directors. Following 
completion of a recruitment exercise in 2012 which culminated with the 
appointment of Mr J Chen in October 2012 the Board returned to 
compliance with this requirement.
The Board held a total of six meetings in 2012. In addition the Chairman 
held one separate meeting with the non-executive directors without the 
executive directors being present to appraise the performance of the 
executive management. The non-executive directors also met once 
without the Chairman to appraise his performance.
The table below shows the number of meetings of the Board, Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees held during the year and the 
number of meetings attended by each director. Where a director is unable 
to attend a Board or Committee meeting his views on agenda items are 
canvassed in advance of the meeting and incorporated into the discussions.

Induction and training
Induction arrangements are in place in order to ensure new directors 
receive a full formal and tailored induction on appointment. The Chairman 
reviews and agrees the training and development needs of the directors 
and the skills and knowledge of the Board as a whole are updated by 
brieﬁngs provided by the Company’s internal resources and materials 
and seminars offered by external advisers.
Performance evaluation
Performance evaluations of the Board, its committees and its directors 
were carried out in the last year by the following internal processes:
 an assessment of the performance of individual non-executive 
directors is carried out by the Chairman through a rolling programme 
of one-to-one discussions using performance evaluation questions as 
the centrepiece for those discussions. Every non-executive director is 
assessed in this way once a year; 
 the performance of the executive directors was reviewed in August 2012 
at a meeting of the non-executive directors chaired by the Chairman; 
 a meeting of the non-executive directors (in the absence of the 
Chairman) chaired by the Senior Independent Director was held in 
November 2012 to evaluate the performance of the Chairman, taking into 
account the views of the executive directors; and 
 the Board and its Committees carry out an annual self-assessment of 
performance led by the Chairman and the Chairman of each committee 
respectively. The results of assessment questionnaires completed by 
those Chairmen were reviewed by the relevant committees and the 
Board and were shared with and discussed by the Board as a whole 
at its meeting in November 2012 and January 2013. 
2012 saw signiﬁcant change to the Board’s composition with a 
strengthening of its effectiveness and a widening of its skills, business 
background and general diversity. Due to this change it was considered 
that it would be too early to consider the introduction of an externally 
facilitated Board evaluation process during 2012.
Non-executive directors are appointed for three-year terms. All directors 
submit themselves for annual election at each Annual General Meeting.
Board committees
The Board has formally established Nomination, Audit, and Remuneration 
Committees, each with their own terms of reference which set out their 
respective roles and the authority delegated to them by the Board. Copies 
of the terms of reference are available upon request from the Company 
Secretary and can also be downloaded from the Company’s website. 
Since 17 May 2012 the Nomination Committee has not complied with 
the composition requirements of Code Provision B.2.1. in that a majority 
of its members were not independent non-executive directors. The Board 
considers that the current composition of the Nomination Committee 
provides it with the ﬂexibility and speed of decision making that is necessary 
in connection with the interview process required for making nominations 
to ﬁll Board vacancies. Accordingly the Board does not currently intend to 
make any changes to the composition of this Committee. All non-executive 
directors have a standing invitation to attend Committee meetings unless 
they are notiﬁed otherwise.  32 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012
Audit Committee
Dear Shareholder
During 2012 the Committee carried out substantial work in connection 
with the provision of the Group’s external audit services and internal 
audit processes.
As the external auditor had been in place since 2002 and their appointment 
was last reviewed in 2009 it was decided that 2012 was an appropriate 
point at which to put the Group’s audit services contract out to tender. 
The Committee oversaw the tender process which was initiated in 
April 2012 and conducted by senior ﬁnancial management and involved 
formal proposals and presentations from three audit ﬁrms. Following a 
rigorous process which took into account qualiﬁcation, expertise, 
resources, independence and value for money the Committee’s 
recommendation to the Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be 
appointed was accepted and the appointment was made on 12 July 2012. 
There were no contractual obligations that acted to restrict the Committee’s 
recommendation. I would like to thank the outgoing auditors, Deloitte LLP , 
for their service over the last ten years and welcome on your behalf 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our new auditor.
Following an assessment of the effectiveness of the 2012 audit carried 
out by way of a review and discussion with the external audit team and 
the Company’s senior ﬁnancial management the Committee is pleased 
to recommend to you that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be appointed 
as auditor at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
As anticipated in the 201 1 Audit Committee report a formalised programme 
of outsourced internal audit services managed by a member of the 
Company’s senior ﬁnancial management was put into operation from 
the beginning of 2012. The Committee approved the appointment of 
KPMG (UK) LLP at the end of 201 1 as the provider of the outsourced 
services and agreed a three year work plan with reports to be made to 
the Committee twice a year. The ﬁrst year of the programme has worked 
well with all the businesses acquired as part of the PolymerLatex 
acquisition in 201 1 being the subject of internal audit reports in 2012. 
The second year of the programme will be rolled out in 2013 and is being 
supplemented, as it was in 2012, by operational review visits performed 
by senior ﬁnancial management.
The Committee also covered the other matters delegated to it by the 
Board under its remit during the course of the year and these are reported 
on in the following section of this report.
Finally I would like to thank my fellow Committee members whose 
details are set out below for their support and look forward to working 
with Alex Catto who joined the Committee this month.

The role of the Audit Committee
Throughout 2012 the Audit Committee was chaired by Mr J K Maiden 
and comprised three independent non-executive directors. Mr Maiden is 
considered by the Board to have ‘recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience’ 
for the purposes of Provision C.3. 1 of the Code due to his current ﬁnancial 
position outside the Group. The Committee has established a detailed 
remit regarding the application of ﬁnancial reporting and internal control 
principles, which covers:
 monitoring the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements of the Group and any 
formal announcements relating to the Group’s ﬁnancial performance and 
reviewing signiﬁcant ﬁnancial reporting judgements contained in them; 
 reviewing the Group’s internal ﬁnancial controls and the Group’s internal 
control and risk management systems; 
 monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit 
function;
 making recommendations to the Board regarding the appointment 
of the external auditor and approving their remuneration and terms 
of engagement;
 reviewing and monitoring the external auditor’s independence 
and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process; and
 developing and implementing policy on the engagement of the 
external auditor to supply non-audit services.
The Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and senior members of his department attend 
meetings of the Committee as part of the review of the Group’s interim 
and annual ﬁnancial statements prior to their submission to the Board. 
The Committee meets periodically with the Company’s auditor without 
management present to discuss the adequacy of the Group’s ﬁnancial 
management, internal controls and information systems and to review the 
terms of their engagement, effectiveness, independence and objectivity. 
With regard to seeking to ensure the independence and objectivity of 
the auditor, the Audit Committee’s policy is to avoid the auditor providing 
services in areas which may create or be perceived to create a conﬂict of 
interest. Accordingly, other than in circumstances where time constraints 
render it impractical or assignments are of a minor nature, the auditor is not 
invited to tender or propose for services of the following nature: corporate 
ﬁnance, legal, information technology and systems, recruitment or 
remuneration, accounting, internal audit or control, acquisition due 
diligence, valuations or appraisals, actuarial or general business consulting. 
In addition the auditor has been requested not to provide services to 
executive directors or senior executives except where approved by the 
Audit Committee. Non-executive directors are required to disclose any 
relationship they have with the auditor. Prior to appointment in July 2012 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were providing and have continued to 
provide personal tax advice to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and expatriate tax 
services to the Group’s senior managers who are required to work outside 
their home country. The Committee do not consider that the provision of 
these services creates any conﬂict of interest as they are of a minor nature 
and are provided by individuals and teams who are not involved in the audit 
and accordingly have approved their continuation.
Details of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor in 2012 are set out 
in note 6 on page 56. Non-audit fees principally relate to tax compliance 
and tax advisory services.

Governance
The Committee met formally 4 times during 2012 and carried out 
the following main activities in addition to the items mentioned in the 
Chairman’s overview:
 Reviewed the ﬁnancial statements in the 201 1 annual report and 
the 2012 interim statement; 
 Reviewed the scope and effectiveness of the external audit; 
 Monitored the effectiveness of the internal controls and risk 
management; 
 Received reports from the external auditor on the major ﬁndings 
of its work; 
 Approved the annual audit plan; 
 Reviewed its remit; and
 Reviewed the Group’s whistleblowing arrangements.
In addition the Chairman of the Committee had regular dialogue with 
the auditor during the course of the year.
Nomination Committee
The composition of the Nomination Committee since 1 January 2012 
has been as follows:
Neil Johnson (Chairman since 17 May 2012)
Jez Maiden
Adrian Whitﬁeld
Peter Wood (until 17 May 2012 and Chairman until that date)
Sandy Dobbie (until 17 May 2012)
The Committee is responsible for: the regular review of the structure, size 
and composition of the Board and the making of recommendations with 
regard to any changes; leading the process for Board appointments 
and nominating candidates for non-executive positions; and considering 
succession planning.
The Committee led the process for nominating Dr J J C Jansz, 
Ms I J S Macpherson and Mr J Chen for appointment as independent 
non-executive directors. This process involved a thorough review 
of a range of candidates put forward by an independent recruitment 
consultancy, which conducted an extensive search process. The diversity 
(including gender) of the Board was taken into account by the Committee 
when making nominations.
The Committee also reviewed senior management succession planning 
within the Group during the course of the year.
The Nomination Committee held one formal meeting during 2012 and 
a number of informal meetings and telephone calls as well as numerous 
interviews in connection with the nomination process referred to above.
The Board adopted a policy on diversity in March 2013. This policy seeks 
to ensure that diversity in its broadest sense is taken into account in the 
process of making appointments on merit against objective selection 
criteria. Copies of the policy are available at www.synthomer.com.
Remuneration Committee
All matters relating to the Remuneration Committee and remuneration 
are covered in the Remuneration report, set out on pages 35 to 39.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with institutional investors is conducted on a regular basis by the 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and meetings take 
place following the announcement of interim and full year results and at 
other times according to circumstances.
The Board has adopted a set of shareholder communication principles 
in order to ensure that Board members develop an understanding of the 
views of the Group’s major shareholders. These principles require the 
Chairman to be present with the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the Chief 
Financial Ofﬁcer at sufﬁcient shareholder presentations and meetings 
that he fully understands the issues and concerns of major shareholders.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer reports on shareholder relations at each 
Board meeting. Communications with shareholders relating to corporate 
governance matters are conducted by the Chairman with the assistance 
of the Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees. 
Written reports on all meetings between non-executive directors and 
institutional shareholders and their representative bodies are presented 
to the Board at the ﬁrst opportunity following such meetings as is all 
correspondence with them.
The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they have 
concerns which contact through the normal channels of the Chairman or 
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer has failed to resolve or for which such contact 
is inappropriate.
The Board seeks to encourage participation of all shareholders, and in 
particular private investors, at the Company’s Annual General Meeting and 
endeavours to ensure all Board members are in attendance. In particular, 
the Chairmen of the Remuneration, Audit and Nomination Committees 
are available to answer questions.
The Company makes use of its website www.synthomer.com to 
communicate with its shareholders where it publishes interim and full year 
results, Company announcements, share price and corporate governance 
and other investor information.
Accountability
An explanation of the directors’ responsibility for preparing the 
ﬁnancial statements, their report that the business is a going concern, 
a responsibility statement and their statement as to disclosure of information 
to the auditor are set out on pages 40 and 28 respectively. Statements by 
the auditor about its reporting responsibilities are set out on pages 41 and 
79 respectively.
A report on the approach to internal control is set out below. The directors 
endeavour to make the annual report and ﬁnancial statements as 
informative and understandable as possible.
Internal control
The Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and sets appropriate policies to ensure that the Code 
requirements on internal control are met. The system of internal control 
deployed within the Group is designed to reduce the risks of failure to 
meet business objectives, but these risks cannot be eliminated. The internal 
control system adopted can therefore only provide reasonable, not 
absolute, assurance about meeting such business objectives or against 
material mis-statement or loss.
The Group’s internal controls over the ﬁnancial reporting and consolidation 
processes are designed under the supervision of the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting 
and the preparation and fair presentation of the Group’s published ﬁnancial 
statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with IFRS. 34 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing signiﬁcant 
business risks faced by the Group has been in place since 2000. 
This has since been built upon so as to embed further the process into 
the businesses and to enhance the usefulness of the relevant processes 
and information, and has been operated throughout 2012 and up to the 
date of approval of the annual report and accounts, and accords with the 
Turnbull Guidance.
The system is applied across the Group on a functional and regional basis 
and a ‘bottom up’ risk proﬁle is created by evaluating the information at an 
operational and Group level. Individual senior managers within Synthomer’s 
businesses identify and assess key risks associated within their area of 
responsibility based on formal management information and interaction 
with colleagues, customers, suppliers and other parties.
The individual submissions are consolidated, reviewed and agreed by 
the Executive Committee. A business risk report is prepared that is closely 
linked to business strategy and takes account of key internal and external 
factors. Risks are prioritised using a common risk matrix, which forms the 
basis of a single corporate risk report that is reviewed and discussed by 
the Audit Committee.
The individual business risk reports are formally reviewed every six months, 
out of which a revised report is submitted which identiﬁes changes in the 
risk environment.
The process was last reviewed by the Synthomer Board of Directors in 
March 2013. The nature of the risks identiﬁed as a result of this process 
during the year primarily relate to matters of an operational and ﬁnancial 
nature and the most signiﬁcant of those which faced the Group in 2012 
are reviewed in the reports of the Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and the Report of the directors.
Risks associated with safety, health and the environment are, by the nature 
of the Group’s business, always of the utmost concern and the Corporate 
social responsibility report on pages 15 to 25 reviews the Group’s 
performance in this connection in 2012.
The processes which are used by the Board either directly or, where 
appropriate, through the Audit Committee to review the effectiveness of the 
internal control and risk management systems (including in relation to the 
ﬁnancial reporting process and the process for preparing consolidated 
accounts) include the following:
 a review of the external audit work plan; 
 consideration of reports from management and external parties, 
including the auditor, on the system of internal ﬁnancial control and 
any material control weaknesses; 
 a quarterly review of safety, health and environmental performance; 
 discussion with management of the actions taken on any possible 
problem areas for the business identiﬁed by Board members or in 
the audit report; 
 consideration of a consolidated risk management report setting out 
the main conclusions from the internal control process; and 
 a biannual report from the internal audit function.
In addition, the Board:
 receives copies of the minutes from all Audit Committee meetings; 
 considers the role of the Group insurance programme; 
 receives regular written and oral reports from management on all 
aspects of production, operations, ﬁnancial and risk management 
matters; and 
 in compliance with Provision C.2. 1 of the Combined Code the Board 
regularly reviews and approves the effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal controls.
The Board conﬁrms that a review of the effectiveness of the Company’s 
risk management and internal control systems was carried out in 2012.
Environmental, social and governance matters
In January 2007 the Association of British Insurers (ABI) published a revised 
version of its guidelines on responsible investment disclosure. These 
guidelines require statements on the extent to which environmental, social 
and governance matters are taken into account by the Board and identiﬁed, 
assessed, managed and monitored, particularly in relation to the risks and 
opportunities they present to the value of the Company.
The Company is a member of the FTSE4Good Index.
Environmental matters
The maintenance of high standards of environmental (together with health 
and safety) protection is central to the Company’s business. A separate 
statement on safety, health and environmental (SHE) matters has been 
a feature of the annual report for a number of years. The Corporate social 
responsibility report statement on pages 15 to 25 incorporates the 
ABI guidelines and includes a report on the initiatives the Company 
has adopted regarding sustainable development.
Social and ethical matters
The Board takes account of social and ethical matters as part of its review 
of internal control which, by virtue of its approach to risk identiﬁcation, 
covers areas which encompass social and ethical matters.
The Board is conscious of its responsibility to the communities in which 
the Group’s businesses operate and encourages local engagement 
by management which includes supporting environmental, health and 
education initiatives.
The Board is also aware of the reputational and legal risks associated with 
social and ethical issues and has a Group-wide code of business conduct 
on corruption and anti-competitive activities, which is available on the 
Company’s website and upon request from the Company Secretary. The 
purpose of this code is to ensure that the Group’s employees have a clear 
understanding of the principles that are important in these areas when 
conducting the Group’s business. The application of the code is explained 
to senior management at regular intervals and they are charged with its 
communication throughout their businesses supported by internal and 
external training. A compliance procedure involving annual certiﬁcation by 
regional senior management and a procedure for maintaining a register of, 
and where appropriate gaining prior approval for, gifts, entertainment and 
corporate hospitality operates throughout the Group. A report is made to 
the Audit Committee annually on the code and the Company’s 
whistleblowing procedure.
Governance
The Board’s approach to governance, training of directors and identiﬁcation 
and assessment of risk is set out above.

Principal areas of focus for the Remuneration Committee during 2012
Following a high level of activity in 201 1 including a review of remuneration 
policies, the introduction of a new long-term incentive plan and a review of 
non-executive directors’ fees the Remuneration Committee (“Committee”) 
dealt with more routine matters in 2012. These principally comprised 
carrying out pay reviews for the executive directors, the setting of annual 
bonus targets for 2012 and determining performance targets and making 
awards under the long-term incentive plan. The Committee also oversaw 
the introduction of revised share ownership guidelines for the executive 
directors and senior management.
The salary increase for the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer effective from 
1 January 2013 included implementation of a commitment arising from 
the 201 1 remuneration review but executive director pay reviews otherwise 
reﬂected inﬂation related awards. The fees paid to the non-executive 
directors remained static in 2012. 2012 saw the making of normal awards 
for the ﬁrst time under the Performance Share Plan introduced in 201 1 and 
awards made in 2010 under the now superseded 2002 long-term incentive 
plan (2002 PSP) were conﬁrmed as having fully vested in March 2013 when 
tested under the performance criteria based on absolute and relative total 
shareholder return. 
Role of the Remuneration Committee and its advisers
During 2012 the Committee comprised three independent non-executive 
directors with Dr Dobbie handing over the role of Chairman to 
Ms Macpherson in May 2012. The composition of the Committee 
since 1 January 2012 has been as follows:
Neil Johnson (until 17 May 2012 and since 7 February 2013 and Chairman)
Jez Maiden
Just Jansz (since 17 May 2012)
Ishbel Macpherson (from 17 May 2012 until 7 February 2013 and Chairman 
until that date)
Sandy Dobbie (until 17 May 2012)
Dominique Fournier (until 13 March 2012)
Attendance at Committee meetings during 2012 is set out on page 31.
The Committee is responsible for determining, in agreement with the 
Board, the Company’s policy on executive remuneration and the speciﬁc 
remuneration for the Chairman and each of the executive directors, 
including pension rights, within the terms of the agreed policy. The 
Committee is also responsible for reviewing the remuneration of senior 
executives throughout the Group. The Committee was assisted in its 
deliberations on the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer’s remuneration by the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer and also took independent advice from and used the 
services of New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited) 
during the year. Aon Hewitt Limited is part of Aon Group as is Aon Limited 
which provides insurance broking services to the Group. The Committee 
is satisﬁed that this in no way compromises the provision of independent 
advice by New Bridge Street.
New Bridge Street was paid £1 1,500 for its services in 2012 which 
included assistance with the preparation of the 201 1 remuneration report 
to shareholders, general advice to the Committee and guidance on the 
implications of the UK government’s proposed remuneration reporting 
regulations. No director is involved in any discussions relating to their 
own remuneration.
The Committee met four times during 2012.
Remuneration policy
Executive directors’ remuneration
The Company’s central policy for 2012 was and continues to be to structure 
executive pay in such a way that key executives may be recruited, motivated 
and retained through being offered remuneration packages that are 
competitive. The Committee has the discretion to consider the Company’s 
performance on environmental, social and governance matters when 
setting the remuneration of the executive directors.
Remuneration of the executive directors comprises:
 a base salary; 
 performance related incentives (being an annual cash bonus plan 
and the 201 1 Performance Share Plan); and 
 pension and ancillary beneﬁts. 
The major element of the remuneration package is a competitive basic 
salary with a further signiﬁcant proportion being structured so as to 
link rewards to corporate performance. Pension and other beneﬁts are 
provided at a level so as to assist with recruitment and retention. Incentive 
arrangements were designed in accordance with the provisions of 
Schedule A to the UK Corporate Governance Code. No elements 
of remuneration other than basic salary are pensionable.
The details of these are set out below.
The Committee does not consider that the incentive structure for senior 
executives gives rise to environmental, social or governance risks by 
inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. 
Base salaries
The basic salary of senior executives is reviewed with effect from 1 January 
each year. The Committee also takes into account the pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group when considering annual salary 
increases and total remuneration.
During 2012 the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer 
received basic annual salaries of £472,500 and £305,000 respectively 
with increases to £500,000 (5.82%) and £312,625 (2.5%) respectively 
implemented from 1 January 2013.
Annual incentive arrangements
For 2012 the Company operated cash bonus plans for the executive 
directors and senior management related to the achievement of proﬁt 
before tax targets. The absolute entry level proﬁt targets under the plan 
were not achieved, however goals for synergy and integration beneﬁts were 
met and accordingly the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion 
and awarded bonuses of 27% of salary to the executive directors for 2012. 
The potential maximum amount payable to the executive directors under 
the plan remained at 100% of basic annual salary. For senior management 
the potential maximum amount payable under the 2012 annual cash bonus 
plans were subject to limits of between 50% to 80% of basic annual salary, 
depending on levels of seniority. All bonus arrangements inherited as a 
result of the acquisition of PolymerLatex in 201 1 have been terminated. 
For 2013, the annual bonus arrangements will operate within a similar 
framework to 2012.
Share plans
201 1 Performance Share Plan
The 201 1 Performance Share Plan was introduced in 201 1 following 
shareholder approval at a General Meeting held in June 201 1 and covers 
the executive directors and senior management. An award consists of a 
right to acquire shares which can be exercised for a nominal price, subject 
to the Company satisfying performance conditions. The value of shares 
awarded under the 201 1 Performance Share Plan in any ﬁnancial year to 
any individual normally may not exceed 150% of their annual basic salary. 
However, in line with market practice, bigger awards may be made in 
exceptional circumstances of up to a further 150% of salary.
Directors’ remuneration report 36 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012
The award policy for 2012 was and remains for 2013 that annual awards 
of 100% of salary are made and, should this policy increase, the Committee 
would consult with key shareholders in advance.
The current performance policy is that two performance conditions apply 
to normal, annual awards under the 201 1 Performance Share Plan. One half 
of the awards will vest subject to a relative total shareholder return (TSR) 
performance condition comparing the Company’s TSR against the TSR 
of the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts and 
ﬁnancial services companies) over a three year period. An underpin applies 
to the TSR performance condition which permits the Committee, at its 
discretion, to scale down the vesting of this part of an award in exceptional 
circumstances if it considers that the level of vesting is not reﬂective of the 
Company’s underlying ﬁnancial performance. The other half of the awards 
will vest subject to an earnings per share (EPS) performance condition 
relating to the annualised three year growth in EPS. The Committee has 
the discretion to reduce (or defer) the level of vesting of an award under 
both the TSR and EPS performance conditions where an event has 
occurred (such as a material health and safety incident) as a result of 
which the Committee considers that it would be inappropriate for vesting 
to occur in accordance with the TSR and EPS performance conditions.
The Committee chose targets that comprise an equal mix of TSR and 
EPS growth as they consider it provides an appropriate blend of share price 
and ﬁnancial conditions which best aligns the interests of management with 
the interests of shareholders.
The 201 1 Performance Share Plan provides for clawback if the Group’s 
accounts have been materially misstated or there has been an error in the 
calculation of any performance conditions which results in an overpayment.
The ﬁrst normal awards were made under the 201 1 Performance Share 
Plan in March 2012 of 100% of salary to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and awards of between 20% and 100% of salary 
were made to a group of senior executives. The performance conditions 
attaching to those awards are set out on page 39.
In order to further align the interests of the executive directors and 
shareholders there are share ownership requirements in connection with 
both the 2002 PSP and the 201 1 Performance Share Plan requiring the 
retention of 25% of the shares acquired by the executive director until such 
time as the executive directors’ holding of ordinary shares in the Company 
has been built up to a level equivalent in value to annual basic salary. Taking 
into account shares comprised in vested unexercised awards, as permitted 
by the share ownership guidelines, this target as at 31 December 2012 has 
been met:

D C Blackwood 11% >100%
During 2012 866,456 shares were the subject of awards made under the 
201 1 Performance Share Plan.
2002 PSP
The shares comprised in the awards granted in 2010 under the 2002 
PSP have vested in full as the performance conditions related to absolute 
and relative total shareholder return were exceeded by a margin of 400% 
and 100% respectively. 
For the purposes of determining the extent to which performance 
conditions have been met TSR data is sourced from external advisers 
and relevant calculations are presented to the Committee by the Group 
Finance and Company Secretary functions for its review before formal 
vesting takes place.
Pension arrangements
Mr A M Whitﬁeld and Mr D C Blackwood are eligible to participate in the 
Group personal pension plan and receive payments of 25% and 20% of 
basic annual salary respectively from the Company which they may use 
either in conjunction with that plan and/or to enable them to make their 
own arrangements. There are no unfunded pension promises or similar 
arrangements for directors.
Beneﬁts
Ancillary beneﬁts comprise a fully expensed car and private health 
insurance.
Executive directors’ service contracts
No director other than Mr A M Whitﬁeld and Mr D C Blackwood has 
a service contract. Mr Whitﬁeld’s contract is dated 22 November 2005 
and Mr Blackwood’s is dated 12 September 2007 . Both contracts have 
no unexpired term, provide for a notice period of one year or, at the option 
of the Company, payment of an amount equal to one year’s salary on 
early termination and otherwise make no provision for pre-determined 
compensation on termination.
The Committee’s policy on contracts and notice periods for executive 
directors is to seek to comply with best practice in corporate governance.
Non-executive directorships held by the executive directors
Mr Whitﬁeld is a non-executive director of Chemical Industries Association 
Limited for which he does not receive any remuneration. He was also 
a non-executive director of AZ Electronic Materials SA until 25 May 2012 
for which he received and retained £22,564 in 2012. Mr Blackwood was 
a member of the Board for Actuarial Standards until June 2012 for which 
he received and retained £5,000 in 2012.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration and terms of appointment
The Board determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors, 
including members of the Remuneration Committee, which is reviewed 
on a biennial basis.
During 2012 the Chairman’s fee was £140,000 per annum with other 
non-executive director fees as follows: £40,000 per annum for those who 
do not sit on a committee; £45,000 per annum, for those who do sit on a 
committee; £50,000 per annum for those who are Committee chairmen 
and the Senior Independent Director.
Non-executive directors are not eligible to receive awards under any 
of the Company’s share plans or other employee beneﬁt schemes nor 
does the Company make any contribution to their pension arrangements.
All non-executive directors are appointed in writing.

Vested awards
(i) The awards made in 2008 under the 2002 PSP were subject to the following performance conditions:
(a)  Absolute total shareholder return condition. 50% of the shares comprised in the award would vest upon the Company’s total shareholder return 
(TSR) over a three year period ended on 31 December 2010 increasing by the rise in RPI plus 15.76% or more compared with the Company’s 
TSR at the start of the three year performance period; 25% of the shares comprised in the award would vest upon the Company’s TSR increasing 
by the rise in RPI plus 9.27% over the three year performance period; and between 25% to 50% of the shares would vest for performance between 
these points on a straight-line basis with lesser performance resulting in no part of the 50% of the shares vesting. 
(b)  Relative total shareholder return condition. 50% of the shares comprised in the award would vest upon the growth in the Company’s TSR over 
the three year performance period exceeding the growth of the FTSE 250 Total Return Index over the same three year period by 7 .69% or more; 
5% of the shares comprised in the award would vest upon the growth in the Company’s TSR over the three year performance period being equal 
to the growth of the FTSE Total Return Index over the same period; and between 5% to 50% of the shares would vest for performance between 
these points on a straight-line basis with lesser performance resulting in no part of the 50% of the shares vesting. 
The 2008 awards vested in March 201 1 in full due to the maximum performance criteria being exceeded. 
(ii)  For the awards made in 2009 under the 2002 PSP the same performance conditions applied as for the awards made in 2008 measured over a three 
year period ending on 31 December 201 1. 
The 2009 awards vested in March 2012 in full due to the maximum performance criteria being exceeded. 
(iii)  For the awards made in 2010 under the 2002 PSP the same performance conditions applied as for the awards made in 2008 measured over a three 
year period ending on 31 December 2012.
The 2010 awards vested in March 2013 in full due to the maximum performance criteria being met.
Unvested awards
(iv)  For the awards made in April 201 1 under the 2002 PSP the same absolute total shareholder condition applied to 50% of the shares comprised in 
the award as for awards made in 2008 measured over a three year period ending 31 December 2013. For the other 50% of the shares comprised in 
the award the following conditions applied: 50% of the shares comprised in the award will vest upon the Company’s TSR at the end of the three year 
period ending on 31 December 2013 being in the top quartile of the TSR of the companies in the FTSE 250 Index: 5% of the shares comprised in 
the award will vest upon the Company’s TSR at the end of the three year period ending on 31 December 2013 being at least equal to the FTSE 250 
Total Return Index; and between 5% and 50% of the shares will vest for performance between these points on a straight-line base with lesser 
performance resulting in no part of the 50% of the shares vesting.
(v)  For the exceptional awards made in June 201 1 under the 201 1 Performance Share Plan 100% of the shares comprised in the award will vest if 
earnings per share (EPS) for 2013 is equal to or greater than 30.3 pence. No shares will vest if EPS for 2013 is less than 27 .3 pence and between 
27 .3 pence and 30.3 pence vesting will be on a straight-line basis. 
(vi)  The awards made in March 2012 under the 201 1 Performance Share Plan were subject to the following performance conditions:
a)  Relative total shareholder return condition: 50% of the shares comprised in the award will vest upon the Company’s TSR at the end of the three 
year period ending on 31 December 2014 being in the top quartile of the companies in the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts and 
ﬁnancial services companies). 12.5% of the shares comprised in the award will vest upon the Company’s TSR at the end of the three year period 
ending on 31 December 2014 being at least at the median of the same comparator group; and between 12.5% and 50% of the shares will vest 
for performance between these points on a straight-line basis with lesser performance resulting in no part of the 50% of the shares vesting.
b) EPS condition: 50% of the shares comprised in the award will vest if earnings per share (EPS) for 201 4 is equal to or greater than 32 pence per share. 
No shares will vest if EPS for 2014 is less than 28 pence and between 28 pence and 32 pence per share vesting will be on a straight line basis.
The notional value of unexercised share options is based on the mid-market price of a share on 31 December 2012 of 188.6 pence. During the year the 
market price ranged between 127 .4 pence and 251.0 pence.

Financial statements, including adoption of going concern basis
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for 
each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the directors are required to prepare 
the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve 
the accounts unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Company 
for that period. 
In preparing the parent company ﬁnancial statements, the directors are 
required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
ﬁnancial statements; and
 prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group ﬁnancial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that directors:
 properly select and apply accounting policies;
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc 
requirements in IFRSs are insufﬁcient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance; and
 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the company 
and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Other matters
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
 the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
ﬁnancial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
 the management report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 41 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012 41 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of Synthomer plc for the 
year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise the Consolidated income 
statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
Consolidated statement of changes in equity, the Consolidated balance 
sheet, the Analysis of net borrowings, the Consolidated cash ﬂow statement 
and the related notes. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out 
on page 40, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group 
ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair 
view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or 
to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that the 
ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial 
and non-ﬁnancial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements 
In our opinion the Group ﬁnancial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2012 and of its proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year 
then ended;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union; and;
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
 the information given in the Report of the directors’ for the ﬁnancial year 
for which the Group ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the Group ﬁnancial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not 
made; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 the directors’ statement, set out on page 29, in relation to 
going concern;
 the part of the Corporate governance statement relating to the 
company’s compliance with the nine provisions of UK Corporate 
Governance Code speciﬁed for our review; and
 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company ﬁnancial statements 
of Synthomer plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 and on the 
information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as 
having been audited.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
31 December 2012
1 General information
Synthomer plc is a company incorporated in the United 
Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address of the 
registered ofﬁce is given on page 26. These ﬁnancial 
statements are presented in pounds sterling because that 
is the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included 
in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
New and amended standards adopted by the group
There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective 
for the ﬁrst time for the ﬁnancial year beginning on or after 
1 January 2012 that would be expected to have a material 
impact on the group.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards and amendments to standards 
and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning 
after 1 January 2012, and have not been applied in preparing 
these consolidated ﬁnancial statements. None of these is 
expected to have a signiﬁcant effect on the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements of the group, except the following 
set out below:
Amendment to IAS1, ‘Financial statement presentation’ 
regarding other comprehensive income. The main change 
resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities 
to group items presented in ‘other comprehensive income’ 
(OCI) on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassiﬁable 
to proﬁt or loss subsequently (reclassiﬁcation adjustments). 
The amendments do not address which items are presented 
in OCI.
IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’, aims to improve 
consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise 
deﬁnition of fair value and a single source of fair value 
measurement and disclosure requirements for use across 
IFRSs. The requirements, which are largely aligned between 
IFRSs and US GAAP, do not extend the use of fair value 
accounting but provide guidance on how it should be applied 
where its use is already required or permitted by other 
standards within IFRSs or US GAAP.
IAS19, ‘Employee beneﬁts’, was amended in June 2011. 
The most signiﬁcant impact on the Group in its 2013 ﬁnancial 
statements will be to replace interest cost and expected return 
on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated 
by applying the discount rate to the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability 
(asset). This change is expected to reduce the Group’s 
reported proﬁt by £3.2 million. This net interest charge will 
be reported as part of ﬁnance costs rather than as a charge 
to operating proﬁt. The additional amount to be reclassiﬁed 
is estimated to be £1.9 million to yield a total net interest charge 
of £5.1 million.
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classiﬁcation, 
measurement and recognition of ﬁnancial assets and 
ﬁnancial liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and 
October 2010. It replaces the parts of IAS39 that relate to the 
classiﬁcation and measurement of ﬁnancial instruments. IFRS 9 
requires ﬁnancial assets to be classiﬁed into two measurement 
categories: those measured as at fair value and those measured 
at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial 
recognition. The classiﬁcation depends on the entity’s business 
model for managing its ﬁnancial liabilities, the standard retains 
most of the IAS39 requirements. The main change is that, 
in cases where the fair value option is taken for ﬁnancial 
liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own 
credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather 
than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting 
mismatch. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact and 
intends to adopt IFRS 9 no later than the accounting period 
beginning on or after 1 January 2015, subject to endorsement 
by the EU. The Group will also consider the impact of the 
remaining phases of IFRS 9 when completed by the Board.
IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated ﬁnancial statements’, builds on 
existing principles by identifying the concept of control as 
the determining factor in whether an entity should be included 
within the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the parent 
company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist 
in the determination of control where this is difﬁcult to assess. 
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 10’s full impact and intends to 
adopt IFRS 10 no later than the accounting period beginning
on or after 1 January 2014, following endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’, includes 
the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other 
entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special 
purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles. The 
Group is yet to assess IFRS 12’s full impact and intends to 
adopt IFRS 12 no later than the accounting period beginning 
on or after 1 January 2014, following endorsement by the EU.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not 
yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact 
on the Group. 47 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012

2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The 
ﬁnancial statements have also been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the 
Group ﬁnancial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS 
Regulation. The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on 
the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of ﬁnancial 
instruments. As discussed in the Report of the directors on 
page 29, the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a 
going concern basis. The principal accounting policies adopted 
are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each 
year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to 
govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of an investee entity 
so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the 
year are included in the consolidated income statement from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of 
disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are 
made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the 
accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
The results of joint ventures are accounted for using equity 
accounting.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries 
are identiﬁed separately from the Group’s equity therein. 
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests 
at the date of the original business combination (see below) 
and the minority’s share of changes in equity since the date 
of combination.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses 
are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of 
the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair 
value of the identiﬁable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, 
associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for 
impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in the consolidated income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash generating units expected to beneﬁt 
from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units 
to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that 
the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the 
unit, the impairment loss is allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the 
other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying 
amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled 
entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition 
to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill 
written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has 
not been reinstated and is not included in determining any 
subsequent proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted 
for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each 
acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values 
(at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred 
or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group 
in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related 
costs are recognised in proﬁt or loss as incurred.
The acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under 
IFRS 3 (2008) are recognised at their fair value at the 
acquisition date, except that:
 deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets 
related to employee beneﬁt arrangements are recognised 
and measured in accordance with IAS12 Income Taxes 
and IAS19 Employee Beneﬁts respectively;
 assets (or disposal groups) that are classiﬁed as held for sale 
in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale 
and discontinued operations are measured in accordance 
with that standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is 
incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the 
combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts 
for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those 
provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement 
period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are 
recognised, to reﬂect new information obtained about facts 
and circumstance that existed as of the acquisition date that, 
if known, would have affected the amounts as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of 
acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information 
about facts and circumstances that existed as of the 
acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired through acquisition are measured 
at their fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives, on the following bases:
Customer relationships –  between 5 and 8 years
Technology – 10 years
Where necessary the fair value at acquisition and estimated 
useful lives for these intangible assets are based on 
independent valuation reports. 48 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012
2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Other intangible assets
Software development and environmental licensing costs 
resulting in development of a long-term intangible asset are 
measured initially at cost and are amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Software – between 3 and 5 years
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the 
Group’s product development is recognised only if all 
of the following conditions in IAS38 are met:
 an asset is created that can be separately identiﬁed 
(such as software and new processes);
 it is probable that the asset created will generate future 
economic beneﬁts; and
 the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
No research or development costs met the criteria for required 
capitalisation under IAS38 during the year.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be 
recognised, development expenditure is recognised as 
an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost (original 
purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the 
asset to its working condition for its intended use), net of 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Except for 
freehold land and land grants in Malaysia, which are not 
depreciated, the cost of property, plant and equipment is 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful 
life as follows:
Freehold building – 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings –  the lesser of 50 years and 
the period of the lease
Plant and equipment –  between 3 and 10 years
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its plant, property and equipment and intangible 
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). 
Where the asset does not generate cash ﬂows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which 
the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to 
sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset 
for which the estimates of future cash ﬂows have not been 
adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) 
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that 
the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised in prior years. A reversal of an 
impairment loss is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss.
Operating leases
Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight-line 
basis to the income statement over the term of the relevant 
lease. Any beneﬁts received as an incentive to enter into an 
operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, 
direct labour costs and those overheads that have been 
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average 
method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling 
price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is 
made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where 
appropriate.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair 
value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in proﬁt or loss 
where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
All trade receivables that are factored by third parties are 
done so on a non-recourse basis. At the point of factoring, 
the Group forfeits the right to future cash ﬂows from these 
receivables and those amounts are derecognised. The cost 
of factoring receivables is recognised as a ﬁnance cost in 
the period in which the receivable is factored.
Amortised costs
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to 
the proﬁt and loss account using the effective interest method 
and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the 
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value 
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method.

Group
ﬁnancial statements
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to reduce 
exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate 
movements. The Group does not hold or issue derivative 
ﬁnancial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of ﬁnancial derivatives is governed by the Group’s 
policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide 
written principles on the use of ﬁnancial derivatives, as set out 
in note 22.
Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its ﬁnancial assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment 
loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any).
Finance costs
Finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement 
over the term of such instruments at an effective interest rate 
on the carrying amount. Finance costs that are directly 
attributable to the construction of property, plant and 
equipment are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets 
in accordance with IAS23.
Foreign currencies
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements of the individual 
companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s 
functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance 
sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets 
and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at 
the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary 
items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are not retranslated.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange 
risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options 
(see below for details of the Group’s accounting policies in 
respect of such derivative ﬁnancial instruments).
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s 
overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are 
translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless 
exchange rates ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly. Exchange differences 
arising, if any, are classiﬁed as equity and transferred to the 
Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are 
recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which 
the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition 
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group 
has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising 
on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs as 
sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group enters into a variety of derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and 
foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward 
contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign currency options.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date 
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. 
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a ﬁnancial 
asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is 
recognised as a ﬁnancial liability. The resulting gain or loss is 
recognised in proﬁt or loss immediately unless the derivative 
is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which 
event the timing of the recognition in proﬁt or loss depends 
on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates 
certain derivatives as either hedges of highly probable forecast 
transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of ﬁrm 
commitments (cash ﬂow hedges), or hedges of net 
investments in foreign operations.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which 
include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives 
in respect of foreign currency risk, as either cash ﬂow hedges, 
or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents 
the relationship between the hedging instrument and the 
hedged item, along with its risk management objectives 
and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. 
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing 
basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument 
that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in 
offsetting changes in cash ﬂows of the hedged item.
Cash ﬂow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives 
that are designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges are 
deferred in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income 
statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in proﬁt or loss in the 
periods when the hedged item is recognised in proﬁt or loss, 
in the same line of the income statement as the recognised 
hedged item. However, when the forecast transaction that is 
hedged results in the recognition of a non-ﬁnancial asset or a 
non-ﬁnancial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred 
in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial 
measurement of the cost of the non-ﬁnancial asset or 
non-ﬁnancial liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the 
hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁes for hedge 
accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity
 at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the 
forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in proﬁt or loss. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, 
the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is 
recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss. 50 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012
2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted 
for similarly to cash ﬂow hedges. Any gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the 
hedge is recognised in equity in the foreign currency translation 
reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion 
is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss, and is included 
in the ‘other gains and losses’ line of the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held 
at call with banks, restricted cash balances which become fully 
liquid within three months or less and other short-term highly 
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently 
payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the 
year. Taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the 
consolidated income statement because it excludes items 
of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the 
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt 
with in equity.
Retirement beneﬁt costs
The costs of deﬁned beneﬁt contributions to the Group’s 
pension schemes and of augmenting existing pensions are 
charged to the consolidated income statement on a systematic 
basis over the expected period of beneﬁts from employees’ 
service.
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes 
are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Actuarial gains on the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are recognised 
in full in each period in which they occur. They are recognised 
outside of the consolidated income statement and are 
presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of 
deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans is the present value of the 
deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the end of the reporting period 
less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments 
for unrecognised past-service costs. The deﬁned beneﬁt 
obligation is calculated annually using the projected unit credit 
method. The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is 
determined by discounting the estimated future cash outﬂows 
using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are 
denominated in the currency in which the beneﬁts will be paid, 
and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of 
the related pension obligation.
The UK deﬁned beneﬁt scheme is funded, with the assets 
of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, 
in separate trustee-administered funds.
For the German schemes, the assets are included within the 
assets of the respective companies, as permitted under local 
laws. The assets of the other overseas schemes are held 
separately from those of the Group.
Provisions
Provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of 
sale of the relevant products, at the directors’ best estimate 
of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s liability.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the 
Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that 
has been communicated to affected parties.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable and represents amounts receivable 
for goods provided in the normal course of business, net 
of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and 
title has passed, where delivery is deﬁned in accordance with 
Incoterms 2000.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 
Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value 
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest.

Deﬁnitions
Total sales
Total sales represent the total of revenue from the Company, 
its subsidiaries, and its share of the revenue of joint ventures.
Operating proﬁt
Operating proﬁt represents proﬁt from continuing activities 
before ﬁnancing costs and taxation.
EBITDA
EBITDA is calculated as operating proﬁt before depreciation, 
amortisation and special items (as deﬁned below).
Special items
The following are disclosed separately in order to provide 
a clearer indication of the Group’s underlying performance:
 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets;
 Impairment of non-current assets;
 Costs of business combinations as deﬁned by IFRS 3 
and related debt issue costs;
 Re-structuring and site closure costs;
 Fair value adjustment – mark to market adjustments in 
respect of cross currency and interest rate derivatives 
used for hedging purposes where IAS39 hedge accounting 
is not applied;
 Amounts advanced in respect of invoices sold under 
non-recourse factoring arrangements;
 Other non-recurring and non-operating items;
 Tax impact of the above items; and
 Settlement of prior period tax issues.
Underlying performance
Underlying performance represents the statutory performance 
of the Group under IFRS, excluding special items.
Net borrowings
Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents together 
with short and long term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect 
of related derivative instruments irrespective of whether 
they qualify for hedge accounting, non-recourse factoring 
arrangements, and the inclusion of Financial Assets.
Critical judgements in applying accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those 
involving estimations (see below), that the Group has made 
in the process of applying the accounting policies and that 
have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised 
in the ﬁnancial statements.
Going concern
The assessment that the ﬁnancial statements should be 
prepared on a going concern basis requires the directors to 
make a judgement that, after taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
The Group activities give rise to signiﬁcant potential deferred 
tax assets, particularly in respect of the UK pension liability, 
tax losses and accelerated capital allowances. Determination 
of whether these assets should be recognised requires a 
high degree of management judgement and is dependent on 
management’s ability to project future earnings from activities 
that may apply loss positions carried forward against future 
income taxes.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements requires 
that management make estimates and assumptions that 
affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and various other factors that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the 
result of which form the basis of making the judgements about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions 
are reviewed on an ongoing basis taking the current and 
expected future market conditions into consideration.
Impairment/reversal of impairment
The Group has signiﬁcant investments in property, plant and 
equipment, acquired intangibles and goodwill. Changes in the 
circumstances or expectations of future performance of an 
individual asset may be an indicator that the asset is impaired 
requiring the book value to be written down to its recoverable 
amount. Impairments, excluding goodwill, are reversed if the 
conditions for impairment are no longer present. Evaluating 
whether an asset is impaired or if an impairment should be 
reversed requires a high degree of judgement and may depend 
to a large extent on the selection of key assumptions about 
the future.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an 
estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to 
which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation 
requires the entity to estimate the future cash ﬂows expected 
to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate present value. The industry 
growth rates used within the forecast future cash ﬂows are 
developed with reference to external sources but are subject 
to estimation uncertainty.
Post retirement beneﬁt obligations
Included in the actuaries’ calculation of the post retirement 
beneﬁt obligations are a number of assumptions. These are 
shown in detail in note 24.
Current tax liability and deferred tax
The Group annually incurs signiﬁcant amounts of income taxes 
payable to various jurisdictions around the world, and it also 
recognises signiﬁcant changes in deferred tax assets and 
deferred tax liabilities, all of which are based on management’s 
interpretations of applicable laws, regulations and relevant 
court decisions. The quality of these estimates is highly 
dependent upon management’s ability to properly apply 
what can be very complex sets of rules and to recognise 
changes in applicable rules. 52 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred 
tax assets to the extent that it is probable that these assets will be recovered. No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted 
earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures. As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected 
to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment at the balance sheet date, or more frequently if there are indications that 
goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”) that are 
expected to beneﬁt from that business combination.
The allocation of the carrying value of goodwill is represented below.

The recoverable amounts for CGUs are determined from value in use calculations, based upon discounted cash ﬂows. The key 
assumptions for those discounted cash ﬂow calculations are the discount rate, proﬁtability and growth rate. The discount rate 
is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable to the 
particular CGUs activities and geography of operation. Proﬁtability and growth rates are based on past experience combined 
with management’s expectations for future business performance, which is informed by a number of factors including economic 
growth, internal plans and competitor and customer activity.
Discount rates of 11% (2011 11%) and 12% (2011 12%) have been used in the above calculations for Europe & North America 
and Asia & Rest of World respectively.
The proﬁt used in the cash ﬂows for the ﬁrst year is derived from management forecasts; for years 2 to 10 a growth rate is applied. 
The proﬁt for year 10 is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity. Growth rates of between 2% (2011 2%) 
and 5% (2011 5%) have been used for Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of World respectively, representing management’s 
best estimate of each CGUs circumstances, and these do not exceed the long term growth rates for the markets concerned.
Of the net book value of goodwill at 31 December 2012, £70.5 million (2011 £70.5 million) is located in the UK.

17 Financial asset
The Group disposed of its Pharma Chemicals business on 30 November 2011. Part of the consideration agreed with the 
buyer, totalling $10.0m, was in the form of a deferred payment to the Group which will be made by the buyer on or before 
30 September 2014. In the event that the buyer is unable to fulﬁl his obligation, this deferred consideration is secured by an 
irrevocable bank guarantee held in favour of Synthomer plc by HSBC Bank plc.
In view of the security held, the Directors consider this deferred consideration virtually certain to be received and have therefore 
included it in these ﬁnancial statements as a Non-Current Financial Asset, and within the Group’s deﬁnition of Net Borrowings. 
The amount of £5.6 million (2011 £5.6 million) included in Non-current assets represents the agreed amount of $10.0 million 
discounted at the rate of 5% per annum from 30 September 2014 to date of completion, plus an appropriate amount unwound 
on this discounting in the period up to 31 December 2012.

There is no material difference between the balance sheet value of inventories and their replacement cost.
The nature of the chemical reaction necessary to produce ﬁnished goods from raw materials is such that ‘work in progress’ 
is not a material part of the Group’s inventory at any given point of time.

The special item fair value adjustment represents the revaluation of US dollar loan notes from the rate of the related cross 
currency swaps to the year end rate, together with the transitional adjustment required to reﬂect movements in fair value caused 
by variations in interest rates, and subsequent amortisation thereof, to the extent that these constituted effective hedges prior to 
the adoption of IFRS.
Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with ﬁnancial institutions with a credit rating of A or higher.
22 Financial instruments
The Group’s treasury function operates procedures designed to reduce or eliminate ﬁnancial risk and ensure that funds are available 
for current and future needs. The policies are approved by the Board and the use of ﬁnancial instruments is strictly controlled.
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising 
the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists 
of debt, which includes the cash and borrowings disclosed in note 21, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial instruments comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources and various items, such as 
trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations. The Group also uses interest rate swaps, currency 
swaps and forward foreign currency contracts to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations 
and its sources of ﬁnance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in Derivative Financial instruments shall 
be undertaken.

Fair values have been obtained from the relevant institutions where appropriate. Where market values are not available, fair values 
of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash ﬂow at prevailing interest 
rates and by applying year end exchange rates. The carrying amount of short-term borrowings approximates to book value.
The fair value of the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or 
indirectly observable.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees 
policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with related disclosure required by IFRS.
Market risk
The Group’s main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The policies adopted to 
address these risks are as follows:
Interest rate risk
The Group ﬁnances its operations through a mixture of retained proﬁts, loan notes and bank borrowings. The Group borrows at 
both ﬁxed and ﬂoating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest proﬁle in order to manage the 
Group’s exposure to interest rate ﬂuctuations.
Foreign currency risk
The Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are 
predominantly denominated in euros. Proﬁt translation exposures are not hedged.
The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of conﬁrmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The Group’s policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities. Consequently, there are 
no material currency exposures to disclose (2011 none).
Impact on income statement
Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts amounting to £1.7 million have been debited to the income statement in the 
year (2011 debit of £3.3 million). These changes are shown separately as a special item in the consolidated income statement.

Hedge accounting
The Group has a number of cross currency swaps that are used to reduce the exposure to interest rate and currency risk.
These swaps are fully effective at eliminating the risks they address. The Group has reviewed the requirements necessary to 
permit the application of hedge accounting under IAS39. It has concluded that the costs involved in meeting these requirements 
cannot be justiﬁed and therefore IAS39 hedge accounting will not be applied.
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in the 
income statement as they arise.
The Group has designated a number of Interest Rate Swap agreements, acquired as part of the acquisition of PolymerLatex 
Group, which in combination represent a ﬂoating to ﬁxed interest rate swap on a principal euro amount of €156 million, as an 
effective hedge against the interest rate exposure associated with a substantial portion of the Group’s euro denominated, ﬂoating 
rate, £150 million term loan. As such these contracts are now accounted for as Cashﬂow Hedges as permitted by IAS39.
In addition, the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts to ﬁx the sterling value of its net investments in 
certain foreign operations, which have a euro functional currency. These contracts, together with €177.8 million drawn on 
the multicurrency term loan facility have been accounted for as net investment hedges as permitted by IAS39.

The interest rate sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and 
non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For ﬂoating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount 
of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts 
their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as 
well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional 
currency of the lender or borrower.
Liquidity risk
The objective of the Group is to meet ﬁnancial commitments as and when they fall due. The Board closely monitors liquidity 
through monthly management accounts.
At the year end, Synthomer plc had the following principal facilities:
A committed syndicated bank facility of £210 million comprising a £150 million term loan which was drawndown in euros on 
completion of the PolymerLatex acquisition, and a £60 million revolving credit facility which was undrawn at 31 December 2012.
Unsecured loan notes totalling approximately £51 million raised from the US private placement market in 2004. With maturity 
between 2014 and 2016, these loan notes provide the Group’s long-term requirements. Please see note 21 for further details.

UK pension schemes
The Group’s UK deﬁned beneﬁt scheme was closed to future accrual in 2009. All pension beneﬁts since that time are provided 
by way of a deﬁned contribution scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the proﬁt and loss account to spread the cost of pensions over employees’ working 
lives within the Group.

Overseas pension schemes
The Group operates a number of smaller overseas pension and post-retirement schemes. The assets of these schemes 
are held separately from those of the Group, with the exception of the unfunded German schemes (net liability £47.7 million, 
2011 £42.7 million), where in line with common practice, the assets are held within the respective companies.
Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
The aggregated pension disclosure below for the overseas deﬁned beneﬁt schemes has been compiled from a number of 
actuarial valuations at 31 December 2012.
The largest of these schemes accounts for £37.8 million (2011 £34.5 million) of the deﬁcit at 31 December 2012. The major 
assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of this scheme are:
2012 2011
Rate of increase in salaries 3.00% 3.00%
Rate of increase in pensions 2.00% 2.00%
Discount rate 3.80% 4.50%
Inﬂation assumption 3.00% 3.00%
The major assumption used in the valuation of the other overseas schemes do not differ signiﬁcantly from the above.

Independent auditor’s report to the 
members of Synthomer plc
We have audited the parent company ﬁnancial statements of 
Synthomer plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 which 
comprise the parent Company balance sheet and the related notes. 
The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
set out on page 40, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the parent company ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. 
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed 
by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all 
the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements 
In our opinion the parent company ﬁnancial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2012;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
 the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and 
 the information given in the Directors’ report for the ﬁnancial year 
for which the parent company ﬁnancial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the parent company ﬁnancial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where 
the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
 the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are 
not made; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit. 
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁnancial statements 
of Synthomer plc for the year ended 31 December 2012.

ﬁnancial statements
1 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. 
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year 
and the preceding year.
Basis of accounting
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the 
going concern basis under the historical cost convention as 
modiﬁed by the revaluation of certain ﬁxed assets, and comply 
with applicable UK accounting standards and the Companies 
Act 2006.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate 
of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, 
at the forward contract rate. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date 
are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, 
if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Tangible ﬁxed assets
Tangible ﬁxed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Cost includes 
the original purchase price of the asset plus the costs 
attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition 
for its intended use. Except for freehold land, which is not 
depreciated, the cost or valuation of tangible ﬁxed assets is 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over their expected useful 
lives as follows:
Freehold buildings  – 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings  –  the lesser of 50 years 
and the period of the lease
Plant and equipment  – between 3 and 10 years
Revaluation of properties
Where depreciation charges are increased following a 
revaluation, an amount equal to the increase is transferred 
annually from the revaluation reserve to the proﬁt and loss 
account as a movement on reserves. On the disposal or 
recognition of a provision for impairment of a revalued 
ﬁxed asset, any related balance remaining in the revaluation 
reserve is also transferred to the proﬁt and loss account 
as a movement on reserves.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision 
for impairment.
Intercompany
Intercompany balances are shown gross unless a right 
of set off exists.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially stated at the amount of the net 
proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is 
provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using 
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences 
that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date 
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay 
more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future 
have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences 
are differences between the Company’s taxable proﬁts and 
its results as stated in the ﬁnancial statements that arise from 
the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods 
different from those in which they are recognised in the 
ﬁnancial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and 
therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available 
evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there 
will be suitable taxable proﬁts from which the future reversal 
of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences 
are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities (including derivative 
instruments) are recognised on the Company balance sheet 
when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors
Trade debtors do not carry any interest and are stated at 
their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to 
the proﬁt and loss account using the effective interest method 
and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the 
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
Trade creditors
Trade creditors are not interest-bearing and are stated at their 
nominal value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at 
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Company enters into derivative ﬁnancial instruments to 
manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate 
risk, including cross currency interest rate swaps and forward 
foreign exchange contracts. The Company does not hold or 
issue derivative ﬁnancial instruments for speculative purposes.
Notes to the company ﬁnancial statements
31 December 2012 82 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012
1 Accounting policies continued
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured 
to their fair value at each balance sheet date. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a ﬁnancial asset whereas a 
derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a ﬁnancial liability. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the proﬁt and 
loss account immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of 
the recognition in the proﬁt and loss account depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Company designates certain 
derivatives as fair value hedges.
The use of ﬁnancial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide written 
principles on the use of ﬁnancial derivatives.
Fair value hedge accounting
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the proﬁt and loss 
account, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. 
The Company only applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign currency exposure associated with the underlying hedged 
item. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is also recognised in the proﬁt and loss account.
Net borrowings
Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents together with short and long-term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect 
of related derivative instruments irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge accounting.
Pension funding
The costs of contributions to the Group’s pension schemes and of augmenting existing pensions are charged to the proﬁt and 
loss account on a systematic basis over the expected period of beneﬁts from employees’ service.
The UK deﬁned beneﬁt scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate 
trustee-administered funds.
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Additions for the year represent the investment in Ennismore Limited, a company incorporated in Jersey. A total amount 
of €350.1 million (£284.7 million) was invested. The Company has designated its euro denominated £150 million multicurrency 
term loan facility of €177 .8 million (see note 8) as a FRS 26 fair value hedge against €177 .8 million of this investment. Under FRS 26, 
the hedged portion of this investment is re-translated at the year end spot rate with the resulting gain or loss being taken to the 
proﬁt and loss account, where it is fully offset by the exchange gain or loss resulting from the re-translation of the term loan 
facility at the same date.
Also included within the movement in investments during the year were the transfer of the Company’s investment in Synthomer 
(UK) Limited to a subsidiary of the group, and the disposal and impairment of various non-trading companies which are no 
longer required.

13 Related party transactions
There were no related party transactions during the year (2011 none), other than those in respect of key management 
compensation which are disclosed in note 28 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements on page 77.
14 Guarantees and other ﬁnancial commitments
The Company has given guarantees amounting to £5.7 million (2011 £17.5 million) in respect of bank and other facilities of 
subsidiaries and joint ventures.
15 Pension commitments
The Group participates in a funded scheme with both a deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution section (the Yule Catto Group 
Retirement Beneﬁt Scheme). The scheme’s deﬁned beneﬁt section was closed to new members with effect from 31 December 1998 
and with effect from 1 January 1999 a deﬁned contribution section was introduced and is open to all eligible Group employees. 
During 2009 the Group announced that it intended to close the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme to future accrual. This process commenced 
in 2009 and was completed in September 2010.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
The pension charge for the year for the Company amounted to £19.4 million (2011 £14.1 million).
In accordance with FRS 17 , the Company will account for its contributions to the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme as if it were a deﬁned 
contribution scheme because it is not possible to identify the Company’s share of the assets and liabilities in the scheme on a 
consistent and reasonable basis. The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme prepared for the purposes of making transitional 
disclosure in accordance with FRS 17 shows a net pension liability of £69.5 million at 31 December 2012 (2011 £73.9 million).
FRS 17 disclosure
Due to the application of IAS19 to the Group ﬁnancial statements, resulting in changes to the required disclosures at Group level, 
the disclosure requirements of FRS 17 for the Group have been included below.
The major assumptions used in the calculation of the FRS 17 liability are:
2012 2011 2010 2009 2008
Rate of increase in salaries N/A N/A N/A 3.00% 2.60%
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.00% 3.00% 3.25% 3.00% 2.50%
Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 2.00% 2.00% 2.25% 3.00% 2.50%
Discount rate 4.60% 4.80% 5.40% 5.70% 6.50%

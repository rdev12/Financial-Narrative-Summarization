We own or co-own the majority of our hotels and many  
were developed, converted or extensively renovated and 
repositioned by us. This means our properties have been 
developed to provide accommodation to our own high

identifying, optimising and realising real estate values, while 
delivering excellent returns through our management 
expertise. Our hotels are usually located in city centres, near 
major transport hubs and local landmarks. In addition, we 
focus on maximising revenue from each hotel through 
generating income from other areas such as meetings, events, 
restaurants, bars and spas. In 2008, we entered the resort 
segment of the market through our partnership with 
Arenaturist in Croatia. 
We proudly introduce a selection of our landmark hotels  
which are owned or co-owned. –7–

the market. The immediate surroundings of the hotel are 
currently undergoing a major transformation, which will further

Dear shareholders, 
2013 was another year of progress for PPHE Hotel 
Group. This was achieved against a very strong 
p ri o r 	 y e a r 	 c o mp a ra t iv e , 	 as 	 w e 	 b e n e fi t e d 	 i n 	 20 1 2	
from the London Olympic Games, and despite 
the remaining challenging conditions in some  
of the markets in which we operate. We focused 
on what we do best: giving our customers 
exemplary service at our segment-leading hotels 
which are located in key travel destinations. As  
a result, we were able to increase our revenue 
year on year. Our teams, aided by our ongoing 
investment in training, continued to deliver 
exceptional service, with service satisfaction 
among our guests increasing once again. 
One of our most exciting developments 
during the year was the opening of our new 
fl a g s h i p	a r t ’ o t e l	a m s t e r d a m,	w h i c h	h a s	b e e n	
very well received by the market. 
We acquired the freehold interests in two 
previously leased art’otels in Berlin, with 
a view to maximise returns by renovating and 
repositioning both hotels. In January this year 
we entered into a 50:50 joint venture in relation 
to these hotels. Our development pipeline  
was further strengthened by an exciting new 
acqu isiti on 	 o f 	 an 	 o f fi ce 	 bu i ldin g 	 in 	 London,	 
near Waterloo Station, where we plan to 
develop a hotel with over 400 rooms.
In December, we completed the largest

an extensive renovation programme across 
some of our core properties. We have an 
exciting journey ahead of us, which will further 
solidify our already strong position in some  
of Europe’s preferred investor and travel 
markets such as London and Amsterdam. 
For the last two years the Board has 
recommended the payment of an interim and 
fin a l 	 divi dend 	 o f 	 6. 0 	 pence 	 per 	 sh ar e 	 m akin g 	 a	
total of 12.0 pence per share for each year. 
The Board is proposing the payment of an 
ELI PAPOUCHADO
CHAIRMAN 
incr e ased 	 fi n a l 	 divi dend 	 o f 	 8. 0 	 pence 	 per 	 sh ar e ,	
which when combined with the interim dividend 
of 6.0 pence per share paid on 11 October 2013, 
amounts to a total dividend for the year ended 
31 December 2013 of 14.0 pence per share,  
an increase of 16.7%. The increased dividend 
r e flec t s 	 the 	 Bo ar d’ s 	 con fi dence 	 in 	 the 	 s tr en gth	
of the business and in respect of future years 
the Board expects to follow a progressive 
dividend policy. 
Looking ahead, we will focus on the delivery  
of the projects in our development pipeline.  
We have four active new hotel projects, three in 
London and one in Germany, plus the extension 
a n d 	 r e c o n fi gu ra t i o n 	 o f 	 P a rk 	 Pl aza 	 R iv e rb a n k	
London, and two rebranding projects which  
are expected to add over 1,200 rooms by the 
end of 2017 , representing approximately a 15% 
increase on our current number of rooms. 
Additional new projects are also being 
considered. Our investment in these new 
projects and an extensive planned refurbishment 
of our existing estate is expected to exceed 
€ 1 30 . 0 	 m i l l i o n 	 a n d 	 wi l l 	 l e a d 	 t o 	 l o n g- t e rm 	 b e n e fi ts .	
The Company continues to consider options of 
how to best fund future expansion, including the 
release of part of the value of hotel assets, while 
retaining operational control.
2014 will be a very special year for PPHE Hotel 
Group as we will be celebrating the start of a 
25-year journey that has taken us from acquiring 
Park Plaza Eindhoven in 1989 through to 
establishing a high quality hotel portfolio, 
world-class brands and strong operating 
performances. We will commemorate this feat 
with several festivities planned throughout the 
year for guests, partners and employees. I take 
personal pride in what we have been able to 
achieve and I am thrilled about the future 
prospects of our Group.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
the Board for their guidance and all our teams 
for their great work in what was a challenging, 
but rewarding year.  –14–

THE ART’OTEL
B R A N D
As distinctive as the name suggests, each art’otel is a true 
piece of art in its own right. Originally created by a small 
group of avid art collectors and entrepreneurs in the early 
nineties, art’otel is a collection of contemporary hotels that 
blend unique architectural style with art-inspired interiors. 
Each art’otel is a true homage to a contemporary artist, and

When we acquired the art’otel brand in 2007, we had a clear 
vision of where we wanted to take the brand. We believed in 
its potential and wanted to make it as unique as it was when it

We didn’t neglect the current, but rather built on the learnings 
from the existing art’otels and added a lot more focus on the 
senses and unique brand characteristics. Our vision has now

Art and culture are ingrained in every  
aspect of the hotel, with knowledgeable 
and passionate employees sharing their 
enthusiasm while simultaneously delivering 
world-class service. The art’otel team 
embraces the excitement of the concept 
– they love art and adore hospitality. We 
elevate the art’otel experience to a level 
beyond templated hospitality without  
losing sight of the fundamentals of a  
hotel stay. We break down traditional  
barriers and engage with guests in an 
informal but respectful manner. 
The new art’otel amsterdam boasts 
contemporary architectural styling, tasteful 
interior design and state-of-the-art facilities,  
all complemented by breathtaking art. At 
art’otel amsterdam, the 5&33 bar and restaurant 
experience is uniquely accessible and stylish, 
with 	 the 	 f ocus 	 on 	 fr esh 	 fl a v ours 	 and 	 out s tandin g

amsterdam seamlessly fuses art and life in  
the very heart of cosmopolitan Amsterdam. 
Building on the brand’s rich heritage, the  
hotel provides an inspirational environment  
for guests, team members and artists to share 
ideas, enhance their knowledge of art and 
immerse themselves in a culturally rich 
atmospher e . 	 Whether 	 an 	 a fi ci on ado , 	 cu ltur e	
vulture or novice art lover, every guest will  
find 	 ar t ’ o t el 	 ams t er dam 	 pr o f oundly 	 insp irin g	
and highly creative, yet also approachable  
and inclusive.
Brilliantly positioned in the city centre with  
the lively Dam Square and Kalverstraat on its 
doorstep, art’otel amsterdam places guests at 
the heart of the action. The city’s exceptional 
restaurants, bars and clubs are close at hand 
and, being located just across from Centraal 
Station, Amsterdam Schiphol Airport is within 
easy reach.
Within the hotel, guests are exposed to a myriad 
of artistic experiences. The work of Atelier Van 
Lieshout permeates every corner, a spectacular 
12-metre art curtain displays emotive footage 
and a 300-square-metre art gallery hosts a varied 
programme of exhibitions from emerging and 
established artists. Add to that a dynamic 
cultural agenda of events and workshops and  
a comprehensive art library, and the atmosphere 
is one of creativity and inspiration.

Signature Artist 
Atelier Van Lieshout is the internationally 
recognised studio of Dutch artist Joep van 
Lieshout. Joep van Lieshout started out as  
a solo artist, and rose to fame in the early 
eighties, producing objects in bright 
coloured polyester – the material that would 
become his trademark. In 1995 he founded 
Atelier Van Lieshout, leading a group of 
like-minded individuals in his search for 
creative and aesthetic solutions. 
Atelier Van Lieshout produces objects  
that balance on the boundary between art, 
architecture and design. Recurring themes  
in the work of Atelier Van Lieshout are power, 
politics and autarky, as well as a fascination 
for life, its creation and its end in death. With 
this body of work, both autonomous and 
commissioned, Atelier Van Lieshout has 
attained international recognition. Over the 
past 25 years, Atelier Van Lieshout has had 
exhibitions at major art institutions and 
collections worldwide. 
At art’otel amsterdam, the works shown in the 
exhibition the Course of Life all, in some way 
or another, refer to the different steps and 
stages in human life. In some of the selected 
pieces, this theme is more explicitly visible 
than in others. These works all focus on the 
central themes of life and death, beginning 
and end, alpha and omega – and everything 
that lies between: the Course of Life.

Welcome 
I am particularly proud of what our teams have 
achieved in 2013. It has been an exciting year 
with strong trading in London, increased 
ownership in several hotels in The Netherlands 
and several corporate developments all of which 
will help us to enhance growth. Our London 
hotels continued to trade strongly and Germany 
delivered a steady performance. Trading 
conditions in The Netherlands remained volatile, 
despite the much-anticipated 2013 celebration 
year for Amsterdam, which failed to bring us as 
m a n y 	 b e n e fi ts 	 as 	 e xp e c t e d .
During the year our teams focused on 
maintaining RevPAR through occupancy,  
in anticipation of certain fragile markets, 
challenging 2012 comparatives and increased 
supply in most of our markets. In local currency, 
our owned hotels in London achieved a 4.9% 
growth in revenue. The London market has 
proven to be highly resilient and we are 
therefore pleased that we have been able to 
further strengthen our development pipeline  
in this appealing travel and investor destination. 
Our development pipeline in London now 
includes three new hotel projects and one 
r econ fi gurati on 	 and 	 e x t ensi on 	 wh i ch, 	 when	
completed, are expected to increase our  
room count in London by approximately  
47% to nearly 3,300.
Disposal
After having carefully reassessed the project 
at Pattaya Bay in Thailand, I am pleased to 
a d v i s e	t h a t	t h e	d i s p o s a l	g a v e	r i s e	t o	a	p r o fi t ,	
although the consideration is deferred for 
three years. 
Investing in our portfolio
During the course of 2013, we continued  
to invest in our hotels to ensure that we  
retain our strong competitive positions in  
the markets in which we operate. In Croatia, 
following a successful 2012 inaugural season, 
Park Plaza Medulin completed its renovation 
scheme with all rooms now fully renovated. 
We also completed the renovation of the 
rooms of the former Hotel Palma with 127 
rooms now added to the room inventory of 
P a r k	Pl a z a	H i s t r i a	P u l a ,	t h e	b r a n d ’ s	fl a g s h i p 
in Istria. 
A major milestone for us was the highly 
a n t i c i p a t e d	o p e n i n g	o f	o u r	l a t e s t	fl a g s h i p	
hotel, art’otel amsterdam. This hotel was set 
t o	r e d e fi n e	t h e	b r a n d	p o s i t i o n i n g	f o r	a r t ’ o t e l ,	
elevating it to a luxury, lifestyle level. Since it 
opened in October 2013, art’otel amsterdam 
has been very well received by the market, 
generating very positive feedback for both 
the hotel and the separately operated  
and marketed 5&33 restaurant, bar and 
gallery space. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
OFFICER’S STATEMENT 
WE ARE COMMITTED TO 
DRIVING GROWTH
BORIS IVESHA 
PRESIDENT AND CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OFFICER –24–
The 5&33 concept was our second successful 
standalone dining concept introduced in the 
year as it was preceded by the launch of TOZI 
(located at Park Plaza Victoria London). Similar 
to 5&33, TOZI is a shared-dining concept aimed 
at a local clientele and both new concepts are 
currently rated among the top restaurants in 
their respective markets. Since it opened in 
April 2013, TOZI, for example, has not left the 
top 20 of best restaurants in London, as 
f e atur ed 	 on 	 in fluenti a l 	 websit e 	 trip advisor . com,	
out of more than 16,000 restaurants in London. 
5&33 has been consistently rated as a top-10 
r es taurant 	 in 	 Ams t er dam, 	 r egu l arly 	 cl a im in g 	 firs t	
position, according to couverts.nl, one of The 
Netherlands’ leading restaurant websites. 
Strategic relationship and marketing
Our more than a decade long partnership with 
the Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group continues  
to go from strength to strength and we are 
pleased to see the global direction this 
partnership has taken. In a global industry,  
it is important to have a clear distribution, 
marketing and sales strategy through which all 
sta k eh o l de rs 	 b e n e fi t 	 fr o m 	 e c o n o m i es 	 o f 	 sca l e ,	
negotiating power and innovative market leading 
initiatives, all of which are engrained in the 
Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group vision and 
roadmap. The various loyalty programmes, in 
which our hotels participate, continued to grow 
their memberships and we experienced more 
contribution of these programmes in the form of 
direct business and award stays being consumed 
at our hotels. Members of the Club Carlson 
programme are also more likely to return than 
non-members, their loyalty score is higher and 
the average room rate associated with member 
stays is higher than from non-member stays.
New for the year was the launch of a dedicated 
loyalty programme for small and medium sized 
enterprises. This programme will help us to 
compete better in our local markets by 
offering our customers a strong global value 
pr o posi tion 	 of 	 t r a v el 	 benefit s 	 and 	 at t r ac ti v e 	
discounts. We are particularly excited about 
the various initiatives Carlson Rezidor Hotel 
Group has in development with Google, such 
as Google Hotel Finder and Google Wallet, 
which will help us to improve our marketing 
reach and aide our objective to generate  
more business direct. Another milestone is  
the integration of tripadvisor.com reviews on 
o ur 	 hot el 	 we bsi t e s. 	 W e 	 t ak e 	 confid ence 	 in 	 o ur 	
products and services and offer our customers 
easy access to ratings and reviews from guests 
who have already stayed with us. 
Guest experience
Consistently delivering exceptional 
customer service remains one of the 
strongest differentiators within our industry 
and our continued investment in learning and 
development programmes has contributed 
to another stellar performance. Our overall 
service performance for the year increased 
to 8.50, another record. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
OFFICER’S STATEMENT

 “THE KEY 
REQUIREMENT TO 
CONTINUOUSLY DELIVER 
EXEMPLARY SERVICE IS  
TO HAVE A HIGHLY 
MOTIVATED AND 
ENGAGED WORKFORCE.”  –25–
The key requirement to continuously  
deliver exemplary service is to have a highly 
motivated and engaged workforce. Our 
employee satisfaction survey results for the 
year were again impressive and a new record 
was achieved. Areas in which our employees 
rated our Group particularly high included 
ethical standards and personal development, 
which showed a good year-on-year growth,  
a direct result of investment in training. Areas 
such as loyalty and ambassadorship increased 
year on year, which are important to ensure 
continuity in service delivery. The response 
rate was at another record level, with 93%  
of our workforce participating.
Corporate Social Responsibility 
Sustainability and responsible business  
are part of our strategy and operations and 
several hotels were recognised during the  
year for their work in these areas, including 
additional accreditation of certain hotels.  
We minimised employees travelling between 
o ur 	 cor por at e 	 of fice 	 and 	 r eg ional 	 of fice s 	 and 	
hotels, by investing in a state of the art 
video-conferencing system. We supported 
various charitable causes throughout the year 
on a corporate and hotel level, including but  
not limited to our annual participation in 
Movember, the prostate cancer charity initiative. 
 “A MAJOR MILESTONE 
FOR US WAS THE HIGHLY 
ANTICIPATED OPENING OF 
ART’OTEL AMSTERDAM. THIS 
HOTEL WAS SET TO REDEFINE 
THE BRAND POSITIONING FOR 
ART’OTEL, ELEVATING IT TO A

capital expenditure programme, with further 
renovation work planned at hotels in all of our 
markets. Our core hotels in The Netherlands and 
the United Kingdom will be renovated and in 
some cases repositioned, to further strengthen 
their appeal. Our acquisition of the freehold 
interests of art’otel berlin mitte and art’otel berlin 
kudamm paves the way for renovations of these 
properties, commencing in 2014. 
In Croatia, the former Hotel Belvedere has 
now closed for extensive renovations and, 
once completed, this hotel will open as Park 
Plaza Belvedere Medulin in summer 2014.  
This will be our fourth and largest Park Plaza 
hotel to open in this attractive tourist 
destination and Park Plaza Hotels & Resorts  
is now one of the largest international hotel 
brands in Croatia. On completion of this 
renovation, more than 50% of Arenaturist’s 
hotel rooms will have been extensively 
renovated between 2012 and 2014. 
An impressive feat given the challenging 
economic conditions and we see it as a 
demonstration of our skills to successfully 
redevelop, reposition and operate hotels. 
Current trading and outlook
T h e	fi r s t	q u a r t e r	o f	t h e	y e a r	i s	t r a d i t i o n a l l y	 
our weakest. Nevertheless in comparison  
with 2013, our RevPAR performance in 
January and February improved year  
on year. Overall results are in line with  
the Board’s expectations in all markets.
Over the next two years, we will be 
s i g n i fi c a n t l y	i n v e s t i n g	i n	o u r	p o r t f o l i o	 
with renovations planned across ten hotels. 
This work is undertaken to ensure our hotels 
continue to improve on their strong market 
positions. We aim to minimise the impact on 
our operations through careful planning and  
a phased approach where possible. However, 
once renovations commence, we anticipate 
reduced capacities and a short-term impact 
on revenue due to temporary closures of 
rooms and public areas. Although this may  
be at the expense of short-term revenue 
gains, we believe that this investment will 
have a positive impact on our long-term 
results and position in the markets in which 
we operate.

OUR PEOPLE AND SERVICES
Irrespective of the business type, all hotels in our portfolio benefit from  
being part of a dynamic, full-service international hotel group led by  
a highly experienced, loyal and involved senior management team. 
PPHE Hotel Group has clearly defined values and operates to very high 
standards. The Company provides a wide range of services to hotels including 
hotel operations, global distribution, sales, revenue management, marketing, 
customer retention management, public relations, finance, human resources, 
learning and development, project design, development services, asset 
management, restaurants and bars operations, legal support, IT and  
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). 
OUR CUSTOMERS
Our customers appreciate our friendly, yet business minded attitude. They 
appreciate the high level of services we offer, the excellent locations and 
contemporary design of our hotels and the reasonable prices we charge. 
The Company’s mission statement is ‘inspiring our guests through individuality 
and passion’, and customers can experience our service-led philosophy first 
hand in five countries, in key leisure and business cities such as Amsterdam, 
Berlin and London or in resort destinations such as Croatia. Customers can 
book our hotels 24/7, be it direct with us, through any of our sophisticated 
platforms such as the websites, apps or mobile sites, through the extensive 
loyalty programmes, or via intermediaries or any of our strategic partners. 
OUR SHAREHOLDERS
Our shareholders believe in our business model, operating skills 
and developments. 
Shareholder value is created through continued improvement of operations, 
revenue growth, active asset management, financial restructuring, expansion  
and development.
Our business types
Full ownership Joint ventures Management 
contracts
Operating 
leases
Franchise 
agreements
We know what to 
look for when 
identifying assets  
with development 
potential, from plots 
of land to tired hotels 
in need of investment. 
We aim to own hotels 
in key gateway cities 
in Europe where 
capital value is likely 
to appreciate.
Our joint ventures 
take many forms, but 
they share the same 
strategy – we focus on 
developing a mutually 
beneficial working 
relationship to return 
maximum profits for 
all parties involved, 
combining our 
management skills  
with co-investment.
A management 
contract allows 
owners to retain 
ownership of their 
property while  
we undertake  
the day-to-day 
management. They 
have the confidence  
of working with a 
leading hotel brand 
while we run their 
hotel with efficiency 
and passion.
Institutional investors 
may favour operating 
leases, whereby we 
lease their property  
and pay them rent.  
We manage all aspects 
of the operation of the 
hotel, from sales  
and marketing to 
reservations and food  
& beverage to human 
resources, thereby 
reducing their exposure 
to economic and 
business downturns.
The franchise option 
is ideal for partners  
who enjoy running 
their own hotel but  
seek the reassurance 
of industry-leading 
support services  
such as distribution, 
marketing and  
central reservations. –28–

2013 performance
Market conditions remained competitive in 
2013, particularly in The Netherlands, and 
our focus was on driving occupancy and 
maintaining our competitive market position, 
albeit at a lower average room rate. This, along 
with a negative impact from foreign exchange, 
including the weakness of Sterling against the 
Euro, were factors in a lower year-on-year 
reported EBITDA performance. EBITDA 
margin reduced to 33.8%, a reduction of 
160bps. On a like-for-like basis EBITDA  
margin was 34.3%, down 110bps.

Enhancing our service quality through 
improving our operational performance 
Our approach
Continue to grow employee and guest 
satisfaction and loyalty by consistent delivery 
of exceptional customer service, underpinned 
by investment in our people development. 
2013 performance
Exceptional customer service remains a key 
differentiator within our industry. Making our 
guests feel welcome and consistently offering 
a high quality of service and an excellent 
overall experience are essential to our 
success and remained a key focus during 
2013. Our mission is to inspire our guests 
through individuality and passion. 
We pride ourselves on our highly motivated 
and engaged workforce and our ongoing 
investment in our employees through 
bespoke training programmes, such as our 
‘Feeling Welcome’ induction programme 
which helps new employees to gain a full 
understanding of our vision, mission, values 
and goals, which support the delivery of a 
tailored service culture across our hotels.  
Our commitment and investment in employee 
training and development programmes was 
r eflec t ed 	 in 	 o ur 	 em plo y ee 	 s ati s f ac tion 	 s ur v ey 	
which achieved an 82.9% employee satisfaction 
score (scale 1–100%) with a record 93% 
participation rate. In particular, employees 
highly rated the Company’s ethical standards 
and personal development programmes, 
which both showed good year-on-year growth. 
Our people are committed to ensuring that  
our customers’ experience is at the heart  
o f 	 e v er y th in g 	 we 	 do . 	 Satisfi ed 	 gues t s 	 ar e

and tend to be less sensitive to price. They are 
also more likely to promote our hotels to their 
family, friends and work colleagues through 
word of mouth and social media platforms. 
During 2013, more than 67 ,000 customers 
completed our online customer feedback  
forms and we were pleased to see that service 
satisfaction among guests increased year on 
year. As rated by our guests, overall service 
performance increased to a record 8.50 (scale 
1–10), contributing to an overall guest 
satisfaction score of 8.30 (scale 1–10).
We will continue to invest to improve our 
operational performance and respond to  
the needs of our guests and employees alike.

Our approach
We are focused on driving growth through

combined with a focus on a high quality

hotel, art’otel amsterdam, which opened in 
September 2013. The opening repositioned 
the art’otel brand to a luxury lifestyle  
offer and added a further 107 rooms  
in this key destination. 
In 	 the 	 Un it ed 	 Kin gdom, 	 we 	 acqu ir ed 	 an 	 o f fi ce	
building near Waterloo Station in London with  
the potential to convert and develop a 400+ 
room hotel. Planning consent has been granted 
and, on completion, this development will make 
us one of the largest operators on London’s 
South Bank. Planning permission was granted 
f or 	 an 	 e x t ensi on 	 and 	 r econ fi gurati on 	 o f 	 P ark	
Plaza Riverbank London which will enable  
us to expand this hotel. In addition we 
continued to advance development plans for 
art’otel london hoxton and our development 
site in West London. In total, we have 1,046 
rooms in our United Kingdom development 
pi peline , 	 w hic h 	 wo uld 	 si g nific antl y 	 inc r ea s e 	 o ur 	
footprint in the attractive London hotel market. 
In Germany, we acquired the freehold interests 
in two hotels in Berlin, which were previously 
managed by us, and plan to embark on a 
renovation and repositioning exercise at these 
hotels during 2014. Construction of Park Plaza 
Nuremberg is expected to commence in 2014, 
with an anticipated opening date in 2015. 
During the course of 2013, we continued to 
invest in our hotels in order to cement our 
market leading positions with renovation 
projects completed in Hungary and Croatia. 
Looking ahead, a proposed €16.0 million 
investment in renovation projects is being 
considered for six of our hotels located in  
the United Kingdom and The Netherlands 
f o l l o w i n g	t h e	s u c c e s s f u l	r e fi n a n c i n g	o f	n i n e	
hotels in December 2013. This investment 
would be over and above normal capital 
expenditure requirements. 
Through successful delivery of these and 
other projects, we aim to increase the number 
of guest rooms in our portfolio by over 1,200 
rooms to approximately 9,500 by the end  
of 2017 and drive continued revenue growth.

2013 performance 
Our 	 fl a gsh ip 	 ho t el 	 ar t ’ o t el 	 ams t er dam, 	 the 	 fi rs t	
of a new generation of art’otels with enhanced 
services, amenities and a new identity, was 
formally opened in October 2013. This unique 
ho t el 	 r ede fines 	 the 	 traditi on a l 	 ho t el 	 e x peri ence	
and allows guests to stay within a highly creative 
environment surrounded by art. The cultural 
experience that art’otel amsterdam offers our 
customers is a key differentiator and provides 
the hotel with a clear market position within  
the competitive hotel market in Amsterdam. 
Looking ahead, we will adopt several of  
the services and features offered there as 
hallmarks for the art’otel portfolio. 
Over the last 12 months we have continued  
to invest in expanding our online footprint  
in 	 r esponse 	 t o 	 the 	 si gn ifi cant 	 gr o w th 	 in 	 on l ine	
booking activity across multi-platforms and 
growth in social media. Several new agreements 
were signed during the year with established 
online travel agents through whom we can 
target previously untapped markets. Particular 
areas of focus for us included search engine 
optimisation and the further development of 
online advertising campaigns with the main 
search engines, travel comparison websites and 
af fi l i at e 	 net work s . 	 These 	 ac tiviti es 	 h a v e 	 led 	 t o	
further growth in revenue generated through 
our websites. A particular trend we continued  
to see in 2013 was the growth in importance of 
mobile devices, with year-on-year revenue 
generated from such devices increasing 
by more than 70%.

Our approach
Continue to make progress in managing and 
mitigating our impact on the environment and 
positively contributing to the local communities 
in which we operate through a robust, proactive 
and measurable approach to Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR). Our aim is to reduce the 
Company’s 2011 CO

the end of 2017 .
2013 performance
During 2013, we have made considerable 
progress in expanding and improving our 
CSR policy and have adopted a proactive 
approach towards monitoring and analysing 
CSR activities and initiatives undertaken 
across the Company. 
We have been actively involved in a number  
of environmental and fundraising activities 
to manage and mitigate our impact on the 
environment while continuing to contribute 
positively to the local communities 
surrounding our hotels. 
Our green initiatives have been embedded 
across the business and a full overview  
is included in our ‘Feeling Welcome’ 
Company-wide induction programme  
for new employees. 
Our Save Energy and Switch Off Now (SEASON) 
initiative is a key element of our employee 
training programmes. By the end of 2013 all

been reduced by 5.5% and there has been a 
corresponding reduction of 6% in greenhouse 
gas emissions.
In recognition of our initiatives and green 
credentials we achieved the Gold Award  
from the Green Tourism Business Scheme  
for Park Plaza Riverbank London in the year.
We remain committed to reducing waste sent

close to their heart and every year charitable 
activities take place at a Company, regional 
and hotel level contributing to the local 
communities in which we have a presence.

  In the like-for-like comparison figures, 
the financial contribution of Park Plaza 
Amsterdam Airport, Park Plaza Victoria 
Amsterdam and Park Plaza Utrecht in 2013 
has been calculated on the basis of the 
ownership interest of PPHE Hotel Group in 
those hotels during the same period in 2012. 
The trading of art’otel amsterdam since 
opening in the fourth quarter of 2013 has 
been ignored. Furthermore, the results of 
two hotels in Berlin were adjusted to reflect 
a similar asset ownership structure during 
the same period in 2012.

  The Group’s result performance is negatively 
affected by a 4.6% reduction in average 
Sterling to Euro exchange rate, as the Group’s 
hotels in the United Kingdom account for 
approximately 65% of Group hotel revenue. 
Constant currency reported financial statistics 
ignore this 4.6% year-on-year decrease and 
the 2012 average Sterling to Euro exchange 
rate is applied to the 2013 reported statistics.  –46–
Total revenue
During the period, reported total revenue for  
the Group grew by 1.2% to €245.0 million (2012: 
€242.1 million). This growth was primarily driven

Reported basic/diluted earnings per share  
for the period decreased by 61.6% to €0.63 
(2012: €1.64). Normalised earnings per share 
was €0.54 (2012: €0.59), representing an 8.5%

(total equity / number of outstanding shares) 
amounts to €7.0 (2012: €6.26).
Dividend
For the last two years the Board has 
recommended the payment of an interim and 
fin a l 	 divi dend 	 o f 	 6. 0 	 pence 	 per 	 sh ar e 	 m akin g 	 a	
total of 12.0 pence per share for each year. The 
Board is proposing the payment of an increased 
fin a l 	 divi dend 	 o f 	 8. 0 	 pence 	 per 	 sh ar e , 	 wh i ch	
when combined with the interim dividend of  
6.0 pence per share paid on 11 October 2013, 
amounts to a total dividend for the year ended 
31 December 2013 of 14.0 pence per share,  
an increase of 16.7%. Such is the belief in the 
strength of the business that we anticipate to 
follow a progressive dividend policy going 
forward. Subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting, to be held on 11 June 
2014, the dividend will be paid on 13 June 2014 
to shareholders on the register at 28 March 2014. 
The shares will go ex-dividend on 26 March 2014.
Foreign exchange impact
The Company reported a €2.2 million foreign 
e x ch a n ge 	 l o ss 	 i n 	 i ts 	 p r o fi t 	 a n d 	 l o ss 	 a c c o u n t 	 
(2012: €0. 1 million). This loss is primarily caused  
by the conversion of outstanding consideration 
due by Red Sea Hotels Limited (related party) in 
connection with the Pattaya disposal, which is 
denominated in Thai Baht.
Financial position
Net bank debt as at 31 December 2013 was 
€483.0 million, an increase of € 22.3 million  
(as at 31 December 2012: €460.6 million).  
This includes €43.2 million of liquid assets  
(as at 31 December 2012: €46.2 million),  
of which cash and cash equivalents were  
€41.7 million (as at 31 December 2012: €44.9

During the period, the movement in net bank

of the art’otel amsterdam development. In 
addition, a decrease of €6.8 million relates to

due to the reported annual redemption of loans. 
The Group’s gearing ratio (net bank debt as a 
percentage of total capital (equity adjusted  
for the hedging reserve plus net bank debt) 
improved by 0.6% to 61.4% (as at 31 December

Looking ahead
We are excited about the future prospects  
of the Group. As we look ahead, we will focus on 
driving growth through delivering our existing 
pipeline, investing in and repositioning several  
of our core assets, and further improving our 
operations through revenue generation. The 
planned renovations across several of our hotels 
may have a temporary negative impact on the 
performance of these hotels due to closures of 
rooms and public areas. However, we believe 
that our investment in these renovation projects 
will have a positive impact on our long-term 
performance.
The Company continues to consider options of 
how to best fund future expansion, including the 
release of part of the value of hotel assets, while 
retaining operational control.

€159.4 (2012: €169.2). EBITDA decreased by 
4.7% to €56.7 million; however, the results for 
the region were negatively impacted mainly 
due to the weakness of Sterling against the 
Euro. On a constant currency basis, EBITDA 
decreased by only 0.2%. Our 2013 EBITDA for 
the United Kingdom was further negatively 
impacted due to a property tax adjustment 
assessed by the tax authorities relating  
to historic periods of approximately  
£2.0 million (€2.4 million).

Renovation projects and  
development pipeline
In April 2013, we opened a brand new restaurant 
concept, TOZI, at Park Plaza Victoria London, to 
much acclaim. TOZI, a name which is derived 
from the Venetian dialect for ‘a group of close 
friends’, is an Italian sharing concept restaurant. 
The restaurant’s performance has exceeded our 
expectations and has consistently ranked in  
the Top 20 best restaurants in London on 
i n fl u e n t i a l 	 w eb s it e 	 trip a dviso r . c o m 	 out 	 o f	 
16,000 London restaurants. 
On 17 June 2013, the Company acquired  
a n	o f fi c e	b u i l d i n g ,	H e r c u l e s	H o u s e ,	n e a r	
Waterloo Station in London. We have since 
applied for planning consent to develop a 
438-room hotel on this site. Planning consent 
was granted on 28 March 2014. During 2014, 
we will continue to develop our plans for this 
site, which once opened, will make us one of 
the largest operators on London’s South Bank. 
On 21 November 2013, we were granted 
planning permission from Lambeth Town 
Council for an extension at Park Plaza 
Riverbank London. We are currently reviewing 
plans for the development of this extension,

The United Kingdom hotel market
The London hotel market delivered marginal 
growth year-on-year, which was driven by a 
growth in occupancy. Across greater London, 
occupancy increased by 2.2 percentage 
points to 82.4%. Average room rate however 
declined by 1.6% to £137.9, resulting in RevPAR 
growth of 0.6% to £113.6.

in the Leeds and Nottingham markets.  
In Leeds, growth was driven by a combination  
of increased occupancy and average room 
rate. For the year, occupancy increased by  
6.2 percentage points to 75.9%, with average 
room rate increasing by 4.4% to £56.0, 
resulting in an overall RevPAR growth  
of 10.9% to £42.5. 
In Nottingham, occupancy increased by 
7.4 percentage points to 69.6%, with average 
room rate decreasing by 0.3% to £49.9, 
resulting in an overall RevPAR growth of  
7.1% to £34.7.

Our Dutch hotel portfolio performance 
Overall our hotels in The Netherlands reported 
a 12.1% increase in total revenue to €42.4 
million (2012: €37.8 million). This growth was 
mainly due to our increased ownership in three 
hotels in The Netherlands, compared with the 
s ame 	 per iod 	 la s t 	 y ear , 	 and 	 t he 	 fir s t -time 	
contribution of the newly opened art’otel 
amsterdam, which opened in October.
EBITDA decreased by 7.1% to €11.4 million 
(2012: €12.3 million), primarily as a result  
o f	t h e	i n i t i a l	o p e r a t i n g	l o s s	i n	t h e	fi r s t	m o n t h s	
of trading of art’otel amsterdam and 
challenging market conditions.
On a like-for-like basis total revenue 
decreased by 0.4% to €37.7 million (2012:  
€37.8 million) and EBITDA declined by 5.6%  
t o	€ 1 1 . 7	m i l l i o n	( 2 0 1 2 :	€ 1 2 . 4	m i l l i o n ) ,	r e fl e c t i n g	
the continued challenging market conditions 
in The Netherlands.
Occupancy increased by 1.5 percentage 
points to 74.1% (2012: 72.6%); paired with  
a 1.0% decrease in average room rate to 
€107.4 (2012: €108.5), this resulted in a 1.0% 
increase in RevPAR to €79.6 (2012: €78.8).
Competitive performances varied by hotel, 
with Park Plaza Vondelpark, Amsterdam,  
Park Plaza Utrecht and Park Plaza Eindhoven 
outperforming their respective competitive 
sets in RevPAR terms. Park Plaza Amsterdam 
Airport improved its RevPAR performance 
year on year, while its competitive set lost 
ground. Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam 
reported a slight improvement in RevPAR

The Dutch hotel market
The hotel market in greater Amsterdam 
showed an improvement year on year, with 
overall RevPAR increasing 3.4% to €92.1. This 
growth was the result of a 2.1 percentage 
points growth in occupancy to 75.5% and an 
average room rate increase of 1.2% to €122.0. 
In Utrecht, the overall hotel performance 
deteriorated due to pressure on average 
room rates, which declined 4.8% to €88.7. 
Occupancy increased by 0.9 percentage 
points to 64.2%, resulting in a RevPAR 
decrease of 4.0% to €56.9. 
The hotel market in Eindhoven was similarly 
weak, with RevPAR decreasing 5.4% to €36.9. 
This was the result of a 3.1 percentage point

however, was further reduced to nil (2012: 
€(0.5) million loss). This improvement was the 
result of the acquisition of two properties, 
that were previously leased, resulting in  
lower lease expenses.

Having renovated 75 rooms at art’otel 
budapest in 2012, an additional 36 rooms 
were renovated in early 2013. No additional 
extensive renovations took place during 2013 
in this region. Following our acquisition of 
art’otel berlin mitte and art’otel berlin 
kudamm in July, we will embark on a 
renovation and repositioning exercise during 
2014 for both hotels. On completion of the 
renovation of art’otel berlin kudamm, this 
hotel will be rebranded as Park Plaza.
In addition, we will part renovate art’otel 
cologne and we expect to commence the 
construction of Park Plaza Nuremberg, with 
an anticipated new opening date of 2015.

BUILDING ON THE 
SUCCESS OF 2012 AND 
FURTHER HOTEL AND 
SERVICE UPGRADES  –59–
Arenaturist group is one of Croatia’s best known 
hospitality groups and consists of seven hotels,  
six holiday apartment complexes, eight campsites 
and 52 food and beverage outlets, all of which  
are located in Istria.
Arenaturist group caters primarily for European 
tourists and the majority of accommodation is 
only operational during the summer months.  
All properties are located in prime locations by 
the sea and are a short distance from either the 
3,000-year-old city of Pula or the touristic town  
of Medulin.
In 2008, we acquired a 20% stake in WH/DMREF 
Bora B.V. (Bora), the holding company of the 
Arenaturist group, and we were awarded the 
management agreement for Arenaturist. 
Arenaturist d.d. is listed on the Zagreb Stock 
Exchange. The Arenaturist group is accounted for 
as an associate in the consolidated statements.
The results from our investment in Bora (consisting 
of shares and loans) increased marginally with  
€ 0. 1 million. This includes a loss of the investment 
in shares of €2.6 million (2012: loss of €2.4 million) 
and an interest income on loans of €2.7 million  
(2012: €2.5 million).
Although this 20% stake attributes marginally

from the management agreements that were 
awarded to us as part of this investment.  
The Group realised a total of €2.5 million of 
management and marketing fee revenues  
in the year (2012: €2.4 million).
Following extensive renovations, three of 
Arenaturist’s hotels reopened as Park Plaza 
properties just before the start of the 2012 
summer season. In 2013, we were able to further 
capitalise on the improved market positions of 
these hotels, with all units reporting healthy 
growth in commercial terms, as well as guest 
satisfaction levels. 
The remaining rooms at Park Plaza Medulin were 
fully renovated before the start of the 2013 season

achieved through the renovation and conversion 
of the former Hotel Palma, located adjacent to 
Park Plaza Histria Pula.
Extensive renovation works started in November 
2013 at Hotel Belvedere. Once completed, this 
hotel will reopen in summer 2014 as Park Plaza 
Belvedere Medulin and will offer approximately 
430 rooms, making it our largest Park Plaza hotel 
in this market.

our ‘Feeling Welcome’ Company-wide induction 
programme for new team members providing  
an overview of the Company’s current green 
initiatives and the importance of sustainable 
operations in the different work places. During 
2013, we improved our communication with team 
members and guests, and provided updates on 
our CSR activities and best practice examples. 
Our Green Teams regularly publicise on social 
media, dedicated brochures, internal portal 
you:niverse and staff common rooms’ 
information boards. 
We understand the importance of energy 
ef fi ci ent 	 t echnologi es 	 in 	 pr eser vin g 	 and 	 sa vin g	
natural resources and as such we are working 
on updating our onsite systems to match 
evolving industry standards and improve 
energy savings through up-to-date equipment 
which now forms part of our capital expenditure 
planning process. We are delighted to report 
that all our properties are equipped with  
ener gy 	 ef fi ci ent 	 l i ght s 	 with 	 the 	 r esu lt 	 th at 	 5 7 %	 
of lights are LED. All hotels are committed to 
recycling paper, glass and cardboard. Where 
appropriate, a number of our hotels have 
installed onsite cardboard bailers, bottle 
crushers and food waste to water systems  
in 	 or der 	 t o 	 r educe 	 l andfi l l . 	 Owin g 	 t o 	 these	
initiatives across our Group we achieved 
a 10% reduction in waste per guest from  
the previous year. 
Managing CSR at the Group
Our CSR policy forms an integral  
part of our values and context  
and is proactively lived by the  
hotels and their teams.
In order to reduce our water consumption,  
we invested in eco-shower heads (14 out of 21 
hotels), water sense enabled toilets (16 out of 21 
hotels) and water restrictors in taps (18 out of  
21 hotels) which led to a 2% reduction in water 
consumption per guest from the previous year.
As a Company, we participate in initiatives  
that support CO
2
 reduction. Every spring a 
number of our hotels participate in Earth Hour, 
encouraging households and businesses to 
turn off their non-essential lights for one hour 
to raise awareness about the need to take 
action on climate change. In 2013, we started 
to procure green electricity for all our UK 
pr o per tie s, 	 meaning 	 a 	 si g nific ant 	 par t 	 of 	
consumed energy is now produced from 
renewable energy sources. We were delighted 
to achieve the Gold Award from the Green 
Tourism Business Scheme for Park Plaza 
Riverbank London.
Aided by the various green initiatives which 
took place in 2013, we reduced our energy 
consumption by 5.5% per guest in comparison 
with 2012 and, as a result, we achieved a 6% 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This  
is in line with our target which was set in 2012 –  
to reduce our 2011 CO
2
 emissions by 20% 
before the end of 2017.
To improve on our CSR initiatives and policy  
we set up various partnership programmes  
with external organisations which monitor our 
progress and provide necessary consultation.  
In 2013, we have successfully completed Carbon 
Reduction Commitment (CRC) auditing with  
the Carbon Trust for our UK operations and  
we are currently in the process of implementing 
tangible green initiatives backed by capital 
expenditure such as plant and machinery,

embedding a monitoring system for consumption 
analysis and developing a dedicated human 
behaviour programme which will provide  
our staff with a better understanding of 
 energy and water consumption. 
The Club Carlson programme launched  
a new initiative during the year, enabling 
members to donate their Gold Points to  
a carbon neutral community which helps 
thousands of people and hundreds of major 
companies around the world to measure, 
reduce and offset their CO
2
 emissions. 
Club Carlson
SM
, the global loyalty programme 
for Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group which 
includes our Park Plaza hotels and art’otels, 
b e c a m e	t h e	fi r s t	l o y a l t y	p r o g r a m m e	i n	t h e	
hospitality industry in 2013 to commit to a 
global carbon offsetting initiative. Carlson 
Rezidor offsets meetings for all Club Carlson 
For Planners meetings and events across the 
Group’s six global hotel brands totalling 1,077 
hotels in operation worldwide. The carbon 
offsetting is a free service for the meeting 
planners and each contribution is used to 
invest in renewable energy in India; and is 
combined with the planting of one tree for 
every tonne of carbon offset through Club 
Carlson For Planners events in the Great Rift 
Valley. This innovative offsetting solution will 
help to reduce our hotels’ and our customers’ 
carbon footprint. –62–
In addition to Club Carlson For Planners 
members, individual Club Carlson members 
have the opportunity to redeem their Gold 
Points to offset the carbon of their personal 
travel and to support the wind farms in India 
and the tree planting in Kenya.
People development and human resources 
2013 was an active year, with several new 
initiatives introduced such as the launch of  
new Learning & Development programmes  
to support the business and as a follow-up  
on the company-wide Inspirational Service 
Programme, the service recovery training  
and maximising sales opportunities; and a 
company-wide induction programme, ‘Feeling 
Welcome’, which will help new team members 
to gain a full understanding of our vision, 
mission, values and goals among others. 
The Group continued to invest in the  
talents of the business, in particular middle 
management, with the introduction of a 
foundation in management development 
p r o gra m m e 	 supp o r t e d 	 b y 	 cl e a rly 	 de fi n e d	
mentor and mentee roles and aimed at 
handpicked talents out of our organisation.
Community activities
The Group aims to support local communities. 
We provide opportunities for permanent/
part-time employment and exciting careers in 
hospitality with the Springboard charity helping 
people of all ages to achieve their full potential. 
With our increasing market presence, we began 
to support Engage Lambeth providing a 
well-planned training programme to young 
people to ensure that the local community 
tackles unemployment and obtains the right 
skills to prosper in career life. In 2013, we 
successfully recruited 25 talented individuals via 
this programme for various hotel departments. 
All our hotels in Germany and The Netherlands 
participate in apprenticeship programmes. 
We currently run catering and hotel school 
apprentice schemes with 114 apprentices, of 
whom 51 were hired in the last year after they 
had completed their apprenticeships.
Charitable activities
For the third consecutive year, we raised 
awareness of prostate cancer with our guests 
by participating in Movember. In 2013, our 
team members were exceptionally active in 
taking direct participation in the Movember 
campaign, setting a fundraising target of a 
minimum of €50 for each MoBro. Collectively, 
we raised over £20,000. 
Germany and Hungary 
In Germany, we have been providing support to 
seriously ill children and their families for a number 
of years through the Kinderhilfe foundation. In 
2013, we were intensively involved in arranging 
various activities which included the renovation  
of two apartments for family members, the 
organisation of Halloween and Christmas parties 
with drinks and presents for kids, and donating 
toys and clothes to a Kinderhilfe shop. 
The Netherlands
In 2013, our hotels in The Netherlands 
supported the annual Amsterdam Diner 
Foundation, which is dedicated to raising 
awareness of the importance of good health 
care in containing AIDS. Park Plaza hotels in  
The Netherlands sponsored overnight stays  
via an auction and lottery with all proceedings 
going to the charity.
United Kingdom
During November and December 2013, all  
our hotels in London, Leeds and Nottingham 
signed up for a StreetSmart fundraising 
campaign to help homeless people in local 
areas. A voluntary donation of £1 was added  
to hotel and restaurant bills which encouraged 
guests to make a small, but important 
contribution. We have received supportive 
feedback from our guests who welcomed  
the campaign, which raised £24,000. 
Throughout the year, our hotels in the United 
Kingdom were proudly supporting the 
phenomenal work of the Willow foundation,  
a charity that brings joy and happiness to 
thousands of terminally ill patients through 
organised experiences. 
Individual achievements
As a Company, we always encourage each of 
our individual hotels to follow and support local 
charities close to their hearts. In addition to the 
aforementioned foundations, hotels run events 
for charities of their own choice. To name some 
of them: in 2013, art’otel dresden arranged the 
provision of hot meals to homeless people 
during the winter months; our London hotels 
held a Macmillan cancer fundraising coffee 
morning; Park Plaza Leeds set up an abseiling 
challenge down the fourth tallest building in the 
city for Cash for Kids charity; Park Plaza hotels in 
The Netherlands launched a campaign to help 
KiKa foundation with children’s cancer research; 
Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam provided 
support to the Energy-4-All foundation to 
expand and speed up the research into 
disorders in energy metabolism.
We are looking forward to a challenging, 
r e w a r d i n g	a n d	p r o fi t a b l e	2 0 1 4 ,	a i m i n g	t o	
continue to reduce our environmental impact 
on target with our 2017 goals and to engage 
our team members while inspiring our guests 
through individuality and passion.  –63–
Certification
It is important for us to know if we are on the right track with our activities and we therefore highly value external 
accreditation. Several of our hotels have worked with the respective authorities within the CSR area and have  
received the relevant accreditation. We will be reviewing similar initiatives for our other hotels.

DIRECTORS’  
REPORT 
The Directors present their report and the 
audited financial statements of the Company 
for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Principal activities
The Company is a Guernsey registered 
company and through its subsidiaries,  
jointly-controlled entities and associates,  
owns, leases, operates, franchises and 
develops full service upscale and lifestyle 
hotels in major gateway cities and regional 
centres predominantly in Europe. 
The Group’s hotels operate under three 
distinct brands, Park Plaza
®
 Hotels  
& Resorts, art’otel
® 
and Arenturist.
The Group has an exclusive licence  
from Carlson
SM
, a global privately owned 
hospitality and travel company, to develop 
and operate Park Plaza
®
 Hotels & Resorts  
in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  
The art’otel
®
 brand is wholly owned  
by the Group.
The Company has a minority ownership 
interest in the Arenaturist group, one of 
Croatia’s leading hospitality companies. 
The Group’s portfolio of owned, leased, 
managed and franchised hotels comprises  
38 hotels offering a total of more than  
8,300 rooms.
The Group’s development pipeline includes the 
construction of four new hotels, the extension 
and reconfiguration of one hotel, and the 
rebranding of two hotels which together are 
expected to add approximately a further 1,200 
rooms to the portfolio by the end of 2017.
Business review 
A review of the business during the year  
is contained in the Chairman’s statement, 
Chief Executive Officer’s statement, strategy 
and performance overview, Chief Financial 
Officer’s statement and review of 2013.
Results and 2013 dividend 
The results for the year are set out in the 
attached Consolidated financial statements. 
Basic and diluted earnings per share for the 
year was €0.63 (2012: €1.64). The Board 
recommends to the Annual General Meeting 
to declare the payment of a final dividend of 
8.0 pence per share for the year ended 
31 December 2013. 
As a matter of Guernsey law, any payment of 
dividends must be made in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies (Guernsey) 
Law, 2008 (as amended). Prior to declaring 
any dividends, the Directors are required to 
carry out a liquidity or cash flow test and a 
balance sheet solvency test and must satisfy 
themselves on reasonable grounds that the 
Company will, immediately after the payment 
of the dividend remain solvent i.e. be able  
to pay its debts as they fall due and the value 
of its assets will continue to exceed the value 
of its liabilities. The test requires the Directors 
to make a future assessment by making 
reference to the solvency test being satisfied 
immediately after a distribution or dividend 
payment is made. If at the time a dividend  
or distribution payment is to be made, the 
Directors believe that the solvency test 
cannot be passed, then no payment may  
be made to the holders of shares.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
Internal controls and an effective risk 
management regime are integral to the Group’s 
continued operation. Overall responsibility  
for the risk management processes adopted  
by the Group lies with the Board. On behalf  
of the Board, the Audit Committee reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control 
policies and procedures for the identification, 
assessment and reporting of risks. In order  
to maintain oversight and seek comfort as to 
Group policies and procedures, the Group 
has an internal auditor who acts as a tool  
to rigorously and continuously test Group 
procedures. For further details in respect  
of the Group’s internal control processes, please 
refer to the Corporate Governance Report.
In this section we describe the Group’s 
principal risks and uncertainties. We provide 
information on the nature of the risk, actions 
to mitigate risk exposure and an indication  
of the significance of the risk by reference to 
its potential impact on the Group’s business, 
financial condition and results of operation 
and/or the likelihood of the risk materialising. 
Not all potential risks are listed overleaf. 
Some risks are excluded because the Board 
considers them not to be material to the 
Group as a whole. Additionally, there may be 
risks and uncertainties not presently known to 
the Directors, or which the Directors currently 
deem immaterial that may also have an 
adverse effect upon the Group.
Directors
The Directors, who served throughout the 
year were as follows:
• Eli Papouchado  
(Non-Executive Chairman)
• Boris Ivesha  
(President and Chief Executive Officer)
• Chen Moravsky  
(Chief Financial Officer)
• Kevin McAuliffe  
(Senior Independent  
Non-Executive Director)
• Elisha Flax  
(Independent Non-Executive Director)
• Nigel Jones  
(Independent Non-Executive Director)
On 13 May 2013, Mr. Papouchado appointed 
Yoav Papouchado as his alternate Director.
In accordance with good corporate 
governance practice, the entire Board will 
stand for re-election at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. Details of the 
Directors’ remuneration are included  
within the Remuneration Report. 
Employees
During 2013, taking into account all  
our hotels, under all types of contract, 
approximately 2,500 team members  
were working for the Group.
Share capital
The issued share capital of the Company 
together with the details of the movements  
in the Company’s share capital during  
the year are shown in Note 14 to the 
Consolidated financial statements.
Largest shareholders
The table provided on page 66 contains 
shareholders holding 3% or more of the 
issued Ordinary Shares (excluding treasury)  
as at 7 April 2014, of which the Company has 
been notified by its Registrar. 
Auditors
In accordance with the Code of Corporate 
Governance, the Audit Committee has 
reviewed the performance of the auditors for 
the year 2013 and has taken into account the 
findings of an FRC report on the 2012 audit 
which it received in January 2014. After careful 
consideration of the report and other 
operational issues, the Audit Committee has 
recommended to the Board of Directors that 
Kost Forer Gabbay & Kasierer, a member of 
Ernst & Young Global, be appointed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting as 
auditors of the Company, in place of Ernst 
& Young LLP.
Going concern 
The Board believes it is taking all appropriate 
steps to support the sustainability and growth 
of the Group’s activities. Detailed budgets and 
cash flow projections have been prepared for 
2014 and 2015 which show that the Group’s 
hotel operations will be cash generative during 
the period. This, taken together with their 
conclusions on the matters referred to below 
and in Note 1(c) to the Consolidated financial 
statements, has led the Directors to conclude 
that it is appropriate to prepare the 2013 
Consolidated financial statements on a  
going concern basis. –68–
DIRECTORS’ REPORT 
CONTINUED 
Risk and impact Mitigation Grading Year on year
Information technology and systems 
The Group is reliant on certain technologies and systems for the  
operation of its business. Any material disruption or slowdown of the Group’s 
information systems, especially any failures relating to its reservation system, 
could cause valuable information to be lost or operations to be delayed.
In addition, the Group and its hotels maintain personal customer data, which 
is shared with and retained by the Group’s partners. Such information may be 
misused by employees of the Group or its partners or other outsiders if there is 
an inappropriate or unauthorised access to the relevant information systems.
The Group invests in appropriate IT systems so 
as to obtain as much operational resilience as 
possible. Further, a variety of security measures 
are implemented in order to maintain the 
safety of personal customer information.
High
Market and hotel industry risks 
The Group’s operations and their results are subject to a number of  
factors that could adversely affect the Group’s business, many of which  
are common to the hotel industry and beyond the Group’s control, such  
as the global economic downturn, changes in travel patterns or in the 
structure of the travel industry and the increase of acts of terrorism. The 
impact of any of these factors (or a combination of them) may adversely 
affect sustained levels of occupancy, room rates and/or hotel values.
Although management continually seeks to 
identify risks at the earliest opportunity, many 
of these risks are beyond the control of the 
Group. The Group has in place contingency 
and recovery plans to enable it to respond to 
major incidents or crises and takes steps to 
minimise these exposures to the greatest 
extent possible.
High
The Group’s borrowings 
The majority of the Group’s bank borrowings are primarily with two bank 
lenders and these financing arrangements contain either cross-collaterisation 
or cross-default provisions. Therefore, there is a risk that more than one 
property may be affected by a default under these financing arrangements. 
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks associated with the Group’s 
existing bank borrowings and its ability to satisfy debt covenants. Failure to 
satisfy obligations under any current or future financing arrangements could 
give rise to default risk and require the Group to refinance its borrowings.
The Board monitors funding needs regularly. 
Financial covenant ratios are monitored and 
sensitised as part of normal financial planning 
procedures. For details of the Company’s 
hedging arrangements and financial covenants, 
please refer to Notes 30(h) and 17 to the 
Consolidated financial statements.
Medium
Fixed operating expenses 
The Group’s operating expenses, such as personnel costs, operating leases, 
information technology and telecommunications, are to a large extent fixed.  
As such, the Group’s operating results may be vulnerable to short-term  
changes in its revenues.
The Group has appropriate management 
systems in place (such as staff outsourcing) 
designed to create flexibility in the operating 
cost base so as to optimise operating profits 
in volatile trading conditions.
Medium
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
The exchange rates between the functional currency of the Group’s 
subsidiaries operating outside the Eurozone, and the Euro (the reporting 
currency for the purposes of the Consolidated financial statements) may 
fluctuate significantly, affecting the Group’s financial results. In addition,  
the Group may incur a currency transaction risk in the event that one of the 
Group companies enters into a transaction using a different currency from 
its functional currency.
The Group eliminates currency transaction risk  
by matching commitments, cash flows and 
debt in the same currency with the exception 
of the outstanding consideration in Thai  
Baht relating to the disposal of the site in 
Pattaya Bay, Thailand. After due and careful 
consideration, the Group decided not to 
hedge this currency risk.
Medium
The Park Plaza
®
 Hotels & Resorts brand and reservation system 
The Group’s rights to the Park Plaza
®
 Hotels & Resorts brand stem from a 
territorial licence agreement with Carlson
SM
, pursuant to which the Group has 
the exclusive right to use (and to sub-license others to use) the Park Plaza
®
 
Hotels & Resorts trademark in 56 countries within the EMEA region. This 
agreement also allows the Group to use Carlson
SM
’s highly cost-effective  
central reservation system. Failure to maintain these rights could adversely 
affect the Group’s brand recognition and its profitability.
The Group’s rights to use the Park Plaza
®
 
Hotels & Resorts brand and Carlson
SM
’s central 
reservation system are in perpetuity. This 
unique and exclusive partnership is reinforced 
by the Group’s continued focus on operational 
efficiency and portfolio growth through its 
intensified cooperation with Carlson
SM
.
Low
Key senior personnel and management 
The success of the Group’s business is partially attributable to the efforts  
and abilities of its senior managers and key executives. Failure to retain its 
executive management team or other key personnel may threaten the  
success of the Group’s operations.
The Group has appropriate systems in place 
for recruitment, reward and compensation 
and performance management. Development 
and maintenance of a Group culture also plays 
a leading role in minimising this risk.
Low
Development (projects)
The Group has various ongoing development projects which are capital intensive. 
These development projects may increase the Group’s expenses and reduce the 
Group’s cash flows and revenues. If capital expenditures exceed the Group’s 
expectations, this excess would have an adverse effect on the Group’s available 
cash. There is a risk that such developments may not be available on favourable 
terms, that construction may not be completed on schedule or within budget, and 
that the property market conditions are subject to changes on environmental law 
and regulations, zoning laws and other governmental rules and fiscal policies.
The Group retains an ownership interest in the 
development sites and therefore it is well placed 
to capitalise on any future rises in property 
prices. The Group tends to enter into fixed price 
turn-key contracts in respect of its developments 
in order to minimise the risk of cost overrun. 
 The Group draws on its previous experience  
in running and managing developments to 
manage potential development risks.

Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are required to prepare the 
Directors’ Report and the Consolidated 
financial statements for each financial year 
which give a true and fair view of the state  
of affairs of the Company as at the end of  
the financial year and of the profit or loss  
for that year. 
In preparing those Consolidated financial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and  
apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that  
are reasonable;
• state whether applicable accounting 
standards have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Consolidated financial 
statements; and
• prepare the Consolidated financial 
statements on a going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors confirm that they have 
complied with the above requirements  
in preparing the Consolidated financial 
statements. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records which disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them  
to ensure that the Consolidated financial 
statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies (Guernsey)
Law, 2008 (as amended). The Directors are 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of  
the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection  
of fraud and other irregularities.
Directors’ declaration
So far as each of the Directors is aware,  
there is no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditor is unaware and each 
has taken all the steps he ought to have taken 
as a Director to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish  
that the Company’s auditor is aware of 
that information. 
Directors’ responsibility statement 
The Board confirms to the best of its 
knowledge that the Consolidated financial 
statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position  
and profit and loss of the Group. 
The Business review, the Chairman’s 
statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s 
statement and the Chief Financial Officer’s 
statement, all of which are incorporated  
into this report, include a fair view of the 
development and performance of the 
business, the position of the Group and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that  
they face and provides information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategies.

CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE 
THE DIRECTORS ARE 
COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING 
A HIGH STANDARD OF 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Introduction
As a company, whose shares are admitted to  
the standard listing segment of the Official List  
of the UK Listing Authority, the Company is not 
required to comply with the requirements of  
the UK Corporate Governance Code published 
by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in  
2012 (the ‘Corporate Governance Code’) and 
available from the FRC website (www.frc.org.uk). 
However, the Board recognises the value of high 
standards and has put in place a framework for 
corporate governance as described below and 
which, in the Directors’ opinion, is appropriate 
for the Group.
The Directors are committed to maintaining  
a high standard of corporate governance  
and intend to continue to comply with those 
aspects of the Corporate Governance Code 
which they consider appropriate, taking into 
account the size of the Company and the 
nature of its business.
KEVIN MCAULIFFE
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 
SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR –71–
Board composition, roles and independence 
The Company currently has six Directors,  
four of whom are Non-Executives (including 
the Chairman, Eli Papouchado). The two 
Executive Directors are Boris Ivesha, Chief 
Executive Officer and Chen Moravsky,  
Chief Financial Officer.
The Corporate Governance Code 
recommends that the Board of Directors  
of a listed company includes a balance of 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors such 
that no individual or small group of individuals 
can dominate the Board’s decision making. 
The Corporate Governance Code further 
recommends that the Chairman, on 
appointment, be independent. 
The Company’s Chairman, Eli Papouchado,  
is the founder of the Red Sea Group (of  
which Euro Plaza Holding B.V., the Company’s 
largest shareholder, is a part) and was  
not therefore on appointment, and is not, 
independent of the Company. However,  
the Board believes that Mr. Papouchado’s 
extensive experience and knowledge of  
the Group’s business as well as the hotel 
business generally justify this departure 
from the recommendations of the Corporate 
Governance Code. On 13 May 2013, Mr. 
Papouchado appointed Yoav Papouchado  
as his alternate Director.
As recommended by the Corporate 
Governance Code, three of the Directors  
(being more than half of the Board excluding the 
Chairman), namely Elisha Flax, Kevin McAuliffe 
and Nigel Jones are regarded by the Company 
as being independent of management and free 
from any business or other relationship that 
could materially interfere with the exercise of 
their independent judgement. Kevin McAuliffe  
has an indirect 1% interest in C.L. Secretaries 
Limited, the Company’s Secretary. The  
Board does not, however, consider this 
interest to be sufficiently material to affect 
Mr. McAuliffe’s independence. 
As recommended by the Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board has appointed 
Kevin McAuliffe as the Senior Independent 
Director to provide a sounding board for the 
Chairman and to serve as an intermediary for 
the other Directors when necessary. During 
the year, the independent Non-Executive 
Directors held meetings without the presence 
of Executive Directors and the Chairman.
The Board has responsibility for the Group’s 
strategic and financial policies and meets 
regularly. All the Directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Group’s General 
Counsel and Company Secretary and are able 
to gain access to external independent advice 
at the Company’s expense should they wish 
to do so in the furtherance of their duties.

An appropriate balance of Executive and 
Non-Executive members of the Board is 
maintained and the Board is supplied with 
regular and timely information concerning  
the activities of the Group in order to enable 
it to exercise its responsibilities and control 
functions in a proper and effective manner.
The Board has a breadth of experience 
relevant to the Company, and the Directors 
believe that any changes to the Board’s 
composition can be managed without  
undue disruption. With any new Director 
appointment to the Board, an appropriate 
induction will be set up. 
The Board considers agenda items laid out in 
the notice of Board meeting and agenda which 
are formally circulated to the Board in advance 
of the Board meetings as part of the Board 
papers and therefore Directors may request any 
agenda items to be added that they consider 
appropriate for Board discussion. In instances 
when the Chairman is not present, the Senior 
Independent Director will chair the meeting. 
Each Director is required to inform the Board  
of any potential or actual conflicts of interest 
prior to Board discussion.
The primary focus at Board meetings is a  
review of operating performance, potential 
investments and joint ventures and matters 
such as financing arrangements, as well as 
marketing/investor relations, risk management, 
general administration and compliance, peer 
group information and industry issues. 
The Board evaluates its performance and 
considers the tenure of each Director on 
an annual basis, and believes that the mix 
 of skills, experience, ages and length of 
service is appropriate to the requirements  
of the Company. The entire Board retires  
and stands for re-election annually at  
the Annual General Meeting. 
The roles of Chairman and the Chief Executive 
Officer are separate and clearly defined. The 
scope of these roles is approved and kept 
under review by the Board so that no individual 
has unfettered decision-making powers. 
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership 
and governance of the Board and the Chief 
Executive Officer for the management of the 
Group and the implementation of Board 
strategy and policy on the Board’s behalf. 
In discharging his responsibilities, the Chief 
Executive Officer is advised and assisted by 
senior management.
During the financial year, the Board  
held four Board and ten ad hoc Board  
Committee meetings.
Directors’ duties
The Directors have adopted a set of reserved 
powers, which establish the key purpose  
of the Board and detail its major duties.
These duties cover the following areas  
of responsibility:
• statutory obligations and public disclosure;
• strategic matters and financial reporting;
• oversight of management and  
personnel matters;
• risk assessment and management,  
including reporting;
• monitoring, governance and control; and
• other matters having material effects  
on the Company.
These reserved powers of the Board have 
been adopted by the Directors to clearly 
demonstrate the seriousness with which  
the Board takes its fiduciary responsibilities 
and as an ongoing means of measuring and 
monitoring the effectiveness of its actions. 
External appointments
Directors may hold directorships or other 
significant interests with companies outside 
of the Group which may have business 
relationships with the Group. Executive directors 
may not accept external directorships and retain 
any fees earned from those directorships without 
prior discussion with the Chief Executive Officer. 
Provided always that this does not lead to any 
conflicts of interest and that they do not hold 
more than one non-executive directorship in  
a FTSE 100 company nor the chairmanship of 
such company. In the case of the Chief Executive 
Officer, prior discussion will need to be held  
with the Chairman.
Directors’ indemnities and protections
The Company has arranged appropriate 
insurance cover in respect of any legal action 
against Directors and senior managers of 
companies within the Group. In addition,  
the Articles of Incorporation of the Company 
permit the Directors and officers of the 
Company to be indemnified in respect of 
liabilities incurred as a result of their office. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CONTINUED  –73–
Board Committees
In accordance with the Corporate 
Governance Code, the Company has 
established the following Committees in 
order to carry out work on behalf of the 
Board: an Audit Committee, a Remuneration 
Committee and a Nominations Committee. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee is comprised of  
Kevin McAuliffe (Non-Executive Director  
and Senior Independent Director), Elisha Flax 
(Non-Executive Director) and Nigel Jones 
(Non-Executive Director).
Contrary to the requirements of the 
Corporate Governance Code, none of  
the members of the Audit Committee have 
recent and relevant experience, which for 
these purposes is taken to be a professional 
qualification from one of the professional 
accounting bodies. However, the Board 
considers that the members’ substantial 
experience of dealing with financial matters 
is more than adequate to enable the Audit 
Committee to properly discharge its duties in 
light of the nature of the Company’s business. 
There have been four Audit Committee 
meetings during 2013.
For further details in respect of the  
Audit Committee’s role, function and 
responsibilities, please refer to the Audit 
Committee Report in this section.  
Remuneration Committee
A Remuneration Committee has been 
established and comprises Kevin McAuliffe 
(Chairman) and Elisha Flax. The Remuneration 
Committee advises the Board on an overall 
remuneration policy and meets as and when 
required. The Remuneration Committee  
also determines, on behalf of the Board,  
and with the benefit of advice from external 
consultants, the remuneration packages  
of the Executive Directors. The Board 
determines the remuneration of the  
Non-Executive Directors.
There has been one Remuneration 
Committee meeting during 2013.
Nominations Committee
A Nominations Committee has been 
established and comprises Elisha Flax 
(Chairman), Nigel Jones and Kevin McAuliffe. 
Whenever possible, all such Non-Executive 
Directors are present at meetings of the 
Nominations Committee. The Nominations 
Committee carries out the selection process 
for the appointment of candidates to the 
Board and proposes names for approval  
by the full Board.
There was one Nomination Committee  
Meeting held during 2013.
Communications with shareholders
The Board is accountable to the Company’s 
shareholders and as such it is important  
for the Board to appreciate the aspirations  
of the shareholders and equally that the 
shareholders understand how the actions  
of the Board and short-term financial 
performance relate to the achievement  
of the Company’s longer-term goals. 
The Board reports to the shareholders on its 
stewardship of the Company through the 
publication of interim and final results each year. 
Press releases are issued throughout the year 
and the Company maintains a website (pphe.
com) on which press releases and the annual 
report and accounts are available to view. 
Additionally, this annual report contains 
extensive information about the Company’s 
activities. Enquiries from individual shareholders 
on matters relating to the business of the 
Company are welcomed. The Executive 
Directors and Non-Executive Directors also 
meet with major shareholders to discuss and 
review the progress of the Company and to 
understand their issues and concerns, as well  
as discussing governance and strategy.
The Chief Executive Officer and the  
Chief Financial Officer provide periodic 
feedback to the Board following meetings 
with shareholders. 
The Annual General Meeting provides an 
opportunity for communication with all 
shareholders and the Board encourages  
the shareholders to attend and welcomes  
their participation. The Directors attend  
the Annual General Meeting and are available 
to answer questions. Details of resolutions  
to be proposed at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company to be held on  
11 June 2014 are included in the notice of 
Annual General Meeting which has been 
posted to shareholders and can be found  
on the Company’s website pphe.com. –74–
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Internal controls
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility 
for establishing and maintaining the Group’s 
and the Company’s systems of internal control. 
These are designed to safeguard the assets  
of the Group and to ensure the reliability of 
financial information for both internal use  
and external publication.
The Group’s internal control procedures 
include Board approval for all significant 
projects. All major expenditures require either 
senior management or Board approval at  
the appropriate stages of each transaction. 
A system of regular reporting covering both 
technical progress of projects and the state  
of the Group’s financial affairs provides 
appropriate information to management to 
facilitate control. The Board reviews, identifies, 
evaluates and manages the significant risks 
that face the Group.
The Group has in place internal control and 
risk management systems in relation to the 
Group’s financial reporting process and the 
Group’s process for preparing consolidated 
accounts. These systems include policies  
and procedures to ensure that adequate 
accounting records are maintained and 
transactions are recorded accurately and fairly 
to permit the preparation of Consolidated 
financial statements in accordance with IFRS. 
Any systems of internal control can only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that 
material financial irregularities will be detected 
or that the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives is eliminated. The Directors, having 
reviewed the effectiveness of the system of 
internal financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management, consider  
that the system of internal control operated 
effectively throughout the financial year 
and up to the date the financial statements 
were signed.
Share dealing code
The Company has adopted a share dealing 
code for Directors and relevant employees, 
which is in accordance with the requirements 
of the Model Code for Securities Dealings  
(as set out in the Listing Rules of the  
UK Listing Authority).

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
Audit Committee
Audit Committee Members
The Audit Committee is comprised of  
Kevin McAuliffe (Non-Executive Director  
and Senior Independent Director), Elisha Flax 
(Non-Executive Director) and Nigel Jones 
(Non-Executive Director).
Role
The Audit Committee assists the Board in 
observing its responsibility of ensuring that the 
Group’s financial systems provide accurate and 
up-to-date information on its financial position 
and that the published Consolidated financial 
statements represent a true and fair reflection 
of this position. It also assists the Board in 
ensuring that appropriate accounting policies, 
internal financial controls and compliance 
procedures are in place. 
The Audit Committee receives and reviews 
information from the Chief Financial Officer, 
the Company Secretary, the internal audit  
team and the external auditors regularly 
throughout the year. 
External audit and external auditors
Ernst & Young LLP are the Company’s current 
external auditors.
The Audit Committee considers the 
appointment and re-appointment of the external 
auditors and reviews their terms of appointment 
and negotiates fees on behalf of the Company 
prior to making recommendations through the 
Board to the shareholders to consider at each 
Annual General Meeting.
In accordance with the Code of Corporate 
Governance, the Audit Committee has reviewed 
the performance of the auditors for the year 2013 
and has taken into account the findings of an 
FRC report on the 2012 audit which it received in 
January 2014. After careful consideration of the 
report and other operational issues, the Audit 
Committee has recommended to the Board of 
Directors that Kost Forer Gabbay & Kasierer, a 
member of Ernst & Young Global, be appointed 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting as 
auditors of the Company, in place of Ernst 
& Young LLP .
In accordance with corporate governance 
requirements, the Audit Committee reviewed  
the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditors and has reported to the 
Board that it considers that the external 
auditors’ independence and objectivity  
have been maintained. 
To analyse audit effectiveness, the Audit 
Committee meets with management to 
discuss the performance of the external 
auditors without them being present. Separate 
meetings are also held with the external 
auditors without the presence of any member  
of executive management.
Internal audit
The Audit Committee monitors and reviews 
the effectiveness of the internal auditor; 
agrees his annual work plan and reviews 
whether the internal auditor has the proper 
resources to enable him to satisfactorily 
complete such work plans. It also reviews 
status reports and considers management’s 
response to any major finding, providing 
support, if necessary, for any follow-up action 
required and ensures that the team obtains 
free and unrestricted access to all Group 
activities, records, property and personnel 
necessary to fulfil its agreed objectives.
To analyse audit effectiveness, the Audit 
Committee meets with management to 
discuss the performance of the internal 
auditor without him being present. Separate 
meetings are also held with the internal 
auditor without the presence of any  
member of executive management.
Financial reporting
Prior to submission to the Board, the Audit 
Committee monitors the integrity of the 
financial statements and annual accounts  
and confirms that they have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards and the 
requirements of Guernsey law.
The Audit Committee reviews draft annual  
and interim reports before recommending 
their publication to the Board. The Audit 
Committee discusses with the Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and external 
auditors the significant accounting policies, 
estimates and judgments applied in preparing 
these reports.
The Audit Committee also reviews the  
reports to shareholders and any other public 
announcement concerning the Group’s financial 
position, corporate governance statements  
and statements on the Group’s system of 
internal controls and reports its views to the 
Board to assist in its approval of the results 
announcements and the Annual Report. –76–

Each Non-Executive Director has specific

Remuneration policy 
The Company's remuneration policy is

Executive Directors and senior managers with

to attract, retain and motivate individuals of 
the quality required to achieve the Group's

Note 1 General 
a. The Consolidated financial statements of PPHE Hotel Group Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the year 
ended 31 December 2013 were authorised for issuance in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 28 April 2014. 
b. Description of business and formation of the Company: 
The Company was incorporated and registered in Guernsey on 14 June 2007. The shares of the Company are publicly traded. 
The Company’s primary activity is owning, leasing, developing, operating and franchising primarily full-service upscale and lifestyle 
hotels in major gateway cities and regional centres predominantly in Europe. 
c. Assessment of going concern: 
As part of their ongoing responsibilities, the Directors have recently undertaken a thorough review of the Group’s cash flow forecast 
and potential liquidity risks. Detailed budgets and cash flow projections have been prepared for 2014 and 2015 which show that the 
Group’s hotel operations will be cash generative during the period.  
 
The Group has entered into a number of loan facilities, the details of which are set out in Note 17. The Board believes that the Group 
currently has adequate resources and in the future will generate sufficient funds to honour its financial obligations and continue its 
operations as a going concern for the foreseeable future. The Group analyses its ability to comply with debt covenants in the near 
future. During 2013, the Company succeeded in refinancing approximately 60% of the Company’s bank loans. Besides more 
favourable terms, through this refinance, the Company’s loans now have an average maturity date of five years, mitigating the  
liquidity risk of the Company. 
 
Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
a. Basis of preparation: 
 Statement of compliance 
The Consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial 
instruments and available-for-sale financial assets that have been measured at fair value. The Consolidated financial statements are 
presented in Euro and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (€’000) except when otherwise indicated. 
The Consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union, which comprise standards and interpretations issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee and endorsed by the 
European Union. 
The accounting policies used in preparing the Consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 
are set out below. These accounting policies have been consistently applied to the periods presented unless otherwise stated. 
b. Basis of consolidation: 
The financial statements of the subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using 
consistent accounting policies. All inter-company balances and transactions, income and expenses, and profits and losses resulting 
from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in full. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on 
which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date on which such control ceases. 
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group and are presented separately in 
the income statement and within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, separately from parent shareholders’ 
equity. 
The Group has interests in hotels in The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany, Hungary and Croatia. Furthermore, the Group had 
an interest in a mixed-use development project in Thailand until its disposal in 2013 (see Note 3(b)). For details on the Group’s 
subsidiaries and investments as at 31 December 2013 see Appendix A. 
For details on the Company’s interests in jointly controlled entities (proportionately consolidated as at 31 December 2013) 
see Appendix B. 
c. Changes in accounting policy and disclosures: 
The Company consistently applied its accounting policies and adopted on 1 January 2013, IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, IAS 19 
(revised 2011) Employee Benefits and the amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosure (regarding offsetting financial assets and liabilities). Furthermore, as part of the Annual Improvements process the following 
standards were amended effective 1 January 2013: IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IAS 1 
Presentation of Financial Statements, IAS 32 Financial Instruments, Presentation, Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and 
Equipment and IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The new accounting standards and interpretations have had the following impact 
on the financial statements.

Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
c. Changes in accounting policy and disclosures continued 
 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when an entity  
is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or 
permitted. This standard mainly impacted the method of valuation of the Group’s derivative financial instruments, which were 
previously valued at a settlement value; whereas under the new standard they are valued at an exit value, taking into account the 
valuation effect of the credit risk of the Group and the counterparty in derivative transactions. The effect of this change on the financial 
position and performance is not material in the current or prior years. This standard furthermore included some additional disclosures, 
which are provided in these financial statements (see Note 30(g)).  
 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (Amendments to IAS 1) 
These amendments introduce a requirement for entities to group items presented in “other comprehensive income” (OCI) on the 
basis of whether they can potentially be reclassified to profit or loss subsequently (reclassification adjustments). The amendments do 
not address which items are presented in OCI. The amendment affected the disclosures of the Group and did not have an effect on 
performance or the financial position. 
The other new or revised standards and interpretations, including the improvements did not impact the Group materially. 
d.  Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions: 
The preparation of the Group’s Consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, 
at the reporting date. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods. 
 Judgments 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, Management has made the following judgments, which have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated financial statements: 
 Acquisition of subsidiaries that are not business combinations 
At the acquisition date of subsidiaries and operations, the Company determines whether the transaction constitutes an acquisition of a 
business in a business combination transaction pursuant to IFRS 3. If the acquisition does not constitute a business as defined in IFRS 3, 
the cost of purchase is allocated only to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired company on the basis of their relative fair 
values at the date of purchase without allocating any amount to goodwill or deferred taxes, and including any minority interest 
according to its share of the fair value of net identifiable assets at the acquisition date. 
In determining whether a business was acquired, the Company evaluates whether the entity which was acquired is an integrated set of 
activities and assets capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. The following criteria 
which indicate acquisition of a business are considered: the variety of assets acquired, the extent to which ancillary services to operate 
the property are provided and the complexity of the management of the property. 
 Finance lease commitments – Group as lessee 
The Group has entered into commercial land leases. The Group has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions 
of the arrangements, that it holds all the significant risks and reward of ownership of the land and accounts for the contracts as 
finance leases. 
 Estimates and assumptions 
The key assumptions made in the Consolidated financial statements concerning uncertainties at the reporting date and the critical 
estimates computed by the Group for which there is a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. 
 Determination of fair values in the context of business combinations: 
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as ensuring 
appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and other relevant 
information at the acquisition date. The Group engages independent valuation specialists to determine such fair values. In the case 
of property, plant and equipment, the valuer uses valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow models .The key assumptions 
used to determine the fair value in the context of business combinations are further explained in Note 3. 
  
– 87 –  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
CONTINUED 
Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
d.  Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions continued 
 Impairment of non-financial assets: 
The Group’s impairment test for tangible and intangible assets is based on value in use calculations that use a discounted cash flow 
model. The cash flows are derived from the budget of the cash-generating unit being tested. The recoverable amount is most sensitive 
to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for 
extrapolation purposes.  
 Deferred tax assets: 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused carry forward tax losses and temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. The amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, is 
based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. Additional information is 
provided in Note 25. 
 Taxes: 
The Group is subject to income and capital gains taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine the 
total provision for current and deferred taxes. The Group recognises liabilities for current taxes based on estimates of whether 
additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, 
such differences will impact the income and deferred tax provisions in the period in which the determination is made. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are recognised on a net basis to the extent they relate to the same fiscal unity and fall due in approximately the 
same period. 
e. Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of 
the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. 
For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the 
non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed 
and included in administrative expenses. 
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. 
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts of the acquiree. 
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by 
the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a 
change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured in accordance 
with the appropriate IFRS. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and final settlement is accounted 
for within equity. 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised 
for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair 
value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in profit or loss. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that 
are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those 
units. Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss 
on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation 
disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained. 
 Business combinations involving entities under common control 
The Group accounts for business combinations that include entities under common control using the acquisition method provided 
that the transaction has substance. 
  
– 88 –  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
f. Investment in an associate: 
The Group’s investment in its associate is accounted for using the equity method. An associate is an entity in which the Group has 
significant influence. Under the equity method, the investment in the associate is carried in the statement of financial position at cost 
plus post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the 
carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. 
The income statement reflects the share of the results of operations of the associate. Where there has been a change recognised 
directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this, when applicable, in the 
statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are 
eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate. 
The share of profit of an associate is shown on the face of the income statement. This is the profit attributable to equity holders of the 
associate and therefore is profit after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associate. 
The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. Where necessary, adjustments are 
made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group. 
g. Jointly controlled entities: 
The Group has an interest in a joint venture which is a jointly controlled entity, whereby the venture has a contractual arrangement that 
establishes joint control over the economic activities of the entity. The agreement requires unanimous agreement for financial and 
operating decisions among the ventures. The Group recognises its interest in the joint venture using the proportionate consolidation 
method. The Group combines its proportionate share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the joint venture with 
similar items, line by line, in its Consolidated financial statements.  
The financial statements of the joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. Adjustments are made where 
necessary to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group. 
Adjustments are made in the Group’s Consolidated financial statements to eliminate the Group’s share of intra-group balances, 
transactions and unrealised gains and losses on such transactions between the Group and its jointly controlled entity. Losses on 
transactions are recognised immediately if the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realizable value of current assets or an 
impairment loss. The joint venture is proportionately consolidated until the date on which the Group ceases to have joint control over 
the joint ventures. 
h. Foreign currency translation: 
The functional currency of the Company is the Pound Sterling. The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro. Each 
entity of the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured 
using that functional currency. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into functional currency at the rates prevailing on the reporting 
date. Profits and losses arising from exchange differences are included in the income statement. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the entities whose functional currency is other than Euro are translated at exchange rates 
prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Equity items 
are translated at the historic exchange rates. Exchange differences arising on the translation are classified as a separate component of 
equity (foreign currency translation reserve). Such translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which 
the entity is disposed of. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and translated at the closing rate. 
Exchange differences in respect of loans denominated in Euro which were granted by the Company to its subsidiaries are reflected 
in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity, as these loans are designated as a hedge of the Group’s net investment in a 
foreign operation.

i. Intangible assets: 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.  
Intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life and assessed for impairment whenever 
there is an indication that the intangibles may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least 
at each financial year end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits 
embodied in the assets are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes 
in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense for intangible assets is recognised in the income statement.  
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured at the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.  
j. Property, plant and equipment: 
Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated 
using the straight-line method, over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets or the lease term as follows: 
The costs of maintaining property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred. Costs incurred 
that significantly increase the recoverable amount of the asset concerned are added to the asset’s cost as an improvement and 
depreciated over the expected useful life of the improvement.  
An item of property, plant and equipment, and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement when the 
asset is derecognised. 
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial year end, and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate. 
The Company distinguishes between sold and unsold apart-hotel units. Unsold units are depreciated using the straight-line method as 
mentioned above. Apart-hotel units which have been sold to individual purchasers are subject to a depreciation charge of zero as their 
residual value will be equal to their carrying amount. 
Apart-hotel units sold to purchasers will only be derecognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership of, and control over, 
the relevant units have passed to the purchasers.

k. Impairment of non-financial assets: 
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. Where it is not 
possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the asset is considered 
impaired and the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised as an expense immediately.  
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but not in excess of the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss 
been previously recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit). A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately. 
l. Financial instruments: 
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs, except for 
investments at fair value through profit or loss in respect of which transaction costs are carried to the income statement. 
After initial recognition, the accounting treatment of investments in financial assets is based on their classification into one of the 
following categories: 
1. Loans and receivables: 
The Group has loans and receivables that are financial assets (non-derivative) with fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market. After initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method taking into account transaction costs and less any allowance for impairment. Gains and losses are recognised 
in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the systematic 
amortisation process. Except for available for sale financial assets, all financial assets of the Company are classified as “loans  
and receivables”. 
 2. Available-for-sale financial assets: 
The Group has available-for-sale financial assets (presented in the financial statements under “other current financial assets”) that 
are financial assets (non-derivative) that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified as loans and receivables. After 
initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Gains or losses from fair value adjustments are 
recognised directly in other comprehensive income in the net unrealised gains reserve (included in other reserves in equity). When 
the investment is disposed of or in case of impairment, the cumulative gain or loss previously recorded in equity is recognised in 
the income statement. Interest income on investments in debt instruments is recognised in the income statement using the 
effective interest method. Dividends earned on investments are recognised in the income statement when the right of payment 
has been established. 
 3. Fair value: 
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique 
(see Note 30(g) for specific valuation methodologies). 
 Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly  
or indirectly. 
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable  
market data. 
The fair value of investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to market prices 
on the reporting date. For investments where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. Such 
techniques include using recent arm’s length market transactions; reference to the current market value of another instrument 
which is substantially the same; discounted cash flow or other valuation models. 
 4. Financial liabilities: 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. After initial 
recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method which also 
accounts for directly attributable transaction costs. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loan is 
derecognised as well as through the systematic amortisation process.

l. Financial instruments continued 
 5. Derecognition of financial instruments: 
  Financial assets 
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the Group has 
transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or assumes an obligation to pay the cash flows 
in full without material delay to a third party and has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 
  Financial liabilities 
A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, i.e. when the obligation is discharged or cancelled or expires. A financial 
liability is extinguished when the debtor (the Group) discharges the liability by paying in cash, other financial assets, goods or 
services; or is legally released from the liability. 
Where an existing financial liability is exchanged with another liability from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is accounted for as an extinguishment 
of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised 
in the income statement.  
 6. Impairment of financial assets: 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether the following financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired as follows: 
• Assets carried at amortised cost: 
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors are experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or 
delinquency in interest or principal payments or other observable data of a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash 
flows. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments carried 
at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss carried to the income statement is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that 
have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. In a subsequent period, the amount 
of the impairment loss is reversed if the recovery of the asset can be related objectively to an event occurring after the 
impairment was recognised. The amount of the reversal, as above, is credited to the income statement up to the amount 
of any previous impairment.  
• Available-for-sale financial assets: 
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, evidence of impairment would include a significant or 
prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost. Where there is evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss 
measured as the difference between the acquisition cost (less any previous impairment losses) and the current fair value, is 
removed from equity and recognised in the income statement. In subsequent periods, any reversal of impairment loss is not 
carried to the income statement but recognised as other comprehensive income.  
m. Inventories: 
Inventories include food and beverages and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes purchase cost 
on a first in-first out basis.  
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to make 
the sale. 
n. Inventories under construction: 
Inventories under construction are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of inventories includes direct 
identifiable construction costs, indirect costs and capitalised borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price  
in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to sell. 
o. Cash and cash equivalents: 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months 
or less.

Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
p. Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting: 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and 
are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the 
fair value is negative. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the  
income statement. 
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined using valuation techniques, including the discounted cash flow model. 
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows  
that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. 
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group 
wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation 
includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the 
entity will assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the cash flows attributable to the 
hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows and are assessed on an 
ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they 
were designated. 
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income, while the 
ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income 
statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is 
recognised. 
q. Trade receivables: 
Trade receivables recognised under current assets are stated at amortised cost (which in most cases is equal to their nominal amount) 
as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated uncollectible amounts. 
r. Revenue recognition: 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty. The Group assesses its revenue 
arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. The Group has concluded that it is 
acting as a principal in all of its revenue arrangements. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue 
is recognised: 
 Owned and leased hotels 
Primarily derived from hotel operations, including the rental of rooms, food and beverage sales and other services from owned and 
leased hotels operated under the Group’s brand names. Revenue is recognised when rooms are occupied, food and beverages are 
sold and services are performed. 
 Sale of apart-hotel units 
Revenue from the sale of apart-hotel units is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership and control have been 
passed to the buyer, typically the expiry of the period over which the Company has guaranteed returns (see Note 6). 
 Management fees 
Earned from hotels managed by the Group, under long-term contracts with the hotel owner. Management fees include a base fee, 
which is generally a percentage of hotel revenue, and an incentive fee, which is based on the hotel’s profitability. Revenue is 
recognised when earned and realised or realisable under the terms of the agreement. 
 Franchise fees 
Received in connection with a licence of the Group’s brand names, under long-term contracts with the hotel owner. The Group 
charges franchise royalty fees as a percentage of hotel revenue. Revenue is recognised when earned and realised or realisable under 
the terms of the agreement. 
 Marketing fees 
Received in connection with the sales and marketing services offered by the Group, under long-term contracts with the hotel owner.  
The Group charges marketing fees as a percentage of hotel revenue. Revenue is recognised when earned and realised or realisable 
under the terms of the agreement.

Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
r. Revenue recognition continued 
 Customer loyalty programme 
The Group participates in the Club Carlson
SM
 customer loyalty programme to provide customers with incentives to buy room nights. 
This customer loyalty programme is owned and operated by Carlson
SM
 and therefore the entity retains no obligations in respect of the 
award credits other than to pay the programme operator for the granted award credits. The customers are entitled to utilise the 
awards as soon as they are granted. 
The Group purchases these award credits from Carlson
SM
 and issues these to its customers in order to enhance its customer 
relationships rather than to earn a margin from the sale of these award credits. The Group concluded that it is acting as principal in this 
transaction and, in substance, is earning revenue from supplying these awards to its customers. The Group measures these revenues 
at fair value and recognises these gross from the costs of participating in the programme. 
s. Non-GAAP measures 
 EBITDAR 
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairment loss and rental expenses, share of associate and exceptional 
items presented as other income and tax (EBITDAR) correspond to revenue less cost of revenues (operating expenses). EBITDAR, 
together with EBITDA is used as a key management indicator.  
 EBITDA 
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, exceptional items presented as other income and impairment loss 
(EBITDA) correspond to gross profit after the operating costs of holding leased hotels. 
 EBIT  
Earnings before interest exceptional items presented as other income and tax (EBIT) correspond to gross operating profit after the 
operating costs of holding both leased and owned assets.  
t. Leases: 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
 The Group as lessor 
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
 The Group as lessee 
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are 
capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments.  
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in the income statement. 
Leased assets are depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain 
ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the 
lease term. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
 Prepaid leasehold payments 
Prepaid leasehold payments are up-front payments to acquire a long-term leasehold interest in land and building. These payments 
are stated at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the respective period of the leases (50 years). 
u. Employee benefits: 
 Share-based payments 
The Board has adopted a “Share Option Plan”, under which employees and Directors of the Company and its subsidiaries receive 
remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity 
instruments (equity settled transactions).  
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are 
granted. The fair value is determined by using an appropriate pricing model, further details of which are given in Note 16. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each 
reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement expense or credit for a period represents the movement 
in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period. 
  
– 94 –  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
CONTINUED 
 
Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
u. Employee benefits continued 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional 
upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting, irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting 
condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied. 
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms 
had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any modification that 
increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee, as measured at the 
date of modification. 
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised 
for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or 
the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on 
the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described 
in the previous paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally. 
 Pension 
The Group has a defined contribution pension plan where the employer is liable only for the employer’s part of the contribution 
towards the individual’s pension plan. 
The Group will have no legal obligation to pay further contributions. The contributions in the defined contribution plan are recognised 
as an expense and no additional provision is required in the Consolidated financial statements. 
v. Borrowing costs for qualifying assets: 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, are capitalised to the cost 
of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the 
temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs 
eligible for capitalisation.  
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
w. Taxation: 
 Current income tax 
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from 
or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date. 
 Deferred income tax 
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from an asset or liability 
in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit or loss; and in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly 
controlled entities, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in them relating to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income 
are recognised in equity or other comprehensive income and not in the income statement except: 
where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit or loss; and 
in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities, 
deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable 
future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised 
deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that 
future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
w. Taxation continued 
 Deferred income tax continued 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in them relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not 
in the income statement. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set-off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
x. Treasury shares: 
Company shares held by the Company are recognised at cost and presented as a deduction from equity. Any purchase, sale, issue 
or cancellation of treasury shares is recognised directly in equity. 
y. Earnings (loss) per share: 
Basic earnings (loss) per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit (loss) for the year attributable to shareholders 
of the parent company by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
Diluted earnings (loss) per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit (loss) for the year by the weighted average number 
of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of Ordinary shares that would be issued on the 
conversion of all the dilutive potential Ordinary shares into Ordinary shares. 
z. Standards issued but not yet applied: 
Standards issued but not yet effective, or subject to adoption by the European Union, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s 
Consolidated financial statements are listed below. This listing of standards and interpretations issued are those that the Group 
reasonably expects to have an impact on disclosures, finance position or performance when applied at a future date. The Group 
intends to adopt these standards when they become mandatory. 
The following standards have been issued by the IASB and are not yet effective and are subject to adoption by the European Union. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
The standard has been issued as the IASB completes each phase of its project to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement. The first elements of IFRS 9 were issued in November 2009 and October 2010 to replace the parts of IAS 39 that 
relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. In November 2013, an amendment was issued to address hedge 
accounting and to remove the previously determined effective date of 1 January 2015. Instead, the IASB proposes to set the effective 
date of IFRS 9 when it completes the impairment phase of the project. The European Union has already indicated that it will not begin 
the process of considering the adoption of IFRS 9 until the standard has been published in its final form. The Group is yet to assess 
IFRS 9’s full impact and will determine the date to adopt IFRS 9 once it is endorsed for use in the EU. 
 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements  
IFRS 10 builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be 
included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in 
the determination of control where this is difficult to assess. Based on the preliminary analyses performed, IFRS 10 is not expected to 
have any impact on the currently held investments of the Group. This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2014 (EU). As a consequence of this change IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements has been 
amended. 
 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements  
IFRS 11 determines the treatment of joint arrangements by focusing on the rights and obligations of the arrangement rather than its 
legal form. There are two types of joint arrangement: joint operations and joint ventures. Joint operations arise where a joint operator 
has rights to the assets and obligations relating to the arrangement and hence accounts for its interest in assets, liabilities, revenue and 
expenses. Joint ventures arise where the joint operator has rights to the net assets of the arrangement and hence equity accounts for 
its interest. Proportional consolidation of joint ventures is no longer allowed. The application of this new standard will impact the 
financial position of the Group by eliminating proportionate consolidation of the joint venture in Aspiration Ltd. With the application of 
the new standard, the investment in Aspiration Ltd will be accounted for using the equity method of accounting (see Note 29 for the 
amounts currently consolidated on a proportionate basis). This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2014 (EU), and is to be applied retrospectively for joint arrangements held at the date of initial application. As a consequence 
of this change IAS 28 Accounting for Associates has been amended to reflect the accounting for joint ventures under the 
equity method.

z. Standards issued but not yet applied continued 
 IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities 
Includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special 
purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles. A number of new disclosures are also required, but have no impact on the 
Group’s financial position or performance. This standard becomes mandatory for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 
(EU). 
The following other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations are not yet effective and it would be expected to have no material impact 
on the Group: 
- Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12: Consolidated Financial Statements, Joint Arrangements and Disclosure of Interests 
in Other Entities – Transition Guidance  
- Investment Entities (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27) (issued on 31 October 2012)  
- Amendments to IAS 39 Novation of Deirvatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting 
- Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-financial Assets 
- Amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions* 
- Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle* 
- Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle* 
- IFRIC 21, Levies 
All of the above are mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, except those marked * which are 
mandatory from 1 July 2014. 
 
Note 3 Acquisitions and divestments  
a.  Business combinations in 2012 
 On 30 March 2012 (“Acquisition Date”), PPHE Netherlands B.V. (a wholly owned subsidiary within the Group (PPHEN)) entered into 
an agreement to acquire the remaining 50% interest in, and related loan to, Park Plaza Amsterdam Airport, Park Plaza Victoria 
Amsterdam, Park Plaza Utrecht and the art’otel amsterdam project (together the “Hotels”) from a subsidiary of Elbit Imaging Limited 
(“Elbit”), for a nominal consideration of €26.5 million (fair value of the consideration is €25.9 million). On the Acquisition Date, the 
directors of Elbit resigned and the Company through PPHEN obtained full control over the Hotels. On 16 May 2012 (“Date of 
Transfer”), completion of the share transfer occurred.  
 The total consideration for the acquisition comprised: 
1. €23.0 million in cash which was satisfied in full on the Date of Transfer 
2. the issue of 700,000 shares at £2.11 per share in the capital of the Company (the “Consideration Shares”), with a fair value 
at Acquisition Date of €1.8 million, and 
3. a deferred consideration, payable on the fourth anniversary of the Date of Transfer under the terms of the agreement, equal 
to 700,000 multiplied by the shortfall of the closing price of the Company’s shares on the Date of Transfer below £4.17, subject 
to certain reductions set out in the agreement (the “Deferred Consideration”), but in any event, not exceeding £1.4 million 
(€1.7 million). The fair value of the deferred consideration at the Acquisition Date was €1.1 million. 
The Company has been granted an option to buy back all of the Consideration Shares which Elbit may own from time to time 
until the fourth anniversary of the Date of Transfer at a price of £4.17 per share. If the Company elects to exercise this option, the 
balance of the Deferred Consideration will be reduced by an amount equal to £2.06 multiplied by the number of shares bought back. 
Any such exercise would be subject to shareholder approval under Guernsey law. All amounts due to Elbit are fully guaranteed by 
the Company. 
As the Company has achieved full control over the Hotels, which were previously held under joint control, the transaction is accounted 
for as a business combination achieved in stages (“step acquisition”). Accordingly, Management has re-measured the Company’s 
previously held equity interests in the Hotels at the Acquisition Date at fair value and recognised a gain in 2012 of €45.7 million, which 
is recorded in other income along with the negative goodwill of €4.3 million.  
The previously held interest, representing the Company’s 50% shares, accounted for by using the proportionate consolidation method 
and on acquisition, the 100% interests were recorded at fair value, as disclosed on the next page.

The excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired over the consideration paid amounting to €4.3 million was allocated to 
negative goodwill on the basis of a final purchase price allocation and is presented under “other income”. The reason for this 
negative goodwill is the fact that the Group was in a good position to negotiate this transaction.

b. Divestments in 2013  
The Company completed a sale to Red Sea Hotels Limited (“Red Sea”) of all the Company's shares in its subsidiary, Leno Finance Limited 
(“Leno”), the company through which the Company owned its interest in the site in Pattaya Bay, Thailand, and certain related loans and 
receivables, for a total consideration of Thai Baht 600 million (€15.0 million). Red Sea is controlled by Mr. Eli Papouchado, Chairman of 
PPHE Hotel Group, who, together with his family trusts, owns 44.63% of the voting rights in the Company. Mr. Papouchado (and his family 
trusts) were deemed to be acting in concert with Mr. Boris Ivesha (the President and Chief Executive Officer of PPHE Hotel Group) and his 
family trust, which owns 19.25% of the voting rights in the Company.  
None of the consideration for the disposal was paid on completion, but will be payable by Red Sea in cash by no later than January 2017 
(by when it is expected that the project will have been completed). However, Red Sea will be required to pay the consideration (in whole 
or in part, as applicable) earlier to the extent either that revenues from the sale of condominium units and serviced apartments exceed 
the aggregate of the total project development costs (including all financing costs) and related tax liabilities or that value from the project 
is otherwise released to Red Sea.  
The present value of the outstanding consideration is calculated at Thai Baht 419 million (€9.3 million), taking into account a discount rate 
of 10%.  
The Company recognised a profit on the transaction of €2.8 million, which is presented under other income and expenses.  
As security for payment of the consideration, the Company has been granted a charge over shares in Leno representing 63% of Leno's 
share capital. Under the terms of the United Overseas Bank (“UOB”) facilities, the Company is obliged, among other things, to provide 
certain financial support in the event of a cost overrun or funding shortfall in relation to the project and, in the event of default by Bali Hai 
Company Limited (the Thai company undertaking the project that is the borrower under the UOB facility) after completion of the project, 
UOB can require the Company to purchase the serviced apartments for a consideration equal to the amount then outstanding under the 
UOB facilities, subject to a maximum of Thai Baht 600 million (€13.3 million). It was a condition of UOB’s consent to the sale of Leno that 
the Company continues to be bound by these obligations. Red Sea and Leno have agreed to indemnify the Company in respect of certain 
of these continuing obligations and as security Leno has pledged the shares held by it in Bali Hai Company Limited and certain affiliated 
Thai companies to the Company.  
The Company has also been granted an option to manage the completed development and/ or acquire the serviced apartment element 
of the Project for Thai Baht 600 million. However, the Group will not be under any obligation to Red Sea to proceed with either.

london 
hoxton, the Park Royal London project, Waterloo Development site and Park Plaza Nuremberg. The conversion of the Victoria 
Monument building (located in Amsterdam) into art’otel amsterdam was completed in the year and reclassified to land, buildings 
and furniture and equipment. 
b. The amount of borrowing costs capitalised during the year ended 31 December 2013 was €781,000 (2012: €887,000). The rate used 
to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation was 4.8% (2012: 4.8%), which is the average effective interest rate 
of the specific borrowing. 
(2) For information regarding liens, see Note 16.  
Land includes the following amounts where the Group is a lessee under a finance lease: 
The Group leases certain land in London under lease agreements longer than 100 years. 
The recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment had been determined on the higher of internal value in use calculations using 
discounted cash flow projections for the relevant cash-generating units and third party valuations. These projections are based on financial 
budgets approved by the senior management covering a five-year period. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 
9.0%-10% (2012: 8.65%) and cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2%-2.5%. In 2012, the Group 
recorded an impairment loss in respect of hotel properties in the UK segment in the amount of €6.2 million, which is included in 
depreciation, amortisation and impairment loss. 
Note 6 Apart-hotel units under management 
The construction of Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London was completed in 2010 and the hotel partially opened to paying customers in 
March 2010. As at 31 December 2010, the sale of 535 units had been completed. On the completion of each sale the purchaser was issued 
a “B” Ordinary share in the management company of the hotel, 1 Westminster Bridge Plaza Management Company Limited (“1WB”). 
Marlbray Limited (“Marlbray”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the owner of the freehold of the hotel, holds the sole 
voting share, being an “A” Ordinary share. This results in Marlbray having control in 1WB until the expiry of the period of guaranteed 
returns to purchasers (i.e. five years from the last completion).

Note 6 Apart-hotel units under management continued 
As long as control over 1WB, and therefore the indirect control over the apart-hotel units, stays within the Group, all of the conditions for  
revenue recognition from the sale of apart-hotel units are not met. Hence, in these Consolidated financial statements the assets have not 
been derecognised and the proceeds received from the purchasers (€182.7 million) have been accounted for as an advance payment until 
such time as they can be recognised as revenue (see Note 2(j)). For information regarding commitments and contingent liabilities, 
reference is made to Note 16.

Note 8 Investment in associate 
a. WH/DMREF Bora B.V.: 
In April 2008, Euro Sea Hotels N.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired 20% of the shares of WH/DMREF Bora B.V. 
(“Bora”) from a group of real estate investment funds. Bora currently owns approximately 74% of Arenaturist d.d., a public company 
listed on the Zagreb (Croatia) Stock Exchange, and 100% of three related private companies. These companies together own seven 
hotels, six apartment complexes and eight camp sites in or around Pula on the Istrian coast of Croatia. As part of the transaction, 
the Company also acquired 20% of the debt currently owed by Bora to its shareholders. The total consideration for the acquisition, 
including the debt acquired, was €22.4 million, which was funded by the Company from its existing cash resources. The investment 
in Bora is accounted for under the equity method in accordance with IAS 28. 
The interest rate on the shareholders’ loan is a fixed rate of 8.9% per annum and the denomination of the loan is Kuna. The repayment 
date of the loan is 31 August 2020.

c. Nature and purpose of reserves: 
 Other reserves 
The other reserves mainly consist of results of transactions that affected the equity of the Group before and during the listing on the 
Stock Exchange in 2007, the change in fair value of the available for sale financial assets and share-based payments. 
 Foreign currency translation reserve 
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements 
of foreign operations.  
 Hedging reserve 
This reserve is comprised of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge.  
Note 15 Share-based payments 
During 2007, the Company established a Share Option Plan (the “Plan”) with the following principal terms:  
a. The Plan has two types of options: Option A and Option B. The exercise price of both options will not be less than the closing price of 
a share on the dealing day immediately preceding the date of grant (as published in the Financial Times on the date of grant). Option 
A vests over a period of three years from date of grant and Option B vests at the end of three years from grant date. Unexercised 
options expire ten years after the date of grant. The Plan does not include any performance conditions. 
b. At any time, the total number of shares issued and/or available for grant (in a ten-year period) under the Plan or under any other 
employee share scheme which the Company may establish in the future may not exceed 5% of the Company’s issued share capital at 
that time. For the purpose of this calculation, any option granted under the Plan immediately following Admission to the AIM in July 
2007 is disregarded.  
The fair value of the options is estimated at the grant date using the binomial pricing model according to the terms and conditions 
upon which the options were granted.  
The following lists the inputs to the binomial model used in 2013 for the fair value measurement of the granted share options:  
The expected life of the share options is based on historical data, current expectations and empirical data. It is not necessarily indicative of 
exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility of similar listed companies 
over a period similar to the life of the options is indicative of future trends, which may not be reflective of the actual outcome. 
The expense arising from equity-settled share-based payment transactions during 2013 is €144,000 (2012: €13,000). As at 31 December 
2013, 262,000 options became exercisable (2012: 0).Total exercisable options at 31 December 2013 amounts to 506,800 (2012: 244,800).  
Movements during the year 
The following table illustrates the number (No.) and weighted exercise prices (EP) of, and movements in, share options during 2013 
and 2012: 
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2013 is eight years (2012: nine 
years).

Note 16 Pledges, contingent liabilities and commitments  
a. Pledges, collateral and securities: 
Substantially all of the Group’s assets and all of the rights connected or related to the ownership of the assets (including shares of 
subsidiaries and restricted deposits) are pledged in favour of banks and financial institutions as security for loans received. For most 
of the loans, specific assets are pledged as the sole security provided.  
b. Restricted cash: 
 (i) In connection with the development and sale by Marlbray of apart-hotel units (see Note 6), Marlbray received deposits from 
prospective purchasers in respect of pre-sold units (up to 25% of the contracted sale price). As at 31 December 2013, a balance 
of £7.9 million (€9.5 million), being forfeited deposits, is held in respect of the rescinded contracts of purchasers who failed to 
complete. Certain of these prospective purchasers have instigated proceedings seeking recovery of the forfeited deposits. 
The Company believes that a final court ruling in connection with these legal proceedings is not expected within the coming 
12 months and accordingly these balances are being classified as non-current. 
 (ii)  Under the facility agreement of Marlbray with Bank Hapoalim B.M. (Bank Hapoalim), sufficient funds are required to be 
deposited in the DSCR account until the sum deposited is equal to twice the amount of interest payable on the next interest 
payment date. The deposits in the DSCR account are presented as restricted in the financial statements and amount to  
£3.3 million (€3.9 million). 
c. Commitments: 
1. Management and franchise agreements: 
(i) The Group entered into a Territorial Licence Agreement (the “Master Agreement”) with Carlson Hotels Worldwide, Inc. 
(“Carlson
SM
”). Under the Master Agreement, the Group, amongst other rights, is granted an exclusive licence to use the brand 
“Park Plaza
®
 Hotels & Resorts” in 56 territories throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa in perpetuity (the “Territory”).  
The Master Agreement also allows the Group to use, and license others to use, the Carlson
SM
 Systems within the Territory which 
right includes the right to utilise the Carlson
SM
 System’s international marketing and reservations facilities and to receive other 
promotional assistance. The Group pays Carlson
SM
 a fee based on a percentage of the hotels’ gross room revenue. 
(ii) The Group entered into several management agreements with operated hotels and developed hotels located in The 
Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany, Hungary and Croatia in consideration for an annual fee of 2% to 3% of the hotels’ 
revenues, as applicable, as well as 7% to 10% of the gross operating profit. The Group is also charging sales and marketing fees 
as a percentage of revenue, as well as partially reimbursed for certain portions of the expenses incurred. The management 
agreements are for periods of 15 to 25 years. 
(iii) Within the terms of the management agreements, the hotels were granted by the Group a licence allowing them the utilisation, 
throughout the term of the management agreements, of the “Park Plaza
®
 Hotels & Resorts or art’otel
®
”name. 
2. Lease agreements: 
(i) The Group has entered into several finance lease agreements for the rental of land. Certain of the leases are subject to periodic 
rent reviews. The Group’s share in the future minimum rental payments under non-cancellable leases are as follows:

2. Lease agreements continued 
   Details regarding the finance lease agreements are as below: 
a) Grandis Netherlands Holding B.V. has a land leasehold interest expiring in 2095, of Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London. The 
current annual rent amounts to £810,000 (€972,000) (subject to “open market value” rent review every five years).  
 Grandis has an option to extend the lease to a total of 125 years, expiring in 2121. The Company also has an option to 
terminate the lease in 2059. 
 As at 31 December 2013, the rent review of 29 September 2011 is not yet complete and the landlord is seeking to increase 
the passing rent. An arbitrator has been appointed to determine the reviewed rent. If an increased rent becomes payable, 
Grandis will be required to pay the balance of rent due from 29 September 2011 plus interest, plus the increased rent going 
forward in accordance with the terms of the lease. Depending on the outcome of the review, Grandis could be liable to pay 
a proportion of the landlord’s legal costs.  
b) Riverbank Hotel Holding B.V. has a land leasehold interest expiring in 2125, in Park Plaza Riverbank London. The current 
annual rent amounts to £653,000 (€784,000), subject to rent review every five years.  
c) On 18 June 2012, Club A40 Holdings B.V. (Club A40) completed the purchase of the freehold property at 628 Western 
Avenue, Park Royal, London W3 (the “Site”) which is a development site on one of the main thoroughfares into London, for 
£6.0 million (€7.2 million). Simultaneously, Club A40 completed the sale of the Site at a price of £7.0 million (€8.4 million) and 
the leased-back of the Site at an initial rent of £306,500 (€367,000) per year (the “Sale and Leaseback”) for 170 years. Under 
the terms of the Sale and Leaseback, the Company is required to procure the construction of a 158-162-room hotel on the 
Site. The gain on this sale has been deferred in the statement of financial position as the leaseback is classified as a finance 
lease liability.  
(ii)  The Group operates hotels and occupies certain premises under various lease agreements in which the building, fixtures, 
furniture and equipment are leased. These tend to be long-term arrangements under which the Group leases a hotel from a 
third party property owner for periods of 20 to 25 years and often include options to extend for varying periods. Monthly rental 
payments are based on a percentage of the operating revenues or gross operating profit of that hotel subject, in most cases, to 
a minimum amount which is independent of the operating revenue or gross operating profit. The rental expenses presented in 
the income statement mainly consist of minimum lease payments. 
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 
3. Construction contract commitment: 
As at the reporting date, the Company, entered into capital commitments amounting to €0.3 million for construction of the Park 
Royal project.

4. Guarantees: 
a) On completion of each sale of the 535 apart-hotel sold units in Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London, Marlbray entered into 
income swap agreements with all (but four) of the unit holders. The income swap agreements include an obligation on the unit 
holder to assign the right to receive the net income derived from the unit to Marlbray and an undertaking by Marlbray to pay 
unit holders a rent guarantee of between 5% and 6% p.a. yield, depending on the agreed sale contract (with the exception of 
two units in respect of which the guaranteed annual return is less than 5%) on the purchase price for the five-year period 
commencing on the second month following the date of completion of the sale.  
The Company has agreed to guarantee the obligations of Marlbray under the income swap agreements. The remaining future 
obligation as at 31 December 2013 amounts to £13.4 million (€16.1 million). 
b) The Company guarantees all amounts due to Elbit in connection with the acquisition of Elbit’s interests in Park Plaza Riverbank 
London, Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Park Plaza Victoria London, Park Plaza Amsterdam Airport, Park Plaza Victoria 
Amsterdam, Park Plaza Utrecht and the art'otel amsterdam. The remaining obligation as at 31 December 2013 amounts to 
€2.9 million (see Note 18). 
c) The Company guarantees 65% of the amounts owed by Victoria Monument B.V. to Bank Hapoalim B.M. in relation to its 
financing the art'otel amsterdam project. As at 31 December 2013, 65% of the outstanding loan amount is € 16.9 million. This 
loan was refinanced in 2014 (see Note 31) and consequently this guarantee has expired.  
d) Under the terms of the UOB facilities received for the construction in Pattaya Bay, Thailand (the “Project”) the Company is 
currently obliged to provide certain financial support in the event of a cost overrun or funding shortfall in relation to the Project 
and, in certain circumstances, may be required to purchase serviced apartments after completion of the Project for a maximum 
consideration of Thai Baht 600 million (€15.0 million) to fund any amounts that are outstanding under the UOB facilities. The 
support deed provides that the Company shall maintain a Net Gearing Ratio (the ratio of (i) any interest bearing indebtedness 
owed to financial institutions or under financial debt instruments of the Company less any cash balances or cash equivalent 
instruments maintained by the Company to (ii) its Tangible Net Worth (total tangible assets less all external liabilities in respect 
of money borrowed or raised by the Company) not exceeding 3:1. In addition, the Company guaranteed practical completion 
of the Project. Red Sea Hotels Limited has agreed to indemnify the Company in respect of certain of these continuing 
obligations and as security Red Sea Hotels Limited has pledged the shares held by it in Bali Hai Company Limited (the 
company that owns the project in Pattaya Bay, Thailand), and certain affiliated Thai companies. 
  e) The Company guarantees all obligations of the tenant under parcel 1 of the lease agreement for Western Avenue 
(mixed use development Park Royal) up to the date of practical completion of the development of the hotel on site. 
The annual lease amounts to £0.3 million (€0.4 million).  
 f) The Company guarantees principal and interest under the €12.0 million facility granted by Bank Hapoalim B.M. to

to ABM Hotel Holding B.V. and ABK Hotel Holding B.V.  
i)  The Company guarantees principal and interest under a €30.0 million facility granted by Bank Hapoalim B.M. to Park Plaza 
Hotels Europe B.V. As of 31 December 2013, €10.0 million of this facility has been drawn.  
j) The Company has given a guarantee for all obligations under the lease agreement of the Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London. 
k) The Company guarantees principal and interest under the £12.0 million (€14.4 million) facility granted by Bank Hapoalim B.M. to 
Hercules House Holding B.V.

* €0.9 million relates to the 2012 business combination for the acquisition of hotels in The Netherlands as described in Note 3(a). € 2.1 million relates to the 2010 business 
combination for the acquisition of various hotels in the United Kingdom. Both amounts may be reduced depending on the performance of the Company’s shares during the 
five-year period following completion as follows. The deferred consideration for the UK transaction has the following reduction mechanism: 
a)  If at the settlement date, the average share price of the Company (over the last 60 business days) is higher than the Cap, the 
remaining cash payment is cancelled. 
b)  If at the settlement date, the average share price of the Company (over the last 60 business days) is lower than the Cap but 
higher than £1.50, the remaining cash payment will be reduced by the difference between the share price and £1.50 (“Floor”) 
multiplied by 1,000,000 shares. 
c)  If at the settlement date, the average share price of the Company (over the last 60 business days) is lower than the Floor the 
remaining cash payment is £3.5 million (€4.1 million). 
In both deferred considerations the fair value is estimated using the following variables: 
a)  The present value of the contingent cash payment using a discount rate of 5%.  
b)  Plus the value of an American call option (using a binomial model) with an exercise price of the Floor. 
c)  Minus the value of an American call option (using a binomial model) with an exercise price of the Cap.

d. Tax laws applicable to the Group companies:  
1. The Company is subject to taxation under the law of Guernsey. The Company is therefore taxed at the standard rate of 0%.  
2. Foreign subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in their country of domicile in respect of their income, as follows:  
a) Taxation in The Netherlands: corporate income tax rate is 25% (2012: 25%). 
b) Taxation in the United Kingdom: corporate income tax rate for domiciled companies is 25% and for non-domiciled 20%. 
c) Taxation in Germany: corporate income tax rate and business rates is 30.2%. 
d) Taxation in Hungary: corporate income tax rate is 18%. 
e. Losses carried forward for tax purposes: 
The Company and its subsidiaries have carried forward losses for tax purposes estimated at approximately €170.3 million (2012: 
€190.3 million). The Group did not establish deferred tax assets in respect of losses amounting to €160.6 million (2012: €179.3 million) 
of which tax losses amounting to €21.3 million may be utilised for a period up to seven years. The reason for not recognising deferred 
tax assets is that the recovery of carried forward tax losses is uncertain. The remaining tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

Note 30 Financial risk management objectives and policies 
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, restricted 
deposits and investment in shares and bonds. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s 
operations. The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly 
from its operations.  
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, including principally interest rate swap contracts. The purpose is to manage the interest 
rate risk arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. It is, and has been throughout the years under review, the Group’s 
policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board of 
Directors reviews and agrees on policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below. The Group’s accounting policies 
in relation to derivatives are set out in Note 2. 
a. Foreign currency risk: 
The Group is exposed to minimal foreign currency risk, due to transactions in foreign currency, as most of the transactions of each 
of the entities in the Group are denominated in the functional currency of the relevant entity, except for the outstanding consideration 
in Thai Baht relating to the disposal of the site in Pattaya Bay Thailand. After careful consideration the Group decided not to hedge 
this currency risk. A decrease in the Thai Baht against the Euro of 5%, results in the Group recording an exchange loss of approximately 
€0.6 million. 
b. Interest rate risk: 
The Group’s exposure to the risk for changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with 
a floating interest rate.  
The Group has five variable interest rate loans that are not hedged with interest rate swaps. Based on this sensitivity analysis 
calculation, the Management expects that with an increase/decrease of the three-month market (LIBOR) interest rate by 50bps 
the results of the Group would be changed by €0.4 million. 
The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using fixed rate debt. To manage its interest costs, the Group enters into interest rate 
swaps, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts 
calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. Furthermore, the Group uses fixed interest rate debts. For this 
reason the Group’s cash flow is not sensitive to possible changes in market interest rates. Possible changes in interest rates do, 
however, affect the Group’s equity or results as the fair value of the swap agreements changes with interest rate changes. These swaps 
are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.  
The fair value of the swaps of the Group as at 31 December 2013 amounts to a liability of €20.3 million (2012: liability of €34.8 million). 
The movements in the value have been accounted for in equity and profit or loss respectively. The Group performed a sensitivity 
analysis for the effect of market interest rate changes on the fair value of the swaps which was calculated by an external valuator. Based 
on this sensitivity analysis calculation, the Management expects that with an increase/decrease of the three-month market interest rate 
by 50bps, the fair value of the swaps, and the hedge reserve in equity would increase/decrease by €8.7 million (2012: €5.3 million) 
and the results would not be materially impacted by this. 
The Group uses short-term deposits (weekly and monthly) for cash balances held in banks.  
Restricted deposits that were received from unit holders (see Note 16(b)) were held in bank accounts in the United Kingdom bearing 
interest at an average annual rate of 0.9% (2012: 0.8%). If the interest rate increase/decrease is an average of 50bps, the profit of the 
Group would not change materially. 
c. Credit risk: 
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made 
to customers with an appropriate credit history. The Company’s policies ensure that sales to customers are settled through advance 
payments, in cash or by major credit cards (individual customers). Since the Group trades only with recognised third parties, there 
is no requirement for collateral for debts with third parties. Furthermore, the Group has no dependency on any of its customers. The 
receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis. Management monitors the collection of receivables through credit meetings 
and weekly reports on individual balances of receivables. Impairment of trade receivables is recorded when there is objective evidence 
that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The maximum credit 
exposure equals the carrying amount of the trade receivables and other receivables since the amount of all trade and other 
receivables has been written down to their recoverable amount. The result of these actions is that the Group’s exposure to 
bad debts is not significant.

CONTINUED 
Note 30 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued 
c. Credit risk continued 
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and investment 
in securities, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the 
carrying amount of these instruments. The Group has limited concentration risk in respect of its cash at banks. 
d. Market risk: 
As at 31 December 2013, the Group has an available-for-sale investment in securities, in the amount of €1.5 million (2012: €1.3 million). 
The securities are presented at their quoted market price and changes in market price are recorded in equity. If the market prices of 
the securities increase/decrease by an average of 5%, the equity of the Group would increase/decrease by €75,000 (2012: €65,000). 
e. Liquidity risk: 
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and 
bank loans. The Group’s policy is to arrange medium-term bank facilities to finance its construction operation and then to convert 
them into long-term borrowings when required. 
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities as at 31 December 2013 and 2012 based 
on contractual undiscounted payments.

f. Capital management: 
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios 
in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value. 
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. The Group monitors 
capital using a gearing ratio, which is net bank debt divided by total capital plus net bank debt. The Group’s policy is to keep the 
gearing ratio between 60% and 70%. The Group includes within net bank debt, interest bearing bank loans and borrowings, less 
cash and cash equivalents and other liquid assets. Capital includes equity less the hedging reserve.  
g.  Fair value of financial instruments: 
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included in the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to 
estimate the fair values:  
Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, and other current assets and liabilities approximate their carrying 
amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
Long-term fixed-rate and variable-rate receivables/borrowings are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such as interest rates, 
specific country risk factors, and individual creditworthiness of the customer and the risk characteristics of the financed project. Based 
on this evaluation, allowances are taken to account for the expected losses of these receivables.  
The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks and other financial liabilities, obligations under finance leases as well as other 
non-current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, 
credit risk and remaining maturities. 
Fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is derived from quoted market prices in active markets. A market is regarded as active  
if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory 
agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market 
price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in Level 1. The Group enters 
into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Derivatives are valued using 
valuation techniques, for swap models, using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit 
quality of counterparties, and interest rate curves.  
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined 
by using valuation techniques, based on a discounted cash flow. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market 
data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an 
instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. 
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.

 Fair value hierarchy 
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique 
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value so determined: 
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly  
or indirectly. 
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable  
market data. 
As at 31 December 2013, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:

h. Derivative financial instruments: 
The majority of the Group’s borrowings are at variable interest rates based on LIBOR or EURIBOR. To limit its exposure to changes in 
the rates of the LIBOR and EURIBOR on its cash flows and interest expense, the Group has entered into various interest rate swaps, as 
described below: 
1. On 3 December 2013, the Group entered into two interest rate swaps with Aareal with a nominal value of £136.5 million (€163.8 
million) and €121.7 million with fixed quarterly interest payments at a rate of 2.77% and 1.70% per annum respectively.  
 As at 31 December 2013, the fair value of the swaps is estimated at a liability of €10.0 million.  
 The Company meets the relevant criteria in IAS 39 to apply hedge accounting and the fair value changes of swaps in the hedge 
relationship that are determined to be effective are recorded in the other comprehensive income. All fair value movements that are 
determined to be ineffective are recorded in the income statement immediately. The amount recorded in the other comprehensive 
income amounts to €1.7 million. The total amount of ineffectiveness recorded in the income statement amounts to €0.3 million.

2. In 2004, Laguna Estates (Leeds) Limited (“Laguna“) and Katmandu Limited (“Katmandu“) entered into an interest rate swap 
according to which they swapped the variable interest rate as follows: 
 Laguna swapped the variable interest rate of three month LIBOR on a loan of £15.0 million (€18.0 million) received from the Royal 
Bank of Scotland plc, bearing fixed quarterly interest payments, at the rate of 5.13% for the period until January 2019. As at 31 
December 2013, the fair value of the swap is estimated at a liability of £2.2 million (€2.6 million). Katmandu swapped the variable 
interest rate of three-month LIBOR on a loan of £6.0 million (€7.2 million) received from the Royal Bank of Scotland plc, bearing 
fixed quarterly interest payments, at the rate of 5.54% for the period until 31 May 2027. As at December 2013, the fair value of 
the swap is estimated at a liability of £1.5 million (€1.8 million). 
Laguna and Katmandu meet the relevant criteria in IAS 39 to apply hedge accounting and the fair value changes of swaps in the 
hedge relationship that are determined to be effective are recorded in the other comprehensive income. All fair value movements 
that are determined to be ineffective are recorded in the income statement immediately. 
The amount recorded in the other comprehensive income amounts to €2.1 million. The total amount of ineffectiveness recorded 
in the profit and loss account amounts to €0.5 million. 
3. In 2013, ABM Holding B.V. (ABM) and ABK Holding B.V. (ABK) entered into interest rate swap transactions pursuant to which ABM 
and ABK swapped the variable interest rate of three-month LIBOR on a loan from Deutsche Hypothekenbank. The swap nominal 
amounts are €12.5 million, which is amortising over the term of the loan. The swap bears a fixed rate of 1.9%, for a period until April 
2023. As at 31 December 2013, the fair value of the swaps is estimated at a liability of €0.1 million. All fair value movements were 
assessed effective and the change in fair value is recorded in other comprehensive income. 
4. In 2011, Marlbray entered into several interest rate swap transactions pursuant to which Marlbray swapped the variable interest rate 
of three month LIBOR on a loan from Bank Hapoalim B.M. The swap nominal amounts are £111.0 million, with amortising nominal 
amounts. The swap bears a fixed quarterly interest payment, at a rate of 2.64%–3.18% per annum, for the period until June 2018. As 
at 31 December 2013, the fair value of the swap is estimated at a liability of £4.9 million (€5.8 million). All fair value movements were 
assessed effective and the change in fair value is recorded in the other comprehensive income. The amount recorded in other 
comprehensive income amounts to £6.2 million (€6.6 million). 
Note 31 Subsequent events  
1. On 29 January 2014, the Company announced that the €24.0 million refinancing with Aareal Bank AG of the recently opened 
art'otel amsterdam which the Company owns and operates was successfully completed (art’otel Refinance Tranche). The art'otel 
amsterdam was previously financed by a development facility provided by Bank Hapoalim that was due to mature in the first 
quarter of 2014. The parties agreed not to hedge the exposure to changes in the interest of the art'otel Refinance Tranche. 
2.  On 13 January 2014, the Group entered into a 50:50 joint venture in relation to art’otel berlin mitte and art’otel berlin kudamm (the 
“Hotels”) with the Nakash group and its wholly owned entities (“Nakash”). 
 The Group sold to Nakash 50% of the shares in the companies which own the freeholds and the operating businesses of the Hotels 
and assigned 50% of the shareholder loans made by the Group to those companies for an aggregate consideration of €3,180,425. 
This was satisfied by the discharge in full of the loan of that amount that had been advanced by one of Nakash's affiliates in order 
to facilitate completion of the acquisition of the Hotels in July 2013. The Company and Nakash will also contribute €1,000,000 each 
for the renovation of the Hotels. 
 Under the joint venture, Nakash has agreed to indemnify the Company against 50% of any liability it may incur under its guarantee 
to Deutsche Hypothekenbank. 
3.  The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 8.0 pence per share (2012: 6.0 pence per share), which will absorb £3.3 million 
of equity.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
To the members of PPHE Hotel Group Limited
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of PPHE Hotel Group Limited for the year ended 31 December 2013 
which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows and the related Notes 1 to 31. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 262 of the Companies (Guernsey) 
Law, 2008. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 69, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• proper accounting records have not been kept; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

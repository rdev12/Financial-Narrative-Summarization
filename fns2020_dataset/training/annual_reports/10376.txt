Our market
The pub market is estimated to be worth
over £19bn per annum. It has benefited
over the last ten years from the growth
in the popularity of eating-out, with
approximately a third of total household
food expenditure now made outside the
home. This is in contrast to the more
traditional pub market of draught beer,
which has declined, down 27% in
volume since 1998.
Against this background, our strategy
has proved exceptionally successful,
driving market share gains in all key
categories.

Profitable market share gains Delivering 
shareholder value
Since our foundation in
2003, the Board has had
an absolute commitment
to the creation and
delivery of value to
shareholders whether
through organic growth,
investment in the
business for high returns,
the pursuit of value
creative acquisitions, or 
a return to shareholders
by way of dividends 
and share buybacks.

Chairman’s statement
Since our foundation in 2003 the 
Board has had an absolute commitment 
to the creation and delivery of value to
shareholders whether through organic
growth, investment in the business for
high returns, the pursuit of value creative
acquisitions, or a return to shareholders 
by way of dividends and share buybacks. 
With this guiding principle in mind, and
recognising that a consistently higher
valuation is placed by property investors
on our estate than is valued within the
current integrated model, the Board has
been investigating options for capturing
the value of the property estate for
shareholders on a sustainable basis. 
To that end, after a competitive process,
substantial progress was made in the
summer on negotiating a joint venture
transaction with R20 (the investment
vehicle of Robert Tchenguiz). In the 
final stage of this transaction, we entered
into hedging agreements which were a
fundamental bank requirement to secure
the necessary financing arrangements 
for the joint venture and to achieve
appropriate ratings from ratings agencies.
However, the sudden and unprecedented
collapse of world debt markets rendered
the joint venture undeliverable but 
left the hedging arrangements in place.
Driven by a most unusual mix of inflation
and interest rate expectations, combined 
with limited liquidity, the cost of the
Mitchells & Butlers’ results this year reflect
a strong financial performance and we are
pleased with the operational development
across the business. The executive team
has been particularly effective in growing
sales and profits despite some significant
economic and cost challenges, whilst also
rapidly implementing the conversion of
the high quality Whitbread sites acquired
in July 2006. We have extended our
leadership of the eating-out market
serving 107 million meals and generated
significant drinks market share gains. 
As a result, revenues have risen by 10%,
operating profits by 11% and earnings per
share before exceptional items by 21%.
This performance has enabled the Board
to recommend a final dividend payment
of 10.0p per share, taking the total
ordinary dividend for the year to 14.25p,
an increase of 16.3%. This payment is
additional to the Special Dividend of
£486m paid to shareholders in October
2006 and reflects the strong growth 
in earnings per share, as well as our
commitment to a progressive policy 
for dividends.
Mitchells & Butlers

hedges at the year-end, although not 
a cash item, had risen to £155m after tax.
The hedging arrangements have been
retained as the Board remains committed
to a property-based refinancing which
would utilise them, once debt markets
have recovered. The Board will continue
to balance the assessment of risk with
potential reward of this policy.
Whilst the Board’s focus has been on the
establishment of a property joint venture,
alternative property based refinancing
structures remain under consideration. 
In this context, the board has received 
a proposal from R20 in respect of a
demerged Real Estate Investment Trust
(‘REIT’) structure, which includes R20
procuring a fixed price underwriting for
in the region of 25% of the REIT equity.
The attractiveness and feasibility of this
proposal is being explored. A REIT
structure would have to meet the Board’s
requirement for an appropriate balance 
to optimise the value of both demerged
companies as independent entities.
The Board will continue to review
alternative structures that would
demonstrably create value from the
property, whilst providing an attractive
long term business model for the
operating company.
In view of the focus on Mitchells &
Butlers’ real estate, we considered it was
important to establish a current value of
our freehold and long leasehold properties
and we requested Colliers CRE to update
our valuation as at 29 September 2007.
The revised value of the estate in our
books at £5bn represents a net increase 
of £1.1bn compared to the historical
accounting basis and provides a solid 
and up to date foundation for judging 
the asset strength of the Group 
in turbulent times.
Because pubs are specific use assets, 
it is the operational success of the business
which has been the primary factor in
growing the value of our freehold property
and which has also enabled us to return
over £1.1bn in cash to shareholders 
since demerger in 2003, over and above
ordinary dividends. This performance 
has been driven by our operational teams,
who I believe are collectively the best in
the industry. I would like to thank them 
all for their perseverance, flexibility and
hard work during the year.
There has been one change to the 
Board announced during the second half
of the year. Tony Hughes, 59, stepped
down as Managing Director, Restaurants
on 1 October 2007 since when he has
been assisting in the handover of his role
and the further development of food
capabilities in the business. He will retire
from the Board of the Company on 
31 December 2007. He is succeeded 
by Adam Fowle, previously Managing
Director for the Acquired Sites and
Business Development. Adam has some 
20 years experience in licensed retailing,
having joined Mitchells & Butlers in 1985.
He was previously Managing Director 
of the Pubs & Bars division, becoming 
a Retail Director at Sainsbury’s for two
years. He rejoined Mitchells & Butlers 
in 2005.
I welcome Adam to the Board and would
like to thank Tony for his exceptional
contribution to the Company over the last
12 years. His vision and drive have been
instrumental in the development of our
highly successful pub restaurant brands. 
I wish him every happiness in his
retirement.
Looking forward, 2008 will undoubtedly
be a more challenging year, with the
uncertain outlook for consumer
confidence and the first year of the
smoking ban. However, I am confident
that a clear management strategy for
competitive out-performance based on
high quality brands, excellent sites and
strong operating skills will underpin the
continuing progress of the Company.

the market and strategy
The market
This good performance has been achieved
against some difficult market conditions in
the latter part of the financial year. Rising
interest rates, growing inflation pressures
and an increased tax burden have begun
to reduce consumer confidence
particularly of mid-market families with
mortgages. Industry growth this year has
also been limited by poor summer weather.
This has coincided with the introduction
of the smoking ban in England and Wales,
which is accelerating the key underlying
trends in the market: the growth in casual
pub users replacing frequent regulars; the
increasing importance of food, soft drinks
and wine against the decline of beer and
machine income; the growth in pub usage
by women, families and the growing
retired population and the decline in 
male session drinking; and the growth 
in the importance of the off-trade (and
supermarkets in particular) contrasting
with the decline in the traditional on-trade
beer market.
While the uncertain consumer
environment, the smoking ban and 
the poor summer weather have each
contributed to a tightening of the 
short-term market, especially in drinks,
the long-term outlook for the value for
money eating-out market continues to 
be good with on-trade food volumes up
3% in the year, driven by long-term
lifestyle changes. Our sales strategy, the
positioning of our brands and formats 
and the quality of our pub locations have
enabled us to achieve good sales growth 
in the year and leave us competitively well

Chief Executive’s review 
of the market & strategy
As a result of our focus on amenity, range,
service and value, Mitchells & Butlers has
delivered another strong trading
performance with like-for-like sales growth
of 3% in the year. Sales increases have
been effectively converted into profits
growth, with further improvements in
employee productivity, purchasing gains
and effective cost controls generating an
operating profit of £343m before
exceptional items. Retail net operating
margins are broadly in line with last year
despite £8m of regulatory cost increases
and, as a result of the conversion of the
Acquired Sites, £14m of closure and pre-
opening costs. Earnings per share before
exceptional items of 35.5p for the year 
are 21.2% ahead of last year reflecting 
the strong trading performance; the
contribution from the Acquired Sites; a
significant development project completed
by Standard Commercial Property
Developments Limited (‘SCPD’); as well as
the share consolidation that accompanied
the Special Dividend earlier this year.

placed to make further market share gains
in a more challenging environment during
the year ahead. A number of long-term
factors reinforce our confidence:
Pub usage is becoming more 
popular although less regular
Since 1990 the proportion of adults
visiting pubs at least monthly has risen
from 59% to 72%, with a marked
acceleration in the growth of less frequent
customers since the turn of the century.
This growth in total number of users
reflects the increased popularity and
availability of eating-out in pubs, driven by
social and lifestyle changes such as the
increase in the female working population
and single households along with the
affluence and longevity of a growing
retired population. Alongside this, the
traditional pastime of visiting the local
pub several times a week solely to drink
continues to decline with the proportion
of those visiting at least three times a week
reducing by more than half to 8% of the
adult population. (Fig. 1)
The smoking ban, which now applies to
the whole of the UK, has served to
reinforce this development, broadening
pubs’ appeal to new or less frequent users
who are now more attracted to pubs,
particularly for eating-out. Evidence from
Scotland, which is now in the second year
of the smoking ban, suggests that there
are significant long-term growth
opportunities for pubs focused on driving
food sales to these less frequent users.
Eating-out is increasingly the reason 
for visiting
The eating-out market has been growing
steadily over the past 20 years at around
4% in real terms, reflecting both changing
lifestyles and the wider provision of good
value food offers. Eating-out now accounts
for approximately a third of total household
expenditure on food in the UK, but it is
only at levels achieved in the US over 30
years ago. The value for money offered by
the pub combined with its relaxed casual
dining atmosphere means that it has been
capturing an even greater share of this
wider eating-out market. (Fig. 2)
Through selective acquisitions and
disposals, Mitchells & Butlers has
repositioned its estate of pubs to focus on
large sites which afford the scale to drive
high volumes of food at very attractive
prices. The average main meal price in
Mitchells & Butlers sites is around £5.60
against a UK average of between £8 and
£9*. This value for money positioning has
helped to drive food volume growth of
67% over the last five years.
The customer appeal of pub food 
is expanding
Traditionally, eating-out in pubs and
particularly pub restaurants has been
concentrated in suburban areas amongst
predominantly middle income consumers.
This segment of the market, while still
growing, has slowed as a result of
consumer economic pressures especially in
the light of rising mortgages bills and
other cost of living increases. This, in turn,
has led to some pressure on sales for some
of our mid-market brands and formats.
Over recent years, however, the market 
for eating-out in pubs has broadened
considerably, both to more affluent
customers through the development 
of gastro-pubs and to the more densely
populated housing estates through the
dramatic growth of local pub food. 
The smoking ban has given this latter
market significant additional momentum.
For example in the period since the
introduction of the ban to the year end
same outlet food sales in our Local Pubs
were up 14% with additional increases in
associated drinks sales.
Mitchells & Butlers is developing its
formats to respond to these changing
market dynamics. In the higher affluence
areas we have expanded our Premium
Country Dining format and at the year
end we had 44 pubs operating under this
format across the country. In the more
blue collar segments our Sizzling Pub Co.
and Pub & Carvery formats offer
exceptional value: steak and chips at £3.99
or a full carvery meal at £3.50 during the
week. These formats have seen very high
increased footfall and volume growth, with
the average Pub & Carvery site now selling
over 2,900 meals per week.

Chief executive’s review of 
the market and strategy
continued
Growth in food-related drinks volume
An ever increasing proportion of drinks
sales in pubs are now associated with
ancillary purchases alongside food, rather
than solely drinking occasions. These
incremental drinks sales are biased
towards wine and soft drinks, helping to
mitigate the impact of the poor summer
this year which has led to a slow down 
in the overall market for soft drinks and
wine which fell 2%. The strength of our
food volume performance and our drinks
retailing skills has enabled us to maintain
our relative out-performance in both 
these categories making substantial market
share gains and showing positive volume
growth. This has been achieved by
attracting new customers together with 
the value for money, range and quality 
of our drinks offers.
Continued decline in on-trade beer
The same social and demographic
changes which are fuelling the growth 
in pub food are contributing to the
continued decline in the on-trade beer
market with volumes down 5% in the year.
This has also been driven by the scale of
the retail beer price increases taken by the
on-trade in general and by the widening
price gap between the on-trade and the
supermarkets. This has been particularly
evident with significant supermarket
discounting of beer around major holidays
such as Christmas and important sporting
events such as the football and rugby
World Cups.
In response to falling volumes, most of 
the on-trade has responded by consistently
raising prices ahead of general inflation.
In contrast, we have followed a policy 
of pricing restraint leading to sustained
beer market share gains, for example 
on average a pint of standard lager in 
a Mitchells & Butlers pub is now £2.12, 
36 pence cheaper than the average 
in the leased and tenanted competition.
As a result same outlet beer volumes have
grown by 6% over the past four years,
almost keeping in line with off-trade
volume, and substantially out-performing
the rest of the on-trade volume decline 
of 15%. (Fig. 3)
Although the market is yet to experience 
a winter, the English smoking ban 
is already accelerating the shift from 
on-trade to off-trade. In the first four
months following the English ban, which
was introduced on 1 July 2007, the 
on-trade has seen beer volumes decline 
by over 6%, while the off-trade has seen
volumes grow by nearly 7%.
Mitchells & Butlers strategy for growth
The results achieved this year reflect our
leadership position in the growing eating-
out market and further significant drinks
market share gains. Our average weekly
sales per pub are up 6% to £18.5k and
operating profit has increased by 11% 
to £343m. We have generated this
performance through the successful
implementation of our sales strategy,
which is to:
Lead the value for money 
casual dining market
We have continued to capitalise on the
growth in informal, value for money,
eating out with same outlet like-for-like
food volumes increasing by 6% in the year
against a pub food market up 3%. We are
now selling in total 107m meals a year.
Our total food sales, including the benefits
of the Acquired Sites, grew by 22% in the
year. This has been achieved through a
constant focus on quality and value to the
customer and we will continue to reinvest
margin into our menu offers to generate
further profitable volume growth.
The key to generating profitable food
growth is responding to customers’ 
high sensitivity to perceptions of value.
This is reflected in both high consumer
price elasticities and rising menu 
quality expectations.
Our business model is focused on
attracting incremental food volumes 
which in turn generates high margin
drinks sales. With low additional
employment costs, the gross profit
generated has a high drop through 
to operating margin.
As a result of this trading strategy, across
the estate as a whole, average weekly 
food sales rose by 12%, while the average
number of meals served grew by 15% as
the mix moved strongly towards the value
segment. Thus, although like-for-like food
prices rose 1.6%, the average retail price
of food served fell by 0.8% due to the 
shift in mix.

We believe that the smoking ban, now
implemented across the UK, will further
strengthen the growth prospects for food
sales in our pubs, by being able to attract
new customers previously deterred by
tobacco smoke. Since the smoking ban 
was implemented in England, same outlet
like-for-like food sales are up 5%.
Generate significant 
drinks market share gains
Our same outlet like-for-like drinks sales
increased by 2.2% in the period. Sales
volumes, a crucial measure of underlying
customer usage, once again strongly out-
performed the market across all the key
categories of beer, cider, wines, spirits 
and soft drinks. Crucially, our same outlet
beer and cider volumes were maintained
against the background of a 4% decline 
in the on-trade market for these products
in the year as a whole.
We are out-performing in the beer 
category through widening the product
range that we offer, improving the serve
quality through intensive cellar training
and investment in cooling systems, as well
as delivering better presentation through
attractive glassware.
Value is also playing a key part in our
strong drinks market share gains, with 
a wide gap opening between our pricing
and general on-trade pricing, thereby
protecting our volumes from the
supermarket discounting. As a result, 
the average retail price of standard lager
is now 36 pence per pint less in our pubs
than the average in leased pubs. This 
is despite our average retail drinks prices
rising by 3.4%, partly due to like-for-like
price increases, but also due to trading 
up to new, premium products. This
increase is less than the price rises across
the on-trade as a whole. As a result 
of these product initiatives and pricing
policies, on a longer-term perspective, 
we have grown our same outlet beer
volumes by 6% over the past four years,
against a 15% decline in the rest of the
on-trade.
We have been following a similar strategy
in wine, soft drinks and coffee which are
key attractions to new users of pubs. 
We have been extending our ranges with
new premium products, offering good
value own label products and enhancing
the serve quality. Wine sales volumes grew
last year by 3% with draught dispense now
in some 630 pubs. In soft drinks, we have
been successfully extending the range of
fresh juices, cordials and mineral waters.
We have also installed new branded coffee
offers in around 1,200 pubs, with an uplift
in sales volumes of 23%.

Sizzling Pub Co.
Fundamental to the
market out-performance
of SPC is the format’s
ability to attract an
increasing number of
customers into its pubs
through its great value
food offer, to make
incremental, full-price
drinks sales to these
customers. Thus its
current offer of two main
meals for £6 from 2.30pm
to 6.00pm Monday 
to Friday has seen the
number of meals sold 
in this time-slot grow to
16,000 per week over the
last two years.
Pub & Carvery
As the rise in frequent,
casual eating-out among
value-focused consumers 
has continued apace,
Mitchells & Butlers has
successfully evolved new
formats to tap into this
fast-growing area of the
market. One such format
is Pub & Carvery, trialled
over two years ago, and
now trading in 58 sites
nationally. Serving an
average of over 2,900
meals a week, the highest
we believe of any format 
in the industry, the brand
provides a traditional,
relaxed pub environment
with a freshly-cooked
carvery offer priced 
from an incredible £3.50.
For our guests, this
represents better value
than eating at home. 
The brand has average
weekly sales of almost
£30k per pub and is
providing very high
incremental returns 
on investment.
Overview 10
Chief executive’s review of 
the market and strategy
continued
In addition, we opened six new sites, and
carried out 65 conversions and 13 growth
projects to change the customer offer or
increase the trading area of the site in the
core estate. Overall, we are generating a
pre-tax incremental return of 20% on our
expansionary investment over the last two
years in the core estate.
As a result of this strategy, and in the light
of the general levels of investment in the
on-trade market as a whole, the amenity
gap between our pubs and the majority 
of pubs in the UK is widening, further
improving our overall customer value
proposition and our market share gains
relative to the rest of the on-trade.
We continue to make targeted disposals,
where the value to third parties is higher
than the trading value to us. During the
year we generated £162m of disposal
proceeds, including the sale of 102 pubs
to Trust Inns Ltd in October 2006, taking
advantage of the buoyancy in the property
market to crystallise the value of smaller
pubs, which had limited food growth
potential.
Grow profits and capture asset
appreciation to benefit shareholders
Pubs are valued as specific use assets,
primarily on the basis of their profitability
and our strong operating performance has
helped to generate further capital
appreciation within our estate. This has
been reflected in the £1.1bn upward
revaluation of the estate to £5.0bn that has
been carried out in conjunction with our
property valuers, Colliers CRE.
Our focus remains on releasing to
shareholders the benefits of this capital
appreciation. At the start of the year, in
October 2006, we returned £486m to
shareholders by means of a Special
Dividend of £1 per share, crystallising for
shareholders the continuing growth in the
value of the estate.
Mitchells & Butlers
Annual report and accounts 2007
Develop and evolve an industry-leading
portfolio of formats to drive sales growth
Our emphasis on innovation to develop
our brands and formats to keep pace 
with fast changing consumer expectations
is focused on ensuring that we continually
attract new customers and generate 
higher levels of visits. We have developed
an industry leading portfolio of brands
and formats targeted at the growth
segments of the market. Average weekly
sales per pub are well over three times 
the industry average.
For instance, during the course of the year
we have further developed our category
killer, value food formats, Sizzling Pub Co.,
Pub & Carvery and our new Community
Locals format ‘Cornerstone’.
These each offer outstanding food value,
with main meals priced between £3.50 
and £4.50, in an attractive, high amenity
pub environment. Pub & Carvery is now
generating an average of over 2,900 meals
per pub per week, the highest, we believe,
of any format in the industry. We have also
evolved our long established High Street
formats of O’Neill’s and Scream, with
strong performances resulting. Similarly
the development of our London offers of
Nicholson’s and Metro Professionals has
generated exceptional double digit food
sales growth.
Deliver a profitable, integrated 
food and drinks offer
Whilst eating out is increasingly the reason
that customers visit a Mitchells & Butlers
pub, combining higher growth, lower
margin food sales with higher margin
drinks sales is key to maximising 
overall profitability. Our aim is to add
incremental food sales which can be
delivered at low marginal cost with an
attractive drop-through to profit.
Extract volume driven efficiencies
Our rising volumes are critical in
underpinning our efficiency gains. 
This year we have seen a further strong
rate of increase in staff productivity, 
with a 3.9% increase in staff contribution
per hour in the core estate. This reflects
the impact of our training programmes, 
our focus on the optimum deployment 
of staff and ever more refined techniques
for forecasting and scheduling. These
have enabled us to realise significant
productivity gains and maintain our pub
employment cost ratio below 24% of sales
excluding the Acquired Sites, despite a
further increase of 6% in the National
Minimum Wage in October 2006.
On purchasing, the Cost of Goods’ 
index increases have seen cost rises held
to under 1%, significantly below inflation,
while £7m per annum of purchasing
synergies from the Acquired Sites were
delivered this year, ahead of our forecasts
at the time of acquisition.
We also continue to drive process
efficiencies in the infrastructure to leverage
our scale economies. For example, the
extra overhead required to service some
£200m of sales from the Acquired Sites
will have been held to £2m per annum.
These factors have enabled us to maintain
high net operating margins of 17.9%
broadly in line with last year, despite £8m
of regulatory cost increases and £14m of
closure and pre-opening costs.
Over the next 12 months we have
instigated a material rationalisation 
of the organisation, with approximately
£7m of annualised cost efficiencies
targeted to be delivered in FY 2009.
Extend the skill base of operational
excellence throughout the estate
The skills and experience of our operating
teams provide a critical competitive
advantage for us in delivering high
standards of customer service efficiently
and profitably. We have continued to 
build our staff training programmes and
industry leading practices in the areas 
of: capacity management at peak times;
kitchen processes and organisation; bar
and floor service productivity; staff
product knowledge and our responsiveness
to direct measures of feedback on guest
satisfaction. This focus on operational
excellence is central to the high average
levels of sales and profitability generated
by our pubs.
Proactively manage the 
estate to maximise value
Our strategy is to maximise the
profitability and value of each pub by
applying the breadth of our trading
formats as is most appropriate to the local
market and demographics. During the
year we have been adding value through
this strategy to both the Acquired Sites
and the existing estate. The Acquired Sites’
conversion programme remains on track
with 172 pubs now converted to our
formats. We have moved at a rapid pace
with the integration programme to turn
around their previous under-performance
and provide a platform for future growth.
Average weekly sales uplifts on the
converted sites are running at
approximately 20% above the levels at
which the pubs were acquired. We remain
confident in delivering the year three
target of 30% sales uplifts in the 2009
financial year. 11
It has also been clear that property
investors are attracted to the long-term,
secure growth prospects that can be
created through the rentalising of part of
our operational cash flows in a dedicated
property structure. Whether in a joint
venture, a REIT or another separate
property structure, fundamentally 
higher values appear to be placed on 
the estate than when it is combined in 
an integrated model with the operations.
We believe that substantial value can 
be potentially captured from our high
quality, freehold and long leasehold 
assets, through such structures. A key
consideration in such a process is to
construct a lease arrangement which
ensures that both the property and the
operations remain mutually incentivised 
to continue to create long-term value.
The Board will continue to investigate
actively the options for capturing 
the value of the property estate for
shareholders on a sustainable basis.

Cask ale training
The quality of our 
cellar skills has been
instrumental in our
sustained gains in beer
market share. With the
increase in demand for
cask ales, Ember Inns
has invested this year in
specific training on the
management and serve 
of cask ale, to ensure
customers enjoy the
finest quality pint
possible. Most Ember
Inns are now certified 
by Cask Marque, an
independent accreditation
scheme to recognise
excellence in the service 
of cask ale, and each 
pub has a beer quality
champion, trained by
experienced brewers.
Acquired Sites
In July last year, we
acquired 239 of the best
pub restaurant sites in 
the UK. These freehold
pubs were well located,
large, predominantly
residential and freehold 
or long leasehold, and
approximately half
situated in the higher
growth regions of the
South East and South
West of England. They
were therefore an
excellent strategic fit 
with the Company’s
existing estate. Our key
capital investment priority
this year has been the
rapid and successful
conversion of these sites
and a total of £80m has
been invested to this end.
Overview 12
Key performance indicators
Alignment of remuneration incentives 
with key performance indicators (‘KPI’s)
It is a key principle of the Company 
to align the interests of the Directors 
and other key employees with those of 
its shareholders. Executive remuneration
(as detailed in the Remuneration report
on page 35), therefore includes schemes
which contain elements of remuneration
linked to the KPIs below. Same outlet 
like-for-like growth, EPS and incremental
return on expansionary capital are used as
performance measures within the Short
Term Deferred Incentive Plan (‘STDIP’)
and the amount by which cash return 
on cash capital employed (‘CROCCE’)
exceeds weighted average cost of capital
(‘WACC’) is used within the Performance
Restricted Share Plan (‘PRSP’) scheme.
Total shareholder return (‘TSR’) is also 
an important measure of performance 
for Mitchells & Butlers’ shareholders as 
it combines the increase in the value of
the Company’s shares with any dividend
returns made to shareholders. Mitchells 
& Butlers’ TSR performance compared
with its selected comparator group is
highlighted in the Remuneration report
and forms one of the performance
conditions within the PRSP scheme.
For the purposes of remuneration
schemes, TSR is taken over the life 
of the scheme rather than as an annual
measure. Over the last three years, 
the Company has delivered an increase 
of 216% in TSR reflecting the success 
that has been achieved in executing
Mitchells & Butlers’ strategy.
Mitchells & Butlers implements and
monitors its performance against its
strategy principally through four key
performance indicators. The performance
in the year is as follows:
1. Same outlet like-for-like sales 
growth – Mitchells & Butlers’
operational and marketing plans 
have delivered strong and consistent
like-for-like sales growth of 3% 
in the year (4.1% in FY 2006).
2. EPS growth – Mitchells & Butlers’
strong trading performance, together
with share repurchases and the share
consolidation that accompanied the
Special Dividend in October 2006,
have generated growth in earnings 
per share before exceptional items of
21.2% in the year (15.4% in FY 2006).
3. CROCCE in excess of WACC –
Mitchells & Butlers aims to maximise
the difference between the post-tax
CROCCE and its WACC, a key
measure of value creation. A CROCCE
of 10.8% after tax was achieved in the
12 months to 29 September 2007,
around 4 percentage points ahead 
of the estimated WACC for the year,
reflecting good operating performance
supported by an efficient use of the
balance sheet. (CROCCE was 11%
after tax in the 12 months to 30
September 2006, around 5 percentage
points ahead of our estimated WACC
for that year.)
4. Incremental return on expansionary
capital – Our track record in this area
has remained strong during the period.
Pre-tax returns of 20% are being
achieved on the core expansionary
capital projects carried out over the
last two years. This measure excludes
the recently Acquired Sites due to the
relatively short period of ownership
and post-conversion trading, making 
it more difficult to estimate seasonal
patterns and annualised returns. 
(Pre-tax returns of over 20% were
achieved on the core investments made
in the previous two years in FY 2006).

KPI definitions
Same outlet like-for-like sales growth
The sales this period compared to the
sales in the same period in the previous
year of all managed pubs that were
trading throughout the two periods being
compared, expressed as a percentage.
EPS growth
The earnings per share for the period
before exceptional items, compared to the
comparable period last year as reported in
the financial statements expressed as a

CROCCE in excess of WACC
The post tax cash return on cash capital
employed compared to the weighted
average cost of capital post tax, where the
cash return is earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation less cash
tax that would be charged on operating
profit without any tax shield from interest.
Cash capital employed is the average 
net operating assets, plus the average
accumulated depreciation, plus goodwill
written off, less the historical revaluation
reserve.
The WACC is the post-tax weighted
average cost of capital, calculated using
the post-tax cost of debt during the year
and the cost of equity, weighted according
to the proportion of the Company
financed through debt and equity.
Incremental return on 
expansionary capital
Incremental return is the growth in 
annual pub operating profit expressed 
as a percentage of the associated capital
investment for sites having received
expansionary investment over the last 
two financial years. Sites are included 
once they have been trading for three
months. For sites which have not been
trading for a full 12 months, incremental
return is estimated based on an
annualisation of actual post-investment
trading. Expansionary capital is capital
invested to increase the trading area of 
a pub or to materially change the
customer offer. Expansionary capital
represents investment over and above the
maintenance investment cycle for a pub. 13
Lead the value for money 
casual dining market
Historically, Mitchells & Butlers’ sites were
heavily concentrated in the main UK
industrial areas of the North and Midlands.
However, following a number of disposals,
the acquisition of 550 pubs from Allied
Domecq in 1999 and the purchase of the
Acquired Sites in July 2006, as well as the
addition of over 400 individual sites since
the early 1990s, the business is now spread
across the UK, more broadly mirroring the
demographics of the UK population with
a higher weighting in the affluent South
East and London.
Our pubs are situated predominantly 
in residential areas (75%) with the vast
majority either freehold or long leasehold
(almost 90%) and having high average
weekly sales of £18.5k (over three times
greater than that of the average UK pub).
The estate over the last 10 years has
therefore been fundamentally repositioned
to capture the strongest growth areas of
the market. Hence, in a pub eating-out
market that has grown by 27% since 
2002 and is forecast to grow by a similar
amount in the next five years, our 
food volumes have increased by 67%.
Additionally our food sales mix has 
grown from 22% of total retail turnover 
in 1998 to 37% at the end of 2006. (Fig. 4)
Critical to this growth has been our
absolute focus on providing value to our
customers, through fresher, higher 
quality ingredients at lower price points.
Consequently the average price of a main
meal in a Mitchells & Butlers pub is now
approximately £5.60, highlighting the
value proposition, particularly considering
the relative healthiness, quality of service
and amenity that our pubs offer.
Generate significant 
drinks market share gains
We focus our drinks retailing at delivering
a wide range of products from across the
world without being tied to any specific
producer. For example, across the
Company we now stock over 40 draught
lagers compared to only five 10 years ago.
Our drinks volume out-performance has
been driven by our focus on improved
serve quality and on point of sale
communication with further range
extensions. We are using our unit level
and purchasing scale economies to
improve quality and choice for our
customers and thereby gain market share.
In beer, we have increased the number of
outlets using glycol technology to improve
the quality of their draught beer and have
sought to improve the range of beers on
offer. For example in Nicholson’s we are
responding to market trends by increasing
the number of ales handles on each bar 
to six, whilst increasing and premiumising
the lager choice by installing Erdinger 
and Peroni.
We have been following a similar strategy
in other drinks categories, extending our
ranges, bringing in new premium
products, offering good value own label
lines, and upgrading the serve quality.
In wine, we are seeing both trading up to
better quality premium wines, while at the
same time our own label wines, such as
Silverland, have grown to around 25% of
sales. We also now have draught wine
dispense in some 630 pubs, with draught
wine sales now accounting for almost 10%
of total wine sales.
In soft drinks, our priorities have been on
range extension in the fast growing fresh
juice as well as other categories. In June
we refreshed the range of juices and
cordials in our Pubs & Bars division,
driving sales growth of 16% in the period
to the end of the year despite the poor
summer weather.
While in coffee, we have installed branded
coffee offers such as Costa, Illy, and
Segafredo in almost 1,200 pubs.
Further extending the quality of our
drinks offers into these ‘non-traditional’
lines will add to the attraction of our pubs
to new and light users.
This focus on choice, value and quality 
has resulted in continued market share
gains in all the main drinks categories.
Evolve and develop our brands and
formats to drive sales growth through 
high levels of amenity and service
Mitchells & Butlers operates a spectrum 
of brands and formats tailored to specific
user groups in particular demographic
areas. The division into Residential and
High Street areas is further split by
occasionality into drinks-led and food-led
pubs giving the main segments of the
market: local pubs, pub restaurants, 
high street pubs & bars and city centre
restaurants. These have developed into
some of the strongest consumer brands
and formats in the industry. The chart
overleaf sets out the range of brands and
formats operated by Mitchells & Butlers 
in each of these market segments. (Fig. 5)
We evolve our brands and formats through
spending regular amounts of maintenance
expenditure to match changing consumer
needs. This evolution can also be driven
through a change in our offers. For
example our O’Neill’s brand has been
refreshed in the year, improving both the
range of drinks offered and the choice
and quality of its menu.
We have also continued to trial new
formats to tap into fast growing areas of
the market. One example of this is Pub 
& Carvery which was trialled over the last
two years and has grown to 58 sites. It has
average weekly sales of almost £30k and 
is providing very high incremental return
on investment. This format targets value
orientated consumers – offering a freshly
cooked carvery meal at around £3.99 in 
a pleasant relaxed environment, which
represents better value for money than 
the home cooked alternative.
Our key capital investment priority this
year has been on the rapid and successful
conversion of the Acquired Sites to our
strong brands and formats. The
outstanding quality of these sites has more
than met our pre-acquisition expectations
and the intensive preparations beforehand
have put us in a position to move rapidly
ahead with the conversion process. The
scale and speed of this programme has
already converted the vast majority of
these sites, a mere 16 months following
the acquisition.

The initial sales uplifts are approximately
20%, and we are on track to achieve 
our three year, 30% target. We expect 
a further steady build up over the next
couple of years.
Deliver a profitable, integrated 
food and drinks offer
Critical to the success of our strategy 
to date has been our focus on leveraging
the growth in food to attract customers 
to the pub, thereby increasing higher
margin ancillary drinks sales to maximise
profitability. We also aim to reinforce the
link between food and drink through our
marketing activity and sales promotions.
In Toby, for example, we have dropped
the price point for a carvery meal from
£5.25 to £5.00 in mid week, this has not
only driven food volume but drinks sales
as well, and most importantly, net profit.
Extract volume driven efficiencies
Scale at both the pub and corporate 
level is critical in ensuring the success 
of our value and volume strategy. (Fig. 6)
At the corporate level, the growth in 
our food sales over the last five years has
enabled us to increase our purchasing
power with suppliers, for example we buy
products such as turkey tops in greater
quantities than the major supermarkets.
This has helped to offset the faster growth
in relatively lower margin products such as
food and wine and enabled us to counter
the over £70m increase in regulatory and
energy costs during that period. Through
reducing purchasing costs we can increase
quality, pass additional value on to our
customers and in turn further increase 
our volumes. For example, Mitchells &
Butlers purchased 1.1 million kilograms 
of jacket potatoes in the year. Better
market conditions and alternative sources
for potatoes have ensured improved
commercial terms for the Company, with 
a saving of 24% on our annual spend.
This focus has enabled us to hold our cost
of goods flat this year with the gain on
new contracts offsetting inflation, duty
increases and the contractual increases 
in on-going agreements.
At the pub level, through operating large
scale pubs, we are able to provide the
quality of amenity and service and the
range of products at good value prices
that today’s customers demand. The
Company constantly invests in developing
operating skills in the efficient
management of kitchens, bars and serve
times, to deliver high service standards 
at peak trading times. Our Pub & Carvery
format, which offers freshly cooked food 
at a highly attractive £3.99 price point,
has had significant success in the densely
populated housing estates. In the last
three years therefore average spend per
head has fallen from £4.71 to £4.01, while
average meal volumes have risen from
1,800 per week to over 2,900 per week.
Profitability has been further enhanced 
by the incremental drinks sales generated,
which along with productivity gains have
led to average profits per pub up 29%. 
It is our purchasing power allied to our
strong operating skills that have enabled
us to achieve this performance.
Unit scale allows the Company to schedule
and deploy staff very closely to the trading
patterns of the pub thereby capturing
additional sales at busy times and reducing
labour costs during quiet periods. Through
sophisticated scheduling and forecasting
of sales, we have been able to maintain
pub employment costs at under 24% of
sales despite the substantial real increases
in the National Minimum Wage.
We have also had considerable success 
in applying our productivity systems and
purchasing power to the Acquired Sites
where we have made £7m of purchasing
gains during the year.
Extend the skill base of operational
excellence throughout the estate
Key to the successful, profitable operation
of our businesses is our ability to recruit,
train and retain the best people. Our wide
range of brands and formats mean we are
able to offer a huge variety of opportunities
to our employees, from bar staff to kitchen
manager to chef. We offer comprehensive
training so experience is not always
essential; however, personality and 
a passion for excellent customer service 
are critical. The Company is committed 
to providing equality of opportunity 
to all employees without discrimination
and we are supportive of the employment
and advancement of disabled and
disadvantaged persons.
Mitchells & Butlers deploys a 
combination of assessment centres,
internal development centres, recruitment
advertising, interviewing and on-job
evaluation to recruit potential managers
and assistant managers and to help people
develop their careers. At the same time 
we recognise that many people want the
flexibility of a part-time job in order to
suit their lifestyle. We aim to make them
welcome in the workplace and to provide
for their needs.
We currently employ around 43,000
people and offer real opportunities to
build a career within the Company. This
year we invested an average of six days
training per employee, with structured
training programmes including both on
and off the job training.
Mitchells & Butlers is committed to
ensuring all retail management and staff
have the skills to perform their roles
effectively. A significant amount is spent
on training managers and team leaders
through the Competence in Retail
Management Certificate and Management
Foundation Course programmes. Each
year, around 2,500 of our retail employees
are trained through these programmes,
giving them the essential skills to operate
our businesses legally and safely. This
training also gives managers the knowledge
required to provide on-site training to
retail staff.
The National Certificate of Personal
Licence Holders (NCPLH) is an essential
qualification to progress to manager level
and employees can work towards this with
an experienced manager; this year, over
3,000 employees achieved their NCPLH
with the Company. The internal succession
rate to the post of assistant manager 
is around 70% for most of our brands 
and formats.
Our training programmes are not only
fundamental to motivating our employees,
giving them the skills to achieve their
ambitions but also, crucially, they underpin
our commitment to operate our businesses
safely. Notably, we have rigorous training
about the responsible retailing of alcohol
to give our retail employees the expertise
and the confidence to serve our customers
correctly. Our retail teams currently refuse
service to approximately 50,000 people 
a month who are unable to provide proof
of their age.
The Company has two graduate
recruitment schemes: the Corporate
Graduate programme and the Vocational
Graduate Programme, placing employees
on a fast-track to a retail management
position. Within any given year, we have
approximately 60 graduates participating
in our management training schemes and
for the second year running we achieved 
a Springboard UK award for Best Student
Placement for a Large Organisation.

Overview The Company has had an established,
comprehensive employee communications
programme in place for over 10 years. 
A variety of channels such as team
meetings, conferences, in-house
publications and the intranet keep 
staff informed on matters relating 
to the Company and its performance.
Two-way communications between senior
management and employees are driven
primarily through regular discussion
groups at the corporate level and
operational communications forums. 
A formal Business Forum, at which
Executive Directors meet with elected
employee representatives to discuss
business concerns, takes place annually.
The yearly corporate employee
satisfaction survey gauges staff opinion 
on a wide variety of Company issues 
and working practices in a confidential
manner and provides a continuous
objective measure for employee
satisfaction and engagement. This year
the response rate to the survey improved
for the fourth consecutive year and the
continuing positive trend relating to
questions about employee engagement is
encouraging, with over 90% of employees
feeling satisfied and motivated by their
work. More than 94% of Mitchells &
Butlers’ employees would recommend 
the Company as a good place to work.

Current trading
Current trading has been resilient with
same outlet like-for-like sales growing by
1.4% in the seven weeks to 17 November.
Trading in the three weeks to 17 November
has shown a material improvement on
October with same outlet like-for-like sales
up 2.4% following the launch of our new
winter menus. This sales growth has been
generated against the background of the
start of the first winter period of the
smoking ban in England and Wales, a
continuing volume decline in the on-trade
beer market in October of approximately
8% and a more uncertain consumer
environment.

Note: These results include the Acquired Sites
Within the Residential estate, Local Pubs
have traded well, with same outlet like-for-
like sales growth of 3.3%, reflecting large
drinks market share gains, continued
strong food sales growth and the benefit 
of the Rugby World Cup. The Rugby
tournament however, had a negative
impact on our pub restaurants where like-
for-like sales have been marginally positive
overall, although they were up 2.6% in 
the last three weeks following the launch
of the new menus with their enhanced
quality and value.
These new menus are part of a carefully
trialled and targeted margin investment
programme that we have started 
to implement within pub restaurants 
to drive profitable volume growth in
response to a slowing in performance
towards the end of last year, particularly 
in the Vintage Inns format. The initial
customer response to these new menus 
is very encouraging.
In the High Street, which accounts for
25% of sales, the successful evolution 
of our formats has generated like-for-like
sales ahead by 2.5%, with strong growth 
in food sales. Trading in central London
has remained buoyant.
Trends following the smoking ban 
in England are currently broadly in line 
with those seen in the first year of the 
ban in Scotland where there was a slowing
of overall sales in the winter months. 
In the 20 weeks since the introduction 
of the smoking ban in England, same
outlet like-for-like sales for our English
pubs, excluding those previously converted
to non-smoking, increased by 1.5%,
with food sales up 5% and drinks sales
marginally up. In the last seven weeks
these pubs grew by 0.7% on a same outlet
basis. We continue to be encouraged by
the improvement in same outlet like-for-
like sales this year within our Scottish
pubs, up 6.7%, partly helped by the recent
Euro 2008 football, and we believe that
the overall impact of the ban will be
beneficial over time to larger, well invested
pubs with an attractive food offer. 17
Mitchells & Butlers has performed well
despite a more challenging consumer
environment in the second half of the year.
Earnings per share grew by 21.2% in the
year, underpinning the proposed increase
of 16.3% in the annual ordinary dividend
to 14.25 pence per share, in addition to
the Special Dividend of £1 per share paid
to shareholders in October 2006.
Strong operating performance
Our value and volume strategy, combined
with the unrivalled quality of our pub
properties, has been the key to our
resilient trading performance. Like-for-like
sales during the year were up 3% and net
retail operating margins were broadly
maintained, despite £8m of additional
regulatory costs and £14m of closure 
and pre-opening costs arising from the
conversion of the Acquired Sites to our
brands and formats.
Investing for high returns
In the year we invested £261m in the
estate, including £131m of expansionary
capital of which £80m was spent on
converting the Acquired Sites, delivering 
a sales uplift of approximately 20% against
the levels at which the sites were acquired.
Our core expansionary investment over
the last two years has continued to deliver
incremental pre-tax returns of 20%, whilst
the business as a whole achieved a post-tax
cash return on capital employed of 10.8%.
Value-creative disposals
Alternative use and investment 
demand for individual pubs reached
record levels during the year and we took
the opportunity to dispose of some of our
smaller pubs, reinvesting the proceeds 
in high return projects within the estate.
During the year, we raised £162m of cash
from disposals, including £101m from 
the sale of 102 smaller, community pubs 
to Trust Inns Ltd.
Releasing additional value from property
We conducted during the year a rigorous
review to determine whether the Company’s
properties would be valued more highly 
if they were separated from the operations
of the business. Our market-testing in the
spring confirmed that specialist investors
would place a substantially higher value
on our properties than that which was
implied in our stock market valuation. 
We examined alternative structures to
access this upside for shareholders and
concluded that a joint venture would offer
the best route to crystallise a substantial
proportion of the property value, whilst
protecting the integrity of the existing 
and proven integrated operating model.
Following a competitive process, we
negotiated terms with R20 for the sale 
of a 50% stake in a £4.5bn joint venture,
comprising the majority of our freehold
and long leasehold properties. Shortly
before finalising the agreement, the
sudden debt market crisis in July meant
that the transaction could not 
be implemented.

Financial review
Hedging arrangements
In the final stage of the planned
transaction, Mitchells & Butlers and 
R20 separately entered into debt hedging
arrangements (‘hedges’) comprising
interest rate and inflation swaps intended
to be contributed to the joint venture.
These were required to support the
delivery of the financing package. The
turbulence in the debt markets since July
has led to long-term interest rates falling.
At the same time, long-term inflation
expectations have risen, whilst the market
liquidity for such instruments has sharply
diminished. These three factors combined
to produce a post-tax deficit on the
hedges of £155m, against the mark-to-
market values at the balance sheet date.
This is not a cash loss to the business, 
as the hedges have not been closed out
and we continue to expect that they 
will be utilised in a future property 
based refinancing, once debts markets
have stabilised.
Property valuation
Given the continued focus on our 
estate, we completed a revaluation of 
the properties as at 29 September 2007.
The revised value of £5.0bn is included 
in our financial statements and represents
a net increase of £1.1bn against the
historical accounting approach. Whilst 
this accounting valuation is consistent 
with the existing structure of the Group, 
our property valuers have advised that,
within an OpCo/PropCo structure, our
freehold and long leasehold properties
would support a market rent of £280m
and a rental yield of 5.8%, with an
indicative value of £4.8bn before any
allowance for purchaser’s costs. This
valuation covers only the rent from these
properties and therefore excludes the
other cash flows received by the operating
company which, based on trading in 
the year ended 29 September 2007, 
would equate to some £200m of
underlying EBITDA.
Pensions
After £40m of additional contributions,
there was a pension deficit of £18m at the
end of September under IAS19, with more
prudent mortality assumptions applied
following the actuarial valuation exercise
in the year. The formal actuarial valuation
as at 31 March 2007 indicates a larger
deficit of around £250m, reflecting 
the more conservative gilts basis for
discounting future liabilities. In line with
the new pension regulations, the Company
is finalising with the Trustees a formal
recovery plan to close this deficit by 2017.
As part of this plan, in addition to ordinary
annual service contributions, we expect
that further contributions of £24m will 
be made in each of the next three years.
Summary
Our operational focus remains on driving
profitable sales growth and generating
strong cash flows. We will also continue 
to look at the best opportunity to release
additional value from our property to
benefit shareholders.

Total revenue for the year was £1,894m,
up 10.1% on last year, including the first
full year of ownership of the Acquired
Sites purchased from Whitbread PLC in
July 2006.
Strong like-for-like sales growth continued
in the year in both Residential and High
Street areas, reflecting resilient trading in
more challenging conditions in the second
half and further significant market share
gains.
Like-for-like sales Same outlet* Uninvested*
Residential 3.1% 1.5%
High Street 3.0% 2.3%

With the success of our ongoing sales and
marketing activities, same outlet food sales
and drink sales were up 5.1% and 2.2%
respectively, with average retail prices 
up less than 2%, reinforcing our value
position in a market characterised by real
price increases.
Our increased share of the drinks market
and the increasing scale of our food
volumes have helped us to mitigate
continuing pressures on the cost of goods
purchased, including drinks duty rises 
and global food inflation. Overall gross
margins were slightly below last year,
reflecting a further shift in the sales mix
towards the higher growth but lower
margin categories of food and wine.

By continuing to improve employee
productivity, our pub employment ratio 
in the estate was maintained at below 24%
of sales, despite further increases in the
National Minimum Wage adding £7m to
our labour costs. As a result the net retail
operating margin at 17.9% was broadly in
line with last year, despite £14m of one-off
closure and pre-opening costs incurred 
in connection with the conversion of the
Acquired Sites.
We invested £261m in the year, of 
which £8m related to the purchase of the
Acquired Sites and £80m was invested 
to convert the majority of those sites to
Mitchells & Butlers’ brands and formats.
In the existing estate, £122m was invested
to maintain the high levels of amenity 
in the pubs and in the continuing
development and evolution of our brands
and formats and £51m was spent on
expansionary projects. During the year 
six new pubs opened and 65 existing 
pubs were converted to one of our brands
or formats to uplift their sales and 
profits. We are continuing to achieve 
an incremental, pre-tax return of 20% 
on the core expansionary projects 
of the last two years.
During the year we raised £162m of cash
from disposals, including £101m from the
sale of 102 of our smaller, community pubs
to Trust Inns Ltd. As a result, net capital
investment during the year was £99m.
In addition to the strong retail
performance, Standard Commercial
Property Developments Limited (‘SCPD’)
realised a property development profit 
of £7m in the year. As a result, total
operating profit before exceptional items
was £343m, up 11% on last year.

After the disposal of 86 managed pubs, 
eight transfers to business franchise and 
one pub transferred to the Restaurants
division, there were 1,129 managed pubs
in the Pubs & Bars division at the end of
the period, including 28 Acquired Sites. 
There were on average 1,159 managed
pubs trading during the year.
Revenue was up 1%, including £16m 
from the Acquired Sites transferred to the
division following conversion. Excluding
those Acquired Sites and adjusting for
major disposals made last year and at the
beginning of this year, revenue in the core
Pubs & Bars estate was up 3.5%.
Pubs & Bars continued to achieve market
share gains in drink sales, as a result of
the widening gap between our amenity,
product range and value for money and
that of the competition. Food sales in 
the year were up 12.5% (excluding the
Acquired Sites) driven by growth in the
residential pubs, notably Sizzling Pub Co.
and Metro Professionals, as well as by the
Town Pubs and the central London estate.
The review of machines stakes and prizes
shortly before the beginning of the year
raised the maximum stake to 50p and the
maximum prize to £35. These changes
were modestly beneficial to machine sales
although the negative impact of the
smoking ban introduced in July meant
that machine sales were slightly down 
for the year as a whole.
A total of 56 conversions were completed,
predominantly to residential brands and
formats such as Sizzling Pub Co., Ember
Inns and the Metro Professionals format.
As a result of tight cost control and
improved employee productivity, Pubs 
& Bars operating profit of £191m before
exceptional items was up 6.7% in the year
and the net operating margin increased
from 18.7% last year to 19.7%. Excluding
the contribution from the Acquired Sites
and the impact of major disposals in the
comparative year, the existing Pubs & Bars
estate increased operating profit by 11.9%.

Following the disposal of 15 pubs and

there were 787 managed pubs in the
Restaurants division at the end of the
period, including 191 Acquired Sites, 
two new individual pubs and one pub
transferred from Pubs & Bars. There 
were on average 768 managed pubs
trading during the year.
Revenue was up 19.2%, including £160m
from the Acquired Sites. Excluding the
Acquired Sites, there were on average 591
pubs trading during the year and in these
pub restaurants, revenue grew by 2.7%,
with food sales up 3.9% and drinks up 0.7%.
The Restaurants division successfully
integrated the Acquired Sites and
completed the majority of the conversions
during the year as planned. Growth in 
the rest of the estate slowed during the
year primarily as a result of increasing
economic pressure on mid-market
consumers and greater intensity of
competition in pub food. Management
focus is on continuing to evolve the offer
in our brands and formats, combined 
with further efficiency and productivity
improvements.
Restaurants division operating profit of
£145m before exceptional items was up
11.5% on last year, including £16m from
the Acquired Sites. The net operating
margin fell from 17.1% last year to 16.0%
due to the closure and pre-opening costs
associated with the conversion of the
Acquired Sites and the comparatively low
margins achieved by those sites prior to
conversion. Excluding the Acquired Sites,
the Restaurants estate increased operating
profit by 4% with a net operating margin
improvement of 0.2 percentage points.
Standard Commercial Property
Developments Limited (‘SCPD’)
SCPD generated £18m of revenue and
£7m of operating profit in the year, 
the majority of which related to the sale 
of a long-term development property 
in Burton-on-Trent, which was completed
in August.
Property backed refinancing and 
related hedging arrangements
Substantial progress was made in the
summer on structuring an attractive
property transaction, with terms largely
concluded with R20 (the investment
vehicle of Robert Tchenguiz) based on the
sale of a 50% stake in a £4.5bn property
joint venture comprising approximately
1,300 pubs and £240m of rent.
In the final stage of the planned
transaction, the Company and R20
separately entered into certain interest
and inflation hedging arrangements
intended to be contributed to the joint
venture. However, the sudden, rapid
deterioration in debt market conditions 
in late July meant that a financing
package could not be obtained and 
the transaction could not be executed.
The hedges remain in place as it is 
the Board’s intention to utilise these
financial instruments in a future property
based refinancing once debt markets 
have stabilised.

Property revaluation
Given the continued focus on the value 
of our estate, we have completed a
revaluation of our fixed assets based on an
updated valuation by our property valuers,
Colliers CRE, of our freehold and long
leasehold properties as at 29 September
2007. For accounting purposes, this
valuation represents the aggregate value 
of each individual pub, rather than a
portfolio approach, based primarily on 
the trading cash flows. The revised value
of the properties at £5.0bn represents 
a net increase of £1.1bn compared with
the historical accounting basis. We will
continue to revalue our properties each
year on a rolling basis.
The accounting valuation of the property
is consistent with the existing structure 
of the Group. However, based on advice
received from Colliers CRE, all of the
freehold and long leasehold properties
within an OpCo/PropCo structure would
support a market rent of £280m and a
rental yield of 5.8%, with an indicative
valuation of £4.8bn for the PropCo, before
any allowance for purchaser’s costs, based
on a 35 year, RPI-inflating lease. This
valuation approach relates only to the 
rent from the freehold and long leasehold
pubs and therefore excludes the cash flows
received by the operating company from
these pubs, as well as other company cash
flows including those from existing short
leasehold pubs. Based on the year ended
29 September 2007, this would equate 
to approximately £200m of underlying
EBITDA.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those which are
separately identified by virtue of their 
size or incidence so as to allow a better
understanding of the underlying trading
performance of the Group. Exceptional
items are generally those which do 
not form part of the core operations 
of the Group. As a result, the Board
focuses on ‘pre-exceptional’ performance
measures in order to compare underlying
performance year on year.
The interest rate and inflation hedging
arrangements that the Company entered
into in July 2007 provide an economic
hedge against the future anticipated cash
flows associated with a property based
refinancing, however they do not qualify
for hedge accounting as defined in IAS39.
Movements in their fair values are therefore
recognised directly in the Group income
statement, within exceptional finance
costs. The total fair value movement 
of these instruments during the year
reported within exceptional finance 
was £(221)m, (£(155)m after tax).
An exceptional loss on property related
items of £23m (£17m after tax) arose
during the year. This was caused by
impairment arising from the revaluation
of the property portfolio of £45m 
(£32m after tax) partly offset by net 
profits on the disposal of properties 
of £22m (£15m after tax), primarily
related to the sale of 102 pubs to 
Trust Inns Ltd on 6 October 2006.
Exceptional costs of £4m (£3m after tax)
were incurred in the first half of the year
relating to the integration of the Acquired
Sites, whilst a further £7m of costs 
(£7m after tax) were incurred in the
second half of the year, relating primarily
to professional advisers’ fees in relation to
the Board’s review of a potential property
refinancing and the proposed joint
venture transaction with R20.
The tax impact of the above exceptional
items is a £74m credit. In addition, there
is a further £26m of exceptional deferred
tax credits (giving a total of £100m),
primarily relating to the change in the
corporate tax rate from 30% to 28% 
in April 2008.
Finance costs and revenue
Finance costs during the year were £153m
before exceptional items, £35m higher
than last year. Finance revenue of £6m 
was achieved on the Group’s cash balances
being £3m lower than last year. The net
increase in finance costs of £38m against
last year reflects the higher level of debt 
in the Group following the purchase of 
the Acquired Sites in July 2006 and the
payment of a Special Dividend of £486m
to shareholders in October 2007.
Net finance income from pensions 
was £11m, £3m higher than last year 
due to an increase in the expected return 
on the assets in the pension scheme
compared to the charge for the liabilities.
The Group’s blended net interest rate for
the year was 5.5% including the impact 
of the net finance income from pensions.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year was 
£62m before exceptional items. This 
is an effective rate of 30% of profit 
before tax, one percentage point lower 
than the previous year. The decrease has 
been achieved following the resolution
during the second half of the year 
of various outstanding items with 
HM Revenue & Customs.
As part of the exercise to revalue assets 
at the year end, management also reviewed
the Group’s deferred tax provision for
unrealised gains under IAS12. This review
has resulted in a prior year adjustment
which has the effect of increasing the
deferred tax provision in the opening
balance sheet by £76m. This adjustment
has no impact on previously reported
profits. In addition, as a result of the
revaluation, the deferred tax balance at 29
September 2007 has increased by £296m.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share were 35.5p before
exceptional items, 21.2% ahead of 
last year. In addition to the growth in
operating profit, earnings per share have
benefited from a 17% reduction in the
average number of shares mainly as a
result of the 34 for 41 share consolidation
carried out in October 2006 in conjunction
with the Special Dividend.
The loss per share after exceptional 
items was 2.5p reflecting primarily 
the exceptional accounting losses 
on the financial hedges entered into 
in anticipation of a property refinancing 
and the proposed joint venture 
transaction with R20.
Dividends and returns to shareholders
The Board is recommending a final
dividend for 2007 of 10 pence per share.
Together with the interim dividend 
of 4.25 pence paid on 29 June 2007, 
this gives a total dividend for the year 
of 14.25 pence, up 16.3% on last year.
Notwithstanding a more challenging
outlook for the economy and the market
environment, the proposed increase in 
the ordinary dividend is underpinned by
the strong underlying earnings per share
performance achieved in the year. The
Board remains committed to a progressive
policy for dividends consistent with the
growth prospects of the Company.
Subject to approval at the AGM on 
31 January 2008, the final dividend will be
paid on 4 February 2008 to shareholders
on the register on 7 December 2007.
Since Mitchells & Butlers listed in 
April 2003, shareholders have received
more than £1.1bn in cash through Special
Dividends and share buybacks, over 
and above ordinary dividends paid. 
This represents more than 70% of the
Company’s market capitalisation at 
the time.
Mitchells & Butlers
Annual report and accounts 2007 21
Cash flow and net debt
The Group’s operations continue to be
highly cash generative. Cash flow from
operations was £447m before exceptional
items but after additional pension
contributions of £40m. Net capital
expenditure was £99m including £80m 
of expenditure on the Acquired Sites,
£51m of core expansionary capital
investment, £122m of maintenance
capital, less disposal proceeds of £162m.
Net interest paid of £145m was £38m
higher than last year reflecting the
increased level of debt in the business. 
Tax paid was £33m, £15m lower than 
the prior year driven primarily by £10m 
of tax rebates received from HM Revenue
& Customs during the year. Payments
totalling £52m were made in respect of
the final dividend for FY 2006 and the
interim dividend for FY 2007 in addition
to the Special Dividend of £486m paid 
in October 2006. £46m was spent to
repurchase shares, whilst £11m was
received from the exercise of share options.
As a result, there was a net cash outflow 
of £399m before exceptional costs of
£12m and bond repayments of £39m. 
This compared to a cash outflow before
exceptional items of £428m last year. 
Net debt at the year end was £2,479m,
£412m higher than last year, representing
5.25 times EBITDA.
Share price and market capitalisation
At 28 September 2007 the share price 
was 611p compared with 590p at the start
of the financial year, an increase of 3.6%.
The Company is a member of the FTSE
100 index with a market capitalisation of
approximately £2.5bn at the year end.
Treasury management
The financial risks faced by the Group 
are identified and managed by a central
Treasury department. The activities of 
the Treasury function are carried out in
accordance with Board approved policies
and are subject to regular audit. The
department does not operate as a profit
centre.
At 29 September 2007, the Group’s 
net debt of £2,479m consisted of the
securitised debt of £2,356m, borrowings
on the Group’s revolving credit facility of
£192m, derivatives hedging balance sheet
debt of £45m, other loan notes and
finance lease obligations together totalling
£3m, offset by a cash balance of £117m.
Pensions
On an IAS19 basis, the Group’s pensions
schemes showed a deficit of £18m, 
(£14m after tax) at 29 September 2007
compared with £99m (£67m after tax)
at 30 September 2006. The reduction in
the deficit reflects the benefit of £40m of
additional pension contributions paid in
the year and improved investment returns,
partially offset by updated assumptions of
life expectancy.
The full actuarial review undertaken in the
year is currently being finalised based on
the value of the schemes as at 31 March
2007. The actuarial valuation adopts a
more conservative basis of discounting the
liabilities than is required by IAS19 and
the preliminary result shows a deficit of
approximately £250m. In line with the
new pensions regulations, the Company 
is finalising with the Trustees a formal
recovery plan to close this deficit by 2017.
As part of this plan, in addition to the
ordinary annual service contributions, 
it is expected that further contributions 
of £24m will be made in each of the next
three years. The contribution for the 
year ending 30 September 2008 will
include the payment of £20m previously
committed at the time of the Special
Dividend in October 2006. The level of
additional contributions will be subject to
review during the next actuarial valuation
as at 31 March 2010.
Shareholders’ funds
Shareholders funds were £1,576m at the
end of the year including the impact of
the property revaluation compared with
£1,209m at the start of the year which
incorporates the impact of the £76m prior
year adjustment.

Operating
and financial
review
Overview This section highlights some of the
particular risks which affect the Group 
but it is not intended to be an extensive
analysis of all risks which may arise in the
ordinary course of business or otherwise.
Some risks may be unknown to the Group
and other risks, currently regarded as
immaterial, could turn out to be material.
There are a number of potential risks and
uncertainties which could have a material
impact on Mitchells & Butlers’ long-term
performance and achievement of its
strategy. These risks and uncertainties
arise as a result of operational, market
driven, regulatory or financial factors.
Mitchells & Butlers adopts a pro-active
approach in this area with each member 
of the Executive Committee taking
responsibility for the management of 
the specific risks associated with their
department; and a dedicated Group
Assurance team who report through the
HR Director and General Counsel to 
the Executive Committee and the Board. 
The Company also operates a Risk
Management and Disclosure Forum 
to ensure that the impact of any new
legislation is considered and that action
plans are put in place to address any
required changes in advance of any
implementation date. Although Mitchells
& Butlers has been successful in mitigating
these risks in the past, there is no
guarantee that it can continue to do so.
Operational factors
Brands, formats and offerings
Mitchells & Butlers’ pubs and pub
restaurants compete for consumers 
with a wide variety of other branded 
and non-branded pubs and restaurants 
as well as off-licences, supermarkets 
and takeaways. The large supermarket
groups, in particular, often sell alcohol
and especially canned beer, at greatly
discounted prices as an element of their
marketing strategy. In 1980, 88% of beer
in the UK was sold through pubs, clubs
and restaurants (the ‘on-trade’). This
percentage has been declining steadily,
such that during 2006, 57% of beer was
sold through the on-trade with the
supermarkets’ and off-licences’ share 
(the ‘off-trade’) having increased 
to 43%. Competition in the eating-out
market has also increased particularly as 
a result of the smoking ban, implemented
in England on 1 July 2007, which has 
led to many pubs either beginning to 
sell food, having not done so previously, 
or improving their food offers.
Changes in consumer tastes in both food
and drink, for example the heightened
awareness of healthy eating, and
demographic trends over time may 
affect the appeal of Mitchells & Butlers’
pubs and pub restaurants to consumers.
This may be especially so if the Group
does not anticipate, identify and respond
by evolving its brands, formats and
offerings adequately and sufficiently
promptly to reflect such changes in
consumer requirements and preferences,
particularly in regard to the growth in the
eating-out market.
Mitchells & Butlers has a Sales and
Marketing executive for both the Pubs &
Bars and Restaurants divisions, chaired by
the Divisional Managing Director, which
actively monitors consumer trends and the
corresponding relevance of Mitchells &
Butlers’ brands, formats and offerings.
Trials of new operating formats and the
evolution of existing offers are undertaken
every year as part of this programme. A
recent example has been the development
of a format called Pub & Carvery, which
was first trialled over two years ago and is
now trading in 58 sites.
Supplier dynamics
Food and drink purchases account for the
majority of Mitchells & Butlers’ supply
costs. Mitchells & Butlers’ relative size 
in the pub and pub restaurant sector,
particularly following the purchase of the
Acquired Sites in July 2006, has allowed it
to renegotiate supplier contracts
successfully in the past year. In addition, 
as the Group’s legacy tied drinks
arrangements have reduced, Mitchells &
Butlers has taken advantage of its
increasing freedom to increase the choice
available to customers on favourable terms.
However Mitchells & Butlers is
contractually bound to use certain
suppliers. Most notably, as part of its
acquisition of the 550 former Allied
Domecq sites in 1999, Mitchells & Butlers
was required to purchase a fixed minimum
volume of Carlsberg-Tetley products until
12 December 2007. Mitchells & Butlers is
also tied for approximately half of its soft
drinks volume to Britvic plc until February
2008. If Mitchells & Butlers was unable 
to satisfy its minimum purchase volume
obligations to a material extent under
these agreements, it would be obliged to
pay liquidated damages. During the year,
Mitchells & Butlers took the opportunity
to enter into a new, shorter-term
agreement with Carlsberg-Tetley which 
has given more flexibility to the business
and negotiations are well advanced to
ensure that the Company’s soft drinks
purchases are renegotiated on more
favourable terms.
In food, the larger number of food
ingredients and the more fragmented
nature of food suppliers on the world
commodity markets means that Mitchells
& Butlers has a greater opportunity to
source food purchases from alternative
suppliers than is the case with the drinks
market. However, Mitchells & Butlers
continues to be exposed to the risk of
higher food prices depending on global
availability and demand for products.
Mitchells & Butlers is also exposed to
movements in distribution costs for food
and drinks as suppliers’ increased fuel
costs may be passed on to the Company.
Mitchells & Butlers is a large commercial
user of gas and electricity and is therefore
subject to fluctuations in utility costs (for
example, both gas and electricity costs
rose sharply during FY 2006 due to global
price increases). In order to reduce
exposure to short-term fluctuations in
energy prices, Mitchells & Butlers has a
rolling programme of forward purchases
for three, six, nine and 12 months in the
future. An energy awareness team has
been established to review energy usage
and is working with the business to
continue to find ways to promote further
efficiencies in energy consumption.
Market driven factors
Consumer expenditure
The Group’s revenues are linked 
to the economic climate in the United
Kingdom and, to a much lesser extent, 
in Germany. Changes in consumer
expenditure may arise as a result of the
general economic situation, such as in the
latter part of this year when rising interest
rates and an increased indirect tax burden
appear to have impacted consumer
confidence, or more localised specific
factors such as decreased activity in the
financial markets or from reduced tourist
visits as a result of terrorist activity
throughout the world and in London.
Consumer expenditure in pubs may also
vary through consumer perceptions and
attitudes to safety and public order and
localised national or international scares
as a result of food contamination.
However, Mitchells & Butlers has over
2,000 individual businesses and its range
of brands and formats targeting different
income and consumer groups mitigates
this risk. This wide range of offers
provides the flexibility to respond to
changes in consumer behaviour through
either the evolution of the offer or the
substitution of an alternative operating
format or brand at a particular location.
Seasonality
Customer visits to the Company’s pubs
and pub restaurants are generally higher
during holiday periods, such as Christmas
and New Year, and over bank holidays.
Frequenting of pubs and pub restaurants
is otherwise slightly lower during the
winter months than in the summer. Visits
to pubs and pub restaurants are also

review
affected by the weather, with warm sunny
weather being particularly advantageous
for pubs and pub restaurants with
gardens. Mitchells & Butlers’ marketing
strategies address the impact of
seasonality, wherever possible, to capture
demand in busy periods and to encourage
customers to visit in quieter periods.
Regulatory factors
Mitchells & Butlers operates in a heavily
regulated sector and changes in regulation
can have a significant impact upon
Mitchells & Butlers’ business. Some
examples of the regulatory changes which
could affect Mitchells & Butlers include:
Smoking bans
Approximately 90% of Mitchells & Butlers
pubs are in England where a full ban 
on smoking in pubs came into force on 
1 July 2007. Trading in Scotland in the
first year after its ban came into force 
(26 March 2006) was less strong than in
England in the same period with total
like-for-like sales up 2% with food sales 
up 8% and drink sales flat. Since then,
sales have continued to grow but at a
slower rate than in England as new users
sample the smoke-free atmosphere. Our
experience so far suggests that large pubs,
with the capability to serve high volumes
of good food at attractive prices, will
benefit from a ban on smoking. However,
smaller pubs, with limited food capacity
and a bias towards beer sales and machine
income are likely to suffer.
National Minimum Wage
The Government has increased the
minimum wage by an average of 5.6% per
annum over the last five years, materially
above the rate of inflation. It currently
stands at £5.52 per hour having been
increased by 17p for adults in October
2007. The Low Pay Commission has
recommended that any further increase 
in the national minimum wage should
remain in line with general wage inflation,
although to date this recommendation has
not been endorsed by the Government. In
addition, in October 2007 the Government
increased the statutory holiday entitlement
of all employees from 20 to 24 days, which
further increased the Group’s employment
costs. Mitchells & Butlers has in the past
successfully mitigated these statutory
increases in employment costs through
productivity improvements. These
measures have allowed the Group to
maintain the ratio of employment costs 
at 24% of sales in 2007.
Licensing
New licensing laws became fully effective
in November 2005. Licensing matters
were taken away from the Magistrates
Courts and transferred to local authorities
and a new requirement was introduced for
operators of licensed premises to hold a
premises licence and the manager of the
pub to hold a personal licence. Greater
flexibility of opening hours was introduced
which allows pub operators to apply to the
local authority for permission to change
opening hours, subject to objections from
local residents, the police and other
relevant agencies.
However, these groups also now have 
a right to ask the local authority for the
premises licence to be reviewed at any
time where they believe that any of the
Government’s licensing objectives are
being compromised. As a result of such
review, the local authority has the power 
to attach further conditions to the licence,
reduce trading hours, call for a change 
in the pub management or ultimately
suspend or revoke the licence.
Mitchells & Butlers has been successful in
the vast majority of initial applications to
extend previous opening hours (typically
for an additional hour or two later in the
week and at the weekend). The Group
does not hold any 24 hour licences.
Mitchells & Butlers also invests heavily in
the ongoing training of its managers and
staff to ensure continued compliance with
licensing laws and that its pubs are
operated in a responsible manner.
Changes in taxation
Mitchells & Butlers’ activities are affected
by a number of tax-related matters. 
These include duty on alcoholic
beverages, property rates, VAT and 
other business taxes.
Mitchells & Butlers ensures it takes
appropriate action to minimise the risks
from regulation through a number of
means including:
• active participation with industry
organisations, such as the British 
Beer & Pub Association and the British
Hospitality Association, ensuring that
effective lobbying is carried out;
• the operation of a Risk Management
and Disclosure Forum to ensure that 
the impact of any new legislation 
is considered and that action plans 
are put in place to address any 
required changes in advance of 
any implementation date; and
• continual consideration of operating
procedures to ensure any cost increases
arising from such changes can be
mitigated through productivity increases
or other cost reductions.
Financial factors
Pension funding
Mitchells & Butlers participates in defined
benefit pension schemes which give rise to
various funding risks. The main risk is the
variability of the amount of contributions
required to be paid to the schemes by
Mitchells & Butlers in order to account 
for past service benefit deficits and future
service benefit accruals. These in turn are
impacted at any point in time by changes
in life expectancy assumptions, the
performance of the stock market and
bond yields.
Recent legislation means that it may 
be appropriate to approach the Pensions
Regulator for pre-clearance of agreements
reached with the Pension Trustees at the
time of significant corporate transactions.
Such clearance may include a requirement
to increase the level of funding over a
reduced timescale.
Mitchells & Butlers’ pension risks have
been mitigated by the closure of the
defined benefit schemes to new entrants 
in 2002. As an alternative, a competitive
defined contribution pension scheme is
now available to eligible new employees.
Mitchells & Butlers also maintains a close
dialogue with the pensions schemes’
Trustees and two of the Trustees are
appointed by the Company. As a result 
of the funding deficits in the schemes, 
the Company has made additional
contributions of £145m over and above
the regular service contributions since
listing in 2003 in order to proactively
reduce the deficit. The Company has
previously committed to make an
additional contribution of £20m during
FY 2008. A full actuarial valuation of the
schemes was conducted during FY 2007.
The results of this review are expected to
be finalised in December 2007, together
with a fresh schedule of contributions as
required by the new pensions regulations.
Property backed refinancing and related
hedging arrangements
During the year, the Company entered
into certain interest and inflation hedging
arrangements in anticipation of a property
backed refinancing around a joint venture
arrangement with R20. However, the
sudden, rapid deterioration in debt
market conditions in the summer meant
that an appropriate financing structure
was not possible and the transaction could
not be executed. The hedges remain in
place as the Board believes it is highly
likely that these financial instruments 
will be used in a future property based 
refinancing once debt markets have
stabilised. However there is a risk that no
property based refinancing will occur or
that the Company’s strategy could change
such that the hedges would need to be
closed out, which would currently result 
in a substantial cash loss. The Company
has in place a process to monitor the
movement in the value of the hedges 
and the position is kept under close 
and regular review by the Board.
Overview 24
Corporate social responsibility
Corporate social responsibility
Mitchells & Butlers operates in a highly
regulated industry and recognises that it
has an inherent duty under its licences to:
• ensure the responsible operation of its
premises for guests, employees and the
wider community; and
• promote the objectives of the Licensing
Act 2003, namely:
– the prevention of crime and disorder
– public safety
– the prevention of public nuisance
– the protection of children from harm.
This is at the heart of the business and is
why the Company strives to ensure that
corporate social responsibility underpins
its business operation at every level.
Please note that the following sections
provide a summary only of our policies 
in respect of our corporate social
responsibility (‘CSR’) activity. A more
detailed account of Mitchells & Butlers’
CSR practices and corporate compliance,
including case studies, can be found 
in our separately published Corporate
Social Responsibility Review 2007 
on www.mbplc.com/csrreview
Corporate governance
The Board is responsible for the Company’s
internal control and risk management
system. The Corporate Governance report
on page 30 gives details of how this
responsibility is discharged.
Our Executive Committee, comprising the
HR Director and General Counsel as well
as the Chief Executive and the Finance
Director, has adopted a Code of Ethics 
to promote honest and ethical conduct
throughout our business. The code
includes:
• the ethical handling of actual or
apparent conflicts of interest between
personal and professional relationships;
• a requirement that any hospitality from
suppliers must be approved, with a
presumption against its acceptance;
• requiring full, fair, accurate, timely and
understandable disclosure in periodic
reports required to be filed by Mitchells
& Butlers plc; and
• promoting compliance with all
applicable rules and regulations that
apply to the Company and its officers.
Our Business Conduct guidelines describe
the standards of behaviour expected from
those working for the Company. Our
corporate reputation depends on all staff
acting in good conscience and behaving
with integrity in our dealings with
employees, shareholders, customers,
suppliers and all other stakeholders.
Mitchells & Butlers offers an
independently administered confidential
hotline, also known as a whistleblowing
hotline, for any employee wishing to report
any concern that they may have that 
they feel unable to raise with their line
manager. All whistleblowing allegations
are reported to and considered by the
Audit Committee.
The Board takes regular account of 
social, environmental and ethical matters
concerning the Company through the
Chief Executive’s regular reports to the
Board, presentations to the Board at its
strategy meetings and through adoption
of its Code of Ethics. The Company
Secretary is responsible for ensuring that
Directors are made aware of and receive
training in respect of such matters. 
Formal reporting to the Board of social,
environmental and ethical matters takes
place every six months.
Identification and assessment of risks 
to the Company’s short and long-term
value arising from social, ethical and
environmental matters are achieved
through the Company’s Major Risk and
Assurance Review, regularly updated and
presented to the Board annually. The
Board considers as an intrinsic part of this
review whether the steps taken to address
these risks are appropriate. These are
detailed further below. Opportunities 
to enhance the Company’s value are
considered as part of that review and 
at strategy discussions.
A Mitchells & Butlers Risk Management
and Disclosure Forum exists to monitor
the Company’s activities and to ensure
that a consistent and proactive approach
to managing risk occurs throughout the
Company, including those of a social,
ethical or environmental nature. The
Forum aims to meet on a quarterly basis.
The Board also receives regular updates
on significant legislative change or
development in corporate governance 
best practice. The Company’s social,
environmental and ethical disclosures 
are reviewed for accuracy through 
a combination of detailed verification 
by members of management responsible 
for the individual areas of corporate 
social responsibility and high level reviews
by the members of the Board and
Executive Committee.
Alcohol and Social Responsibility policy
Mitchells & Butlers was one of the first
companies to establish a comprehensive
policy for the responsible retailing of
alcohol, in 2000. Our Alcohol & Social
Responsibility (‘ASR’) policy includes clear
guidelines on the responsible operation 
of our pubs; the sale and promotion 
of alcohol; our under-18s policy; and 
our staff training and development
programmes.
The introduction of our leading 
policy shaped the development and
implementation of industry-wide codes 
of conduct. We update the policy regularly,
re-launching it in October 2004 and in
May 2006. In August this year we updated
it again to reflect:
• the acceptance of an international
passport as a recognised form of
identification – we continue also to
accept UK Passports, UK photograph
driving licences, and proof of age cards
bearing the PASS hologram as
recognised forms of identification;
• the tightening of guidelines around
pricing, discounting and promotions
across our businesses; and
• the inclusion of new information 
listing the units of alcohol contained 
in commonly served drinks.
We are determined to ensure that
Mitchells & Butlers’ pubs are operated 
in a way that fully justifies the grant 
of a licence for the responsible retailing 
of alcohol. In that regard we were 
pleased to be recognised by the Morning
Advertiser for the second time as this
year’s most responsible drinks retailer 
in the managed pubs category.
Challenge 21
Mitchells & Butlers led the industry in
2004 when we launched our Challenge 21
campaign. It is not an over 21s only
entrance policy but rather a requirement
to ask for identification if a customer
appears to be under 21, so as to prove
that he or she is at least 18 years of age.
The principle of Challenge 21 – to support
and educate our staff and customers on
the issues relating to under-age sales – is
now firmly embedded in our Company
culture. To monitor the scale of attempted
under-age purchasing in our pubs, we now
record all instances of refusal to serve and
are currently registering around 50,000
refusals per month.
Mitchells & Butlers
Annual report and accounts 2007 25
Through our various training
programmes, all our retail staff, including
door staff, are made aware of their
responsibilities for serving alcohol and the
personal penalties for failure to comply
with the Licensing Act requirements.
We also regularly audit our businesses to
ensure our practices are being maintained
and employ an independent company to
perform test purchasing visits as an
additional check.
Responsible promotions policy
As part of our Alcohol and Social
Responsibility policy we have strict
guidelines in place regarding the pricing
and promotion of our drinks. Any
promotional activity must be approved by
the Marketing Director and observe the
guidelines outlined in our ASR policy.
The guiding principles of the Company’s
policy are:
• to offer guests real service and value 
at fair, competitive prices;
• to seek to encourage guests to return 
to Mitchells & Butlers’ pubs, rather than
to encourage increased consumption 
by guests during a single visit;
• to ensure that guests are offered choice
and value without inducements to drink
to excess. We will not, for example, 
offer any ‘2 for the price of 1’ drinks
promotions; and
• to encourage and support designated
driver and other anti-drink/drive
initiatives.
Mitchells & Butlers is a member of 
the British Beer & Pub Association and
played a central role in the formation 
of the organisation’s code encouraging
promotional activity. In addition all our
promotional activity complies with the
Portman Group’s Code of Practice.
Alcohol awareness
Mitchells & Butlers is a major contributor
to the Drinkaware Trust, an independent
UK-wide charitable trust with the objective
of positively changing public behaviour
and the national drinking culture, to
tackle alcohol-related harms.
Our updated ASR policy issued in August
this year now includes details of units 
of alcohol in relation to the ABV of every
alcoholic product sold in our pubs, to
ensure staff can assist customers who ask
for guidance. Brand specific training also
highlights ABV information to managers
and staff as part of all new product
inductions. ABV information and
responsible retailing messages are also
included in some drinks menus and
promotional materials, to raise staff 
and customer awareness.
Conflict management
Mitchells & Butlers recognises that failure
to identify and resolve potential sources 
of conflict in our pubs or on the door can
have serious consequences. As a result,
conflict management training is
undertaken as appropriate within our
retail management training, helping to
reduce the risk of serious incidents and
better protect both employees and guests.
Conflict management training also helps
our staff to manage issues associated with
drugs abuse. Where there is any evidence
of such in our businesses, we move 
rapidly to assess the situation and take
appropriate, tough measures to resolve 
the matter immediately.
Industry partnerships
Mitchells & Butlers works closely with the
key authorities, including the Police, Fire,
Local Authorities and the Government, in
pursuit of our commitment to responsible
retailing practices.
It is Company policy for all pub managers
to join and support their local ‘Pubwatch’,
if one exists, which we believe both builds
relationships within the area and helps
staff identify and resolve potential issues
before they escalate.
Across the country, a number of individual
Mitchells & Butlers’ pubs have gained
recognition from city councils and the
police for running safe, responsible
businesses via the Best Bar None Award
scheme and City Safe schemes.
We support regional Crime and Disorder
partnerships and aim to participate fully
in the drive against ‘binge drinking’ and
its related effects, as outlined in the
Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for
England.
We also support a number of Business
Improvement District schemes (‘BID’s) for
example Broad Street, Birmingham and
the current proposal for Nottingham.
Licensing Act
The Licensing Act 2003 came into effect
on 24 November 2005. From that date
licensed premises have been able to 
make use of any variations to previous
opening hours granted by the relevant
local authority.
Mitchells & Butlers has so far applied 
for an average of just over one additional
hour per day per pub. In making
applications we sought to balance the
opportunity to offer our guests more
flexible opening times with respect for
local communities. In the vast majority 
of cases our applications were successful.
We do not hold – not did we apply for –
any 24 hour licences.
The Company’s experience has been 
one of successful implementation, much 
of this due to extensive education as to 
the objectives of the Licensing Act and
training to ensure these objectives are
adhered to. We have seen a marginal
increase in sales overall, but with less
pressure at closing time and few instances
of disorder.
Smoking bans
We believe the introduction of the smoking
bans will be beneficial to our businesses in
the longer-term. They present us with a
real opportunity to attract new customers,
who did not previously use pubs because
of tobacco smoke, to come into our pubs
and pub restaurants across the country.
Our experience since the bans came into
force shows that our large pubs, serving
high volumes of good food at attractive
prices, are already seeing this benefit.
We’re continuing to develop the
reputation of our pubs for serving 
good food at good value prices, focusing
on innovation in the development of 
our menus and drinks ranges, to appeal 
to a wider consumer base arising from 
the ban.
Gaming
Mitchells & Butlers was involved in the
creation of the first gaming industry code
of practice in the 1990s that aimed to
prevent under 18s from playing pub
gaming machines. The Company has
contributed for many years – in cash and
in kind – to charities such as GamCare
that work in the area of treatment for
problem gamblers. In recent years, the
Company’s contributions have been made
via the Responsibility in Gambling Trust.

Commission on the drafting of the
Gaming Machine Code of Practice, which
replaced the industry’s voluntary Code
from 1 September 2007.
Good food
As the food supply chain becomes
increasingly complex, we take into account
a number of factors when purchasing our
food, including the health and safety of
our guests, food quality, provenance and
price. With large scale national brands
competing in different markets, we require
our suppliers to guarantee the supply of
large quantities of quality ingredients for
the life of a menu. Our objective is to offer
competitively priced dishes of appropriate
quality and provenance. In some instances
this means a regional supplier and in
others worldwide suppliers.
The Company carries out an assessment 
of the environmental policies and
practices of its major food suppliers.
Growers and farmers who supply Mitchells
& Butlers are required to comply with the
Euro-Retailer Produce Working Group’s
standard of good agricultural practice,
known as the EurepGAP Standard.
Mitchells & Butlers also abides by the
Code of Ethics issued by The Chartered
Institute of Purchasing & Supply. 
Our guiding principles on corporate
procurement are to:
• enable the Company to conduct its
procurement activities in a safe, ethical
and professional manner;
• exclude suppliers that disregard health,
safety and welfare;
• ensure all personnel conform with
national and EU laws;
• ensure representatives are fair and
reasonable with suppliers;
• exclude suppliers that exploit 
people unfairly; and
• utilise suppliers that preferentially
conserve the environment.
We aim to offer a broad range of menu
items across our estate so guests seeking
healthier options have plenty of choice.
Focus on menu development has enabled
us to offer guests more variety, from
sharing ‘small plate’ dishes in Ember Inns
or hand-cut Maris Piper chips in our
Metro Professionals format to the Best 
of British range in Cornerstone, our
successful community pub format. We
have developed fresh dishes that are
healthier and tastier, with a wider taste
profile and better provenance – for
example, organically farmed Shetland
salmon features on the new Vintage Inns
menu. Vegetarian options are also now
available across all our pubs.
We continue to develop our menus with
the focus to improve nutritional content.
In August this year, Harvester came top in
a national comparison of family restaurant
chains, carried out by an independent
dietician, on their offer of healthy dishes
for children.
Following the successful launch of
nutritional data on the Harvester website
in 2006, Toby Carvery will also be
launching a nutritional breakdown 
of all menu items in late 2007.
Environment
Mitchells & Butlers takes its environmental
responsibilities seriously and has a policy
of seeking continuous improvement, 
with particular focus on recycling and
energy usage.
We have an established recycling
programme for both glass and cardboard
in our businesses. In the last 12 months
we recycled over 14,000 tonnes of waste.
We are continuing to make excellent
progress in energy saving and, in
September, we opened our first ‘green’
business, designed to trial a number 
of energy saving measures, at the Toby
Carvery, Banbury.
Health and safety
The Company strives to provide a safe
environment for all employees, guests 
and other visitors to its premises and 
to comply with relevant health and safety
legislation. In addition, the Company:
• aims to protect the health 
of employees with suitable, 
specific work-based strategies;
• seeks to minimise the risk of injury 
from Company activity; and
• ensures that sufficient resources 
and information are made available 
and suitable management systems 
are in place to address health and 
safety matters.
The Board is responsible for ensuring 
that sufficient resources are available to
implement its Health and Safety policy.
Compliance with Company policy is
monitored and audited centrally and a
comprehensive annual health and safety
report is produced for the Board.
We use a major, independent safety and
assurance company to audit and report 
on safety practices in all businesses. 
These inspections, which take place 
at least twice a year, form an essential
element of our due diligence and include:
• independently verified means 
of monitoring safety standards;
• consistent audit systems across 
all businesses;
• an independent assessment of 
standards combined with technical
support on improvement; and
• education and training provision 
for businesses failing to meet our
expectations as to standards.
In addition to the Company’s internal
safety experts, leading consultants in the
fields of food safety and fire safety are also
retained. As a result of the audits, the
management of health and safety, food
safety and fire safety is constantly reviewed
and improvements made where necessary.

excellence in the OFR on page 15.
Community
Mitchells & Butlers is fully aware that 
each one of our businesses has an impact
on its local community. We aim to ensure
that this impact is always positive and we
pursue this through a carefully planned
blend of local and national initiatives.
Our pub managers raise thousands of
pounds for charity. They are supported 
via the Company’s Community Awards
and celebrated via the annual Heart of the
Community Awards. These recognise the
efforts of our employees in forging good
relations with their local communities. 
A prize fund of £25,000 is collectively
received by the award winners for
donation to their individually chosen 
good cause.
Our Employee Community Award scheme
encourages our employees to support 
a charity through their own fundraising
activity or voluntary work. During the last
year £40,000 has been donated by them to
variety of charities as part of the scheme.
Throughout the year we have also made 
a number of in-kind donations such as
offering use of Company facilities, such 
as meeting rooms, free of charge, and
donating complimentary meals in our
businesses to local community groups,
charities and schools.
Our brands are also are key supporters 
of national and local charities of their own
choice. Harvester restaurants have raised
£33,500 over the last 12 months for the
children’s charity Make-A-Wish Foundation
UK. In March, Ember Inns launched its
second annual ‘Drink Pink’ fundraising
campaign for leading charity Against
Breast Cancer. All Ember Inns pubs
donated 5p per glass of rose wine sold,
raising over £17,000 for the charity.
Mitchells & Butlers
Annual report and accounts 2007 27
Around 600 pubs including Ember Inns,
O’Neill’s and Hollywood Bowl offered
customers a free hot drink, in return 
for a voluntary donation, as part of their
involvement in Macmillan Cancer’s World’s
Biggest Coffee Morning in September.
We have marked our third year of
partnership with Barnardo’s with a further
£50,000 donation. Employees have also
supported the partnerships through
fundraising activities and raised an
additional £12,600.
As a leading company with its
headquarters in Birmingham we also
sponsor a number of successful arts
organisations in the city. Partnerships
include the City of Birmingham
Symphony Orchestra (CBSO),
Birmingham Royal Ballet (BRB), The
Birmingham REP and ExCathedra.
Our special CBSO On the Road
programme enters its fifth year of
community based concerts, performed 
by members of the orchestra around the
Midlands region. The concerts allow
community organisations to experience a
performance from professional musicians
while providing an excellent fundraising
opportunity. Our long-standing relationship
with the CBSO was recognised in this
year’s Jaguar Arts & Business Awards,
where the partnership won the inaugural
Champion of Champions award.
This year our sponsorship of the
Birmingham Royal Ballet has secured
additional funds from Arts & Business
enabling the BRB to host a series of
educational dance workshops in primary
schools across the West Midlands.
Including these additional funds from 
Arts & Business, the Company’s total
corporate donations were over £215,000
(2006, £200,000).
Our role as good neighbours
Our pubs and pub restaurants play an
important role in the heart of thousands
of communities across the UK. As a
Company we committed to encouraging
and supporting our businesses in this
community role. Through schemes such 
as Pubwatch and via our managers taking
part in Residents Association meetings, we
are able to establish better communication
and develop valuable discussion forums
for handling and resolving local issues.
The OFR’s intent is to provide
information to shareholders and should
not be relied upon by any other party 
or for any other purpose. This OFR, 
and other sections of this Annual 
Report, contain certain forward-looking
statements with respect to the operations,
performance and financial condition 
of the Group. By their nature, these
statements involve uncertainty since future
events and circumstances can cause results
and developments to differ materially
from those anticipated. The OFR and
other sections of this Annual Report
contain certain forward-looking statements
which are made by the Directors in good
faith based on the information available 
to them up to the date of their approval of
the financial statements and the Company
undertakes no obligation to update these
forward-looking statements. The forward-
looking statements should be treated with
caution due to the inherent uncertainties,
including both economic and business 
risk factors, underlying any such forward-
looking information. Nothing in this
Annual Report should be construed 
as a profit forecast.
The OFR has been prepared for the
Group as a whole and therefore gives
greater emphasis to those matters which
are of significance to Mitchells & Butlers
plc and its subsidiary undertakings 
when viewed as a whole.

Directors’ report
The Directors present their report 
for the year ended 29 September 2007.
This Directors’ report should be read 
in conjunction with the Chairman’s
statement and the Operating and 
financial review (the ‘OFR’) on pages 6 
to 27, including the Chief Executive’s
review, the Business review, the Finance 
Director’s report, the Financial review and
Corporate governance report (which are
incorporated in this Directors’ report by
reference). Details of the Group’s policy
on addressing financial risks are given 
in the OFR and details about financial
instruments are shown in Note 21 to the
financial statements. Together these
sections include information about the
Group’s business, its financial performance
during the year, likely developments, 
and any principal risks and uncertainties
associated with the Group’s business. 
Principal activities
Mitchells & Butlers is the leading operator
of managed pubs and pub restaurants,
with an estate of 2003 sites as at 
29 September 2007, principally located 
in the UK, and with 42 pub restaurants 
in Germany. 
Share capital
On 1 October 2006, the Company had
486,910,806 ordinary shares of 7
1
⁄ 12p in
issue. On 18 October 2006, having been
approved by shareholders, the share
capital of the Company was consolidated
in the ratio of 34 new ordinary shares 
of 8
13
⁄ 24p for every 41 existing ordinary
shares of 7
1
⁄ 12p. As at 29 September 2007,
403,779,693 ordinary shares of 8
13
⁄ 24p 
were in issue. 1,241,969 of these shares
were held in Treasury and the Company’s
employee share trusts held 1,070,449
shares at the year end. At the 2007 AGM,
shareholders passed a resolution to permit
the Directors to undertake market
purchases of up to 40,346,510 of the
Company’s shares. This authority will
expire at the earlier of the 2008 AGM 
or 1 May 2008.
Refinancing and return of funds to
shareholders
Following the refinancing that was
completed in September 2006 and the
share capital consolidation that occurred
on 18 October 2006, the Company paid 
a Special Dividend of £1 per share on 
25 October 2006 as an interim dividend
for the year ending 29 September 2007. 
Final dividend
The Board recommends a final dividend
for the year ended 29 September 2007 of
10.0p per share to be paid on 4 February
2008 to shareholders on the register at
close of business on 7 December 2007.
This makes a total dividend, including the
Special Dividend, for the year of 114.25p
per share (2006 12.25p per share). 
Securities and Exchange Commission
(‘SEC’) registration 
Since listing in 2003, the Company 
has been registered with the SEC under
the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the ‘Exchange Act’). However, the fact
that the presence of US shareholders 
was largely a legacy of the demerger from
Six Continents in 2003 and the increasing
costs of maintaining this US registration
prompted the Company to seek to
terminate its Exchange Act registration.
Following changes to the SEC rules
implemented in June 2007, the Company
was able to file to terminate its registration
under the Exchange Act. This termination
took effect on 4 September 2007 and
accordingly the Company no longer has
any reporting requirements under the
Exchange Act.
Substantial shareholders
As at 28 November 2007, the Company
had been notified of the following
beneficial interests (3% or more) 
in its shares:

to the Board during the year.
Adam Fowle was appointed to the 
Board on 1 October 2007. Tony Hughes
will stand down from the Board on 
31 December 2007.
Interests of the Directors and their
immediate families in the issued share
capital of the Company are set out in the
Remuneration report on page 44.
Directors’ indemnity
The Directors have the benefit of the
indemnity provision contained in the
Company’s Articles of Association. This
provision, which is a qualifying third party
indemnity provision as defined by Section
234 of the Companies Act 2006, was in
force throughout the last financial year
and is currently in force. The Company
also purchased and maintained
throughout the financial year Directors’
and Officers’ liability insurance in respect
of itself and its Directors.
Employees
The Group employed an average of
42,741 people in 2007 (2006 38,677).
Details of the Group’s employment
policies are shown on page 15 of 
the OFR.
Employee engagement
Mitchells & Butlers is keen to encourage
employee participation in the Group’s
success through share ownership and
operates the following share plans:
Sharesave Plan
In June 2007, options were granted to
2,498 employees over 938,905 shares 
at 711p per share, a 20% discount on 
the market price. On 1 October 2006, 
the Company’s first Sharesave offering
matured and 994 employees were able 
to exercise options over shares priced 
at 169p per share when the market price 
was 586.33p per share. This represented a
gain on their investment of over £22,000
for those employees saving the maximum
amount under the plan.
Share Incentive Plan
During the year 115,121 shares were
allocated by the Share Incentive Plan
trustee as free shares to 9,967 eligible
employees subject to the plan rules.
Executive Share Option Plan
Following the 2006 AGM, no further
awards are to be made under this plan.
3,796,471 shares under option and 
priced at 252.5p per share vested during
the year.
Performance Restricted Share Plan
During the year, 65 employees were
granted nominal cost options which 
will vest subject to the achievement of
performance conditions as set out in the
Remuneration report on page 38.
1,033,897 shares under option vested
during the year. 29
Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan
At the discretion of the Remuneration
Committee, Directors may elect to take
50% or more of their annual bonus in
shares. These shares are deferred for three
years. A matching award of shares is made
by the Company, which is is also deferred
for a three year period and is released
subject to the satisfaction of a three year
performance condition.
252,979 shares were released under this
plan during the year. The Executive
Directors’ maximum accrued entitlements
for the year and for future release are set
out on page 42.
Headroom limits
During the year, the Company has
remained within its headroom limits 
for the issue of new shares for share 
plans as set out in the rules of the plans. 
At 29 September 2007, the position under
the ‘5% in 10 years’ limit for discretionary
plans was that shares equivalent to 2.06%
of the ordinary share capital had been
allocated and under the ‘10% in 10 years’
limit for all share plans was that shares
equivalent to 2.4% of the ordinary share
capital had been allocated. The Company
uses an Employee Benefit Trust to acquire
shares in the market when appropriate to
satisfy share awards. 
Health and safety
It is important to the Group to provide
and maintain a safe environment for all
employees, customers and other visitors 
to its premises. The Group complies with
relevant health and safety legislation.
Details are included on page 26 of 
the OFR.
Environmental and social responsibility
Mitchells & Butlers recognises that it is
part of a wider community and recognises
that it has a responsibility to act in a way
that respects the environment and the
social wellbeing of others. A summary 
of the Company’s approach to these issues
is set out on page 26 of the OFR.
Policy on payment of suppliers
Mitchells & Butlers plc is a holding
company and has no trade creditors. 
The policy of its principal operating
subsidiaries is to agree particular terms
with major suppliers and abide by those
terms, subject to satisfactory performance
by the supplier. Amounts owed to other
suppliers are settled in the month
following that in which the subsidiaries
receive a valid invoice. 
Charitable donations and 
charitable activity
The Company continues to support
community initiatives and charitable
causes, full details of which are given 
on page 26 of the OFR.
Political donations
The Company made no political
donations during the year and intends 
to maintain its policy of not making 
such payments. It will, however, 
as a precautionary measure to avoid
inadvertent breach of the law, seek
shareholder authority at its 2008 AGM 
to make limited donations or incur 
limited political expenditure, although 
it has no intention of using the authority.
Going concern
The financial statements which appear 
on pages 47 to 86 have been prepared 
on a going concern basis as, after making
appropriate enquiries, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the
Group has adequate resources to continue
in operational existence for the
foreseeable future.
Annual General Meeting
The notice convening the Annual General
Meeting to be held at 11.00am on
Thursday, 31 January 2008 is contained 
in a circular sent to shareholders with 
this report. At the meeting, resolutions 
will be proposed to renew the authority 
to issue shares without applying statutory
pre-emption rights and to authorise the
Company to make market purchases of its
own shares. Resolutions to make certain
amendments to the Articles of Association
are proposed to bring the Company’s
Articles of Association in line with age
discrimination legislation and the
Companies Act 2006. In particular, the
Company is seeking the right to use
electronic means as the default method 
of communicating with its shareholders,
for example by using the website for
delivery of the Annual report and accounts.
Shareholders will be given the opportunity
to elect to receive a hard copy, rather than
receive it by default as at present. Full
details of these resolutions are provided 
in the shareholder circular.
Auditors
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed 
their willingness to continue in office 
as auditors of the Company and their
reappointment will be put to shareholders
at the AGM.
The Directors who held office as at the
date of approval of this Directors’ report
confirm that so far as they are each aware,
there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditors are
unaware; and that each Director has 
taken all steps that ought to have been
taken as a director to be aware of any
relevant audit information and to
establish that the Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information.

Corporate Governance report
Combined Code compliance
The Board recognises the importance 
of good corporate governance in creating
a successful, sustainable and profitable
business. It is committed to compliance
with the principles of corporate
governance as set out in the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance 
(the ‘Combined Code’) and considers that
the Company has complied throughout
the year ended 29 September 2007 with
all the provisions of the Combined Code,
except where explained below.
The Board is responsible for the 
Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management and for reviewing its
effectiveness. In order to discharge that
responsibility, the Board has established 
the procedures necessary to apply the
Combined Code, including clear operating
procedures, lines of responsibility and
delegated authority. These procedures have
been in place since the Group was listed
and are regularly reviewed by the Board.
Business performance is managed closely
and, in particular, the Board and the
Executive Committee have established
processes, as part of the normal good
management of the business, to monitor:
• strategic plan achievement, through a
comprehensive series of strategic
reviews;
• financial performance within a
comprehensive financial planning and
accounting framework;
• capital investment and asset
management performance, with detailed
appraisal, authorisation and post
investment reviews; 
• consumer insight data and actions to
evolve brands and formats to ensure that
they continue to be relevant; and
• risk management, through an ongoing
process, which accords with the Turnbull
guidance and provides assurance
through reports from Group Assurance,
that the significant risks faced by the
Group are being identified, evaluated
and appropriately managed, having
regard to the balance of risk, cost and
opportunity.
In addition, the Audit Committee receives:
• reports from Group Assurance on the
work carried out under the annual
internal audit plan; and
• reports from the external auditors.
Through the monitoring processes set 
out above, the Board has conducted a
review of the effectiveness of the system 
of internal control during the year ended 
29 September 2007. The system of
internal control is designed to manage,
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and, as such,
it can only provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss. In that context, the
review, in the opinion of the Board, did
not indicate that the system was ineffective
or unsatisfactory and the Board is not
aware of any change to this status up 
to the approval of this Annual Report.
Although the Company is no longer
required to comply with the requirements
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to certify the
effectiveness of its financial controls, the
Directors remain fully committed to
ensuring that the Group operates a good
control environment. 
With regard to insurance against risk, it is
not practicable to insure against every risk
to the fullest extent. The Group regularly
reviews both the type and amount of
external insurance that it buys, bearing 
in mind the availability of such cover, its
cost and the likelihood and magnitude 
of the risks involved.
Board and committee structure
To support the principles of good
corporate governance, the Board and
committee structure operates as set 
out below:
The Board
The Board consists of the part-time 
Non-Executive Chairman, four Executive
and four independent Non-Executive
Directors.
There are nine Board meetings currently
planned for 2008, and there were eight
scheduled meetings during 2006/07. 
Sir Tim Lankester and Sara Weller 
were each unable to attend one meeting,
otherwise there was full attendance. 
Seven additional Board meetings were
held during the year. George Fairweather, 
Tony Hughes, Sir Tim Lankester and 
Sara Weller were each unable to attend
one of these additional meetings. Where 
a Director was unable to attend a meeting,
he or she was provided with all the papers
and information relating to that meeting
and was able to discuss issues arising with
the Chairman and Chief Executive.
The Board is responsible to shareholders
for the strategic direction, development
and control of the Group. It therefore
approves strategic plans and annual
capital and revenue budgets. It reviews
significant investment proposals and the
performance of past investments and
maintains an overview and control of 
the Group’s operating and financial
performance. It monitors the Group’s
overall system of internal controls,
governance and compliance and ensures
that the necessary financial and human
resources are in place for the Company 
to meet its objectives. The Board has
established a schedule of matters which
are reserved for its attention which are
published on the Company’s website.
The Board has adopted objective written
criteria for the appointment of Directors
and the roles of the Chairman, Chief
Executive and Non-Executive Directors
have been defined in writing.
The Company Secretary’s responsibilities
include ensuring good information flows
to the Board and its committees and
between senior management and the 
Non-Executive Directors. The Company
Secretary is responsible through the
Chairman for advising the Board on all
corporate governance matters and for
assisting the Directors with their
professional development, as well as
facilitating the induction of Directors. This
includes regular corporate governance
and business issues updates, as well as 
the use of operational site visits and the
provision of external courses where
required. The appointment and removal
of the Company Secretary is a matter
reserved for the Board.  31
Directors
The following were Directors of the
Company during the year:

Tony Hughes Managing Director, 
Restaurants 15.04.03
Karim Naffah Finance Director 15.04.03
Sara Weller Independent 
Non-Executive Director 15.04.03
Sir Tim Lankester Independent 
Non-Executive Director 16.05.03
Drummond Hall Independent 
Non-Executive Director 30.07.04
Adam Fowle was appointed to the 
Board on 1 October 2007 and 
Tony Hughes will stand down from 
the Board on 31 December 2007.
Directors’ biographical details are 
set out on page 28 of the Annual review
and summary financial statement 2007 
and these include their main commitments
outside the Company.
The Company ensures that Directors
submit themselves for re-election at least
every three years. 
Mike Bramley, Roger Carr and Drummond
Hall will retire by rotation and offer
themselves for reappointment at the 2008
AGM on 31 January. As Adam Fowle was
appointed during the year, he will also
stand for reappointment at the 2008 AGM.
More information about the Directors
standing for reappointment is set out 
in the AGM Notice.
Details of the Executive Directors’ service
contracts are set out on page 40. The
Chairman and the four independent 
Non-Executive Directors have letters 
of appointment. 
Chairman
Roger Carr is Chairman of the Board and
has responsibility for the smooth running
of the Board and for ensuring that all
Directors are fully informed of matters
relevant to their roles. He also ensures
that appropriate communication is
maintained with shareholders. Roger’s
external appointments include chairing 
a FTSE 100 company and he is deputy
chairman of another. On 20 April 2007,
the Company entered the FTSE 100. 
As a result, the requirement in the
Combined Code that a chairman should
not chair more than one FTSE 100
company is no longer met. The
independent Non-Executive Directors 
led by the Senior Independent Director
specifically considered the impact of 
this and his continued contribution 
as part of the Board effectiveness review
referred to on page 32. This confirmed
that he demonstrates through his energy,
commitment, wealth of experience and
dedication, that he is more than capable
of devoting sufficient time to his role of
Chairman of the Company alongside his
other external appointments.
The Chairman separately met with the
Non-Executives without the Executive
Directors present as part of the Board
Effectiveness Review.
Chief Executive
Tim Clarke is the Chief Executive and 
has responsibility for implementing the
strategy agreed by the Board and for 
the executive management of the Group.
He has authority to approve capital
expenditure projects up to a level
authorised by the Board.
Senior Independent Director
Drummond Hall was appointed 
the Senior Independent Director 
on 23 February 2007. Sara Weller was
Senior Independent Director until then.
Drummond’s responsibilities include
being available to liaise with shareholders
who have issues to raise. He is a member
of the Remuneration Committee, 
the Nomination Committee and the 
Audit Committee. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Company has experienced
independent Non-Executive Directors 
who represent a strong source of advice 
and independent judgement. In addition
to the Chairman, who was independent
upon his appointment, there are 
four Non-Executive Directors, who 
the Board considers to be wholly
independent. Other than their fees 
which are disclosed on page 39, the
independent Non-Executive Directors
received no remuneration from the
Company during the year. When 
Non-Executive Directors are considered
for appointment, the Nomination
Committee will take into account their
other responsibilities in assessing whether
they can commit sufficient time to their
prospective directorship.
All Directors are briefed by use of
comprehensive papers circulated in
advance of Board meetings and by
presentations at the meetings in addition
to receiving minutes of previous meetings.
Their understanding of the Group’s
operations is enhanced by business
presentations and operational visits

Remuneration Committee
During the year, the Remuneration
Committee, which is chaired by Sara 
Weller, comprised the four independent 
Non-Executive Directors and the
Chairman. Roger Carr was appointed 
to the Remuneration Committee on 
1 October 2006, in line with revisions
made to the Combined Code during 
the year, although the Remuneration
Committee noted that these changes come
into effect for financial years beginning 
on or after 1 November 2006. This
Committee met six times during 2006/07.
Further details about the Remuneration
Committee are included in the
Remuneration Report on page 35.
Nomination Committee
This Committee consists of the Chairman
of the Board, who chairs the Committee,
the four independent Non-Executive
Directors and the Chief Executive. The
Company Secretary is Secretary to this
Committee. The terms of reference for
this Committee are consistent with the
requirements of the Combined Code. 
The Nomination Committee is responsible
for nominating, for the approval of the
Board, candidates for appointment to the
Board. It is also responsible for succession
planning and reviewing the output of the
Board effectiveness review. It met three
times during the year to consider
succession planning and to recommend
the appointment of Adam Fowle to the
Board. Although Sir Tim Lankester and
George Fairweather were each unable 
to attend one meeting, they were
nevertheless provided with all the papers
and information relating to that meeting
and were able to discuss issues arising with
the Chairman of the Committee. 
General Purposes Committee
The General Purposes Committee
comprises any two Executive Directors 
or any one Executive Director together
with a senior officer from an agreed and
restricted list of senior executives. It is
always chaired by a Director. It attends to
business of a routine nature and to the
administration of matters, the principles
of which have been agreed previously by
the Board or an appropriate committee.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee, which is
chaired by the Chief Executive, consists 
of the Executive Directors and certain
other senior executives as shown on 
page 29 of the Annual review and
summary financial statement 2007.
The Executive Committee meets every
four weeks and has everyday responsibility
for the running of the Group’s business. It
develops the Group’s strategy and annual
revenue and capital budgets for Board
approval. It reviews and recommends to
the Board any significant investment
proposals.
This Committee monitors the financial
and operational performance of the
Group and allocates resources within the
budgets agreed by the Board. It considers
employment issues, ensures the Group has
an appropriate pool of talent and
develops senior management manpower
planning and succession plans.
Board effectiveness evaluation
An internal evaluation of the Board’s
effectiveness was carried out shortly after
the year end, which included a review 
of the performance of the Chairman 
and of the individual Directors. The
evaluation considered the processes 
of the Board and its committees, and the
range and balance of skills demonstrated
by the Executive and Non-Executive
Directors. It also reviewed the Directors’
involvement in strategic, operational 
and financial matters, and their exposure
to senior managers. Output from the
Board effectiveness review is considered 
by the Nomination Committee to ensure 
that an appropriate balance of skills,
knowledge and experience is represented
on the Board and that the Board and its
committees continue to work effectively. 
Independent advice
Members of the Board may take
independent professional advice in the
furtherance of their duties and they have
access to the advice and services of the
Company Secretary.
Shareholder relations
The Board recognises that it is
accountable to shareholders for the
performance and activities of the
Company. The Company has a regular
programme of meetings with its major
institutional shareholders which provides
an opportunity to discuss, on the back 
of publicly available information, the
progress of the business. The Chairman,
the Chief Executive and the Finance
Director report to the Board the views of
major shareholders about the Company,
and the Senior Independent Director 
and other Non-Executive Directors are
available to shareholders on request.
Institutional investors and analysts are 
also invited to briefings by the Company
after the announcement of its interim and
preliminary results. The content of these
briefings is posted on the Company’s
website, together with general information
about the Company so as to be available
to all shareholders. Presentations are also
made to groups of individual shareholders.
The AGM provides a useful interface 
with private shareholders, many of 
whom are also customers. All proxy votes
received in respect of each resolution at
the AGM are counted and the balance 
for and against, and any votes withheld,
are indicated. The Chairmen of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination
Committees attend to answer questions.
Mitchells & Butlers
Annual report and accounts 2007 33
The Company’s Audit Committee has met
the requirements of the Combined Code
on Corporate Governance throughout 
the year. A copy of the Audit Committee’s
terms of reference is publicly available
within the Investor section of the
Company’s website.
Role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee’s principal
responsibilities are to:
• review the Company’s public statements
on internal control and corporate
governance compliance prior to their
consideration by the Board;
• review the Company’s processes 
for detecting fraud, misconduct and
control weaknesses and to consider 
the Company’s response to any such
occurrence;
• review management’s evaluation of 
any change in internal controls over
financial reporting;
• review with management and the
external auditors any financial
statements required under UK
legislation before submission to 
the Board;
• establish, review and maintain the 
role and effectiveness of the Group
Assurance function;
• assume direct responsibility for 
the appointment, compensation,
resignation, dismissal and the
overseeing of the external auditors,
including review of the external audit,
its cost and effectiveness;
• pre-approve non-audit work to be
carried out by the external auditors and
the fees to be paid for that work along
with the monitoring of the external
auditors’ independence;
• oversee the process for dealing with
complaints received by the Group
regarding accounting, internal
accounting controls or auditing matters
and the confidential, anonymous
submission by employees of concerns
regarding questionable accounting or
auditing matters; and
• adopt and oversee a specific Code 
of Ethics for the Executive Directors, 
the Executive Committee and all other
senior officers which is consistent with
the Company’s overall statement of
business ethics.
Audit Committee composition
The Audit Committee is chaired by
George Fairweather who, as a Chartered
Accountant and the finance director of a
former FTSE 100 company, has current
and relevant financial experience and is
considered to be the Committee’s financial
expert. The Committee’s other members
are Drummond Hall, Sir Tim Lankester
and Sara Weller. The Committee wishes 
to retain the knowledge, experience and
judgement of the Chairman of the Board,
but, reflecting recommendations within
the Smith Guidance, Roger Carr is not 
a member of the Committee, but attends
at the invitation of the Committee’s
Chairman. The Committee regularly
invites the external auditors, the Chief
Executive, the Finance Director and 
the Director of Group Assurance to its
meetings. Discussions are however held 
in private when appropriate. All of the
Committee’s members are independent
Non-Executive Directors.
Audit Committee frequency
The Committee meets at least four 
times a year. During 2006/07 four full
meetings of the Committee were held.
There was full attendance at all these
meetings other than one at which Sara
Weller and one at which Sir Tim Lankester
were unable to attend. On those occasions
all the papers and information relating 
to the meetings were provided and they
were able to discuss issues arising with the
Committee Chairman. 
Audit Committee process
The Committee discharges its
responsibilities, as defined in its terms 
of reference, through a series of Audit
Committee meetings throughout the year
at which detailed reports are presented 
for review. The Committee commissions
reports, either from external advisers, the
Director of Group Assurance, or Company
management, after consideration of the
Company’s major risks or in response to
developing issues. The Committee meets
privately with the external auditors and
the Director of Group Assurance at least
four times a year and liaises with
Company management in considering
areas for review.
During the year, the Committee’s
meetings considered the following
matters:
• Interim and full year financial results;
• The Company’s proposed approach 
to Interim Management Statements; 
• The scope and cost of the external audit;
• Non-audit work carried out by the
external auditors and trends in the 
non-audit fees in accordance with 
the Committee’s policy to ensure the
safeguard of audit independence;
• The scope of the annual internal audit
plan, the Internal Audit department’s
terms of reference, its resourcing and
external support;
• The external auditors’ interim and full
year reports;
• Periodic internal control and assurance
reports from the Internal Audit function;
• The effectiveness of the external
auditors and consideration of their
reappointment;
• Periodic reports on allegations made via
the Group’s whistleblowing procedures
and the effectiveness of these procedures;
• The effectiveness of the Internal Audit
function;
• The resignation and steps taken to
replace the Director of Group
Assurance;
• Management representations granted 
to the external auditors and the
Company’s procedures to ensure all
relevant audit information has been
disclosed;
• Major changes in the Group’s internal
controls;

• The co-ordination of the internal and
external audit functions;
• The Group’s framework for the
identification and control of major 
risks, its Risk and Assurance Register
and the annual assessment of control
effectiveness;
• Compliance with the code of ethics for
the Executive Directors, the Executive
Committee and all other senior officers;
• Corporate governance developments;
• Review of the steps taken by the Group
to achieve SEC deregistration;
• Review of the suitability of the Group’s
accounting policies and practices;
• The status of litigation involving 
the Group; and
• The Committee’s own terms of
reference, membership and its
effectiveness.
The Company’s public financial
statements are reviewed by the Audit
Committee in advance of their
consideration by the Board. Adequate
time is allowed between the Committee’s
review and the Board’s approval for any
actions or further work requested by the
Committee to be completed.
Evaluations of the Committee in the year
have been performed with the assistance
of the Director of Group Assurance. 
External auditors’ independence
The Audit Committee has adopted a
policy on the utilisation of the external
auditors for non-audit work that is in
compliance with the Combined Code. 
The external auditors may carry out
certain specified non-audit work, in 
areas that have been pre-approved by 
the Committee, up to a monetary limit 
of half the audit fee per transaction 
and subject to an annual total cap of no
more than the audit fee. Any other work
for which management wishes to utilise 
the external auditors must be approved 
by the Committee. In this regard the
Audit Committee specifically considered
and approved management’s request to 
utilise Ernst & Young for one transaction
during the year where management felt
Ernst & Young were best placed to provide
the service.

This report has been prepared by the
Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’)
and has been approved by the Board. It
complies with the Companies Act 1985
and also with the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance (the ‘Combined
Code’) and with the UKLA Listing Rules.
Throughout this report, references to 
the year are to the 52 week period ended
29 September 2007. This report will be
put to shareholders for approval at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
to be held on 31 January 2008.
The Remuneration Committee
Throughout the year, the Committee
consisted of the following Non-Executive
Directors:
• Sara Weller 
• Roger Carr
• George Fairweather
• Drummond Hall
• Sir Tim Lankester 
Sara Weller is Chairman of the
Committee. She has experience of human
resources matters and has the appropriate
skills to chair the Committee. She does
not chair any other committee of the
Board. As noted last year, Roger Carr 
was appointed to the Committee from 
1 October 2007.
There were six meetings of the Committee
held during the year. George Fairweather
was unable to attend two meetings,
otherwise there was full attendance. 
Where a Director was unable to attend 
a meeting, he was nevertheless provided
with all the papers and information
relating to that meeting and was able to
discuss issues arising with the Chairman 
of the Committee. Tim Clarke, the Chief
Executive, attended the meetings of the
Committee during the year at the invitation
of its Chairman. No Executive Director
attended on matters relating to his own
remuneration.
No member of the Committee has any
personal financial interest, other than as a
shareholder, in the matters to be decided
by the Committee. The remuneration of
the Non-Executive Directors is decided 
by the Board as a whole on advice from
the Executive Directors, supported by
independent remuneration advisers to 
the Company. 
The Committee received external advice
during the year from remuneration
consultants Deloitte & Touche LLP
(‘Deloitte’) and Watson Wyatt, as well 
as from Allen & Overy, the Company’s
general legal advisers. The Committee
took advice from Tim Clarke, the Chief
Executive, Bronagh Kennedy, Human
Resources Director and General Counsel,
and Sheila Mellish, Director of
Compensation & Benefits. None of these
participated in discussions concerning
their own remuneration. Following a
review of advisers, Deloitte was
independently appointed by the
Committee as its adviser from May 2007.
Deloitte advises the Company on general
tax matters and has previously advised on
Non-Executive Directors’ fees. It has not
provided remuneration services to the
Company since appointment as adviser to
the Committee.
The terms of reference of advisers to the
Committee are on the Company’s website,
as are the terms of reference of the
Committee itself.
The Committee is responsible for
determining policy on remuneration,
including pension rights and, should 
it be necessary, compensation payments,
for the Executive Directors, other
members of the Executive Committee 
and certain senior executives and for
reviewing the Chairman’s fees. The
Committee is committed to the principles
of accountability and transparency to
ensure that remuneration arrangements
demonstrate a clear link between reward
and performance. It determines the actual
remuneration of the Executive Directors
and reviews proposals in respect of other
members of the Executive Committee,
taking account of a range of factors,
including percentage increases awarded
across the Group as a whole. For the year
under review, the total emoluments
including benefits in kind earned by those
members of the Executive Committee who
were employed in the Group at the year
end, and who were not main Board
Directors, are shown in the table below:
No. of executives £000
1 301-350
3 351-400
2 401-450
1 501-550
The rest of this report deals with the
remuneration of the Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors only.
Remuneration policy for Executive
Directors
The following overall policy has applied
throughout the year and is intended 
to continue to apply for the financial 
year 2008:
• Remuneration packages are designed 
to attract, retain and motivate Executive
Directors of the highest calibre;
• The packages will be competitive within
the leisure retailing industry and in
those markets from which the
organisation recruits;
• In fixing remuneration, note will be
taken of reward levels in the wider
community and of the remuneration
structure throughout the organisation;
• There will be an appropriate balance
between fixed and variable risk reward.
The latter will be linked to the
performance of both the individual and
of the Group; and
• Basic salary will normally be set within 
a competitive range broadly at median
market level when compared with
appropriate comparator companies, but,
by exception, may extend into the upper
quartile to attract new employees and
reward key individuals for consistent
outstanding performance. 
Overall reward levels depend on the
achievement of challenging corporate 
and individual performance targets
designed to underpin the achievement 
of the Company’s strategic goals, 
ensuring continued close alignment
between executive reward and enhanced
shareholder value. To this extent the
Committee reviews, on an ongoing basis,
the operation of its incentive schemes,
including the exercise of discretion, grant
levels, performance criteria and vesting
schedules, to ensure that they remain
appropriate. 
The Company measures its performance
against its strategy through four key
performance indicators (‘KPI’s), being:
1. Same outlet like-for-like sales growth.
2. Earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth.
3. Cash return on cash capital employed
(‘CROCCE’) in excess of the weighted
average cost of capital, post tax
(‘WACC’).
4. Incremental return on expansionary
capital.
As outlined in the OFR, total shareholder
return (‘TSR’) is also an important
measure of performance and this measure
forms one of the performance conditions
for the Performance Restricted Share Plan.
These KPIs and their alignment to
remuneration policy are summarised
overleaf and are discussed in more detail
in the OFR on page 12.

The main components of Executive
Directors’ remuneration have to date 
been as shown in the diagram alongside.
Shares arising from share schemes 
should not normally be sold until the
minimum level of ownership, as described
on page 39, has been satisfied.
The Committee monitors the size 
of potential remuneration awards 
to Directors and uses independent
consultants to assist with modelling
potential outcomes.
Of the components of the remuneration
package, only basic salary is pensionable. 37 Mitchells & Butlers
Annual report and accounts 2007
Basic salary
Basic salary will normally be set within a
competitive range broadly at median
market level. As previously reported, from
2007 onwards, the Committee decided
that by exception, basic salary may extend
into the upper quartile to attract new
employees and reward key individuals for
consistent outstanding performance. Basic
salary is based on individual performance
and on information from independent
professional sources on the salary levels
for similar jobs in comparator companies.
Salary levels in the Group and in the
wider employment market are also taken
into account.
The proportion of the Group’s basic salary
bill attributable to the Executive Directors
and other members of the Executive
Committee was 0.8% (2006 0.8%).
The average basic salary of the Executive
Directors, on the basis that no short-term
bonus was paid during the year, was
£419,250 (2006 £710,250) and the
average per non-Board employee was
£13,686 (2006 £13,387); the ratio is
therefore 1:31 (2006 1:53). The Board and
the Remuneration Committee do not have
a policy on this ratio, but aim to reward all
employees fairly according to the nature
of their role, their performance and
market forces. 
In the year under review, the average 
base salary increase for members of the
Executive Committee, which includes 
the Executive Directors was 3.4%, whereas
the average increase for other employees,
including retail staff and management,
was 2.3%.
Annual performance bonus and Short
Term Deferred Incentive Plan 
The purpose of the annual bonus and
STDIP is to reward participants for
performance over the previous financial
year and provide an element of retention
through a matching share award going
forwards.
Participation is considered each year, at
the discretion of the Committee.
Challenging performance goals are set
which must be achieved before a bonus
becomes payable. For 2006/07, the
maximum bonus opportunity has been
100% of salary of which, for the year to 
29 September 2007, 75% was linked to
earnings per share and 25% to personal
and Group business objectives. At the
discretion of the Committee, the bonus is
payable either in cash or in shares under
the STDIP as set out below. 
During the year, certain hedging
instruments (‘hedges’) were taken out in
anticipation of implementing a property
backed refinancing. These hedges have
given rise to a non-cash deficit at the 
year end. As it is uncertain whether this
non-cash deficit will crystallise and, 
if so, the extent to which it will affect the
financial performance of the Company, 
the Executive Directors have voluntarily
offered to freeze final consideration of
whether a bonus should be paid in respect
of the year to 29 September 2007 pending
a review by the Remuneration Committee
at the forthcoming half year or later, if
appropriate. 
Under the STDIP , any award of Bonus
Shares is deferred for three years and, if
the Executive Director is in the Company’s
employment at the end of that period, the
Company will provide Matching Shares on
a 1:1 basis. Under the rules of the STDIP ,
the Remuneration Committee has
discretion to award Matching Shares, on 
a pro rata basis and subject to satisfaction
of the performance condition, to good
leavers, as defined by the plan rules.
Vesting of Matching Shares takes place
subject to the achievement of a three 
year performance condition. There is no
retesting of the performance condition
over the three year period. 
As it has not yet been determined whether
it is appropriate to make payment of the
Executive Directors’ bonuses in respect of
the financial year 2006/07 as explained
above, there may also be no award of
Bonus or Matching Shares.
Where Matching Shares have been
awarded, the performance condition has
been based on EPS growth. 
For the award in respect of the financial
year 2004/05, the performance condition
is based on growth in EPS such that
cumulative EPS over the three year
performance period must increase by at
least 27% points over the growth in RPI
before Matching Shares can vest in full.
The vesting of Matching Shares will be 
on a sliding scale according to the level 
of EPS growth. No Matching Shares will 
be released unless EPS growth over the
performance period exceeds RPI growth
by at least 12% points.
For the award in respect of the financial
year 2005/06, the performance measure 
is as described above except that the
performance condition is based on
average EPS growth in excess of RPI over
the performance period.
EPS growth has been chosen because it 
is a measure which reflects movement 
in shareholder value. The Company’s
auditors review and certify performance
against the target.
Where an award is made, participants are
entitled to receive Dividend Accrued
Shares on vesting equal to the value of the
gross ordinary dividends that would have
been paid on the vested shares during the
performance period.

Performance Restricted Share Plan 
The PRSP grants Executive Directors, 
at the discretion of the Committee, cash
or nominal priced options over shares
subject to the satisfaction of a performance
condition set by the Committee which 
is measured over a three year period.
Participants are entitled to receive Dividend
Accrued Shares on vesting equal to the
value of the gross ordinary dividends that
would have been paid on the vested shares
during the performance period.
Currently, three cycles are being operated
in respect of the periods 2004/07, 2005/08
and 2006/09, each with two performance
conditions, based on: 
• Total shareholder return; and 
• Cash return on cash capital employed
exceeding the weighted average cost 
of capital, post tax.

TSR was chosen as a measure because it
aligns the interest of management with
that of shareholders. The CROCCE versus
WACC measure was chosen to incentivise
the Executive Directors to increase the
cash returns generated by the business
and to reduce the overall cost of funding
to the Company, thereby maximising the
spread between the two and increasing
shareholder value. 
Performance measurement under the
PRSP is reviewed and certified by the
Company’s auditors.
TSR measure
For each cycle, 50% of the award is
measured by reference to TSR performance
against a comparator group of other
companies which, at the date of award,
consisted of:

removed following its delisting at the end of 2006
For the three year cycle ending September
2007, the Company had to finish in first
to fifth position for an award to vest,
graded between 100% of the TSR element
of the award for first position to 20% 
for fifth position. Below fifth position, 
the award relating to TSR lapses. The
Company finished in second position so
80% of this element of the award will vest. 
For the three year cycles ending
September 2008 and September 2009, 
the Company has to finish in first to fifth
position for an award to vest. Below fifth
position, the award relating to TSR lapses.
CROCCE/WACC measure
The vesting of the other 50% of the award
is based on the average amount by which
the Company’s CROCCE exceeds WACC
over the performance period. The award
for this element of the performance
measure is graded so that, for the three
year cycle ending September 2007, if the
amount by which the CROCCE exceeds
the WACC over the performance period is
at least 5.0% points, 100% of the CROCCE
element of the award will vest, whereas, 
if the excess is 3.5% points, 20% of the
award will vest. In between 3.5% points
and 5.0% points, the award will be graded
on a straight line basis. Below 3.5% points,
there will be no award in respect of this
element. The excess of CROCCE over
WACC for the cycle to September 2007
was 4.47% points, therefore 71.7% of this
element of the award will vest.
For the three year cycles ending
September 2008 and September 2009, 
the vesting of the other 50% is based on
the excess of CROCCE over WACC as
described above, except that, for the cycle
to September 2009, if the amount by

Executive Share Option Plan (‘EXSOP’)
Grants of EXSOP options were made
annually up to June 2005. No further
grant is intended to be made under this
plan. Grants were made at the discretion
of the Committee according to seniority,
the maximum value in any one year being
two times salary. A performance condition,
set by the Committee, has to be met
before the options may be exercised. For
options granted in 2005, the performance
measure is that cumulative adjusted EPS
over the three year performance period,
from 1 October 2004 to 30 September
2007, must increase by at least 27% points
over the growth in RPI before the options
can be exercised in full. As this performance
condition has been achieved, 100% of the
options will become exercisable three years
after the date of grant. The performance
measure under the EXSOP was reviewed
and certified by the Company’s auditors. 
The latest lapse date under this plan for
options previously granted is June 2015. 
Rolled-over legacy options
On demerger from Six Continents, 
the Group’s executives, including the
Executive Directors, with outstanding
options under the Six Continents
Executive Share Option Schemes were
permitted to roll over those options into
options of equivalent value over the
Company’s shares. The performance
conditions ceased to apply to those options
on demerger. The latest lapse date for
these legacy options is in October 2012.
Other share plans
Executive Directors may participate in the
all-employee share plans; the Sharesave
Plan and the Share Incentive Plan.
Performance targets do not apply to such
plans. No grant of options was made
under the Sharesave Plan to any Director
during the year. 39 Mitchells & Butlers
Annual report and accounts 2007
Companies used for comparison in
respect of overall pay and benefits 
In assessing overall levels of pay and
benefits, Mitchells & Butlers takes 
into account the packages offered by
comparator companies. To improve the
consistency and relevance of the data, 
the approach to benchmarking has, with
advice from Deloitte, been reviewed this
year. To ensure that the methodology
remains relevant to the structure of the
business and properly reflects the markets
from which the organisation recruits, the
overall levels of pay and benefits will be
assessed by reference to market practice 
in both the FTSE All Share index, as well
as relevant sector specific comparators.
The methodology and the comparator
companies are chosen by the Committee
following advice from independent
external consultants having regard to:
• industry sector to include direct
competitors and the wider retail sector;
• size – financial size and the number of
people employed; and
• the structure and complexity of the
business.
FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 comparators
From its listing on 15 April 2003 until 
21 December 2003, the Company was a
constituent of the FTSE 100 index. From
22 December 2003 until 20 April 2007,
the Company was included in the FTSE
250 index. Since then, it has been
included in the FTSE 100 index. The
graph below therefore measures the
Company’s TSR performance, assuming
dividends are reinvested, against both the
FTSE 100 and 250 indices.
TSR has been calculated in accordance
with the requirements of the Companies
Act 1985, except that the period covered 
is only since the Company’s listing in 
April 2003.
Directors’ shareholdings
To support the Company’s commitment 
to ensure that Directors’ interests are
aligned to those of shareholders, there is 
a mandatory shareholding of three times
salary for the Chief Executive and twice
salary for other Executive Directors. 
It is the policy of the Remuneration
Committee that, for any future Executive
Director appointment, the mandatory
shareholding requirement may be reduced
to one times salary subject to this
continuing to be reflective of market
practice at that time. Notwithstanding 
this policy, it has been decided that 
Adam Fowle will be required to attain a
shareholding of twice his annual salary
within five years of his appointment as 
an Executive Director, effective from 
1 October 2007. Apart from this, 
Adam Fowle’s remuneration package is
consistent with the remuneration policy
outlined on page 35 of this report. 
Each of the incumbent Executive Directors
had, at 29 September 2007, achieved the
mandatory shareholding to ensure that
their interests are aligned with those of
shareholders as set out below.

Director multiple of salary*

Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are paid 
a basic fee with additional fees for
membership of the Remuneration and
Audit Committees and for chairing those
committees. No additional fee is paid 
for membership of the Nomination
Committee. The fees are approved 
by the Board on the recommendation 
of the Executive Directors, based on a
review of the fees paid in other companies 
of a similar size. Fees are normally
reviewed every three years. A review of
these fees was last carried out in April
2006. Non-Executive Directors do not
participate in the Company’s bonus
arrangements, share schemes or pension
arrangements. The fee structure
applicable throughout the financial year 
is set out below:

Policy on Directors’ contracts
It is the Company’s normal policy to
provide Executive Directors with rolling 
12 month contracts, which provide for 
12 months notice from the Company 
and six months notice from the Director.
Service contracts provide for summary
termination in the event of gross
misconduct. In other circumstances, 
any severance payment would normally 
be based on a valuation of net pay and
benefits for any unexpired notice period
in the expectation that the Director has
made reasonable attempts to mitigate 
his loss. There are no compensation
provisions in relation to a change of
control of the Company. Benefits normally
include membership of a pension scheme,
a healthcare scheme and the use of a
company car. In 2006 the Remuneration
Committee decided to introduce, for 
new appointees to the Board, contracts
that provide for phased compensation
payments on loss of office. This reflects
developing best practice and has been
applied in respect of Adam Fowle’s
appointment on 1 October 2007.

*To retirement age at 60. Tony Hughes will leave
Mitchells & Butlers by reason of early retirement,
aged 59, on 31 December 2007
No payments, including compensation 
on early termination, should normally 
be payable on termination, other than 
the salary and benefits due for the notice
period and such entitlements under
incentive plans that are consistent with the
terms of such plans. Any entitlement under
incentive plans will vest or lapse, subject 
to the discretion of the Remuneration
Committee, in accordance with the terms
of such plans.
Non-Executive Directors do not have
service contracts, but operate under a
letter of appointment which provides for
their tenure of office to be reviewed when
they are about to stand for re-election,
which is every three years. In any event,
Non-Executive Directors may not
currently serve after the AGM following
their 67th birthday. There is no notice
period and no provision for termination
payments. 
The dates of appointment of the 
Non-Executive Directors are set out on
page 31. 
Pension arrangements
UK-based Executive Directors and senior
employees participate with other members
in the Mitchells & Butlers Executive
Pension Plan (the ‘Plan’) and, if
appropriate, the Mitchells & Butlers
Executive Top-Up Scheme (‘MABETUS’).
Executives in Germany who do not
participate in these plans are entitled to
participate in relevant local plans. The
Remuneration Committee has considered
the implications of the pensions
regulations contained within the Finance
Act 2004 effective from April 2006. The
MABETUS will remain in place and will
be used to provide benefits for members
of the defined benefit plan who were
above the earnings cap (the ‘Cap’) on 
5 April 2006 and for members whose
pension benefit is above the Lifetime
Allowance, which limits the amount of
benefits that receive preferential tax
treatment under a pension arrangement
which has ‘registered’ status with 
HM Revenue & Customs. MABETUS is 
an unfunded, unregistered arrangement,
however, appropriate security is provided
through a charge on property assets. 
This decision does not alter the cost to the
Company of providing pension benefits.
No extra payment has been or is planned
to be made to any individual as a result of
the new legislation.
The Plan is a funded occupational pension
scheme which has ‘registered’ status with
HM Revenue & Customs and therefore 
is subject to preferential tax treatment
compared to unregistered schemes such 
as MABETUS. The Plan has a final 
salary section under which the Executive
Directors can accrue benefits. Benefits up
to the Cap are provided by the Plan and
MABETUS is used to provide benefits 
in excess of the Cap. Mike Bramley has
entitlement to benefits in excess of his
Lifetime Allowance, which are also
provided by MABETUS. 
The Plan’s main features applicable to the
Executive Directors are:
• a normal pension age of 60;
• pension accrual of up to 1/30th of final
pensionable salary for each year of
pensionable service;
• life assurance cover of four times
pensionable salary;
• pensions payable in the event of ill
health; and
• on death, pensions based on one-third
full pension entitlement for a spouse
and one-sixth for each of a maximum 
of two eligible children.
On the death of a Director before his
normal pension age, a spouse’s pension
equal to one-third of the Director’s
pension is payable; a child’s pension 
of one-sixth of the Director’s pension 
is payable for each of a maximum of 
two eligible children.
Early retirement 
A member who decides to leave the
service of the Company currently has the
right to draw his accrued pension at any
time after his 50th birthday, subject to a
discount for early payment.
Pension increases
All pensions in excess of Guaranteed
Minimum Pensions are subject to annual
increases in line with the annual rise in
the RPI, subject to a maximum of 5% per
annum. In addition, it is the Company’s
present aim to pay additional increases
based on two-thirds of any rise in the 
RPI above 5% per annum.
Other discretionary benefits
Other than the discretionary pension
increases mentioned above, there are no
discretionary practices which are taken
into account in calculating transfer values
on leaving service.
External listed company appointments
The Company recognises that its
Executive Directors may be invited to
become non-executive directors of other
listed companies and that such duties 
can broaden experience and knowledge,
which will benefit the Company. Executive
Directors are therefore allowed to accept
one such non-executive appointment with
the Company’s prior approval and as long
as this is not likely to lead to conflicts of
interest. Fees received may be retained by
the Director. Tim Clarke is a non-executive
director of Associated British Foods plc,
and received £45,875 (2006 £44,000)
during the year for that appointment.

Group business objectives related to:
• improvement in like-for-like sales;
• staff productivity;
• guest satisfaction;
• effective purchasing;
• return on investment; 
• asset management; and
• return on the Acquired Sites.
Personal business objectives related to the financial performance of the business area for which the Director was directly responsible.

Performance Restricted Share Plan 
Participation in the PRSP is by means of an option which is exercisable for nominal consideration, once the performance condition
has been satisfied. 
In 2007, there were three cycles of the plan in operation, each with a three year performance period, as outlined below:
• October 2004 to September 2007 
The combined maximum award from the two measures is equivalent to 90% of basic salary at the date of the award;
• October 2005 to September 2008 
The combined maximum award is, as approved by shareholders at the 2006 AGM, equivalent to 177% of basic salary at the date 
of the award. This change was applied in conjunction with the discontinuance of the EXSOP; and
• October 2006 to September 2009
The combined maximum award is also equivalent to 177% of basic salary at the date of the award.
Details of the two performance measures are set out on page 38. 43 Mitchells & Butlers

Independent auditors’ 
report to the members 
of Mitchells & Butlers plc
We have audited the Group financial
statements of Mitchells & Butlers plc 
for the year ended 29 September 2007
which comprise the Group income
statement, the Group statement of
recognised income and expense, the
Group balance sheet, the Group cash flow
statement and the related notes 1 to 33.
These Group financial statements have
been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the 
parent company financial statements of
Mitchells & Butlers plc for the year ended
29 September 2007 and on the information
in the Directors’ remuneration report that
is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the
Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might
state to the Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as
a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors
and auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for
preparing the Annual Report and the
Group financial statements in accordance
with applicable United Kingdom law and
International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘IFRS’s) as adopted by the
European Union are set out in the
Statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group
financial statements in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to
whether the Group financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether 
the Group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also
report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the Directors’ report
is consistent with the financial statements.
The information given in the Directors’
report includes that specific information
presented in the Operating and financial
review that is cross referred from the
Business review section of the Directors’
report.
In addition we report to you if, in our
opinion, we have not received all the
information and explanations we require
for our audit, or if information specified
by law regarding Directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate
governance statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the nine
provisions of the 2003 Combined Code
specified for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority,
and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all
risks and controls, or form an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures.
We read other information contained 
in the Annual report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited
Group financial statements. The other
information comprises only the Operating
and financial review, the Directors’ report,
the Corporate governance statement, 
the Audit Committee report, and 
the unaudited part of the Directors’
remuneration report. We consider the
implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in
the Group financial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgments made by the
directors in the preparation of the Group
financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit 
so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient
evidence to give reasonable assurance 
that the Group financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or
error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the Group
financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– the Group financial statements give 
a true and fair view, in accordance with
IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union, of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 29 September 2007 and 
of its loss for the year then ended;
– the Group financial statements have
been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
– the information given in the Directors’
report is consistent with the Group
financial statements.

Mitchells & Butlers
Annual report and accounts 2007 51
1. General information 
Mitchells & Butlers plc (the ‘Group’) is
required to prepare its consolidated
financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards
as adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’)
and in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985.
The Group has adopted a policy of
revaluing its freehold and long leasehold
land and buildings as at 29 September
2007 and these are now stated at fair
value. Short leasehold properties, fixtures
and fittings are held at deemed cost and
non-current assets held for sale as at 
29 September 2007 are held at the lower
of deemed cost or expected net realisable
value upon their disposal.
The change in accounting policy reflects
the adoption by the Group of emerging
best practice among UK listed companies.
In addition, the Group has been pursuing
a property based refinancing during the
year, seeking to realise for shareholders the
potential value of the Group’s property
portfolio. The revaluation of freehold and
long leasehold land and buildings within
the Group’s balance sheet provides
shareholders with a more representative
value than the historic cost basis.
Certain items of property, plant and
equipment as at 30 September 2006 are
held at deemed cost under the transitional
rules of IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements are
presented in pounds sterling (rounded to
the nearest million), being the functional
currency of the primary economic
environment in which the parent and most
subsidiaries operate.
With the exception of the change in
accounting policy noted above, the
Group’s accounting policies have been
applied consistently, although certain
exemptions to the retrospective
application of IFRS have been made by
the Group in accordance with IFRS 1
‘First-time Adoption of International
Financial Reporting Standards’.
The Group’s accounting reference date 
is 30 September. The Group draws up 
its financial statements to the Saturday
directly before or following the accounting
reference date, as permitted by section
223 (3) of the Companies Act 1985.
The preparation of the consolidated
financial statements requires management
to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions in the application of accounting
policies that affect reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The areas involving a higher degree of
judgement or complexity, or areas where
assumptions and estimates are significant
to the financial statements, include
depreciation and amortisation, asset
impairments and pensions. Actual results
may differ from estimates.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements
incorporate the financial statements 
of Mitchells & Butlers plc (the ‘Company’)
and entities controlled by the Company
(its subsidiaries). The financial statements
of the subsidiaries are prepared for the
same financial reporting period as the
Company. Where necessary adjustments
are made to the financial statements 
of subsidiaries to bring their accounting
policies into line with those used by the
Group. Inter-company transactions, balances
and unrealised gains and losses on
transactions between Group companies 
are eliminated on consolidation.
Intangible assets
i Goodwill
Goodwill arising in respect of acquisitions,
being the excess of the purchase
consideration over the fair value attributed
to the separately identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired,
is stated at cost less any impairment 
in value. Goodwill is not amortised, but 
is reviewed for impairment annually 
or more frequently if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may be impaired. Any impairment 
is recognised immediately in the income
statement and is not subsequently
reversed. On disposal of a subsidiary, 
the attributable amount of goodwill 
is included in the determination of the
profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior 
to 30 September 1998 was eliminated
against reserves. In accordance with IFRS3
‘Business Combinations’, such goodwill
remains eliminated against reserves 
and is not included in determining any
subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill denominated in foreign currencies
is translated into sterling at each balance
sheet date and any movements are accounted
for as set out under ‘foreign currencies’.
ii Computer software
Computer software and associated
development costs, which are not an integral
part of a related item of hardware, are
capitalised as an intangible asset and
amortised on a straight line basis over
their useful life. The period of amortisation
ranges between three and ten years with
the majority being five years.
Property, plant and equipment
Within property plant and equipment,
freehold and long leasehold land and
buildings have been revalued as at 
29 September 2007 to fair value. Short
leasehold properties, fixtures and fittings
are held at historic cost and non-current
assets held for sale as at 29 September
2007 have not been revalued. Surpluses
which arise from the revaluation 
exercise are recorded directly within 
the revaluation reserve unless they are
reversing a revaluation decrease which has
been recognised in the income statement
previously, in which case an amount equal
to a maximum of that recognised in the
income statement previously is recognised
in income. Where the revaluation exercise
gives rise to a deficit, this is reflected
directly in the revaluation reserve to the
extent that a surplus exists against the
same asset. Any residual amount is then
recognised against income.
Property, plant and equipment as at 
30 September 2006 is stated at historic
cost or deemed cost less accumulated
depreciation and any impairment in 
value. Properties and land that had been
revalued prior to 26 September 2004, 
the date of transition to IFRS, are stated
as at 30 September 2006 on the basis 
of deemed cost, being the revalued
amount at the date of that revaluation.
The use of the ‘deemed cost’ exemption
on transition to IFRS means that there
were no revaluation surpluses in respect 
of property, plant and equipment at 
that date. Consequently, the revaluation
surplus reflected in the revaluation reserve
represents the increase in valuation above
the previous carrying amount, and any
downward valuations are recognised in the
income statement.

Notes to the financial statements

1. General information continued
Depreciation is charged to the income
statement on a straight line basis over the
estimated useful lives of items of property,
plant and equipment. Freehold land is not
depreciated. Freehold and long leasehold
properties are depreciated over 50 years
from the date of acquisition to their
estimated residual value. Leasehold
properties are depreciated over the
unexpired term of the lease where this is
less than 50 years. The cost less residual
value based on prices prevailing at the
balance sheet date of plant, machinery,
fixtures, fittings and equipment is spread
by equal instalments over the estimated
life of the relevant assets, namely:
Equipment in retail outlets 3–20 years
Information technology 
equipment 3–7 years
Vehicles 4–5 years
Plant and machinery 4–20 years
Assets held under finance leases are
depreciated over their expected lives on
the same basis as owned assets or, where
shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Expected useful lives and residual values
are reviewed each year and adjusted 
if appropriate.
Profits and losses on disposal of property,
plant and equipment are calculated as the
difference between the net sales proceeds
and the carrying amount of the asset at
the date of disposal. 
The carrying values of property, plant and
equipment are reviewed on an outlet basis
for impairment if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. An
impairment loss is recognised whenever
the carrying amount of an outlet exceeds
its recoverable amount. The recoverable
amount is the higher of an outlet’s fair
value less costs to sell and value in use.
Where an impairment loss subsequently
reverses, the carrying amount of the asset
is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but so that the
increased carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would
have been determined had no impairment
loss been recognised for the asset in 
prior years. A reversal of an impairment
loss is recognised as income immediately.
Non-current assets held for sale and
disposal groups
When the value of an asset or group of
assets will be recovered through a sale
transaction rather than continuing use, the
assets are reclassified as non-current assets
held for sale, or as a disposal group, where
the assets are to be sold as a group in a
single transaction. This condition is met
when the sale is highly probable and the
asset is available for immediate sale in 
its present condition. Management must 
be committed to the sale and completion
should be expected within one year from
the date of classification. Non-current assets
held for sale and disposal groups are valued
at the lower of book value and fair value less
costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.
Leases
i Operating leases
Leases in which substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership are retained 
by the lessor are classified as operating
leases. Payments made under operating
leases and sub-leases are charged to 
the income statement on a straight line
basis over the period of the lease. Lease
incentives are recognised as a reduction 
in the rental expense over the lease term.
Premiums paid on acquiring a new lease
are spread on a straight line basis over the
lease term. Such premiums are classified
in the balance sheet as current or non-
current prepayments, with the current
portion being the element which relates 
to the following financial period.
ii Finance leases
Leases in which the Group assumes
substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership are classified as finance leases.
Property, plant and equipment acquired
by way of finance lease are capitalised 
at the inception of the lease at an amount
equal to the lower of their fair value and
the present value of the minimum lease
payments. The corresponding liability 
to the lessor is included in the balance
sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease
payments are apportioned between 
the finance lease obligation and finance
charges in the income statement so as 
to achieve a constant rate of interest on
the remaining balance of the obligation.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
and net realisable value. Work in progress
is in respect of property development
activities and includes the direct costs 
of the developments and associated
professional fees.
Financial instruments
i Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised
and carried at original cost less an
allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
ii Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash
at bank and in hand and other short-term
highly liquid deposits with an original
maturity at acquisition of three months or
less. Cash held on deposit with an original
maturity at acquisition of more than 
three months is disclosed as current asset
investments. For the purposes of the cash
flow statement, cash and cash equivalents
consists of cash and cash equivalents as
defined above, net of bank overdrafts that
are repayable on demand and that are
integral to the Group’s cash management.
iii Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised
at original cost.
iv Borrowings
Borrowings, which include the Group’s
secured loan notes, are stated initially 
at fair value (normally, the amount of the
proceeds), net of issue costs. Thereafter
they are stated at amortised cost using 
an effective interest basis. Finance costs,
which are the difference between the net
proceeds and the total amount of payments
to be made in respect of the instruments,
are allocated over the term of the debt
using the effective interest method.
v Derivative financial instruments and 
hedge accounting
The Group uses interest rate, inflation 
and currency swap contracts to hedge its
exposure to changes in interest rates, the
retail price index and exchange rates. It
also uses gilt hedges to hedge its exposure
to movements in the fair value of its fixed
rate debt. These contracts are designated
as cash flow hedges and hedge accounting
is applied where appropriate. Derivative
financial instruments are not used for
trading or speculative purposes.
Mitchells & Butlers
Annual report and accounts 2007 53
1. General information continued
Interest rate, inflation, currency swap 
and gilt hedges are initially measured at
fair value on the contract date, and are
remeasured to fair value at subsequent
reporting dates. Fair value is calculated as
the present value of the estimated future
cash flows.
Changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments that are designated and
effective as hedges of highly probable
future cash flows are recognised directly 
in equity. The cumulative gain or loss is
transferred from equity and recognised 
in the income statement at the same time
as the hedged transaction affects profit 
or loss. The ineffective part of any gain 
or loss is recognised in the income
statement immediately.
Movements in the fair value of derivative
instruments which do not qualify for hedge
accounting are recognised in the income
statement immediately.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when 
the hedging instrument expires or is sold,
terminated, or no longer qualifies for hedge
accounting. At that point, the cumulative
gain or loss in equity remains in equity and
is recognised in accordance with the above
policy when the transaction affects profit or
loss. If the hedged transaction is no longer
expected to occur, the cumulative gain 
or loss recognised in equity is recognised
in the income statement immediately.
vi Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company
are translated at the fair value of the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are
recorded at the exchange rates ruling on
the dates of the transactions. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into the functional
currency at the relevant rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign
exchange differences arising on translation
are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are
measured at cost using the exchange rate 
on the date of the initial transaction.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities
of the Group’s overseas operations are
translated into sterling at the relevant rates
of exchange ruling at the balance sheet
date. The results of overseas operations
are translated into sterling at weighted
average rates of exchange for the period.
Exchange differences arising from 
the translation of the results and the
retranslation of opening net assets
denominated in foreign currencies are
taken directly to the Group’s translation
reserve. When an overseas operation 
is sold, such exchange differences are
recognised in the income statement 
as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Revenue
Revenue is the value of goods and services
sold to third parties as part of the Group’s
trading activities, after deducting sales-
based taxes, coupons and staff discounts.
The majority of revenue comprises food
and beverages sold in the Group’s outlets.
This revenue is recognised at the point 
of sale to the customer. Revenue arising
from the sale of development property 
is recognised on legal completion of 
the sale. 
Tax
The income tax expense represents 
both the income tax payable, based on
profits for the year, and deferred tax and
is calculated using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. Income tax is recognised in 
the income statement except when it
relates to items charged or credited directly
to equity, in which case the income tax is
also charged or credited to equity.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary
differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amount of their
tax bases. No deferred tax is recognised 
if the temporary difference arises from
goodwill or the initial recognition of an
asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination and, at the 
time of the transaction, affects neither the
accounting profit nor taxable profit or 
loss. Deferred tax is not recognised in
respect of temporary differences associated
with investments in subsidiaries, where the
timing of the reversal of the temporary
difference can be controlled and it is
probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided 
is based on the expected manner of
realisation or settlement of the carrying
amount of assets and liabilities. Deferred
tax assets are recognised only to the extent
that it is probable that future taxable profits
will be available against which the asset can
be utilised.
Employee benefits
i Pension obligations
The Group has both defined benefit and
defined contribution pension arrangements.
The liability recognised in the balance
sheet in respect of the Group’s defined
benefit arrangements is the present value
of the defined benefit obligation less the
fair value of the scheme assets. The cost 
of providing benefits is determined 
using the projected unit credit method 
as determined annually by qualified
actuaries. The current service cost, together
with the cost of any benefits relating to
past service, is charged to operating profit.
The interest cost and the expected return
on assets are shown as a net amount
within finance income or finance expense.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised
in full in the period in which they occur,
in the statement of recognised income and
expense, rather than the income statement.
For the defined contribution arrangements,
the charge against profit is equal to 
the amount of contributions payable.

1. General information continued
ii Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of equity-
settled share-based compensation plans,
whereby, subject to meeting any relevant
conditions, employees are awarded shares
or rights over shares. The cost of such
awards is measured at fair value, excluding
the effect of non market-based vesting
conditions, on the date of grant. The
expense is generally recognised over the
vesting period and is adjusted for the
estimated effect of non market-based
vesting conditions and forfeitures, on the
number of shares that will eventually vest
due to employees leaving the employment
of the Group. Fair values are calculated
using a combination of Black-Scholes,
Binomial and Monte Carlo simulation
models depending on the conditions
attached to the particular share scheme.
The Group has taken advantage of 
the transitional provisions of IFRS 2
‘Share-based Payment’ and applied its
requirements to only those awards 
granted after 7 November 2002 that had
not vested before 1 January 2005.
Own shares
The cost of own shares held in employee
share trusts and in treasury are deducted
from shareholders’ equity until the 
shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed
of. Where such shares are subsequently 
sold or reissued, the fair value of any
consideration received is also included 
in shareholders’ equity.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the 
Group has a present legal or constructive
obligation as a result of past events, it is
more likely than not that an outflow of
resources will be required to settle the
obligation and the amount can be reliably
estimated. Provisions are measured 
using the Directors’ best estimate of the
expenditure required to settle the obligation
at the balance sheet date, and are
discounted to present value where the
effect is material.
Dividends
Dividends proposed by the Board but
unpaid at the year end are not recognised
in the financial statements until they have
been approved by shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting. Interim dividends
are recognised when paid.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those which are
separately identified by virtue of their 
size or incidence so as to allow a better
understanding of the underlying trading
performance of the Group. Exceptional
items and the related tax on these are
excluded from the calculation of earnings
per share before exceptional items.
Recent accounting developments
During the year, the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) 
and International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 
issued the following standards and
interpretations with an effective date after
the date of these financial statements.
They have not been adopted early by the
Group. The Directors do not anticipate
that the adoption of the new standards 
or revisions to existing standards will 
have a material impact on the Group’s
financial statements in the period of initial
adoption and expect that there will be no
material impact on reported income or
net assets. The impact of IFRIC 14 will
depend on the balance sheet position of
the pension plans in the year of adoption
and in particular whether a pension plan
surplus or deficit is recorded under
IAS 19.
IFRS7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’
and ‘Amendment to IAS 1 – Capital
disclosures’ will require disclosure of
additional information relating to the
Group’s financial instruments. IFRS 7 
is first effective for periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2007.
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ replaces
IAS 14 and requires segment information
to be presented on the same basis as used
for internal reporting purposes. IFRS 8 
is first effective for periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2009. 
Revised IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’ which is
first effective for periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2009, requires costs which
are directly attributable to assets that take 
a substantial period of time before they
are ready for use or sale, to be capitalised.
IFRIC14, ‘IAS19 – The Limit on a 
defined benefit asset, minimum funding
requirements and their interaction’ is first
effective for periods beginning on or after
1 January 2008 and provides guidance on
the amount of pension surplus to be
recognised as an asset.
Exchange rates
The results of overseas operations 
have been translated into sterling at the
weighted average euro rate of exchange
for the financial period of £1 = s1.48
(2006 £1 = s1.46), where this is a
reasonable approximation to the rate at
the dates of the transactions. Euro and 
US denominated assets and liabilities 
have been translated at the relevant rate
of exchange at the balance sheet date 
of £1 = s1.43 (2006 £1 = s1.47) and 
£1 = $2.04 (2006 £1 = $1.87) respectively.

2. Change of accounting policy and
prior year adjustment
As at 29 September 2007 the Group has
adopted a policy of revaluing its freehold
and long leasehold property portfolio to
market value, in accordance with the fair
value provisions of IAS 16 ‘Property, plant
and equipment’. This is a change from the
previous policy, under which property,
plant and equipment was stated at historic
cost, except for certain items of property,
plant and equipment held at deemed 
cost under the transitional rules of IFRS.
As stated in note 1 above, the change in
accounting policy reflects the adoption 
by the Group of emerging best practice
among UK listed companies. In addition,
the Group has been pursuing a property
based refinancing during the year, seeking
to realise for shareholders the potential
value of the Group’s property portfolio.
The revaluation of property, plant and
equipment within the Group’s balance
sheet provides shareholders with a more
representative value than the historic 
cost basis.
The impact on the financial statements 
of this change in accounting policy has
been to:
• increase the net book value of land and
buildings as at 29 September 2007 by
£1,124m;
• recognise an exceptional charge against
operating profit in respect of
‘Impairment arising from revaluation 
of the property portfolio’ of £45m. 
This impairment reflects the difference
for all assets where the fair value of the
asset as determined by the revaluation 
as at 29 September 2007 is below the 
net book value prior to the revaluation;
• the impact of the above is a net increase
in the value of property, plant and
equipment of £1,079m (see note 15).
This has been booked as an increase 
on cost or valuation of £1,042m and a
write back of accumulated depreciation
of £37m;
• increase the amount of the deferred
taxation provision by £296m after taking
account of the change in the rate of
corporation tax in 2008;
• recognise an exceptional deferred tax
credit of £13m in respect of ‘Impairment
arising from revaluation of the property
portfolio’; and
• recognise a credit of £828m against the
revaluation reserve, representing the
revaluation adjustment of £1,124m, plus
the related deferred taxation liability 
of £296m.
As a result of the work performed to
enable a policy of revaluation to be
adopted, the Group has obtained more
detailed information in respect of the
valuation and tax base cost for individual
assets. This information has enabled 
the Group to adjust its brought forward
deferred taxation provision as at 
1 October 2005 to a more appropriate
amount. The Group has increased 
its deferred taxation provision as at 
1 October 2005 by £99m, with a
corresponding entry recognised in
retained earnings at the same date. It has
increased the tax credit relating to the
indexation of gains in respect of previous
revaluations in its statement of recognised
income and expense in 2006 by £23m. 
As a result of this prior year adjustment,
the deferred taxation provision reported
in 2006 has increased by £76m and the
amount of retained earnings reported 
in 2006 has reduced by £76m.

Annual report and accounts 2007 59
7. Share-based payments
The expense recognised for share-based
payments in the year is £8m (2006 £8m)
which comprises share option schemes
and share awards.
The Group had six share option schemes,
all of which are equity-settled, in operation
during the year.
The vesting of all awards or options is
generally conditional upon participants
remaining in the employment of a
participating company during the 
vesting period.
Sharesave Plan
The Sharesave Plan is a HM Revenue
& Customs approved savings scheme,
whereby the proceeds from a savings
contract, of either three or five years
duration, may be used to purchase shares
under option. Options are granted at the
commencement of the savings contract, 
at a discount of up to 20% of the market
value of the shares at the date of invitation.
There are no performance conditions. 
The scheme is open to all UK employees
provided that they have at least one year’s
service at the date of invitation. The vesting
period is 39 months or 63 months and
options may be exercised up to six months
after the vesting date.
Share Incentive Plan
The Share Incentive Plan is open to all UK
employees with at least 18 months service
at the date of award. The plan awards free
shares to participating employees based
on salary, up to a maximum award of
£3,000 per employee per year. There are
no performance conditions. There is a
vesting period of two years (as defined in
IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payment’) from the
award date. Shares are generally held in
Trust for at least three years and are
capable of being released to participants
at any time thereafter.
Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan
Under the Short Term Deferred Incentive
Plan the annual bonuses of the Executive
Directors may be deferred into Mitchells &
Butlers shares with one matching share
awarded for every bonus share. From the
grant in December 2006 participants are
also entitled to receive Dividend Accrued
Shares on vesting equal to the value of the
ordinary dividends that would have been
paid on the vested shares during the
performance period.
Mitchells & Butlers
Annual report and accounts 2007
Up to and including the grant in December
2004 (relating to the 2003/04 bonus year)
there was no additional performance
condition over the deferral period. For 
the grant in December 2005 (relating 
to the 2004/05 bonus year) an additional
earnings per share related performance
condition applies in respect of the vesting
of matching shares. Matching shares 
will only be released in full if the Group’s
adjusted earnings per share over the 
three year performance period ending 
27 September 2008, exceeds by at least
27%, the increase in the UK Retail Price
Index for the same period. For the grant
in December 2006 (relating to the 2005/06
bonus year) the earnings per share related
performance condition still applies in
respect of matching shares, however it 
is now determined with reference to the
average adjusted earnings per share over
the three year performance period exceeding
the UK Retail Price Index growth.
All grants of options up to and including
the grant in December 2004 vest in three
equal tranches one year, two years and three
years after the date of award. For the
awards in December 2005 and December
2006 vesting occurs three years after 
the award date. Shares are transferred 
to participants on vesting.
All deferrals of bonuses into shares to date
have been entirely at the discretion of the
Remuneration Committee.
Performance Restricted Share Plan
The Performance Restricted Share Plan
allows Executive Directors and other eligible
employees to receive nominal cost options,
subject to the satisfaction of a performance
condition, set by the Remuneration
Committee, which is normally measured
over a three year period. Vesting is
conditional upon the achievement of total
shareholder return (‘TSR’) and cash return
on cash capital employed (‘CROCCE’)
performance conditions. The vesting period
for these options is generally three years
followed by a two year exercise period. 
For the options with the TSR performance
condition, Monte Carlo simulations were
performed to incorporate the market
condition in the measurement of the fair
value. For all grants from 2005/06 onwards,
participants will be entitled to receive
Dividend Accrued Shares on vesting equal
to the value of the ordinary dividends that
would have been paid on the vested shares
during the performance period.
Executive Share Option Plan
The grant of options under the Executive
Share Option Plan was discontinued
following shareholder approval of changes
to Executive Director remuneration in 2006. 
The last grant of options under this plan
was made in June 2005. The option prices
were set at an amount not less than the
average market value of a share over 
the three business days immediately prior
to the date of grant. Vesting is conditional
upon the achievement of an adjusted
earnings per share related performance
condition. Adjusted earnings per share 
is basic earnings per share before
exceptional items.
The vesting period for these options 
is three years from grant, followed by 
a seven year exercise period.
Rolled-over options
Under the terms of the separation in
2003, holders of options under the 
Six Continents Executive Share Option
Schemes were given the opportunity 
to exchange their Six Continents PLC
options for equivalent value new options
over Mitchells & Butlers plc shares. 
The exchanged options are not subject 
to performance conditions and were
immediately exercisable. The latest possible
exercise date for any of the Rolled-over
options outstanding at 29 September 2007,
is 28 May 2012.
Further details of the above schemes are
included in the Remuneration report on
pages 37 to 38.
The following tables set out awards and
options granted during 2007. No options
were granted under the Executive Share
Option Plan or Rolled-over options
during the period.

The exercise price relating to the Performance Restricted Share Plan is £1 per participating employee per exercise.
(ii)
The expected dividend yield input for the grant of Performance Restricted Share Plan options in 2006 and 2007 is zero as
participants are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares to the value of the ordinary dividends paid during the vesting period.
(iii)
The expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price commensurate with the
expected term of the options and share awards. Where insufficient share price data is available, competitor share price volatility
data over a longer period equal to the expected life of the option or share award is considered.
(iv)
The expected term of the options is taken to be the midpoint between vesting and lapse, except for the Performance Restricted
Share Plan where the terms of the plan resulted in it being advantageous for participants to exercise directly after vesting. 
In this case the expected life has been assumed to equate to the vesting period.
(v)
The fair value of the Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan awarded in FY 2007 is equal to the share price on the date of award as
there is no price to be paid and employees are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares.
The fair value of the Share Incentive Plan shares is equal to the share price on the date of grant as there is no option price to be 
paid and employees are entitled to dividends during the vesting period. Hence the assumptions set out above are not relevant to

8. Pensions
Retirement and death benefits are provided for eligible employees in the United Kingdom principally by the Mitchells&Butlers Pension
Plan (MABPP) and the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan (MABEPP). These plans are funded, HM Revenue & Customs
approved, occupational pension schemes with defined contribution and defined benefit sections. The defined benefit sections of the
plans closed to new entrants during 2002 with new members provided with defined contribution arrangements. The defined benefit
liability relates to these funded plans, together with an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement (the Executive Top-Up Scheme,
or MABETUS) in respect of certain MABEPP members. The assets of the plans are held in self-administered trust funds separate
from the Company’s assets.
The valuations used for IAS 19 purposes are based on the preliminary results of the latest full actuarial valuation carried out at
31 March 2007 and expected to be finalised in December 2007 updated by the Schemes’ qualified actuaries to 29 September 2007.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 29 September 2007 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same
date using the projected unit method. As the defined benefit sections of the pension plans are now closed to new members, the
current service cost as calculated under the projected unit method will increase as members approach retirement.
In the 52 weeks ended 29 September 2007, the Group paid regular contributions of £10m (2006 £11m) and additional contributions
of £40m (2006 £20m) in respect of the defined benefit arrangements. In addition the Group paid £1m (2006 £1m) in respect of the
defined contribution arrangements.
The preliminary results of the 2007 actuarial valuation showed a funding deficit using a more prudent basis to discount the scheme
liabilities than is required by IAS 19 and a formal recovery plan to 2017 is being finalised with the Trustees. The result of this is that
the Group will make additional contributions of £24m in the 52 weeks ending 27 September 2008, of which £20m represents the final
instalment of the previously agreed schedule of contributions. This will be followed by further additional contributions of £24m in
each of the financial years 2009 and 2010, as part of the recovery plan to close the deficit by 2017. The level of additional contributions
will be subject to review during the next actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2010. Employer contribution rates to the defined benefit
arrangements for the 52 weeks ending 27 September 2008 are expected to be 24.2% for the MABPP and 42.0% for the MABEPP .
Based on these expected contribution rates, it is estimated that total contributions in the 52 weeks ending 27 September 2008 will 
be £38m, comprising regular contributions of £14m, including £1m payable in respect of the defined contribution arrangements 
and additional contributions of £24m.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
The principal financial assumptions used by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were:
2007 2006 2005 2004 2003
Wages and salaries increases 4.9%
*
4.4% 4.3% 4.3% 4.2%

Inflation rate 3.4% 2.9% 2.8% 2.8% 2.7%
*For MABPP members (5.9% for MABEPP members). Includes allowance for promotional salary increases.

Mortality assumptions
The mortality assumptions are based on the PA92 ‘year of birth’ standard tables with allowance for medium cohort projections, with
ages rated up by two years for non-retired members of the MABPP , by three years for current pensioners and rated down by two years
for members of the MABEPP . The mortality assumptions adopted have been updated to allow for improvements in life expectancies,
taking into account an analysis of the recent experience of the Plans. A summary of the average life expectancies assumed is as follows:
2007 2006
Main Plan Exec Plan Main Plan Exec Plan
years years years years
Male member aged 65 (current life expectancy) 19.4 23.6 17.8 17.7
Male member aged 45 (life expectancy at 65) 21.2 24.8 19.4 19.5
Female member aged 65 (current life expectancy) 22.2 26.5 20.7 20.7
Female member aged 45 (life expectancy at 65) 24.0 27.7 22.4 22.4
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the Group considered the current level of expected returns
on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes
in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class
was weighted based on the asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio,
resulting in a weighted average assumption of 6.1% at 29 September 2007. The actual investment return achieved on the scheme
assets over the year was 9.1% (2006 10.8%).
The combined assets of the MABPP and MABEPP , their expected rates of return and the value of the pension scheme assets and
liabilities at the balance sheet date can be summarised as follows:

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 26 September 2004 in the Group statement of recognised
income and expense is a £53m gain (2006 £20m gain). The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme
deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception 
of the Schemes. Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been
recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense before 26 September 2004.

The payment of the special interim dividend amounting to £486m was made on 25 October 2006. The shareholders approved, at an

The Board recommended on 28 November 2007 the proposed final dividend for the 52 weeks ended 29 September 2007. This did
not qualify for recognition in the financial statements at 29 September 2007 as it had not been approved by the shareholders at

13. Earnings per ordinary share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) has been calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the financial period by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares held in treasury and by employee share trusts.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive
potential ordinary shares.
Earnings per ordinary share amounts are presented before exceptional items (see note 9) in order to allow a better understanding 
of the underlying trading performance of the Group.

*The 2007 diluted EPS per ordinary share is unchanged from the basic EPS, as the inclusion of the dilutive potential ordinary shares would reduce the loss per share and 
is therefore not dilutive.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculations above are as follows:

On 17 October 2006, shareholders approved a share capital consolidation together with a Special Dividend of 100.0p per ordinary 
share. The overall effect of the transaction was that of a share repurchase at fair value, therefore no adjustment has been made to
comparative data.
At 29 September 2007, nil (2006 nil) contingently issuable shares and 1,034,538 (2006 965,822) other share options were outstanding
that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future but were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as they are antidilutive for
the periods presented.

Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently 
if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill relates entirely to the German business, which is also the non-UK reportable segment. This represents the lowest level
within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
As part of the impairment review the recoverable amount for this business is based on value in use. That calculation uses cash flow
projections based on current year data. Cash flows beyond the current year have been extrapolated using a steady 1.5% growth 
rate – which does not exceed the long-term estimated inflation rate for the German market.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculation are those regarding revenue and discount rates.
The post-tax discount rate used to calculate value in use is 7% (2006 6%). This discount rate is derived from the Group’s post-tax
weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the effects of taxation and for specific risks relating to the German business.
Revenue growth is assumed to be in line with inflation of 1.5% and profit margins are based on current levels.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to changes in assumptions in respect of revenues. However, management believes
that the current assumptions used are reasonable.
Impairment reviews were performed on 1 October 2005, 30 September 2006 and 29 September 2007 by comparing the carrying value
of the business to which goodwill relates with the recoverable amount. Management determined that there has been no impairment. 71 Mitchells & Butlers

Properties
The majority of the Group’s freehold and long leasehold land and buildings, with the exception of land and buildings identified 
for disposal and leasehold properties with an unexpired term of 50 years or less, were valued as at 29 September 2007 by 
Colliers CRE, independent chartered surveyors and by Andrew Cox MRICS, Director of Property, Chartered Surveyor.
The land and buildings were valued at market value, in accordance with the provisions of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors
(RICS) Appraisal and Valuation Standards (‘The Red Book’) assuming each asset is sold as part of the continuing enterprise in
occupation individually as a fully operational trading entity. The market value has been determined having regard to factors such 
as current and future projected income levels, taking account of the location, the quality of the pub or restaurant and recent market
transactions in the sector.
Land and buildings identified for disposal, leasehold outlets with an unexpired term of 50 years or less and fixtures, fittings and
equipment, are included at cost, less depreciation.
The 2006 deemed cost carrying value of the Group’s property, plant and equipment reflects a valuation undertaken in 1999 which
covered all properties then owned by the Group other than leasehold properties having an unexpired term of 50 years or less and
which amounted to £328m at 30 September 2006. This valuation was undertaken by external chartered surveyors, Chesterton plc, 
in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The basis of valuation was
predominantly existing use value and had regard to trading potential. In 1996, a group restructuring by Six Continents resulted in
the transfer at book value of certain property, plant and equipment to a subsidiary that subsequently became part of the Mitchells 
& Butlers group. The book value included the effect of revaluations undertaken prior to 1996. Accordingly, the 2006 carrying value
of the Group’s property, plant and equipment reflects those revaluations in its deemed cost under IFRS, which at 30 September 2006
amounted to £374m.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets with a net book value of £4,321m (2006 £3,273m), which are pledged as
security for the securitisation debt and over which there are certain restrictions on title.

Non-current assets held for sale and the disposal group comprise certain operating properties which have been approved for sale,
such that the carrying amount is expected to be recovered through a sale, rather than through continuing use. Sales are expected
within 12 months from the date of classification. The disposal group held for sale in 2006 represents assets which were sold to 
Trust Inns Ltd for £101m on 5 October 2006 in a single transaction. This represents the only material disposal included within
‘Profits on disposal of properties’ in note 9 ‘Exceptional items’.
The adjustment on classification as non-current assets held for sale forms part of the loss (2006 profit) arising on property-related
items in the income statement. The carrying values included within the disposal group and assets held for sale categories above are

Securitised debt
On 13 November 2003, a group company, Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc, issued £1,900m of secured loan notes in connection 
with the securitisation of the majority of the Group’s UK pubs and restaurants business owned by Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited.
The funds raised were mainly used to repay existing bank borrowings of £1,243m, pay issue costs of £23m and return £501m to
shareholders by way of a Special Dividend.
On 15 September 2006 Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc completed the issue of £655m of further secured loan notes in the form 
of the A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes as detailed below. These were issued under substantially the same terms as the original
securitisation in November 2003. The funds raised were mainly used to return £486m to shareholders by way of a Special Dividend
and to provide long-term funding for the Whitbread pub restaurant sites acquired. As part of the issue, the original A1 and A3 
loan note tranches were repaid and reissued as A1N and A3N loan notes to take advantage of market rates.

**The expected remaining weighted average life (‘WAL’) is based on the amortisation profile of the individual note tranches and assumes refinancing of the notes on
the margin step-up dates. The margin step-up dates as at 29 September 2007 are set out below.
The notes are secured on the majority of the Group’s property and future income streams therefrom. All of the floating rate notes 
are fully hedged using interest rate swaps which fix the interest rate payable.
Interest and margin is payable on the floating rate notes as follows:
Tranche Interest Margin Margin step-up date Post step-up margin
A1N 3 month LIBOR 0.18% December 2010 0.45%
A3N 3 month US$ LIBOR 0.18% December 2010 0.45%

C2 3 month LIBOR 0.75% December 2013 1.88%
D1 3 month LIBOR 0.85% December 2013 2.13%
The overall cash interest rate payable on the loan notes is 5.7% after taking account of interest rate hedging and the cost of the
provision of a financial guarantee provided by Ambac in respect of the Class A notes.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Mitchells & Butlers
Retail Limited, the Group’s main operating subsidiary. These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of
securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash, by way of dividends for example, to other group companies. 
At 29 September 2007, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited had cash and cash equivalents of £89m (2006 £73m) which were governed
by the covenants associated with the securitisation. Of this amount £9m (2006 £8m), representing disposal proceeds, was held 
on deposit in a secured account (‘restricted cash’). The use of this cash requires the approval of the securitisation trustee and may
only be used for certain specified purposes such as capital enhancement expenditure and business acquisitions. 75 Mitchells & Butlers

21. Financial instruments
An explanation of the Group’s financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies is set out in the discussion 
of Treasury policies on page 21 in the Operating and financial review. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or
speculative purposes.
The primary treasury objectives of the Group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying
business needs. If appropriate, the Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
Financial risk management
The main risks which impact the Group result from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Derivative financial
instruments, principally interest rate and foreign currency swaps, are used to manage these risks and are described below.
Interest rate risk
The Group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt instruments and manages the variability in cash flows resulting
from changes in interest rates by using derivatives. The Group minimises the volatility in its financial statements through the
adoption of hedge accounting provisions where appropriate.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s foreign exchange exposure primarily results from the issue of US$418.75m of Class A3N floating rate notes which 
form part of the securitised debt (see note 20). At issuance of the notes the Group entered into a cross currency interest rate swap 
to manage the foreign currency exposure resulting from both the US$ principal and the interest elements of the notes.
After taking into account these hedging arrangements, the Group does not have a material profit and loss account exposure to
movements in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities. In addition, the Group is predominantly UK based and
therefore does not have a significant currency exposure from its operations.
Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets
is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date.

Cash flow hedges
At 29 September 2007, the Group held 10 (2006 10) interest rate swap contracts with a nominal value of £1,105m (2006 £1,105m),
designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of £1,105m (2006 £1,105m) of the Group’s floating rate borrowings,
comprising the A1N, A3N, A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes.
The cash flows occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a fixed rate of 4.8938% (2006 4.8938%).
The contract maturity dates match those of the hedged item. The 10 interest rate swaps above are held on the balance sheet at fair
value, which is an asset of £36m (2006 £33m liability).
At 29 September 2007 the Group held 1 (2006 1) cross currency interest rate swap contract, with a nominal value of £250m (2006
£250m), designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate and currency risk of £250m (2006 £250m) of the Group’s A3N floating
rate US$418.75m borrowings. The cross currency interest rate swap is held on the balance sheet at a fair value liability of £48m 
(2006 £29m liability).
The cash flows occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on US$ LIBOR and paying a fixed rate, in sterling, of
5.4445% (2006 5.4445%).
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised directly in the hedging reserve in equity to the extent that the hedges are
effective. The cash flow hedges detailed above have been assessed as being highly effective during the financial period and are
expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
During the period a gain of £55m (2006 £22m loss) on cash flow hedges was recognised directly in equity. A loss of £15m (2006
£16m) was removed from equity and included in the Group income statement for the period.
Derivative financial instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting 
Following the comprehensive review of the Group’s options for releasing value from its property portfolio the Group announced on 
21 May 2007 its intention to form a property joint venture with R20. In the final stage of the planned transaction, the Group and R20
separately entered into a number of derivative transactions which were intended to be contributed to the joint venture. Their purpose was
to fix the variable cash flows resulting from the inflation linked rental payments receivable by the proposed property joint venture and the
LIBOR linked interest payments on the new debt, as well as to insulate the Group from movements in the fair value of its fixed rate debt.

Whilst these instruments provide an economic hedge against the future anticipated cash flows associated with a property based
refinancing they do not qualify for hedge accounting as defined in IAS39. Movements in their fair values are therefore recognised
directly in the Group income statement, within exceptional finance costs. The total fair value movement of these instruments during
the year reported within exceptional finance costs was £(221)m and is analysed further below.

£1,105m. Under the first swap, the Group receives fixed rate interest at 5.4390% and pays floating rate interest at LIBOR and
under the second swap the Group pays fixed rate interest at 5.4390% and receives floating rate interest at LIBOR. Their purpose 
is to enable the movements in the fair value of the Group’s existing securitisation hedges to be recorded for the benefit of the
proposed property based financing entity, from the period that a transaction is executed. The start date of the swaps will be
dependent upon the date of execution of the property based refinancing. The maturity date is 15 September 2036.
b The 5.5705% forward starting interest rate swap was executed in July 2007 and has a notional principal of £1,300m. The Group
pays fixed rate interest at 5.5705% and receives floating rate interest at LIBOR. Four reverse gilt locks with a combined notional
principal of £1,385m were executed in July 2007 to mitigate against movements in the fair value of the Group’s existing fixed
rate bonds. The purpose of the swap is to replicate the impact of the Group’s existing fixed rate debt so that movements in the
fair value from the transaction date would be for the benefit of the proposed property based financing entity. The reverse gilt
locks mitigate against movements in the fair value of the Group’s fixed rate debt, offsetting the movement in fair value of the
5.5705% interest rate swap. The start date of the swap will be dependent upon the date of execution of the property based
refinancing. The maturity date is 15 September 2030. The reverse gilt locks all have a maturity date of 5 December 2007.
c The 5.2152% forward starting interest rate swap was entered into in July 2007 and has an accrediting and amortising notional
principal of £990m. The Group pays fixed rate interest at 5.2152% and receives floating rate interest at LIBOR. The purpose 
of the swap is to hedge against LIBOR movements associated with the incremental debt intended to be raised by the proposed
property based financing entity. The start date of the swap will be dependent upon the date of execution of the property based
refinancing. The maturity date is 15 September 2037.
d In July 2007, the Group entered into two forward starting inflation swaps with a notional quarterly principal of £30m each. 
The Group receives an annual fixed increase of 3.1775% and pays a variable cash flow based on annual increases in the Retail
Price Index within a collar of 0% and 5%. The two inflation swaps are intended to fix the expected rental income stream
receivable by the proposed property based financing entity, which would increase annually by the Retail Price Index subject to a
collar of 0% and 5%. The start date of the swaps will be dependent upon the date of execution of the property based refinancing.
The maturity date is 15 June 2037.
All cash flows under the above swaps are payable or receivable on a quarterly basis.

This reflects the fact that the terms of these hedge contracts at 29 September 2007 contained an early termination provision effective

*Includes £45m (2006 £26m) relating to currency movements on the retranslation of the US$418.75m A3N loan note, included within net debt (see note 28).
The various tranches of the securitised debt have been valued using period end quoted offer prices. The fair value of interest rate
and currency swaps is the estimated amount which the Group could expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements.
These amounts are based on quotations from counterparties and take into consideration interest and exchange rates prevailing at 
the balance sheet date. Other financial assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or book values approximate to fair values.

Unrecognised tax losses
At the balance sheet date the Group has unused losses of £13m (2006 £13m) available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on tax losses with a value of £5m (2006 £5m) because it is not certain that future
taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefit. These tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
Tax consequences arising from the payment of dividends
There are no tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Group to its shareholders.

All of the ordinary shares rank equally with respect to voting rights and rights to receive ordinary and special dividends. There are
no restrictions on the rights to transfer shares.
On 17 October 2006, shareholders approved a share capital consolidation on the basis of 34 new ordinary shares for every 41 existing
ordinary shares. This provided for all of the authorised ordinary shares of 7

Details of options granted under the Group’s share schemes are contained in note 7.
25. Employee share trusts
The Company has established two employee share trusts:
Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) Trust
The SIP Trust was established in 2003 to purchase shares on behalf of employees participating in the Company’s Share Incentive
Plan. Under this scheme, eligible employees are awarded free shares which are normally held in trust for a holding period of at least
three years. After five years the shares may be transferred to or sold by the employee free of income tax and National Insurance
contributions. The SIP Trust buys the shares in the market with funds provided by the Company. During the holding period,
dividends are paid directly to the participating employees. At 29 September 2007, the trustees, Hill Samuel ESOP Trustee Limited,
were holding 740,210 (2006 910,578) shares in the Company. Of these shares, 419,918 (2006 715,583) have been conditionally gifted
to employees and 306,304 (2006 163,716) have been unconditionally gifted to employees, with the remaining 13,988 (2006 31,279)
shares being unallocated.
Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’)
The EBT was established in 2003 in order to satisfy the exercise or vesting of existing and future share options and awards under 
the Executive Share Option Plan, Performance Restricted Share Plan, Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan, Sharesave Plan and the
Rolled-over options. The EBT purchases shares in the market from time to time, using funds provided by the Company, based on
expectations of future requirements. Dividends are waived by the EBT. At 29 September 2007, the trustees, Mourant ECS Trustees
(Jersey) Limited, were holding 330,239 (2006 1,299,046) shares in the Company.
2006 share numbers are shown prior to the share consolidation.

The Group’s main operating subsidiary, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited, had retained earnings under UK GAAP of £309m at 
29 September 2007 (2006 £234m). Its ability to distribute these reserves by way of dividends is restricted by the securitisation
covenants (see note 20).
Share premium account
The share premium account represents amounts received in excess of the nominal value of shares on issue of new shares.
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve movement arose on the repurchase and cancellation by the Company of nil (2006 13,527,234)
ordinary shares during the financial period at a cost of £nil (2006 £58m), including expenses. The nominal value of the share 
capital cancelled of £nil (2006 £1m) was transferred to the capital redemption reserve.
Revaluation reserve
The revaluation reserve represents the unrealised gain generated on revaluation of the property portfolio with effect from 
29 September 2007. It comprises the excess of the fair value of the portfolio over deemed cost, net of related deferred taxation.
Own shares held
Own shares held by the Group represent the shares in the Company held in treasury (‘treasury shares’) and by the employee 
share trusts.
During the financial period, the Company acquired 1,033,000 (2006 nil) shares for treasury at a cost of £7.4m (2006 £nil), released
220,606 (2006 1,589,880) shares to employees on the exercise of share options for a total consideration of £0.4m (2006 £3.8m), 
and consolidated 88,443 (2006 nil) shares on 18 October 2006. The 1,241,969 shares held in treasury at 29 September 2007 had a
market value of £7.6m (30 September 2006 518,018 shares held had a market value of £3.1m). The aggregate nominal value of the
treasury shares held at 29 September 2007 was £106,000 (2006 £37,000).
During the financial period, the employee share trusts acquired 4,967,276 (2006 4,351,933) shares at a cost of £35.0m (2006 £21.6m),
released 5,916,545 (2006 4,282,188) shares to employees on the exercise of share options and other share awards for a total
consideration of £10.5m (2006 £8.8m) and consolidated 189,906 (2006 nil) shares on 18 October 2006. The 1,070,449 shares held
by the trusts at 29 September 2007 had a market value of £6.5m (30 September 2006 2,209,624 shares held had a market value of
£13.0m). Further details regarding the employee share trusts are given in note 25.
2006 share numbers are shown prior to the share consolidation.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments
related to hedged future cash flows.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign
subsidiaries. 
Goodwill
Goodwill eliminated against reserves at 29 September 2007 was £50m (2006 £50m). This arose in respect of acquisitions completed
prior to 30 September 1998.

Leases
The vast majority of the Group’s leases are industry standard UK pub or commercial property leases which provide for periodic rent

Results for 2005 are presented on a 52 week basis to aid comparability with previous years. The 53 week 2005 results under both

are unaudited.
The Mitchells & Butlers group was created on its separation from Six Continents on 15 April 2003. Significant changes were made 
to the financing structure of the Group which resulted in the replacement of inter-company balances owed to Six Continents with
external debt. In addition, the Mitchells & Butlers group no longer benefited from the Six Continents group tax arrangements that
were in place prior to the separation. The pro forma group income statement for 2003 therefore present the results on the basis 
that the post separation financing and taxation structure had been in place since 1 October 2002. The pro forma income statement
is also stated before exceptional items.
Adjusted earnings per share is stated after removing the impact of exceptional items, less tax thereon.
The adjustments required to make UK GAAP historic information consistent with that presented under IFRS relate to share-based
payment charges and the different calculation basis of deferred tax under IFRS.

Independent auditors’ 
report to the members of
Mitchells & Butlers plc
We have audited the parent company
financial statements of Mitchells & Butlers
plc for the year ended 29 September 2007
which comprise a balance sheet and the
related notes 1 to 14. These parent
company financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies 
set out therein. We have also audited 
the information in the Directors’
remuneration report that is described 
as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the 
Group financial statements of Mitchells 
& Butlers plc for the year ended 
29 September 2007.
This report is made solely to the
Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might
state to the Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as
a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of 
Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for
preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ remuneration report and 
the parent company financial statements
in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and Accounting Standards
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice) are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent
company financial statements and the part
of the Directors’ remuneration report to
be audited in accordance with relevant
legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to
whether the parent company financial
statements give a true and fair view and
whether the parent company financial
statements and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the parent company
Directors’ report is consistent with the
financial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our
opinion, the Company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have 
not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, 
or if information specified by law
regarding Directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained 
in the Annual Report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited
parent company financial statements. 
The other information comprises only 
the Operating and financial review, the
Directors’ report, the Corporate governance
statement, the Audit Committee report
and the unaudited part of the Directors’
remuneration report. We consider the
implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the parent
company financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any 
other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures 
in the parent company financial
statements and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report to be audited. 
It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgments 
made by the Directors in the preparation
of the parent company financial
statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit 
so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the parent company
financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ remuneration report 
to be audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation 
of information in the parent company
financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ remuneration report to 
be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the parent company financial statements
give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice,
of the state of the Company’s affairs as
at 29 September 2007; 
• the parent company financial statements
and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’
report is consistent with the parent
company financial statements.

Operating 
and financial

Overview 1. Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been
prepared under the historic cost
convention. They comply with applicable
accounting standards in the United
Kingdom.
Fixed asset investments
The Company’s investments in group
undertakings are held at cost less provision
for impairment.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognised, subject to certain exceptions,
in respect of all material timing differences
between the recognition of gains and
losses in the financial statements and for
tax purposes. Those timing differences
recognised include accelerated capital
allowances and short-term timing
differences. Timing differences not
recognised include those relating to the
revaluation of fixed assets in the absence
of a commitment to sell the assets, 
the gain on sale of assets rolled into
replacement assets and the distribution 
of profits from overseas companies 
in the absence of any commitment by 
the company to make the distribution. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is regarded as more likely
than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated on a non-
discounted basis at the tax rates that are
expected to apply in the periods in which
timing differences reverse, based on tax
rates and laws enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date.
Employee benefits
i Pension obligations
The Company has both defined benefit and
defined contribution pension arrangements.
The liability recognised in the balance
sheet in respect of the Company’s defined
benefit arrangements is the present value
of the defined benefit obligation less the
fair value of the scheme assets, shown net
of deferred tax. The cost of providing
benefits is determined using the projected
unit credit method as determined
annually by qualified actuaries. The
current service cost of providing pension
benefits to employees, together with the
cost of any benefits relating to past service,
is charged to operating profit and
included in staff costs. The interest cost
and the expected return on assets are
shown as a net amount of finance cost 
or income adjacent to interest. Actuarial
gains and losses are recognised
immediately in the statement of total
recognised gains and losses.
For the Company’s defined contribution
arrangements, the charge against profit 
is equal to the amount of contributions
payable.
ii Share-based compensation
The Company operates a number of
equity-settled share-based compensation
plans, whereby, subject to meeting 
any relevant conditions, employees are
awarded shares or rights over shares. The
cost of such awards is measured at fair
value, excluding the effect of non market-
based vesting conditions, on the date of
grant. The expense is generally recognised
over the vesting period and is adjusted 
for the estimated effect, on the number 
of shares that will eventually vest, of non
market-based vesting conditions and
forfeitures due to employees leaving the
employment of the Company. Fair values
are calculated using a combination of
Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo
simulation models depending on the
conditions attached to the particular 
share scheme.
Own shares
The cost of own shares held in treasury
(‘treasury shares’) or by the Company’s
employee share trusts for the purpose 
of fulfilling obligations in respect of 
the Group’s employee share plans are
deducted from shareholders’ funds in the
Company and Group balance sheet.
Dividends
Dividends proposed by the Board but
unpaid at the period end are not recognised
in the financial statements until they have
been approved by shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting. Interim dividends
are recognised when paid.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are
recorded at the exchange rates ruling on
the dates of the transactions, adjusted for
the effects of any hedging arrangements.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies are translated into
sterling at the relevant rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date.
This applies to the euro loan from
Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH,
which is a monetary item, converted at the
period end rate with exchange differences
arising passing through the profit and loss
account and the euro investment in
Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH,
which is a non-monetary item and
therefore should be held at cost.
However, the Company applies fair 
value hedge accounting, in accordance
with FRS 26, in order to hedge the 
long-term element of the euro loan from
Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH
against part of the investment in Mitchells
& Butlers Germany GmbH. Foreign
exchange differences arising on
translation of both of these items using
the period end rate are taken to the 
profit and loss account. The remainder 
of the investment in Mitchells & Butlers
Germany GmbH is held at cost as
described above.
92 Mitchells & Butlers
Annual report and accounts 2007
Notes to the parent company 
financial statements 93 Mitchells & Butlers
Annual report and accounts 2007
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses interest rate swaps 
and gilt hedges to hedge against the
Mitchells & Butlers group’s exposure to
changes in interest rates and movements
in the value of the Group’s fixed rate debt.
The hedged items are held by a subsidiary
undertaking. Derivative financial
instruments are not used for trading or
speculative purposes.
Interest rate swap contracts are initially
measured at fair value on the contract
date, and are remeasured to fair value 
at subsequent reporting dates. Fair value 
is calculated as the present value of the
estimated future cash flows. Changes in
the fair value of these instruments are
recognised in the profit and loss account
in the period in which the changes arise.
Profit and loss account
The Company has taken advantage of
Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985
and not presented its own profit and loss
account. The Company recorded a profit
after tax of £50m (2006 £667m), less
dividends of £538m (2006 £56m).
Auditors’ remuneration for audit 
services to the Company was £21,000
(2006 £20,000). This is borne by another
group company as are any other costs
relating to non-audit services (see note 5
to the Group financial statements).
The consolidated financial statements 
of Mitchells & Butlers plc are required to
comply with the Companies (Disclosure of
Auditor Remuneration) Regulations 2005.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements
requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results can
differ from those estimates. Estimates 
are used when accounting for items 
such as amortisation, asset impairments
and pensions.
Exchange rates
The results of overseas operations have
been translated into sterling at weighted
average rates of exchange for the year of
£1 = s1.48 (2006 £1 = s1.46) and euro
denominated assets and liabilities have
been translated into sterling at the rate 
of exchange at the balance sheet date of 
£1 = s1.43 (2006 £1 = s1.47).
2. Recent accounting developments
During the year the Accounting Standards
Board (‘ASB’) issued the following
standards, all of which have an effective
date after the date of these financial
statements and have not been adopted
early by the Company:
FRS 29 (IFRS 7) ‘Financial Instruments:
Disclosures’ will require disclosure of
additional information relating to the
Company’s financial instruments with
effect from 1 January 2007. The Company
will be exempt from the requirements of
this standard as the information will be
included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Group.
FRS 25 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure
and Presentation’ has been revised with
effect from 1 January 2007 to remove
disclosures which are now incorporated
within the scope of FRS 29 (IFRS 7)
‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.
During the year the ASB issued an
amendment to FRS 17 ‘Retirement
Benefits’ with effect from 6 April 2007.
The Company has applied the
amendment early in these financial
statements, incorporating the additional
disclosure requirements and valuing the
assets of the defined benefit schemes using
current bid price instead of mid-market
value.
3. Pensions
The Company accounts for pensions
under FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’.
The Company is the sponsoring 
employer of the Group’s pension plans.
Information concerning the pension
scheme arrangements operated by the
Company and associated current and
future contributions is contained within
note 8 page 63 to the consolidated
financial statements.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance
with the advice of the Scheme’s qualified
actuaries. The Company’s total pension
cost included within operating profit for
the 52 weeks ended 29 September 2007
under FRS 17 was £14m (2006 £15m),
comprising £13m (2006 £14m) in 
respect of the defined benefit pension
arrangements and £1m (2006 £1m) 
in respect of the defined contribution
arrangements.
The valuations used for FRS17 purposes
are based on the preliminary results of 
the latest full actuarial valuation carried 
out at 31 March 2007 and expected to 
be finalised in December 2007, updated 
by the independent qualified actuaries 
to 29 September 2007. Scheme assets are
stated at market value at 29 September
2007 and the liabilities of the schemes
have been assessed as at the same date
using the projected unit method. As the
defined benefit sections of the pension
plans are now closed to new members, 
the current service cost as calculated
under the projected unit method will
increase as members approach retirement.
The principal financial assumptions 
used by the actuaries at the balance sheet
date and the basis of these are contained
within note 8 on page 63 to the consolidated
financial statements.

10. Derivative financial instruments
In advance of the intended property based refinancing, a number of derivative instruments were executed by or transferred to the
Company, to mitigate against movements in the value of the Group’s existing fixed rate debt. These are explained further in note21
on page 76 to the consolidated financial statements.
These instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting within the Company as they cannot be designated as a hedge against the 
cash flows of any specific financial instrument anticipated as part of a future property based refinancing. They include the two
5.4390% interest rate swaps, the 5.5705% interest rate swap and the reverse gilt locks described in note 21 on page 77 to the
consolidated financial statements.
Movements in their fair values are recognised directly in the Company’s profit and loss account. The total impact of the above
derivative financial instruments during the year was a charge of £9m.

Overview Electronic communication
Shareholders can register to receive 
an e-mail notification of the availability 
of the Company’s latest shareholder
communications at the following web 
link www.mbplc.com/ecomms. The website
also enables shareholders to view details 
of their own shareholding or electronically
appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf 
on any poll that may be held at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Following recent changes in legislation 
the Company will be seeking authority 
to amend its Articles of Association at the
2008 AGM to enable it to make electronic
communication with shareholders the
default position. The Company intends 
to enclose communication election cards
with the interim dividend payment
mailing in 2008. Shareholders will have
the right to request to receive paper
communications, however this presents 
an opportunity for the Company to
benefit from reducing costs whilst
reducing its impact on the environment.
Interim results
The Company does not intend to publish
future interim results in hard copy. The
interim results will be available online 
at www.mbplc.com/reports
Amalgamating your share accounts
If you received more than one copy of this

your name. To ensure that you do not
receive duplicate mailings in future, you
can have all your shares amalgamated into
one account by contacting the Registrar at
the address below.
Dividend mandates
Shareholders who wish dividends to be
paid directly into a bank/building society

of payment removes the risk of delay or
loss of dividend cheques in the post and
ensures that your account is credited 
on the due date.

in the popularity of eating-out, with

Chairman’s statement
Mitchells & Butlers
Annual review and summary 
financial statement 2007
Mitchells & Butlers’ results this year reflect
a strong financial performance and we are
pleased with the operational development
across the business. The executive team
have been particularly effective in growing
sales and profits despite some significant
economic and cost challenges, whilst also
rapidly implementing the conversion of
the high quality Whitbread sites acquired
in July 2006. We have extended our
leadership of the eating-out market
serving 107 million meals and generated
significant drinks market share gains. 
As a result, revenues have risen by 10%,
operating profits by 11% and earnings per
share before exceptional items by 21%.
This performance has enabled the Board
to recommend a final dividend payment
of 10.0p per share, taking the total
ordinary dividend for the year to 14.25p,
an increase of 16.3%. This payment is
additional to the Special Dividend of £486m
paid to shareholders in October 2006 
and reflects the strong growth in earnings
per share, as well as our commitment 
to a progressive policy for dividends.
Since our foundation in 2003 the 
Board has had an absolute commitment 
to the creation and delivery of value 
to shareholders whether through organic
growth, investment in the business for
high returns, the pursuit of value creative
acquisitions, or a return to shareholders 
by way of dividends and share buybacks. 
With this guiding principle in mind, 
and recognising that a consistently higher
valuation is placed by property investors
on our estate than is valued within the

current integrated model, the Board has
been investigating options for capturing
the value of the property estate for
shareholders on a sustainable basis. 
To that end, after a competitive process,
substantial progress was made in the
summer on negotiating a joint venture
transaction with R20 (the investment
vehicle of Robert Tchenguiz). In the 
final stage of this transaction, we entered
into hedging agreements which were a
fundamental bank requirement to secure
the necessary financing arrangements 
for the joint venture and to achieve
appropriate ratings from ratings
agencies. However, the sudden and
unprecedented collapse of world debt
markets rendered the joint venture
undeliverable but left the hedging
arrangements in place. Driven by a most
unusual mix of inflation and interest 
rate expectations, combined with limited
liquidity, the cost of the hedges at the
year end, although not a cash item, had
risen to £155m after tax. The hedging
arrangements have been retained as the
Board remains committed to a property
based refinancing which would utilise
them, once debt markets have recovered.
The Board will continue to balance the
assessment of risk with potential reward 
of this policy.
Whilst the Board’s focus has been on the
establishment of a property joint venture,
alternative property based refinancing
structures remain under consideration. 
In this context, the Board has received 
a proposal from R20 in respect of a
demerged Real Estate Investment Trust
(‘REIT’) structure, which includes R20
procuring a fixed price underwriting for
in the region of 25% of the REIT equity.
The attractiveness and feasibility of this
proposal is being explored. A REIT
structure would have to meet the Board’s
requirement for an appropriate balance 
to optimise the value of both demerged
companies as independent entities.
The Board will continue to review
alternative structures that would
demonstrably create value from the
property, whilst providing an attractive
long-term business model for the
operating company.
In view of the focus on Mitchells & Butlers’
real estate, we considered it was important
to establish a current value of our freehold
and long leasehold properties and we
requested Colliers CRE to update our
valuation as at 29 September 2007. The
revised value of the estate in our books 
at £5bn represents a net increase 
of £1.1bn compared to the historical
accounting basis and provides a solid and
up to date foundation for judging the asset
strength of the Group in turbulent times.
Because pubs are specific use assets, it 
is the operational success of the business
which has been the primary factor in
growing the value of our freehold property
and which has also enabled us to return
over £1.1bn in cash to shareholders 
since demerger in 2003, over and above
ordinary dividends. This performance 
has been driven by our operational teams,
who I believe are collectively the best in
the industry. I would like to thank them 
all for their perseverance, flexibility and
hard work during the year.
There has been one change to the 
Board announced during the second half
of the year. Tony Hughes, 59, stepped
down as Managing Director, Restaurants
on 1 October 2007 since when he has
been assisting in the handover of his role
and the further development of food
capabilities in the business. He will retire
from the Board of the Company on 
31 December 2007. He is succeeded 
by Adam Fowle, previously Managing
Director for the Acquired Sites and
Business Development. Adam has some 
20 years experience in licensed retailing,
having joined Mitchells & Butlers in 1985.
He was previously Managing Director 
of the Pubs & Bars division, becoming 
a Retail Director at Sainsbury’s for two
years. He rejoined Mitchells & Butlers 
in 2005.
I welcome Adam to the Board and 
would like to thank Tony for his
exceptional contribution to the Company
over the last 12 years. His vision and 
drive have been instrumental in the
development of our highly successful 
pub restaurant brands. I wish him every
happiness in his retirement.
Looking forward, 2008 will undoubtedly
be a more challenging year, with the
uncertain outlook for consumer confidence
and the first year of the smoking ban.
However, I am confident that a clear
management strategy for competitive 
out-performance based on high quality
brands, excellent sites and strong
operating skills will underpin the
continuing progress of the Company.

Continued market out-performance
Our good results this year reflect our
leadership position in the growing
casual eating-out market and our
continued drinks market share
gains. Our average weekly sales per
managed pub are up 6% to £18.5k,
well over three times that of the
average UK pub, and we are
now serving a total of 107 million
meals a year.
Tim Clarke, Chief Executive
Strategic review
Mitchells & Butlers has delivered another
strong trading performance this year.
Like-for-like sales have grown 3%, driven
by our continued focus on value, service,
range and amenity. Operating profit
growth of 11% to £343m, before
exceptional items, has been generated by
our efficient conversion of sales increases
into profits growth, through further
improvements in employee productivity,
purchasing gains and effective cost
controls. Earnings per share for the year,
before exceptional items, are up 21.2% 
at 35.5p. This is a result of the trading
performance, together with the
contribution from the former Whitbread
pub restaurants (the ‘Acquired Sites’), 
a significant development project
completed by Standard Commercial
Property Developments Limited (‘SCPD’)
and the share consolidation that
accompanied the Special Dividend 
in the early part of the year.
This strong performance has been
delivered against a background of
increasingly challenging market conditions
in the second half of the year. A softening
in consumer confidence, particularly
pronounced in the mid-market, driven by
consecutive rises in interest rates, growing
inflation pressures and an increased tax
burden, was exacerbated by the volatility
in the global financial markets. In
addition, industry growth was limited by a
summer of prolonged poor weather.

Mitchells & Butlers
Annual review and summary 
financial statement 2007
These conditions have resulted in a
market where we have seen the increasing
importance of food, soft drinks and 
wine against the decline in beer and
machine income.
However, in the long term, the market for
value for money eating and drinking out
continues to grow. Our same outlet like-
for-like food volumes increased by 6% in
the year against a pub food market up 3%,
driven by key social changes such as the
increase in the number of women in work,
the number of single households and the
growth of an affluent retired population.
Since 1990, the proportion of adults
visiting pubs at least monthly has risen
from 59% to 72%. There has been a
marked increase in the growth of less
frequent customers since the turn of the
century, who, attracted by the widening
appeal of pubs and the strengthened 
food offers, are increasingly visiting to eat.
The same period saw a decline in people
visiting the pub solely to drink, with 
those visiting at least three times a week
dropping by more than half to 8% of 
the adult population.
These long-term trends are likely to be
reinforced by the smoking ban as new and
lapsed customers, previously discouraged
by tobacco smoke, become regular pub-
goers. Our experience so far suggests that
large pubs, with the capability to serve
high volumes of good food at attractive
prices, will benefit from a ban on smoking.
Mitchells & Butlers is well-placed 
to capture this long-term growth. 
Our successful strategy of offering our
customers an ever-wider choice of good
value food and drink in a high quality,
welcoming environment has enabled us 
to achieve good sales growth for a fourth
consecutive year and positions us well to
make further market share gains in a more
difficult market during the year ahead.
Our emphasis on innovation to develop
our brands and formats and our offers 
to keep pace with fast-changing consumer
expectations, and our relentless drive 
to improve our scale efficiencies combine
to ensure our customers enjoy the greatest
possible choice, quality and value. 
Our employees, recruited for their talent
and personality, are trained and motivated
to deliver excellent customer service. 
In essence, our proven operational
expertise at every level, combined with 
a pub estate of exceptional quality in
prime locations, continues to deliver on
our strategy of driving profitable volume
growth and creating shareholder value.
The strength of these strategic levers can
be seen in the results we have achieved 
in the conversion programme on the sites
acquired last year from Whitbread, of
which 172 have been completed so far.
Despite the substantial impact of the 
poor summer weather, particularly on
destination pub restaurants, sales have
increased by approximately 20% and we
are confident of achieving the 30% sales
uplift targets in FY 2009, as indicated 
at the time of acquisition.
Thus we believe we have a long-term,
sustainable growth model which will
enable us to continue to gain market 
share despite the more uncertain outlook
for next year.

Sizzling Pub Co.
Key to the success of our strategy to 
date has been our focus on leveraging
the growth in food to attract customers
to our pubs, thereby increasing higher
margin, ancillary drinks sales to
maximise profitability. We also aim 
to reinforce the link between food and
drink through our marketing activity
and sales promotions.
Sizzling Pub Co. (‘SPC’) was established
in 2001 with only a few pubs initially
trading under the format but this year 
it celebrated its 200th opening. Sited in
suburban locations, SPC pubs offer their
local communities quality and value for
money food and drinks in comfortable
surroundings alongside friendly service.
Fundamental to the market out-
performance of SPC is the format’s
ability to attract an increasing number 
of customers into its pubs through 
its great value food offer, to make
incremental, full-price drinks sales 
to these customers. Thus its current
offer of two main meals for £6 from
2.30pm to 6.00pm Monday to Friday 
has seen the number of meals sold 
in this time-slot grow to 16,000 per 
week over the last two years. The 
value food offer combined with other
promotional activities such as weekly
quiz nights, music and sports events 
is also successful in driving repeat 
visits by guests.

Mitchells & Butlers
Annual review and summary 
financial statement 2007
The eating-out market, now accounting
for approximately a third of the total
household expenditure on food in the 
UK, has grown steadily for many years.
However, it is only now at levels achieved
in the US over thirty years ago. The pub,
with its informal, relaxed atmosphere and
variety of value for money casual dining
offers is well placed to capture an even
greater proportion of the growth in this
market, which has been accelerated by 
the smoking ban now in place for all UK
pubs and restaurants.
For over a decade, Mitchells & Butlers 
has focused on developing a range of
offers to meet consumers’ tastes, building
on consumer insight techniques to invest
strategically to evolve these offers to add
incremental value to the sites we own as
well as those we acquire. We believe we
have the leading portfolio of brands and
formats in the industry.
We have successfully widened the 
appeal of the pub to capture new areas 
of growth in eating-out at both the higher
and lower scales of consumer affluence 
but continuous innovation within our
offers is critical in order to keep pace 
with the constantly rising expectations 
of customers as to food quality, the range
of drinks on offer and the standards 
of amenity and service. Our continuous
investment in each of these areas is also
vital in widening the gap between our
amenity, product range and value for
money and that of the competition,
further improving our overall customer
value proposition and our market share
gains relative to the rest of the on-trade.
In total this year, we invested £253m
maintaining and upgrading our pubs.
Focus on menu development has enabled
us to offer guests more variety, from
sharing ‘small plate’ dishes in Ember Inns
or hand-cut Maris Piper chips in our
Metro Professionals format. Cornerstone,
our successful community pub format, has
introduced its Best of British range which
includes choices such as liver and onions
or ham hock in a West Country scrumpy
sauce. We have developed fresh dishes
that are healthier and tastier, with a wider
taste profile and better provenance – for
example, organically farmed Shetland
salmon features on the new Vintage Inns
menu. Vegetarian options are also now
available across all our pubs.
The improved quality, choice and value 
of our food offers has broadened our
customer base, attracting women, families
and older guests as well as new pub
visitors. A widening customer base,
attracted by the food we offer, has enabled
us to boost associated sales of higher
margin drink sales. Innovation in the
range of drinks we offer has been key 
to this success and we have seen our 
same outlet like-for-like drinks sales grow
by 2.2% for the year. Our contractual
freedom to source an increasing number
of products from a variety of producers
has allowed us to extend the choice for
our customers across all drinks categories,
including new premium products and our
own label products offering great value.
We have focused on enhancing serve
quality, for example through our glycol
cooling system, which improves the serve
consistency for the dispense of draught
products, both beer and wine. Our own
label wine has grown to around 25% 
of wine sales and we have draught wine
dispense in some 630 pubs. Draught 
wine sales now account for almost 10% 
of total wine sales.
Targeted marketing campaigns and point
of sale material, together with seasonal
promotions, have communicated our new
dishes and new drink ranges effectively to
our customers. Very popular annual cask
ale festivals run across our Nicholson’s 
and Ember Inns businesses while All 
Bar One is holding a ‘Favourites Festival’,
showcasing a unique range of beers 
and ciders from around the world and
providing recommendations to customers
on combining these beers with the
international tapas sharing plates available.
In soft drinks we have extended the range
of fresh fruit juices, cordials and mineral
waters. The improved choice for customers
in these categories within our Pubs & Bars
division successfully drove sales growth of
16% from June to the year end, despite the
poor summer weather.
We have installed branded coffee offers
such as Costa, Illy and Segafredo in almost
1,200 pubs which is proving popular 
with our customers – coffee sales volumes
have increased by 23% in the year. The
introduction of branded coffee has worked
particularly well where we have also taken
advantage of the change in licensing law
and the smoking ban to broaden the
reason for and time of visit to the pub. 
For example, we have opened for
breakfast in a number of city centre
businesses such as selected Browns and
Nicholson’s sites, which have seen
encouraging results so far.
Overall, drinks volume growth has
experienced a slow down, with the on-
trade beer market down 5% and the 
soft drinks and wine market down 2%,
However, the strong growth in our food
volumes and our drinks retailing skills
have enabled us to make substantial
market share gains in each of these
categories.
The extension of the quality of our drinks
offers into non-traditional lines will also
add further to the attraction of our pubs
to new and light users.

Mitchells & Butlers
Annual review and summary 
financial statement 2007
For more than a decade, Mitchells &
Butlers has undertaken a strategic
repositioning of its estate to exploit the
growth areas of the market. Through key
acquisitions of significant pub estates, 
as well as individual sites with large sales,
our businesses are now spread across Great
Britain. At the same time there has been a
move away from the historic concentration
of pubs in the industrial areas of the North
and the Midlands to achieve a higher
weighting in the more affluent and faster
growing areas of the country. As a result,
75% of our pubs are now situated
primarily in residential areas.
Through this determined repositioning,
we have developed a pub estate of
exceptional quality that is predominantly
freehold or long leasehold and which, with
its superior scale and location, generates
sales per pub over three times higher than
that of the average pub in the UK. Large
scale, at both the corporate and individual
pub level, has been critical in the success
of our value and volume strategy. The 
size and capacity of our large pubs enable
us to drive high volumes of food at
attractive prices and, this year, our same
outlet like-for-like food sales increased 
by 5.1%. We now sell 107 million meals 
a year, making us the largest on-trade
caterer in the country.
Key to this growth is our commitment 
to provide our customers with the best
quality food offers possible at consistently
great value. This year, we have maintained
an average main meal price of £5.60
against a UK average of between £8 and
£9* which, combined with the high level
of service and amenity that our pubs offer,
has proved compelling to our guests. Food
volumes have grown by 67% over the last
five years. Purchasing and productivity
gains this year mean we are converting
sales growth very effectively into profits.
Although food is relatively lower margin,
sustained and profitable volume growth
has strengthened our negotiating position
with suppliers, driving further purchasing
gains and enabling us not only to offset
increases in regulatory costs this year but
to maintain retail net operating margins
broadly in line with last year. Our strategy
is to reinvest such gains back into the
value and quality offered to customers,
driving real competitive advantage and
thereby creating additional impetus to
volume growth. We will continue to
reinvest margin into our menu offers.
At the pub level, increasing volume
underpins our gains in business
efficiencies. Continuous investment in
developing operating skills in the capacity
management of kitchens, bars and serve
times ensure high standards of service
even at peak trading times. This year, the
Sizzling Pub Co. training team was highly
commended in the Customer Service
Training Team of the Year category in the
National Customer Service Awards 2007,
for its role in supporting new openings.
Our sophisticated scheduling and sales
forecasting systems allow us to match ever
more tightly the number of staff deployed
with the fluctuating trading patterns of 
the pub. Thus, at busy periods we can
move quickly to capture additional sales
by scheduling more staff, whilst keeping 
costs to a minimum during quieter times.
This focus, together with our training
programmes, has resulted in a 3.9%
increase in staff contribution per hour 
in the core estate. Pub employment costs
have been maintained at under 24% of
sales despite the substantial real increases
in the National Minimum Wage.
Our considerable purchasing power and
successful productivity systems have also
driven great benefit in the Acquired Sites
where, ahead of our forecasts at the time
of acquisition, we have made £7m of
purchasing gains during the year.

As the rise in frequent, casual eating-

has successfully evolved new formats 
to tap into this fast-growing area of 
the market. One such format is Pub 
& Carvery, trialled over two years ago,
and now trading in 58 sites nationally.
Serving over 2,900 meals a week,
the highest we believe of any format 
in the industry, the brand provides a
traditional, relaxed pub environment
with a freshly-cooked carvery offer
priced from an incredible £3.50. For our
guests, this represents better value than
eating at home. The brand has average
weekly sales of almost £30k per pub 
and is providing very high incremental 
returns on investment.

Cask ale training
The quality of our cellar skills has 
been instrumental in our sustained gains
in beer market share. With the increase
in demand for cask ales, Ember Inns has
invested this year in specific training on
the management and serve of cask ale,
to ensure customers enjoy the finest
quality pint possible. Most Ember Inns
are now certified by Cask Marque, 
an independent accreditation scheme 
to recognise excellence in the service 
of cask ale, and each pub has a beer
quality champion, trained by experienced
brewers. It has been important to achieve
the right balance between the traditional
ale drinkers who are loyal to one or two
brands with those customers seeking 
out new flavours. Ember Inns typically
carry at least one big-name brand 
or regional favourite but alongside 
there are a number of cask ales chosen
by the customers in conjunction with 
the manager.
Earlier this year, Ember Inns worked
with the Duchy Originals charitable
brand to launch an exclusive promotion
of its Organic Ale which provided our
customers with an opportunity to try the
beer ahead of the competition.

Annual review and summary 
financial statement 2007
Key to the successful, profitable operation
of our businesses is our ability to recruit,
train and retain the best people. Our 
wide range of brands and formats means
we are able to offer a huge variety of
opportunities to our employees, from 
bar staff to kitchen manager to chef. 
We offer comprehensive training so we 
do not always require experience; however,
personality and a passion for excellent
customer service are critical.
Mitchells & Butlers deploys a 
combination of assessment centres,
internal development centres, recruitment
advertising, interviewing and on-job
evaluation to recruit potential managers
and assistant managers and to help people
develop their careers. At the same time 
we recognise that many people want the
flexibility of a part-time job in order to
suit their lifestyle. We aim to provide for
their needs in the workplace.
We currently employ nearly 43,000 people
and offer real opportunities to build a
career within the Company, from retail
staff to Operations Director. This year we
invested an average of six days training
per employee, with structured training
programmes including both on and off
the job training.
At the retail level, the National Certificate
of Personal Licence Holders (‘NCPLH’) 
is an essential qualification to progress 
to manager level and employees can 
work towards this with an experienced
manager; this year, over 3,000 employees
achieved their NCPLH with the Company.
The internal succession rate to the post 
of retail manager is around 70% for most
of our brands and formats.
Our training programmes are not only
fundamental to motivating our employees,
giving them the skills to achieve their
ambitions but also, crucially, they
underpin our commitment to operate 
our businesses safely. Notably, we have
rigorous training about the responsible
retailing of alcohol to give our retail
employees the expertise and the
confidence to serve our customers
correctly. Our retail teams currently 
refuse service to approximately 50,000
people a month who are unable to 
provide proof of their age.
The Company has two graduate
recruitment schemes: the Corporate
Graduate programme and the Vocational
Graduate Programme, placing employees
on a fast-track to a retail management
position. Within any given year, we have
approximately 60 graduates participating
in our management training schemes and
for the second year running we achieved 
a Springboard UK award for Best Student
Placement for a Large Organisation. 
The Company has had an established,
comprehensive employee communications
programme in place for over ten years. 
A variety of channels such as team
meetings, conferences, in-house
publications and the intranet keep staff
informed on matters relating to the
Company and its performance. Two-way
communications between senior
management and employees are driven
primarily through regular discussions
groups at the corporate level and
operational communications forums. 
A formal Business Forum, at which
Executive Directors meet with elected
employee representatives to discuss
business concerns, takes place annually.
The yearly corporate employee
satisfaction survey gauges staff opinion 
on a wide variety of Company issues 
and working practices in a confidential
manner and provides a continuous
objective measure for employee
satisfaction and engagement. This year
the response rate to the survey improved
for the fourth consecutive year and the
continuing positive trend relating to
questions about employee engagement is
encouraging, with over 90% of employees
feeling satisfied and motivated by their
work. More than 94% of Mitchells &

the Company as a good place to work.

Annual review and summary 
financial statement 2007
The deliberate repositioning of Mitchells
& Butlers’ estate over the last 15 years has
been dramatic as we have sought to target
the growth areas of both the market and
the economy. Three strategic acquisitions
in 1995 (Harvester), in 1999 (the Allied
Domecq pubs) and last year (239 pub
restaurants from Whitbread), have enabled
us to make significant step changes in the
restructuring of our business to seize
advantage in the fast-growing market for
eating-out in this country. We have also
acquired over 400 individual sites since
the early 1990s and the superior scale and
location of our pub estate is a source of
real competitive advantage.
During the same period of time, we 
have evolved a range of over 25 brands
and formats, providing our customers 
– whether they are 18 or 80 – with a pub,
bar or pub restaurant that they want to
visit. Our wide range of formats gives 
us the flexibility to trade each one of 
our properties under the offer most
appropriate for the target market and
local customer demographic, affording 
us distinct competitive advantage. This
flexibility has been a key element in our
successful conversion of the Acquired
Sites. In addition, we opened six new 
sites and completed 65 conversions and
13 growth projects from our existing estate
to change the customer offer or increase
the trading area of the site. We are
generating a pre-tax incremental return 
of 20% on such investments in the core
estate over the last two years.
We have also continued to make targeted
disposals this year, taking advantage of 
the buoyancy in the market to crystallise
the property value of some smaller,
freehold pubs where this exceeds the
trading value to the Company. During 
the year we achieved £162m of disposal
proceeds, including the sale of 102 pubs
to Trust Inns Ltd in October 2006,
generating funds which can then be
reinvested in higher growth assets.
Our integrated model, where the value 
of our property portfolio has been greatly
enhanced by our superior operational
expertise and market-leading brands and
formats, has already created significant
value for shareholders and underpinned
our success to date. This has been
reflected in the £1.1bn upward revaluation
of the estate to £5.0bn, which has been
carried out in conjunction with our
property valuers, Colliers CRE.
Our focus remains on releasing to
shareholders the benefits of this capital
appreciation. In October 2006, we
returned £486m to shareholders by 
means of a Special Dividend of £1 per
share, crystallising for shareholders 
the continuing growth in the value 
of the estate.
It has also been clear that property
investors are attracted to the long term,
secure growth prospects that can be
created through the rentalising of part of
our operational cash flows in a dedicated
property structure. Whether in a joint
venture, a REIT or another separate
property structure, fundamentally higher
values appear to be placed on the estate
than when it is combined in an integrated
model with the operations.
We believe that substantial value can 
be potentially captured from our high
quality, freehold and long leasehold 
assets, through such structures. A key
consideration in such a process is to
construct a lease arrangement which
ensures that both the property and the
operations remain mutually incentivised 
to continue to create long-term value.
The Board will continue to investigate
actively options for capturing the value 
of the property estate for shareholders 
on a sustainable basis.

The Acquired Sites
In July last year, we acquired 239 of 
the best pub restaurant sites in the UK.
These freehold pubs were well located,
large, predominantly residential and
freehold or long leasehold, and
approximately half situated in the
higher growth regions of the South East
and South West of England. They were
therefore an excellent strategic fit with
the Company’s existing estate. Our key
capital investment priority this year has
been the rapid and successful conversion
of these sites and a total of £80m has
been invested to this end.
The conversion of these sites to our
brands and formats is enabling us to
create substantial shareholder value from
this acquisition and is accelerating our
growth and leadership position in the
casual eating-out market.

Corporate social responsibility
Mitchells & Butlers
Annual review and summary 
financial statement 2007
Mitchells & Butlers has a core belief that
sustainable business success has to be
based on experienced, professional
licensed retailing which builds upon the
reputation of each individual pub in its
own community.
We operate in a highly regulated industry
and recognise that attached to the grant of
our licences is the primary obligation to
ensure the responsible operation of our
premises at all times for customers, staff
and the wider community. For this reason,
we strive to ensure that corporate social
responsibility underpins our business
operation and discipline at every level.
Our philosophy for corporate social
responsibility combines the best of 
the traditions of the pub landlord’s
commitment to the community with
leading practice in crucial areas such 
as the responsible retailing of alcohol,
food safety and staff training.
A more detailed account of Mitchells &
Butlers’ corporate social responsibility
practices can be found in our separately
published Corporate Social Responsibility
Review 2007 on www.mbplc.com/csrreview
Alcohol and Social Responsibility 
(‘ASR Policy’)
Mitchells & Butlers first established a
comprehensive policy for the responsible
retailing of alcohol in 2000. Our ASR
Policy includes clear guidelines on the
responsible operation of our pubs, the 
sale and promotion of alcohol, our under
18s policy, and our comprehensive staff
training and development programmes. 
We updated and re-launched the ASR
Policy in October 2004, again in May 2006
and most recently in August this year, to
include tighter guidelines on the pricing
and promotions across our businesses and
on Challenge 21, our under 18s policy.
We are determined to ensure that
Mitchells & Butlers’ pubs are operated 
in a way that fully justifies the grant 
of a licence for the responsible retailing 
of alcohol. In that regard, we were pleased
to be recognised for the second time 
by the Morning Advertiser as this year’s
most responsible drinks retailer in the
managed pubs sector.
Smoking bans
We believe the introduction of the smoking
bans will be beneficial to our businesses 
in the longer term. They present us with a
real opportunity to attract new customers,
who did not previously use pubs because
of the tobacco smoke, to come into 
our pubs and pub restaurants across 
the United Kingdom.
Our experience since the bans came into
force shows that our large pubs, serving
high volumes of good food at attractive
prices, are already seeing this benefit. 
We are continuing to develop the
reputation of our pubs for serving good
food at good value prices, focusing on
innovation in the development of our
menus and drinks ranges, to create a wide
choice of dishes using quality ingredients
which are freshly prepared.
Gaming
Mitchells & Butlers, through its support 
of the British Beer and Pub Association
(‘BBPA’), has worked closely with the
Gambling Commission on the drafting 
of the Gaming Machine Permits Code 
of Practice which replaced the industry’s
voluntary code from 1 September 2007.
The BBPA has also worked with the
Gambling Commission on the draft Code
of Practice for Gaming in Pubs and Clubs,
which will regulate the playing of poker
and bingo.
Community involvement
Mitchells & Butlers understands that each
of our businesses has an impact on its
local community. We aim to ensure that
this impact is always positive and we
pursue this through a carefully composed
blend of local and national initiatives. 
Our pub and pub restaurant managers
raise thousands of pounds for charity 
and are supported via the Company
Community Awards and celebrated via the
annual Heart of the Community Awards 
in recognition of the positive community
impact achieved by our pub managers. 
In addition we are now in our third 
year of partnership with Barnardo’s. 
Our in-house Routes to a Brighter Future
campaign helps Barnardo’s to work with
the most vulnerable children and young
people, helping them transform their lives
and their potential. 
As a leading company with its
headquarters in Birmingham we also
sponsor a number of successful arts
organisations in the city. Partnerships
include the City of Birmingham
Symphony Orchestra, Birmingham 
Royal Ballet, The Birmingham REP 
and ExCathedra.
Environment
Mitchells & Butlers takes its 
environmental responsibilities seriously
and has a policy of seeking continuous
improvement, with particular focus 
on recycling and energy usage.
We have an established recycling
programme for both glass and cardboard
in our businesses. In the last 12 months
we recycled over 14,000 tonnes of waste.
We are continuing to make excellent
progress in energy saving and, in
September, we opened our first ‘green’
business, designed to trial a number 
of energy saving measures, at the Toby
Carvery, Banbury.

integrity of the existing and proven
integrated operating model. Following a
competitive process, we negotiated terms
with R20 for the sale of a 50% stake in a
£4.5bn joint venture, comprising the
majority of our freehold and long
leasehold properties. Shortly before
finalising the agreement, the sudden debt
market crisis in July meant that the
transaction could not be implemented.
Hedging arrangements
In the final stage of the planned
transaction, Mitchells & Butlers and R20
separately entered into debt hedging
arrangements comprising interest rate and
inflation swaps intended to be contributed
to the joint venture. These were required
to support the delivery of the financing
package. The turbulence in the debt
markets since July has led to long-term
interest rates falling. At the same time,
long-term inflation expectations have
risen, whilst the market liquidity for such
instruments has sharply diminished.
These three factors combined to produce
a post-tax deficit on the hedges of £155m,
against the mark-to-market values at the
balance sheet date. This was not a cash
loss to the business, as the hedges have
not been closed out and we continue to
expect that they will be utilised in a future
property based re-financing, once debts
markets have stabilised.
Property valuation
Given the continued focus on our estate,
we completed a revaluation of the
properties as at 29 September 2007. The
revised value of £5.0bn is included in our
financial statements and represents a net
increase of £1.1bn against the historical
accounting approach. Whilst this
accounting valuation is consistent with 
the existing structure of the Group, our
property valuers have advised that, within
an OpCo/PropCo structure, our freehold
and long leasehold properties would
support a market rent of £280m and a
rental yield of 5.8%, with an indicative
value of £4.8bn before any allowance for
purchaser’s costs. This valuation covers
only the rent from these properties and
therefore excludes the other cash flows
received by the operating company 
which, based on trading in the year ended 
29 September 2007, would equate to 
some £200m of underlying EBITDA.
Pensions
After £40m of additional contributions,
there was a pension deficit of £18m at 
the end of September under IAS19, with
more prudent mortality assumptions
applied following the actuarial valuation
exercise in the year. The formal actuarial
valuation as at 31 March 2007 indicates a
larger deficit of around £250m, reflecting
the more conservative gilts basis for
discounting future liabilities. In line 
with the new pension regulations, the
Company is finalising with the Trustees 
a formal recovery plan to close this deficit
by 2017. As part of this plan, in addition
to ordinary annual service contributions,
we expect that further contributions of
£24m will be made in each of the next
three years.
Summary
Our operational focus remains on driving
profitable sales growth and generating
strong cash flows. We will also continue 
to look at the best opportunity to release
additional value from our property to
benefit shareholders.
Summary operating
and financial review
Finance Director’s report
Mitchells & Butlers has performed
well despite a more challenging
consumer environment in the
second half of the year. Earnings
per share grew by 21.2% in the
year, underpinning the proposed
increase of 16.3% in the annual
ordinary dividend to 14.25 pence
per share, in addition to the
special dividend of £1 per share
paid to shareholders in 
October 2006.
Strong operating performance
Our value and volume strategy, combined
with the unrivalled quality of our pub
properties, has been the key to our
resilient trading performance. Like-for-
like sales during the year were up 3% 
and net retail operating margins were
broadly maintained, despite £8m of
additional regulatory costs and £14m 
of closure and pre-opening costs arising
from the conversion of the Acquired 
Sites to our brands and formats.
Investing for high returns
In the year we invested £253m in the
estate, including £131m of expansionary
capital of which £80m was spent on
converting the Acquired Sites, delivering 
a sales uplift of approximately 20% against
the levels at which the sites were acquired.
Our core expansionary investment over
the last two years has continued to deliver
incremental pre-tax returns of 20%, whilst
the business as a whole achieved a post-tax
cash return on capital employed of 10.8%.
Value creative disposals
Alternative use and investment 
demand for individual pubs reached
record levels during the year and we took
the opportunity to dispose of some of 
our smaller pubs, reinvesting the proceeds
in high return projects within the estate.
During the year, we raised £162m of cash
from disposals, including £101m from 
the sale of 102 smaller, community pubs 
to Trust Inns Ltd.
Releasing additional value from property
We conducted during the year a rigorous
review to determine whether the
Company’s properties would be valued
more highly if they were separated from
the operations of the business. Our
market-testing in the spring confirmed
that specialist investors would place 
a substantially higher value on our
properties than that which was implied in
our stock market valuation. We examined
alternative structures to access this upside
for shareholders and concluded that a
joint venture would offer the best route 
to crystallise a substantial proportion of
the property value, whilst protecting the

Summary operating
and financial review
Mitchells & Butlers
Annual review and summary 
financial statement 2007
T otal revenue for the year was £1,894m up
10.1% on last year, including the first year
of ownership of the Acquired Sites. Strong
like-for-like sales growth continued
reflecting resilient trading in more
challenging conditions in the second half
and further significant market share gains.
With the success of our ongoing sales and
marketing activities, like-for-like food and
drink sales were up 5.1% and 2.2%
respectively with average retail prices up
less than 2%. Overall gross margins were
slightly below last year, reflecting a further
significant shift towards the higher growth
but lower margin categories of food and
wine. By continuing to improve employee
productivity, our pub employment ratio was
maintained at below 24% of sales, despite
further increases in the National Minimum
Wage adding £7m to our labour costs. As a
result the net retail operating margin at
17.9% was broadly in line with last year,
despite £14m of one-off closure and
pre-opening costs.
We invested £261m in the estate in the year,
of which £8m related to the purchase of the
Acquired Sites and £80m was invested to
convert the majority of those sites to
Mitchells & Butlers’ brands and formats.
£122m was invested to maintain the high
levels of amenity in the pubs and in the
continuing development and evolution of
our brands and formats and £51m was
spent on expansionary projects in the
existing estate. During the year six new
pubs opened and 65 existing pubs were
converted to one of our brands and formats
to uplift their sales and profits. Overall we
are continuing to achieve an incremental
pre-tax return of 20% on the expansionary
investment of the last two years. Net capital
investment was £99m after achieving
£162m of cash from disposals.
Operating profit before exceptional items
was £343m, 11.0% ahead of last year.
Revenue in the Pubs & Bars division was
1.0% ahead of last year, including £16m
from the Acquired Sites transferred to the
division following conversion. Like-for-like
sales, on a same outlet basis, were ahead by
4.7%. There were continued drinks market
share gains, as a result of the widening gap
between our amenity, product range and
value for money and that of the
competition. Food sales across the division
were up 12.5% (excluding the Acquired
Sites) driven by growth in the residential
pubs as well as the T own Pubs and central
London estate. As a result of tight cost
control and improved employee
productivity, operating profit of £191m
before exceptional items was up 6.7% 
in the year and net Operating margin
increased from 18.7% to 19.7%. Excluding
the contribution from the Acquired Sites
and the impact of major disposals in 
the comparative, the existing Pubs and Bars
estate increased Operating profit by 11.9%.
Revenue in the Restaurants division was
19.2% ahead of last year at £908m,
including the contribution of £160m
from the Acquired Sites. Excluding the
Acquired Sites, revenue grew by 2.7% with
food sales up 3.9% and drinks up 0.7%.
The Restaurants division successfully
integrated the Acquired Sites and
completed the majority of the conversions
during the year as planned. Growth in the
rest of the estate slowed during the year
primarily as a result of the increasing
economic pressure on mid-market
consumers and greater intensity of
competition in pub food. Operating profit
of £145m before exceptional items was up
11.5% on last year, including £16m from
the Acquired Sites. Net Operating margin
fell from 17.1% last year to 16.0% due to
the closure and pre-opening costs associated
with the conversion of Acquired Sites
and the comparatively low margins
achieved by those sites prior to conversion.
Excluding the Acquired Sites, operating
profit increased by 4.0% with a net
operating margin improvement on
0.2 percentage points.
Standard Commercial Property
Developments Limited, the Group’s
in-house property development business,
generated £18m of revenue and £7m of
operating profit in the year.
Substantial progress was made in the
summer on structuring an attractive
property transaction, with terms largely
concluded with R20 (the investment vehicle
of Robert Tchenguiz) based on the sale of
a 50% stake in a £4.5bn property joint
venture comprising 1,300 pubs and
£240m of rent. In the final stages of the
planned transaction, the Company and
R20 separately entered into certain interest
and inflation hedging arrangements
intended to be contributed to the joint
venture. The sudden, rapid deterioration
in debt market conditions in later July
meant that a financing package could not
be obtained and the transaction could not
be executed. The hedges remain in place
as it is the Board’s intention to utilise
these instruments in a future property-
based refinancing once debt markets
have stabilised.
Given the continued focus on the value of
our estate, we have completed a revaluation
of our fixed assets based on an updated
valuation performed by Colliers CRE, of
our freehold and long leasehold properties
as at 29 September 2007. The revised value
of the properties at £5.0bn represents a
net increase of £1.1bn compared with the
historical accounting basis. We will continue
to regularly revalue our properties each year
on a rolling basis.
The Company entered into certain interest
rate and other hedging arrangements in
July 2007 which provide an economic
hedge against the future anticipated cash
flows associated with a property based
refinancing, however they do not qualify for
hedge accounting. The total fair value of
these instruments during the year reported
within exceptional items was £(221)m. An
exceptional loss on property related items of
£23m arose during the year, consisting of
impairment arising from the revaluation of
the property portfolio of £45m partly offset
by net profits on the disposal of properties
of £22m, primarily related to the sale of
102 pubs to Trust Inns Limited on
6 October 2006. Exceptional costs of £4m
were incurred in the first half of the year
relating to the integration of the Acquired
Sites, whilst a further £7m of costs were
incurred in the second half of the year,
relating primarily to professional advisers’
fees in relation to the Board’s review
of a potential property refinancing and the
proposed joint venture transaction with R20.
Finance costs for the year before exceptional
items were £153m, £35m higher than last
year, reflecting the higher level of debt in
the Group following the purchase of the
Acquired Sites in July 2006 and the
payment of a Special Dividend of £486m,
to shareholders in October 2006. The
effective tax rate was 30%, one percentage
point lower than last year.
Earnings per share before exceptional items
were 35.5p, 21.2% ahead of last year. In
addition to the growth in operating profit,
earnings per share have benefited from a
17% reduction in the average number of
shares mainly as a result of the 34 for 41
share consolidation in October 2006.
The Board is recommending a final
dividend of 10p per share. T ogether with
the interim dividend of 4.25p paid in June,
this gives a total dividend for the year of
14.25p, 16.3% higher than last year.
The Group’s operations continued to
generate strong cash flows. Cash flow from
operations was £447m before exceptional
items but after pension contributions of
£40m. Net capital expenditure was £99m
including £80m of expenditure on the
Acquired Sites, £51m of core expansionary
capital investment, £122m of maintenance
capital, less disposals proceeds of £162m.
On an IAS 19 basis, the net deficit in the
pension scheme was £18m (£14m, after tax)
at 29 September 2007 compared with £99m
(£67m after tax) at 30 September 2006. The
reduction in deficit reflects the benefit of
£40m of additional pension contributions
paid in the year and improved investment
returns, partially offset by updated
assumptions of life expectancy. 27

29 September 2007, principally located 
in the UK. A review of the the Group’s
performance is contained in the full
Directors’ report which cross-refers to the
Chairman’s statement, and the Operating

Share capital
On 1 October 2006, the Company 
had 486,910,806 ordinary shares of 7
1
⁄ 12p
in issue. On 18 October 2006 the share

shares of 7
1
⁄ 12p. As at 29 September 2007,
403,779,693 ordinary shares of 8
13
⁄ 24p were
in issue. 1,241,969 of these shares were
held in Treasury and the Company’s
employee share trusts held 1,070,449
shares at the year end.
Refinancing and return 
of funds to shareholders
Following a refinancing that was
completed in September 2006 and the
share capital consolidation that occurred
in October 2006, the Company paid 
a Special Dividend of £1 per share on 
25 October 2006 as an interim dividend 
for the year ending 29 September 2007.
Final dividend
The Board recommends a final dividend
for the year ended 29 September 2007 
of 10.0p per share to be paid on 
4 February 2008 to shareholders 
on the register at close of business on 
7 December 2007. This makes a total
dividend, including the Special Dividend,
for the year of 114.25p per share 
(2006 12.25p per share). 
Securities and Exchange 
Commission (‘SEC’) registration 
As a result of changes to the SEC rules
implemented in June 2007, the Company
was able to file to terminate its registration
under the US Securities and Exchange 
Act 1934 (the ‘Exchange Act’). This
termination took effect on 4 September
2007 and accordingly the Company no
longer has any reporting requirements
under the Exchange Act.
Directors
Details of the Directors who served on 
the Board during the year are shown
on page 28.
There were no changes to the Board
during the year.
Adam Fowle was appointed to the Board
on 1 October 2007 and Tony Hughes 
will stand down from the Board on 
31 December 2007. Mike Bramley, Roger
Carr and Drummond Hall will retire by
rotation at the Annual General Meeting
on 31 January 2008. Adam Fowle will also
stand for reappointment at that meeting as
he was appointed by the Directors during
the year. The Executive Directors each
have a service contract with the Company,
and the Non-Executive Directors serve
under letters of appointment.
Employees
The Group employed an average of
42,741 people in 2007 (2006 38,677).
Details of the Group’s employment
policies are shown in the Annual report
and financial statements.
Donations 
The Company continues to support
community initiatives and charitable
causes, full details of which are given 
in the Annual report and financial
statements. The Company made no
political donations during the year and
intends to maintain its policy of not
making such payments. It will, however,
as a precautionary measure to avoid
inadvertent breach of the law, seek
shareholder authority at its 2008 AGM 
to make limited donations or incur
limited political expenditure, although
it has no intention of using the authority.
Annual General Meeting
The notice convening the Annual General
Meeting to be held at 11.00am on
Thursday, 31 January 2008 is contained 
in a circular sent to shareholders with 
this review.
Corporate governance report
The Board recognises the importance 
of good corporate governance in creating 
a successful, sustainable and profitable
business. It is committed to compliance
with the principles of corporate
governance as set out in the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance 
(the ‘Combined Code’) and considers that
the Company has complied throughout
the year ended 29 September 2007 with
all the provisions of the Combined Code,
except where explained below.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the 
Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management and for reviewing its
effectiveness. In order to discharge that
responsibility, the Board confirms that it
has established the procedures necessary
to apply the Combined Code, including
clear operating procedures, lines of
responsibility and delegated authority.
These procedures have been in place since
the Company was listed and are regularly
reviewed by the Board.
During the year, the Board has conducted
a review of the effectiveness of the system
of internal control. The system is designed
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk
of failure to achieve business objectives
and it must be recognised that it can only
provide reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material misstatement
or loss. In that context, the review, in the
opinion of the Board, did not indicate that
the system was ineffective or unsatisfactory.
The Group regularly reviews both the type
and amount of external insurance that it
buys bearing in mind the availability of
such cover, its cost, and the likelihood and
magnitude of the risks involved. The
Group additionally maintains Directors’
and officers’ insurance cover.
Board and committee structure
To support the principles of good
corporate governance, the Board, is
responsible to the shareholders for the
good standing of the Company. There
were eight regular Board meetings during
the year, along with seven additional
meetings. During the year the Company
entered the FTSE 100 and, as a result, 
the Chairman now holds more than one
chairmanship of a FTSE 100 company.
The Non-Executive Directors specifically
considered this as part of the Board
effectiveness review and concluded that 
he is more than capable of devoting
sufficient time to his role of Chairman 
of the Company alongside his external
appointments.
The Audit, Remuneration, Nomination
and Executive Committees of the 
Board meet throughout the year. 
Their terms of reference are available 
on www.mbplc.com/investors
The Company Secretary’s responsibilities
include ensuring good information flows
to the Board and its committees and
between senior management and Non-
Executive Directors, and for assisting 
the Directors with their professional
development.
Going concern
The Company’s financial statements 
for the year ended 29 September 2007
have been prepared on a going concern
basis as, after making appropriate
enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Group has adequate
resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. 31
These principles of alignment are cascaded as appropriate to executives below Board level.

Annual review and summary 
financial statement 2007
This summary is an extract of information
from the full Remuneration report
contained in the Annual report and
financial statements 2007, a copy of 
which is available on request and can 
be viewed on the Company’s website at
www.mbplc.com/reports. Throughout this
review, references to the year are to the
52 week period ended 29 September
2007. The full Remuneration report will
be put to shareholders for approval at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Remuneration policy for Executive
Directors
The following overall policy has applied
throughout the year and is intended 
to continue to apply for the financial 
year 2008.
The Remuneration Committee (the
‘Committee’) determines on behalf of the
Board, with the benefit of advice from
external consultants and the Human
Resources function, the remuneration
packages, including pension rights and,
should it be necessary, compensation
payments, of the Executive Directors, 
the other members of the Executive
Committee and certain other senior
executives. The Committee is also
responsible for reviewing the fees of the
Chairman. The Committee aims to ensure
that remuneration packages are designed
to attract, retain and motivate Executive
Directors of the highest calibre. It has
regard to the levels of remuneration
within the Group and the specific
industries and businesses with which the
Group companies compete and is also
sensitive to levels within the wider
community. The Company operates
performance-related policies designed to
provide the appropriate balance between
fixed remuneration and variable risk
reward. Using target or projected value
calculations, performance-related
incentives for Executive Directors will
equate to approximately 60% of total
remuneration.
Share and cash-based incentives are
designed so as to align the interests of
executives with those of shareholders.
Executive Directors are currently required
to build and maintain significant
shareholdings equivalent to twice their
basic salary, but three times salary for the
Chief Executive. Although the Committee
recently reduced this to one times salary
for any future appointments, subject to
this continuing to be reflective of market
practice, it was decided that Adam Fowle
who was appointed to the Board on 
1 October 2007 would be required to
attain a shareholding of twice his annual
salary within five years of his appointment
as an Executive Director.
The Company measures its performance
against its strategy through four key
performance indicators (‘KPI’s), being:
1. Same outlet like-for-like sales growth.
2. Earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth.
3. Cash return on cash capital employed
(‘CROCCE’) in excess of the weighted
average cost of capital, post tax
(‘WACC’).
4. Incremental return on expansionary
capital.
As outlined in the OFR, total shareholder
return (‘TSR’) is also an important
measure of performance and this measure
forms one of the performance conditions
for the Performance Restricted Share Plan.
These KPIs and their alignment to
remuneration policy are summarised
below.
Performance Restricted Share Plan (‘PRSP’)
Basic salary
Incentivises growth in EPS and share price.
Aligns interests of Executive Directors and
shareholders.
Deferred shares matched 1:1 subject to
achievement of a performance condition. Dividend
Accrued Shares will be awarded on the value of
ordinary dividends accruing on vested shares.
Growth in EPS over
RPI over a three year
performance period.
Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan (‘STDIP’)
Growth in EPS over
RPI over a three year
performance period.
Motivates achievement of annual business KPIs
and delivery of EPS target.
55% of salary ‘on target’ bonus, 100% of base
salary maximum bonus. Payable in cash or shares
at the discretion of the Committee.
Earnings per share
(75%) and personal
and group business
objectives (25%).
These objectives are
based on a number 
of measures including
like-for-like sales
growth and return 
on investment.

Components of remuneration packages
Basic salary
Basic salary will normally be set within 
a competitive range broadly at median
market level when compared with an
appropriate comparator group. As
previously reported, from 2007 onwards,
the Committee decided that by exception,
basic salary may extend into the upper
quartile to attract new employees and
reward key individuals for consistent
outstanding performance. 
Of the components of the remuneration
package, only basic salary is pensionable.
Annual performance bonus and Short
Term Deferred Incentive Plan
Challenging performance goals are set
which must be achieved before a bonus
becomes payable. These targets are linked
to the Group’s performance in achieving
strategic business objectives, delivering
corporate financial targets and to each
Director’s achievement of personal
business objectives. The maximum bonus
opportunity for 2007 was 100% of salary.
Annual bonuses may be paid in cash but,
at the discretion of the Committee, the
Executive Directors may receive all or 
part of the bonus in the Company’s shares
under the terms of the STDIP . Under 
the STDIP , any award of Bonus Shares 
is deferred for three years and, if the

employment at the end of that period, 
the Company will provide Matching
Shares on a 1:1 basis, subject to
satisfaction of the performance condition.
Where Matching Shares have been
awarded, the performance condition has
been based on EPS growth. Dividend
Accrued Shares, equal to the gross
ordinary dividends applicable over the
performance period will be awarded based
on the number of shares vesting.
During the year, certain hedging
instruments (‘hedges’) were taken out in
anticipation of implementing a property
backed refinancing. These hedges have
given rise to a non-cash deficit at the year
end. As it is uncertain whether this non-
cash deficit will crystallise and, if so, the
extent to which it will affect the financial
performance of the Company, the
Executive Directors have voluntarily
offered to freeze final consideration of
whether a bonus should be paid in respect
of the year to 29 September 2007 pending
a review by the Remuneration Committee
at the forthcoming half year or later, if
appropriate.
Performance Restricted Share Plan
The PRSP aims to encourage continuing
improvement in the Group’s performance
over the longer term. Generally a three
year performance cycle will commence
each year and at the end of the cycle two
aspects of the Company’s performance will
be measured:
• total shareholder return against a
comparator group of competitor
companies; and
• cash return on cash capital employed
against its weighted average cost of
capital, post tax.
Awards will be graded according to the
level of performance on each of these
measures. For awards made from 2006
onwards, Dividend Accrued Shares, 
equal to the gross ordinary dividends
applicable over the performance period
will be awarded based on the number 
of shares vesting.
Executive share options 
Grants of options have been made under
the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Share
Option Plan (‘EXSOP’), although no
grants have been made under the EXSOP
since June 2005. It is intended that no
further grants are made under this plan.
The maximum value of shares over which
options were granted in any year was twice
salary for Executive Directors. Options are
exercisable three to ten years from grant
subject to the achievement of a
performance condition set by the
Committee. 
Pension arrangements
Executive Directors participate with 
other members in the relevant Group
pension schemes.

Electronic communication
Shareholders can register to receive 
an e-mail notification of the availability 
of the Company’s latest shareholder
communications at the following web 
link www.mbplc.com/ecomms. The website
also enables shareholders to view details 
of their own shareholding or electronically
appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf 
on any poll that may be held at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Following recent changes in legislation 
the Company will be seeking authority 
to amend its Articles of Association at the
2008 AGM to enable it to make electronic
communication with shareholders the
default position. The Company intends 
to enclose communication election cards
with the interim dividend payment
mailing in 2008. Shareholders will have
the right to request to receive paper
communications, however this presents 
an opportunity for the Company to
benefit from reducing costs whilst
reducing its impact on the environment.
Interim results
The Company does not intend to publish
future interim results in hard copy. The
interim results will be available online 
at www.mbplc.com/reports
Amalgamating your share accounts
If you received more than one copy of this
report, it may be because the Registrar has
more than one record of shareholdings in
your name. To ensure that you do not
receive duplicate mailings in future, you
can have all your shares amalgamated into
one account by contacting the Registrar at
the address below.
Dividend mandates
Shareholders who wish dividends to be
paid directly into a bank/building society
account, should contact the Registrar for 
a dividend mandate form. This method 
of payment removes the risk of delay or
loss of dividend cheques in the post and
ensures that your account is credited 
on the due date.

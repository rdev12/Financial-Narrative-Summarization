Tips on protecting your shareholding
Ensure all your certiﬁ cates are kept in a safe place or hold your shares 
electronically in CREST via a nominee; 
Keep all correspondence from the Registrars which shows your 
shareholder reference number in a safe place, or destroy correspondence 
by shredding; 
If you change address inform the Registrars. If you receive a letter from 
the Registrars regarding a change of address and you have not recently 
moved, please contact them immediately; 
Know when the dividends are paid and consider having your dividends 
paid directly into your bank (you will need to ﬁ ll out a dividend mandate 
form and send it to the Registrars), thus reducing the risk of the cheque 
being intercepted or lost in the post. If you change your bank account, 
inform the Registrars of the details of your new account. Respond to any 
letters the Registrars send to you about this; 
If you are buying or selling shares, only deal with brokers registered in the 
UK or in your country of residence.

Kingﬁ sher’s Registrar, Computershare Investor Services PLC, will not register 
a change of address or change of Bank Mandate instructions unless in writing

Our aims
Our aim is to deliver a step-change in 
value by focusing on three key priorities:
Management
A new senior team, working within a new 
management structure, will have collective 
responsibility for overall Group delivery of results 
as well as key existing cross-Group activities.
Capital
Investment will be reprioritised, targeting higher 
hurdle rates and faster payback periods. A key 
target is to stabilise debt at current levels, prior 
to reducing it in due course. A target of ﬂ at net 
debt has been set for the current year.
Cash returns
Greater focus will be placed on generating higher 
cash returns from the retail businesses. Stretching 
targets for sales growth, margin improvement and 
cost reduction will be drawn up.

Chairman’ s statement
The last ﬁ nancial year has been a challenging one for Kingﬁ sher 
and for its shareholders who have seen a signiﬁ cant reduction in 
the company’s share price. Much of this has been a result of stock 
market volatility, which was caused by uncertainty in the global 
ﬁ nancial markets. During the year, investor sentiment moved 
against UK-based retailers, particularly those selling ‘bigger ticket’ 
items such as home improvement, as concerns about consumer 
credit availability grew.
Whilst stock market sentiment will always ebb and ﬂ ow, our job 
inside the company is to keep focused on moving the business 
forward aggressively but responsibly in order to optimise shareholders’ 
interests in the medium and long-term, as well as the short-term. 
Our model, which gives us exposure to opportunities in a range 
of markets, many in fast growing economies, should enable us 
to grow at rates which are notably higher than companies who 
are solely based in a single developed market. However, for the 
model to work most effectively, each of the units needs to 
perform and a close eye needs to be kept on the balance sheet. 
Against this background it was good to see a range of excellent 
performances by a number of our companies during this last 
year. Examples include Castorama in Poland, which had a 
very successful year, as did its namesake in France. Koçta¸ s, 
our Turkish joint venture, delivered very strong results and our 
new business in Russia made an extremely encouraging start. 
There are, however, areas where we need to see improvement, 
including our business in China, where the performance is 
being addressed.
Overall, total Group sales rose 8% to £9.4 billion in the year, with 
adjusted pre-tax proﬁ t down 2.8% to £386 million, largely due to 
a difﬁ cult UK market. 
In the UK, B&Q made major changes to its business, not only 
refreshing much of its ranges with new products, but revamping 
around 5.5 million square feet of its store space. This has been 
a demanding task which has been carried out well at a difﬁ cult 
stage in the business cycle. These changes are delivering good 
results, it was the right thing to do, and I am sure it will ensure 
B&Q is ready to take full advantage when the market improves.

Annual Report
and Accounts
2007/08
Kingﬁ sher has good brands, exceptional international and national 
store footprints, and excellent people. These now need to be pulled 
together to deliver the necessary returns on our investments and 
sustainable proﬁ t growth which will ﬁ lter through into improved 
beneﬁ ts for our shareholders. 
At the end of the ﬁ nancial year, Ian Cheshire took over from Gerry 
Murphy as Kingﬁ sher’s Chief Executive. Gerry played a major part in 
developing the business, particularly from an international perspective, 
but now Ian has the responsibility of really delivering the Group’s 
potential. I am very conﬁ dent that he is the man for the job.
The spread of our Group means that there are many opportunities 
to invest. I am pleased to see that one of Ian’s ﬁ rst priorities following 
his appointment was to tighten up our controls over capital spend 
and to limit the overall amounts. However, if we are to move the 
business forward we do have to make ﬁ nance available for considered 
investment, whilst taking steps to ensure that our balance sheet is 
prudently protected. 
With this in mind and recognising the external economic environment, 
the Board has decided to reduce the ﬁ nal dividend by ﬁ fty percent 
and would expect to apply a similar cut to the forthcoming interim 
dividend. This would have the effect of rebasing the dividend to a 
level more prudently covered by current earnings from which it could 
grow consistent with the performance and capital needs of the Group. 
The Board is recommending a ﬁ nal dividend of 3.4p, making a total 
dividend for the year of 7.25p.
As I said at the beginning, this has been a difﬁ cult year for our investors 
but within the business there have been many major successes. 
This has been due to a combination of talent and hard work on the 
part of our 85,000 staff across the world. I would like to thank them 
for their enthusiasm and professionalism and wish them all the very 
best for the coming year.

Capital 
Investment will be reprioritised, targeting higher hurdle rates and 
faster payback periods. A key target is to stabilise debt at current 
levels, prior to reducing it in due course. A target of ﬂ at net debt 
has been set for the current year.
Capital invested to support Kingﬁ sher’s domestic and international 
development has been signiﬁ cant to date, building strong retail and 
sourcing operations across the world and there continue to be new 
investment opportunities which offer good returns. However, debt 
has expanded in recent years and, with the global economic cycle 
now tightening, stabilising debt at current levels, prior to reducing it 
in due course is now a priority. Accordingly, we have set a target of 
constant currency ﬂ at net debt for the current year.
Consistent with this, existing capital deployed across the Group 
will be reviewed and new capital investment will continue, albeit at 
a slower rate. Annual capital investment will be around £400 million, 
reprioritised to the highest and fastest-returning projects. Higher 
hurdle rates have already been introduced with immediate effect, 
driving quicker achievement of attractive returns.
Cash returns
Greater focus will be placed on generating higher cash returns 
from the retail businesses. Stretching targets for sales growth, 
margin improvement and cost reduction will be drawn up.
Having invested signiﬁ cantly in the worldwide retail and sourcing 
operations, greater focus will now be placed on generating higher 
cash returns from the retail businesses. Operational improvements 
will be achieved through a greater customer focus and drive for 
operating cost efﬁ ciencies.
Over the next three months the new management team will draw up 
new three-year operating plans with clear, stretching, but achievable, 
sales growth, margin improvement and cost reduction targets. 
Greater emphasis will also be placed on optimising working capital. 
Accordingly, we will align management incentives to the delivery 
of these plans, which will drive a step-change in shareholder value. 
No business can fully shield itself from economic cycles and given 
the current state of the ﬁ nancial markets, most commentators are 
expecting the short-term outlook to worsen before it improves. 
Against this background, our priorities remain on improving cash 
margin and controlling costs. I remain conﬁ dent that Kingﬁ sher has 
a bright future with a strong position in an attractive retail sector, and 
with geographic diversiﬁ cation in developed and developing markets.
Ian Cheshire
Group Chief Executive
Our aim is to deliver a step-change 
in value by focusing on three key priorities
I am delighted to be leading Kingﬁ sher at this important time in 
our development. We have a great opportunity to unlock the full 
potential of our strong assets. By changing how the Group as a 
whole is managed, tightening our use of capital and driving out 
higher cash returns from our businesses we intend to deliver a 
step-change in value for our shareholders.
Home improvement is an attractive segment of retail, beneﬁ ting from 
natural long-term demand characteristics fuelled by demand for more 
new housing and more frequent home renewal. The market also 
beneﬁ ts from many products being common across international 
markets, giving rise to global sourcing and economies of scale.
Within this market Kingﬁ sher is alone in having such a large and 
geographically diversiﬁ ed business. However, delivering more 
shareholder value from this strong strategic position will require 
changes in three key areas. 
Management
A new senior team, working within a new management structure, 
will have collective responsibility for overall Group delivery of results 
as well as key existing cross-Group activities.
Historically, Kingﬁ sher has followed a decentralised management 
approach, with our retail businesses largely operating independently 
but participating in Group-wide programmes for local advantage. 
This approach has successfully resulted in the businesses being 
well adapted to local customers, but it has yet to deliver the Group’s 
full potential.
Going forward, the retail businesses will retain responsibility for best 
serving their local customers but a new senior team, working within 
a new management structure, will have collective responsibility for 
overall Group delivery of results as well as key existing cross-Group 
activities; global sourcing, own-brand development, common 
purchasing, IT, property and global talent management.
Accordingly, three new geographic divisions have now been 
established; UK, France and Other International. Three new 
management roles have been created with overall responsibility 
for all businesses in each geographic division, and good progress 
has been made in identifying these executives. Philippe Tible, 
CEO of Castorama France, has been appointed to lead the French 
division and an announcement about the UK will be made shortly.
These three roles will make up the core of the new Retail Board 
with cross-Group powers and incentives. Internal management 
information has been simpliﬁ ed and more rigorous internal reporting 
– business performance monitoring and challenge processes – are 
being introduced. The Group Chief Executive will regularly attend 
Board meetings of the UK, French and Polish businesses.

2007/08

Kingﬁ sher’s businesses outperformed the market by delivering 
sales growth of 5.1%, despite disruption from B&Q’s biggest year 
of change in its history. 
B&Q’s total reported sales were £3.9 billion, up 2.7% (52 weeks). 
For the ﬁ rst time in three years, despite operating in a challenging 
market and with difﬁ cult summer weather patterns, like-for-like 
sales were up, by 0.6%. Total sales grew 4.8% over the ﬁ rst half but 
only 0.5% in the second half (26 weeks), reﬂ ecting a tougher retail 
environment. However, good sales growth from revamped large 
stores and new ranges helped offset disruption from the ongoing 
renewal activity.
Retail proﬁ t was £131 million (2006/07: £163 million), after £29 million 
net revenue costs of the renewal programme (£14 million revamping 
larger stores and £15 million range review clearance activity). 
Underlying retail proﬁ t was broadly maintained. The underlying 
gross margin rate, before range review clearance activity, was 
slightly up compared to last year, reﬂ ecting less promotional activity 
and a favourable sales mix towards new, higher margin products.
Total costs grew 4% (52 weeks) with underlying cost inﬂ ation of 
2%, net new space growth of 2% and the additional costs of store 
revamping offset by cost savings. 
Renewal programme update
B&Q aims to grow its share of home improvement expenditure 
by strengthening its appeal to both the Do-it-Yourself (DIY) and 
Do-it-For-Me (DFM) customer. During 2007/08, B&Q underwent 
the biggest year of change in its history, which included updating 
product ranges, improving its store environments and introducing 
more services, to ensure B&Q is the ﬁ rst and only store for a greater 
proportion of customers’ home improvement spend. 
New product ranges
B&Q updated 60% of its overall product ranges during the year, 
supported by a major new advertising campaign. Updated ranges 
of wall and window coverings, lighting, soft furnishings and kitchens 
sold particularly well, as have bedroom, plumbing and ﬂ ooring 
ranges which have been updated more recently. A better underlying 
performance is expected from these changes in 2008/09. 
Customer service
Customer service requirements are typically the highest when 
shopping for room make-over decorative items and major home 
improvement projects. Good advice, online and in-store, coupled 
with fast and efﬁ cient delivery and installation, are key to good 
customer service.
During the ﬁ rst half of the year, 800 in-store decorative advisers 
received practical decorating skills training, to enable them to 
advise customers on how to style rooms. This initiative has been 
well received and will be extended to laying ﬂ ooring, tiling and the 
basics of plastering and ﬁ tting kitchens and bathrooms. 
Revamp programme gathers pace
The UK home improvement market* grew over the ﬁ rst half of the 
year, before weakening over the second half, as concerns over higher 
personal debt, less debt availability and falling house prices began to 
weigh on the consumer. For the full year, the market grew by around 
3%, following falls of 0.5% last year and 4% in 2005/06.

01 Revamped displays
A key development during the year was the progress of the large store 
revamp programme. These stores are lighter, brighter and feature more 
clearly deﬁ ned shop-within-shop sections, more room-set displays and 
more space allocated to kitchens, bathrooms, ﬂ ooring and tiling areas. 
The store revamp in Farnborough, Hampshire (pictured right), was 
completed in February. B&Q revamped around 5.5 million square feet

in a modern format. In total, 38 of the 117 large stores are in the modern 
format, with 27 completed in the year. The programme remains on track 
for completion in 2011.

Following a major overhaul of B&Q’s installation and home delivery 
services, the time from order to delivery and installation of kitchens 
and bathrooms has been reduced by ﬁ ve weeks on average. 
Also, the B&Q website (www.diy.com) has been revamped, with 
customers now able to use new free room design and bathroom 
planner software, view more than 35,000 products online and 
check availability in their local store. In addition, 6,500 products 
continue to be available for home delivery.
Store development
Having revamped around 5.5 million square feet of store space 
across the year, B&Q now has over half its store space in a modern 
format. Twenty seven large store revamps, which encompass 
more clearly deﬁ ned shop-within-shop sections, room-set displays 
and more space allocated to kitchens, bathrooms, ﬂ ooring and 
UK Trade
Screwﬁ x total sales grew 28.0% (52 weeks), driven by the 
continued roll-out of the trade counters, which provide customers 
with immediate product availability and a bigger catalogue. 
An additional 55 outlets opened during the year, taking the total 
to 93. Trade counters now represent almost 40% of total sales. 
To support this continued growth, a second distribution centre 
was successfully commissioned during the year in Stafford. 
Retail proﬁ t increased 6.4%, driven by the strong sales growth 
and fulﬁ lment efﬁ ciency gains, offset by start-up costs for the 
second distribution centre and an accelerated trade counter 
opening programme. Excluding the impact from these initiatives, 
retail proﬁ t would have been up around 14%.
One Planet Living at B&Q 
tiling areas were completed. This programme remains on track 
for completion by 2011.
The 11 large new format stores which have been open for more 
than one year have delivered targeted average sales densities of 
over £200 per square foot, 25% higher than comparable sized, 
older format stores.
The higher sales productivity results from customers spending 
more in the expanded kitchen, bathroom and associated project 
areas. In aggregate, the revamps, which on average have only 
24 weeks’ trading data, have delivered sales uplifts of 13% higher 
than a ‘control group’. However, measurement of this relative uplift 
excludes the beneﬁ ts of updated product ranges, which are now 
substantially available in all stores, including the ‘control group’ stores.
B&Q now has 117 large stores (38 in the latest format) and 206 
medium stores (of which 151 have been modernised). Overall net 
space increased 2% during the year. 
Trade Depot, which targets the general builder and specialist 
trade customer, opened two more branches during the year taking 
the total trading to six. Underlying trading remains encouraging.
As part of the new management structure, an integrated review 
of the optimal UK trade strategy across our various brands will 
be conducted.
In January, B&Q unveiled 
a series of initiatives to help 
it and millions of British 
home owners to reduce 
their environmental impact. 
B&Q signed a three-year 
partnership with BioRegional 
to move towards being a 
One Planet Living business. 
As the world’s population 
grows there simply aren’t 
enough resources available 
on the planet to meet 
potential demand. One Planet 
Living aims to maximise the 
use of sustainable materials 
and their transport whilst 
minimising carbon usage 
and waste.
B&Q is working with 
BioRegional to develop two 
sustainability action plans: 
one for B&Q’s own operations, 
and one to help its customers 
achieve One Planet Living in 
their homes and gardens. As 
part of this, B&Q aims to 
develop a substantial One 
Planet Living product range 
in store. This includes low 
energy lightbulbs and 
eco-wool loft lagging, 
winner of the Retail Week 
Product Innovation of the 
Year award for 2008.
As part of this initiative, 
B&Q also announced 
its decision to phase out 
patio heaters.

Two complementary businesses
Kingﬁ sher is the market leader in France with its two complementary store formats, 
Castorama and Brico Dépôt. Kingﬁ sher’s total sales in France grew 7 .2% in the year 
with retail proﬁ t up 13.2%.
01 Castorama
Castorama’s stores are aimed at the mainstream consumer. They stock 
a wide range of up to 50,000 home improvement products, enabling 
customers to complete a full project, including ‘ﬁ nishing touches’, such 
as lighting and soft furnishings. New bathroom ranges performed well 
during the year across four ‘style houses’; ‘Contemporary’, ‘Technicolour’, 
‘Charme’ (pictured) and ‘Authentique’.

Retail proﬁ t grew 13.2% to £237 million with both businesses 
delivering good proﬁ t growth. Gross margins were up 90 basis 
points due to higher own-brand sales penetration, a 25% increase 
in direct sourcing and an improved sales mix across both 
businesses. With a high level of freehold stores and strong cost 
control, Kingﬁ sher’s net cost inﬂ ation in France continues to run at 
around 2%. This is expected to increase to around 3% for 2008/09. 
Brico Dépôt total reported sales increased 11.1% to £1.5 billion. 
LFL sales growth was +1.4% after around 2% of internal 
cannibalisation resulting from the decision to open new stores 
in catchments where existing stores are trading at full capacity. 
Sales were strong in building and decorative categories, 
supported by favourable weather and new ranges of power 
tools and indoor paint. 
Castorama total reported sales grew 4.1% to £1.7 billion 
(+3.7% LFL, +5.6% on a comparable store basis), driven by 
good performances of new paint, decorative and bathroom 
ranges. The sales participation of exclusive own-brand products 
continued to grow with sales of the decorative ‘Colours’ ranges 
almost doubling compared to the prior year.
Castorama continued its store modernisation programme, with 
six stores revamped during the year. Forty-two per cent of total 
selling space is now in the new format and these stores continue 
to outperform, with average sales densities 19% higher than older 
format stores. 
Eight new stores opened in the year taking the total to 89, including 
the opening of three stores transferred from Castorama at the end 
of last year. 
The new SAP information technology platform was implemented to 
support Brico Dépôt’s future growth. Since completion of the project 
stock availability and stock quality have improved.
In France, Kingﬁ sher’s total sales grew 7 .2% (LFL +2.6%). Eight new stores were opened 
in the year and six were revamped, adding around 4% new space. Banque de France data 
shows that growth in comparable DIY store sales* was 3.0% for the full year. Kingﬁ sher’s 
businesses outperformed the market by delivering comparable stores sales growth of 3.7% 
(on the same basis as Banque de France), despite disruption from store revamps.

Sustainability at Castorama
Castorama has continued 
to work with the conservation 
organisation WWF to promote 
‘Partners for the Planet’ 
products with lower impact on 
the environment. These include 
energy saving products, timber 
certifi ed to FSC standards 
and paint with the European 
Eco label. In 2007/08 ‘eco’ 
products represented 8% of 
Castorama France’s total 
sales and included more than 
2,000 product lines. During 
the year, Castorama also 
launched a new 24 page 
guide called ‘The Planet, It’s 
My Home’ featuring solutions 
for more sustainable living. 
Castorama will build on 
this work in the coming 
year through a range of 
initiatives starting with a new 
merchandising display – 
‘La Maison Éco’ – which was 
launched in the new store in 
La Défense in April 2008. ‘La 
Maison Éco’ which identifi es 
products for a ‘healthy, 
effi cient, sustainable home’ 
will be part of all new stores. 
The store opening also saw 
the launch of Castorama’s new 
CD-Rom energy effi ciency 
tool for customers, enabling 
them to calculate an ‘energy 
scorecard’ for their home and 
to fi nd alternative products 
to reduce their consumption.

Kingﬁ sher’s sales in the Rest of Europe increased 22.8% to £1,273 million 
(+12.2% LFL) with 12 more stores trading* compared to the prior year. Retail 
proﬁ t increased 5.9% to £122 million. Asia sales increased 7 .0% to £472 million 
(-0.1% LFL) with retail losses of £14 million (2006/07: £5 million proﬁ t).
Rest of Europe sales increased 22.8% to £1,273 million (+12.2% 
LFL) with 12 more stores (excluding Turkey JV) trading compared to 
the prior year. Retail proﬁ t increased 5.9% to £122 million, reﬂ ecting 
strong growth in Poland offset by weaker performances from 
Castorama Italy and Hornbach (21% economic interest) in a difﬁ cult 
German market.
Seventeen new stores were opened in the year across six countries, 
including seven in Poland, ﬁ ve in Turkey and two in Russia.
Sales for Castorama and Brico Dépôt in Poland increased 31.1% 
to £703 million (+22.5% LFL), boosted by buoyant consumer 
spending, strong property and construction markets and favourable 
weather. Retail proﬁ t increased 41.8% to £87 million as good cost 
control, a year on year doubling in direct sourcing and increased 
own-brand penetration, helped to offset increasing wage inﬂ ation. 
New ranges, including exclusive own-brand professional tools and 
decorative products, performed well. 
Seven new stores opened including the second Brico Dépôt, 
launched to meet the demand for a more trade-orientated offer.
Operating in a generally weak retail market, Castorama Italy sales 
declined 1.2% to £314 million (-2.4% LFL). Sales beneﬁ ted from 
relocated and revamped stores, together with successful targeted 
promotional activity in bathroom accessory and ﬂ ooring categories. 
Retail proﬁ t of £29 million was down slightly on the prior year 
(2006/07: £31 million), with higher pre-opening and revamp costs. 
Increased own-brand penetration and good cost control helped 
to offset the slow market.
One new store was opened taking the total to 28. Two stores were 
revamped and one was relocated. 
In Ireland, where B&Q has eight stores, sales grew 6.8%, reﬂ ecting 
one new store opening in the second half of the year. Brico Dépôt’s 
expansion into Spain continued, with 11 stores now trading with 
underlying trading encouraging. In Russia, two new Castorama 
stores were opened taking the total to ﬁ ve. Sales more than doubled 
compared to the prior year (+25.6% LFL).
Koçta ¸ s in Turkey, a 50% joint venture, continued to grow sales 
and retail proﬁ t strongly, beneﬁ ting from Kingﬁ sher sourcing buying 
power and own-brand penetration. Five new stores opened taking 
the total to 15. Hornbach, in which Kingﬁ sher has a 21% economic 
interest, contributed £13 million to retail proﬁ t; £6 million lower than 
last year, due to a difﬁ cult German market.
Asia sales increased 7.0% to £472 million (-0.1% LFL) with retail 
losses of £14 million (2006/07: £5 million proﬁ t).
B&Q China sales increased 7.9% to £465 million reﬂ ecting new 
store openings and the development of new ranges. Sales were 
ﬂ at on a LFL basis, impacted by a slowdown of new apartment 
sales in the major Chinese markets, and new regulations covering 
trading terms between retailers and suppliers. 
Following the regulation change, ﬁ nalisation of B&Q China’s 
2007 supplier agreements was delayed until clariﬁ cation with 
the authorities in August 2007 . As a result of the required changes 
to some of its supplier arrangements, B&Q China’s result for the 
year was impacted by £11 million, contributing to a retail loss of 
£12 million (2006/07: £8 million proﬁ t). 
The Chinese market remains fundamentally attractive with B&Q’s 
operations in the major cities continuing to show attractive returns. 
B&Q has expanded rapidly over the last three years, adding 42 stores, 
tripling its store base. However, after several years of dramatic growth 
the business now needs a period of consolidation. Following a Group-
led review, B&Q China will be restructured giving rise to an operating 
exceptional cost of £22 million in 2007/08, relating to the accelerated 
write-down of assets. A further exceptional charge of around £1 1 million 
is expected to be recognised in 2008/09. Of the total £33 million 
exceptional charge, the cash cost is expected to be £9 million.
Other Asia
B&Q Taiwan delivered a small proﬁ t for the year prior to it being sold 
to its 50% joint venture partner on 4 January 2008. The exit from 
the two stores in South Korea was completed towards the end of 
the year. Following the disposal of Taiwan and Korea, the B&Q Asia 
head ofﬁ ce in Hong Kong will close in the ﬁ rst half of 2008/09.

Annual Report
and Accounts
2007/08
Kingﬁ sher has exposure to fast-growing, developing economies 
in Europe and Asia, including Poland, Russia and China, as well 
as having well-established businesses in developed markets like 
the UK and France. In total, the home improvement markets in which 
Kingﬁ sher operates are worth over £120 billion.
UK and France
We are the market leader in the UK and France, two of the largest 
retail markets in Europe. Each has large, relatively wealthy 
populations and levels of home ownership are high. Compared 
with the whole European Union (EU), a relatively higher proportion 
of consumer retail expenditure is on home improvement products 
and services. The home improvement markets in these countries 
are well-developed, large and have beneﬁ ted from increasing 
consumer wealth and growth in the number of homes. Consumers 
are served by large, well-established national retailers and small 
local specialists.
One major difference between the UK and France is the level 
of consumer debt, which is signiﬁ cantly higher in the UK. In 2005, 
the UK market declined after many years of growth, reﬂ ecting 
weaker consumer conﬁ dence as interest rates started to rise and 
spending increased in other areas such as travel, leisure and new 
electronic technology. The UK market continued to decline in 2006 
but returned to some growth in 2007. However, with consumer 
conﬁ dence taking a sharp downturn towards the end of 2007, 
most commentators are predicting that 2008 will be another year 
of market decline. The French market, however, has performed 
more strongly in recent years with consumers less impacted by 
rising interest rates. 
Kingﬁ sher also operates in Ireland, one of the smallest markets 
in Europe.
Other International
Italy and Spain 
Kingﬁ sher operates the largest home improvement brand in Italy 
and has a small but fast-developing business in Spain, having 
entered the market ﬁ ve years ago. Italy and Spain are the fourth 
and ﬁ fth largest retail markets in Europe respectively, with large and 
relatively wealthy populations. Retail expenditure has grown faster 
than the EU average over the last ﬁ ve years. Home ownership is high 
but the proportion of retail expenditure spent on home improvement 
is signiﬁ cantly lower than the European average. As a result, the 
home improvement markets are currently less well developed and 
served by a fragmented group of national and regional retailers. 
Both markets are suffering from cyclical pressures at the moment 
with the Italian market declining as relatively higher indebted 
consumers cope with higher interest rates, and the Spanish 
consumer conﬁ dence impacted by a weak housing market. 
Poland and Russia 
Kingﬁ sher is market leader in Poland and is building a new business 
in Russia. Consumers in these countries are enjoying increasing 
disposable income and consumption growth is strong. Retail 
spending in total and the proportion spent on home improvements 
are both lower than the EU average in these countries but are 
growing faster as consumers become wealthier and look to 
improve their homes. Poland has a large, mostly home-owning 
population with good DIY skills. Russia is the largest European 
country and developing fast. The home improvement market is 
being driven by new construction and much needed renovation. 
In both markets, consumers have traditionally been served by 
fragmented small-scale, local outlets and open markets. Over the 
last ﬁ ve years established retailers from western Europe have 
expanded into these two markets.
Kingﬁ sher also operates a joint venture in Turkey, a fast-developing 
market with strong future growth prospects.
China 
China has a fast-growing urban middle class of around 130 million. 
As a result, China is fast becoming one of the most important retail 
markets in the world. In recent years many millions of Chinese have 
been migrating to its major cities. As a result, new homes are being 
built in these cities at an unprecedented rate, typically sold as empty 
concrete shells. The new owners are responsible for completing 
the internal ﬁ t-out and decoration themselves. This has fuelled the 
rapid growth of the home improvement market, particularly design, 
decorating and installation services. Although there has been a 
slowdown in sales of new apartments recently in the major markets, 
long-term growth prospects are strong as expected sustained 
economic growth in China should result in continued new home 
construction, growing consumer wealth and greater home ownership. 
The home improvement market has historically been served by a 
highly fragmented base of very small local outlets. Larger retailers 
with more product choice as well as decorative and installation 
services are emerging.

Group talent development
As a large international retailer, with stores in nine countries, Kingﬁ sher 
can provide unique career and personal development opportunities 
for its people and provide a high quality international talent pool for 
the Group.
To help maximise these opportunities, the Kingﬁ sher Executive Group 
(KEG) and the Kingﬁ sher Talent Group (KTG) were both established 
in 2006/07 to help identify, retain and cultivate the next generation 
of business leaders within Kingﬁ sher.
Their role is to underpin and provide a succession pipeline to the 
well-established Kingﬁ sher Leadership Group (KLG), the top tier 
of Kingﬁ sher’s talent pyramid with a membership drawn from the 
Group Board, the Boards of the three largest operating companies 
and the heads of the other international businesses.
The KEG’s membership is therefore drawn from the 150 most senior 
roles below the KLG, with the expectation that it will act as a stepping 
stone to that grouping, while the KTG offers a platform for future 
success to the brightest and best employees seeking an international 
career and not currently occupying senior management positions.
With these groups in place, the focus last year shifted towards 
developing a series of initiatives to maximise the potential of their 
members. Principal among these was the creation of Leadership 
Attributes, which provide a clear articulation of what it means to be a 
good leader in Kingﬁ sher, as well as deﬁ ning the personal characteristics 
that can help an individual drive success in international retailing.
Produced by a cross-company working group and with the full 
participation of colleagues throughout Europe and Asia, the 
Leadership Attributes are now being embedded within the Group, 
complementing existing work in this area that has already taken 
place at operating company level.
KTG members beneﬁ ted from a number of development activities 
during the year and in January 2008 an event was organised for 
the entire group, after which they joined the annual Kingﬁ sher 
Management Forum for the ﬁ rst time.
Recognising the beneﬁ ts of an engaged workforce
Ensuring that employees are highly engaged with the strategies 
and action plans of Kingﬁ sher’s businesses is a top priority. Key 
to improving this is to understand accurately and in detail the level 
of engagement and how to inﬂ uence this level.
Within Kingﬁ sher, B&Q UK is the leader in measuring and inﬂ uencing 
workforce engagement. In 2000 it launched the ‘Q12’ survey, a 
well-established measurement tool run by Gallup based on 12 key 
employee expectations that, when satisﬁ ed, form the foundation 
of strong feelings of commitment and motivation among staff. 
This survey has been the cornerstone of their efforts to measure 
and improve workforce engagement and over 30,000 staff take 
part twice a year. In 2007 B&Q became the ﬁ rst company outside 
the United States, and the ﬁ rst retailer in the world, to win the 
Gallup Worldwide award for outstanding employee engagement. 
From 2008 the survey will be extended across the Group to include 
all the members of the KLG and the KEG.
Another successful initiative has been implemented at Castorama 
France, where innovative use of technology has improved 
engagement through greater dialogue between employees and 
management. Vizavi, launched in November 2007 , is a webcast 
debate between a group of nominated employees and a panel of 
senior managers including the Chief Executive (see panel for more 
details). By encouraging honest and straightforward discussion 
outside of hierarchical lines, Vizavi has joined the staff website 
Castoramoa (launched in 2006) as one of the key communication 
tools supporting Castorama’s ongoing modernisation programme.
Employee engagement is also a key element of an integrated 
performance management process launched at Screwﬁ x 
last year. A new engagement survey joined a new induction 
programme, appraisal process and succession management 
in the tool box now available to managers across the business. 
In France, Brico Dépôt has installed computer terminals 
in its stores, giving all employees the ability to access the 
company’s online HR Information System to manage HR-related 
administrative tasks. 
A major focus on management development
Management development remained a major focus. At Koçta¸ s, 
the Group’s joint venture business in Turkey, nearly 100 employees 
from different managerial levels took part in a year-long 
development programme that included classroom-based training, 
action plans and meetings with senior managers. In the UK, Trade 
Depot laid the groundwork for a new initiative – entitled ‘Leaders 
of the Future’ – to identify and develop talented people within 
the business, while Screwﬁ x introduced a fast-track development 
programme for trade counter managers.
Bridging the ‘talent gap’
As China’s retail industry continues to grow at pace, its key players 
are facing an ever greater gap between supply and demand for 
talented individuals. In order to attract, motivate, develop and 
retain talented people, B&Q China continues to invest signiﬁ cantly 
in staff training and development. Last year store staff received 
an average of 60 hours’ training each. In addition, 100 employees 
successfully completed Fast Track training and assessment, 
thereby earning promotion to key management positions in the 
company’s 60-plus stores.
Valuing diversity in the workplace
Kingﬁ sher is committed to equality in the workplace, and 
encourages policies on gender, age, disability and race. A good 
example is Castorama France and its policy of integrating disabled 
people into its workforce wherever possible – the number of 
disabled Castorama employees had risen to 412 by the year end.

In 2007 Castorama France 
launched a new televised debate 
with senior management to help 
boost employee engagement. 
Called Vizavi, the debates feature 
a panel of senior management 
who are questioned by staff 
members in the audience. The 
programmes (see photos 
on right) are then screened on 
Castorama’s intranet.
‘Project Conﬁ dence’ training at B&Q UK
Jane Laybourne, from 
B&Q’s Sunderland store, 
is one of more than 2,000 
B&Q UK employees who 
have taken part in B&Q’s 
‘Project Confi dence’ training 
programme. This is a two-
day practical workshop 
to improve their product 
knowledge and boost their 
confi dence in dealing with 
customer enquiries.
She says of the training: 
“It has vastly improved my 
confi dence in talking to 
customers about power tools. 
I fi nd the customers take on 
board what we are saying 
now and have greater trust 
in the advice they are getting. 
It has also helped to pull our 
team closer together – before, 
we didn’t understand each 
other’s level of knowledge 
on power tools, but now we 
can discuss them in a way 
we all understand and are 
comfortable with.”
With training already 
delivered in the décor, 
fl ooring and ceramics, 
and power tools categories, 
the programme will be 
broadened in 2008 to include 
gardening, electrospares, 
hardware, joinery, building 
and showroom.

Sharing ideas and talent around the Group
As an international home 
improvement business 
Kingfi sher is uniquely well-
positioned to share talent and 
ideas across borders, enriching 
the local knowledge base and 
providing personal and career 
development opportunities 
to employees with the drive 
to try something new.
Robert Johnstone (48) spent 
fi ve-and-a-half years at B&Q 
UK in Regional Manager 
roles. He joined Castorama 
Russia in September 2006 
as Operations Director.
He said: “This has been 
a fantastic move for me – a 
chance to experience a new 
retail market and to operate 
at a more strategic level. 
I hope I’ve been able 
to infl uence my Russian 
colleagues in two key areas: 
the fi rst by demonstrating 
the benefi ts of motivating 
employees to do their 
best; the second revolving 
around my belief that 
success in retailing comes 
to those who keep it simple. 
From my own perspective 
I continue to learn every 
day about doing business 
in Russia, and in particular 
the vital importance of 
building strong relationships 
with government and 
other stakeholders.”

Extending our sourcing coverage
Kingfi sher’s direct sourcing 
network is taking on a truly 
global perspective. Our well-
established sourcing offi ces 
in Asia continue to grow and 
are now complemented by 
additional offi ces in Poland 
and, since November 2007, 
São Paulo in Brazil. This 
allows us to extend our 
sourcing coverage deep into 
Eastern Europe and Latin 
America, providing direct 
access to major manufacturers 
around the world. This 
balance in our sourcing 
portfolio gives us a strong 
advantage both in terms 
of fi nding new and unique 
products, and allowing us 
to source at lower cost in 
an infl ationary environment.

Making the most of Kingﬁ sher’s unique competitive advantage
As the leading home improvement retailer in Europe and Asia, with 
operations in nine countries, Kingﬁ sher has a scale and international 
reach which give it unique competitive advantages. But these 
advantages can only be truly realised with the Group’s commercial 
function, its operating companies and its global supplier base 
working closely together.
A year of signiﬁ cant change saw a thorough re-engineering 
of Kingﬁ sher’s international commercial organisation, designed 
to bring it closer to the businesses it supports, deﬁ ne shared 
priorities and launch a series of initiatives that will deliver against 
those priorities.
Progress was made in several key areas, notably direct sourcing, 
developing supplier partnerships, common purchasing and 
reinforcing own-brands.
Direct sourcing continues to drive quality, innovation and value
Kingﬁ sher’s direct sourcing network, which enables Group 
companies to buy goods directly from the manufacturer, offers 
major competitive advantages, not least the ability to secure lower 
prices for our customers. Increasingly, Kingﬁ sher is also using 
direct sourcing to drive quality, innovation and design excellence 
in the products it buys.
Last year, the value of Group purchases made through the direct 
sourcing network increased by 17% to US$821 million (at factory 
prices). Combined, approximately 17 ,000 individual products 
generated 10% of total Group sales revenues.
Growth was particularly strong in the decorative, lighting and 
bathroom categories, as customers recognised great value 
from recently introduced stylish ‘designer’ products which, 
thanks to Kingﬁ sher’s global scale, are priced very competitively.
Coverage of the world’s key product supply markets was extended 
by the opening of a direct sourcing ofﬁ ce in São Paulo, Brazil, 
which provides greater access to the rich natural resources of 
South America, such as FSC certiﬁ ed timber, natural stone and 
ceramics. The new ofﬁ ce joins existing ones in Shanghai, Hong 
Kong, Poland and India, each specialising in distinct product 
areas that, when combined, provide the broad range of options 
demanded by product buyers within Kingﬁ sher’s businesses. 
Also last year Kingﬁ sher held its largest Vendor Conference, 
which brought together around 150 suppliers from Asia, Eastern 
Europe, South America and India to meet with buyers from 
across the Group. The event, held in Shenzhen, China, focused 
on further strengthening existing relationships and working 
together to develop growth opportunities.
Common purchasing programmes
Last year saw the development of common purchasing programmes 
dedicated to key product ranges within categories such as tools, 
light bulbs and wood ﬂ ooring. More than 20 programmes are 
now under way, covering own-brand as well as third-party branded 
products, and more are in the pipeline. 
By bringing product buyers together for joint purchasing trips and 
dedicated networking events, these programmes allow greater 
sharing of ideas and expertise between Kingﬁ sher’s largest 
businesses, as well as boosting the Group’s purchasing power. 
Crucially, they also allow Kingﬁ sher to take the lead in determining 
the design and speciﬁ cations of many products, using the in-house 
design and product benchmarking expertise of B&Q UK and 
Castorama France.
Using quality own-brands to add value and grow market share
Continued progress was made throughout the year to strengthen 
and diversify Kingﬁ sher’s own and exclusive-brand portfolio, notably 
in hand tools, power tools and decorative products. Kingﬁ sher’s 
own-brands in these areas include Performance Power and 
MacAllister power tools and the Colours range of decorative products, 
which includes paint, wallpaper, lighting and soft furnishings. 
Developing strategic supplier partnerships
During the year, negotiations took place with approximately 20 key 
strategic suppliers responsible for a signiﬁ cant proportion of Group 
purchases, aimed at putting in place international contracts that 
will improve purchase terms, facilitate the development of common 
ranges between operating companies and secure exclusive 
products. With much of the groundwork now complete, these 
agreements are due to be ﬁ nalised in the 2008/09 ﬁ nancial year.

A sustainable business
Corporate Responsibility – steps to sustainability
Over the past year Kingﬁ sher has been working with the sustainable 
development charity Forum for the Future to identify sustainability 
opportunities and challenges for the business over the next 10 
years. In order to prepare for these changes, Kingﬁ sher has set 
the ambitious objective of fully integrating sustainability into its 
business thinking. Individual case studies have been included 
in the Operating Review (on pages 8 to 17) and further information 
is available in Kingﬁ sher’s Corporate Responsibility Report and 
on the Kingﬁ sher website. 
Kingﬁ sher has also developed a set of sustainability goals (see 
opposite page). We are working to achieve these goals through our 
Steps to Responsible Growth programme. This sets out speciﬁ c 
actions that Kingﬁ sher’s operating companies must take on 12 key 
social and environmental issues. For each issue, it identiﬁ es three 
levels of progress – ‘minimum action’, ‘policy target’ and ‘leadership 
position’. Most of the operating companies have now met the 
‘minimum action’ level of progress on the 12 issues, with some 
going beyond this on speciﬁ c issues. Kingﬁ sher’s target is for the 
operating companies to meet the ‘policy target’ level by the end of 
January 201 1. The company has also set ﬁ ve-year targets on energy, 
waste and sustainable timber sourcing and additional targets 
will also be set in 2008 in the light of the new sustainability goals.
The company has been ranked highly in a number of recent 
benchmarking studies. For example, it achieved Platinum status 
in the BITC CR Index 2007 and number one position in the UK 
in The Independent newspaper’s guide to the world’s greenest 
companies. Kingﬁ sher also continues to be included in the two 
main socially responsible investment indices – the FTSE4Good 
and Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). 
Sustainable products for consumers
Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of environmental and 
sustainability issues – bringing new opportunities for our businesses 
to develop and market sustainable products and services. 
Marketing campaigns – Kingﬁ sher’s operating companies 
have started a number of high proﬁ le marketing campaigns to 
help customers create more sustainable homes. For example:
B&Q UK is one of the ﬁ rst major businesses to commit to 
One Planet Living – an initiative launched by the environmental 
organisations WWF and BioRegional, which sets out 10 
sustainability principles to ensure people live within the 
resources of this planet. The company is planning to introduce 
One Planet Living products to help customers reduce the impact 
of their homes. See further details on page 10.
Castorama France has continued to work in partnership with 
WWF to promote ‘Partners for the Planet’ products. It has 
produced a 24-page guide for customers ‘Ma Planète c’est ma 
Maison’ (The Planet, It’s My Home). See further details on page 15.
–
–
B&Q China’s Better Homes campaign is ongoing – promoting 
sustainable products to customers through the Better Homes 
logo, catalogue, in-store posters and leaﬂ ets.
Energy efﬁ cient products – To help customers reduce their 
impact on climate change, the business has sourced its own-brand 
range of energy-efﬁ cient light bulbs, which are being rolled out 
across the Group. B&Q UK has run its Energy Efﬁ ciency Made Easy 
campaign for the second year, with TV adverts and a printed ﬂ yer 
on energy efﬁ cient products. Castorama France has introduced 
a series of workshops for customers in stores on energy saving.
Timber – In 2007/08, 71% of reported timber volume sold was 
from proven, well managed forests or recycled. Kingﬁ sher’s target 
is to increase this to 75% by 2010/11 and a timber advisor has been 
recruited to help achieve this.
Chemicals – Operating companies are required to have a 
programme to engage with vendors over the use of chemicals 
of concern by 2010/11. A Steering Group has been set up to 
help prepare for the new EU chemicals legislation, REACH.
Factory working conditions – Kingﬁ sher’s overseas sourcing 
ofﬁ ces audited 433 factories in 2007/08 to assess compliance with 
the Kingﬁ sher Code of Conduct on Factory Working Conditions. In 
addition, a number of Kingﬁ sher operating companies have supplier 
assessment programmes and Kingﬁ sher has developed a Supply 
Chain Toolkit to help ensure a consistent approach across the Group.
Making our own operations sustainable
Climate change – Kingﬁ sher has been working with the Carbon 
Trust to measure and reduce the Group’s carbon footprint. Energy 
efﬁ ciency of stores was 214 kwh/m
2
 in 2007/08. The Group target is 
to achieve a 10% improvement in store energy efﬁ ciency by 2011/12 
(from 2006/07).
Waste – Kingﬁ sher has a target to cut the amount of store waste 
disposed (tonnes per £ of retail sales) by 10% by 2011/12 against 
the 2006/07 baseline.
Diversity – Across the Group, women accounted for 40% of total 
employees and 27% of managers in 2007/08. A Diversity Guidance 
Pack has been produced for Kingﬁ sher operating companies.
Store neighbourhoods – Kingﬁ sher aims to be a good neighbour 
in all the communities it serves. Operating companies support 
a wide range of community and charity projects. See page 35 for 
data on charity contributions.
A more detailed Corporate Responsibility Report for 2007/08 
is available on the Kingﬁ sher website at www.kingﬁ sher.com/cr 
and as a printed summary. The report has been reviewed by 
an independent stakeholder panel and assurance of the data 
conducted by Ernst & Young.

Reporting period
The Group’s ﬁ nancial reporting year ends on the nearest Saturday 
to 31 January. The current year is for the 52 weeks ended 
2 February 2008 with the comparative ﬁ nancial period being 
the 53 weeks ended 3 February 2007. This only impacts the UK 
operations with all of the other operations reporting on a calendar 
basis as a result of local statutory requirements.
The effect of the 53rd week on the results of the Group’s comparative 
period was an increase of £79 million revenue. It has no signiﬁ cant 
impact on operating proﬁ t. So that the results are more readily 
comparable, all of the UK like-for-like analysis has been calculated 
comparing the 52 weeks against 52 weeks last year.
Total reported sales grew 7.9% to £9.4 billion on a reported rate 
basis, and 8.0% on a 52 week constant currency basis. During the 
year, an additional 80* net new stores were added, taking the store 
network to 765 (excluding Turkey JV). On a LFL basis, Group sales 
were up 2.6%.
Operating proﬁ t before exceptional items grew by 0.2% to 
£453 million and fell by 8.8% to £457 million after exceptional items. 
The net interest charge for the year was £62 million, up £11 million 
on the prior year as a result of higher annualised interest rates and 
movements in exchange rates. This was partially offset by an increase 
in net interest return on the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme. 
Adjusted pre-tax proﬁ t fell 2.8% reﬂ ecting challenging trading 
conditions in the UK and China only being partially offset by positive 
performances in France and Poland.
Taxation
The effective rate of tax on proﬁ t has increased from 25% in the 
prior year to 31% reﬂ ecting an increased level of tax on exceptional 
items net of a release of provisions in respect of prior years. The 
effective rate of tax on proﬁ t before exceptional items and excluding 
prior year tax adjustments and the impact of rate changes is 32% 
(2006/07: 32%).
The Group effective tax rate is calculated as follows:
    Proﬁ t  Tax Effective
Effective tax rate calculation 2007/08  £m £m rate
Proﬁ t before tax and tax thereon  395 (123) 31%
Less exceptional proﬁ t and tax thereon (4) 14 
Less prior year adjustment – exceptional  (16) 
Less prior year adjustment – non-exceptional   9 
Less adjustment attributable to rate changes   (9) 
Total   391 (125) 32%
The Group effective rate of tax is affected by the varying tax rates 
in the different jurisdictions in which it operates, the mix of taxable 
proﬁ ts in those jurisdictions, the rules impacting on deductibility 
of certain costs and the non-recognition of tax losses in start-up 
jurisdictions. Whilst the headline tax rates in some of the jurisdictions 
in which we operate are reducing, there is also an increased focus 
on tax as a means of raising revenue for the local economies and 
therefore the tax cost of multinationals is tending to increase over 
time. We will continue to plan our tax affairs efﬁ ciently.
The statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates 
for this ﬁ nancial year and expected rates in the next ﬁ nancial year 
are as follows:
Jurisdiction  Statutory tax rate 2007/08 Statutory tax rate 2008/09
UK  30% 30% – 28%
France  34.43% 34.43%
Poland  19% 19%

Taxation risk management
Kingﬁ sher seeks to organise its tax affairs efﬁ ciently and in a 
way which enhances shareholder value whilst balancing the tax 
risks it faces. Tax risks can arise from change of law, differences 
in interpretation of the law, changes in tax rates and the failure to 
comply with the tax law and associated procedures. The Group 
manages and controls these risks through use of local management, 
its Group tax department and takes appropriate advice from 
reputable professional ﬁ rms. Where disputes arise with the tax 
authorities the Group addresses the areas of dispute promptly 
in a professional, open and constructive manner.
Exceptional items
The Group recorded a £4 million pre-tax exceptional income in the 
year. Net proﬁ ts on property disposals of £39 million and £5 million 
income on previously written off loans have been offset by 
exceptional costs in Asia of £40 million. 
Costs of £13 million have been expensed on the closure of B&Q 
Korea and the Asia head ofﬁ ce, which will close during the ﬁ rst half 
of 2008/09. The Group also sold its B&Q Taiwan 50% stake for 
£50 million recording a gross proﬁ t before goodwill of £27 million 
and net loss on disposal of £5 million. The £32 million goodwill was 
allocated to B&Q Taiwan on the acquisition of Castorama’s minority 
interest in 2002/03. A further £22 million loss has been recorded 
as a result of restructuring the B&Q China business.
In total the B&Q China restructuring is anticipated to cost 
approximately £33 million of which £9 million will be a cash cost.

Dividends
The Board has proposed a ﬁ nal dividend of 3.4p per share, 
making the total dividend for the year 7 .25p per share, down 31.9% 
on the prior year. This dividend is covered 1.6 times by adjusted 
earnings (2006/07: 1.1 times).
The ﬁ nal dividend for the year ended 2 February 2008 will be 
paid on 13 June 2008 to shareholders on the register at close of 
business on 18 April 2008, subject to approval of shareholders at 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting, to be held on 5 June 2008. 
A dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) is available to all shareholders who 
would prefer to invest their dividends in the shares of the Company.
The shares will go ex-dividend on 16 April 2008. For those shareholders 
electing to receive the DRIP the last date for receipt of electing is 
22 May 2008. Dividend cheques and tax vouchers will be posted 
on 11 June 2008. Certiﬁ cates for shareholders electing for the DRIP 
will be posted no later than 26 June 2008.
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) 
ROIC is deﬁ ned as net operating proﬁ t less adjusted taxes (adjusted 
operating proﬁ t excluding property lease and property depreciation 
costs less tax, plus property revaluation increases in the year) 
divided by average invested capital (average net assets less 
ﬁ nancing related balances and pension provisions plus property 
operating lease costs capitalised at the long-term property yield).
Following the transition to IFRS, the Group elected not to revalue 
properties from 1 February 2004. However, property appreciation 
is an integral part of a ROIC measure and therefore Kingﬁ sher 
continues to include revaluation gains and the current market value 
of our properties in ROIC calculations. 
ROIC declined from 8.7% to 6.5%, compared to the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital of 7.6%, up 0.2 percentage points 
on last year primarily due to higher costs of debt.
Underlying ROIC increased from 6.9% to 7.0%. Underlying ROIC 
assumes properties appreciate in value at a steady rate over the 
long-term. When calculating the underlying ROIC, short-term 
variations in property values more or less than the long-term mean 
are excluded.

Annual Report

2007/08
Cashﬂ ow 
The Group generated £465 million of cash from operating 
activities in the year, down £94 million on the prior year. The year 
on year change is mainly as a result of a cash outﬂ ow recorded 
in working capital of £36 million, whereas in 2006/07 a cash inﬂ ow 
of £124 million was recorded. Inventory at £1,873 million was 
£342 million greater than last year reﬂ ecting an increased number 
of stores, extra inventory from the revamp programmes at B&Q UK 
and Castorama France, the effect of exchange rates (£118 million) 
and buying ahead as a result of the timing of Easter. 
Net capital expenditure was £411 million (2006/07: £216 million) 
which has risen year on year as a result of a rise in the level of 
acquisitions within the Group’s portfolio and a reduction of disposals. 
The Group received £50 million net consideration on the sale 
of B&Q Taiwan.
The resulting year end net debt was £1,559 million (2006/07: 
£1,294 million). 
Capital expenditure 
Following the appointment of a new Group Chief Executive the 
capital allocation and approval process has been tightened with 
the aim of prioritising a lower rate of annual capital investment 
towards the highest and fastest returning projects:
The management team will draw up new three year operating 
plans which lead into the budget process for the following year. 
This process drives the key strategic capital allocation decisions 
and the output is reviewed by the Board, twice a year.
The capital expenditure committee will now be chaired by the 
Group Chief Executive and will include the Group Property 
Director as well as the Group Finance Director. It will review all 
projects between £0.75 million and £15.0 million (including the 
capitalised value of lease commitments). Projects above this 
level are approved by the Board although all projects above 
£0.75 million are notiﬁ ed to the Board.
Investment criteria and hurdle rates have been revised with 
more challenging hurdle rates for IRR (Internal Rate of Return) 
and payback and the introduction of a new target for year three 
returns versus initial cash investment.
An annual post-investment review process will continue to 
review the performance of all projects above £0.75 million 
which were completed in the prior year. The ﬁ ndings of this 
exercise will be considered by both the new Retail Board 
and the main Board and directly inﬂ uence the assumptions 
for similar project proposals going forward.
Gross capital expenditure (excluding business acquisitions) for 
the Group was £528 million (2006/07: £467 million). £227 million 
was spent on property (2006/07: £220 million) and £301 million 
on ﬁ xtures, ﬁ ttings and intangibles (2006/07: £247 million). A total 
of £117 million (2006/07: £251 million) of proceeds from disposals 
were received during the year, £115 million of which came from 
property disposals.

Payments to acquire businesses in the year amounted to 
£1 million (2006/07: £2 million) which related to the purchase 
of minorities in China. 
Financing
At the year end, the Group had undrawn committed bank 
facilities available of £675 million. The Group has no signiﬁ cant 
debt maturities until 2010. The maturity proﬁ le of Kingﬁ sher plc’s 
debt and ﬁ nancing arrangement is illustrated at:
www.kingﬁ sher.com/investors/debtinvestors/debtmaturity
Kingﬁ sher aims to smooth the maturity proﬁ le of its debt by 
issuing debt with different maturities and by utilising committed 
bank revolving credit facilities to provide additional liquidity.
In March 2007 , the Group obtained new committed revolving 
credit facilities totalling £275 million with a number of banks and 
a £25 million committed term bank loan facility. These facilities 
mature in March 2010 and are available to be drawn to support 
the general corporate purposes of the Group. In July 2007 , the 
Group extended the maturity of its £500 million syndicated bank 
revolving credit facility by one year, such that it now matures in 
August 2012.
The terms of the US Private Placement note agreement and 
the committed bank facilities require that the ratio of operating 
proﬁ t to net interest payable must be no less than 3:1. The Group 
comfortably complied with this covenant. The interest rates paid 
by the Group under these ﬁ nancing arrangements are based on 
LIBOR plus a margin. The margins are ﬁ xed and are not subject 
to change in line with credit ratings.

Kingﬁ sher 
Annual Report

2007/08
Financial risk management
Kingﬁ sher’s treasury function has primary responsibility for 
managing certain ﬁ nancial risks to which the Group is exposed, 
details of which are provided in note 25 of the accounts.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
so that it can continue to provide returns for its shareholders 
and beneﬁ ts for its other stakeholders; and
To maintain a balance between the higher returns that may arise 
from a higher level of borrowings and the advantages of a strong 
credit proﬁ le.
The Group manages its capital by:
Making an assessment of the return on invested capital;
Monitoring the impact on the Group’s net debt; and
Reviewing the level of dividends.
The Group is subject to certain externally imposed capital 
requirements as follows:
Kingﬁ sher Insurance Limited and Kingﬁ sher Reinsurance 
Limited, wholly owned subsidiaries, are subject to minimum 
capital requirements as a consequence of their insurance 
activities.
Certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of B&Q (China) B.V., 
a wholly owned subsidiary, are subject to minimum capital 
requirements under Chinese statute.
The Group complied with the externally imposed capital 
requirements during the year.
Property 
The values are based on valuations performed by external 
qualiﬁ ed valuers where the key assumption is the estimated yields. 
The average income yields used were 6.3% in the UK (2006/07: 
5.5%), 6.5% in France and Italy (2006/07: 6.7%), 6.9% in Poland 
(2006/07: 6.8%) and 7.7% in China (2006/07: 7.7%).
During the year the Group disposed of properties for cash 
consideration of £115 million including £73 million on the sale 
of its national distribution centre in Worksop, which it retained 
the right to lease for 24 years. This is consistent with the 
Group’s policy of recycling property when economically 
attractive. The proceeds of the transaction were used to 
repay existing debt and to invest in Kingﬁ sher’s worldwide store 
opening programme, including further freehold acquisitions.
The Group owns a signiﬁ cant property portfolio, most of which 
is used for trading purposes. If the Group had continued to 
revalue this it would have had a market value of £3.6 billion at 
year end, compared to the net book value of £2.7 billion recorded 
in the ﬁ nancial statements. This represents a £386 million 
increase against the prior year and a £76 million increase on 
a constant currency basis.

Pensions
The Group holds a net pension surplus of £77 million in relation 
to deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension arrangements including an asset of 
£110 million in relation to its UK Scheme. In 2006/07 the Group 
held a deﬁ cit of £55 million. This increase was as a result of 
additional payments to the UK pension scheme (£101 million 
was paid compared to a normal contribution of around £45 million 
per annum) and increases in the discount rate used to calculate 
the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation from 5.3% to 6.2% as a result of 
increases to corporate bond rates over the year. This was partly 
offset by an increase in the inﬂ ation rate assumption from 2.9% 
to 3.3% and changed mortality rates. The mortality change 
increased the obligation by approximately £34 million and ensures 
that these assumptions remain in line with current market best 
estimates. Further disclosures of the assumptions used (including 
mortality assumptions) are provided in note 27 of the consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements. 
It is worth noting that the pension valuation is dependent on a 
number of assumptions which although they have been applied 
consistently and sensibly, may change, which could have a 
signiﬁ cant effect on the overall surplus.

Kingﬁ sher 
Annual Report

2007/08
Risks
The Board considers risk assessment, identiﬁ cation of mitigating 
actions and internal control to be fundamental to achieving 
Kingﬁ sher’s strategic objectives. The Corporate Governance report 
on pages 37 to 41 describes the systems and processes through 
which the directors manage and mitigate risks. The Board 
considers that the principal risks to achieving its objectives are 
set out below. The Board recognises that the nature and scope 
of risks can change and so regularly reviews the risks faced by 
the Group as well as the systems and processes to mitigate them.
Economic conditions 
The economy is a major inﬂ uence on consumer spending. 
The current economic outlook, particularly with regards to trends 
in employment, inﬂ ation, taxation, consumer debt levels and interest 
rates, is likely to impact consumer demand for discretionary 
spending on the home and places our business plans and 
forecasts at risk. Whilst predicting future trends is very difﬁ cult, 
Kingﬁ sher reﬂ ects the latest independently-sourced estimates 
in its internal plans.
International expansion not only provides opportunities for 
sustainable growth and returns but also economic diversiﬁ cation. 
The UK now accounts for less than half of Group sales and 
the international element will continue to grow at a faster pace. 
This year, Kingﬁ sher accelerated the rate of investment into 
Russia to take full and timely advantage of this exciting and 
fast-growing economy. 
New and emerging markets
Given current global economic conditions and liquidity constraints 
there is a risk that we will be unable to exploit new opportunities 
for entering new and emerging markets. We remain, however, 
committed to developing our existing investments, particularly 
in Russia and China.
These markets, which offer opportunities for long-term sustainable 
growth with superior returns, will continue to present challenges 
in terms of managing cultural and political nuances and risks. 
We will continue our policy of identifying and recruiting strong 
local management teams, who understand the local culture, 
market and risks, and, in some cases, collaborating with joint 
venture partners to mitigate country speciﬁ c risks. 
Kingﬁ sher also provides guidance, policies and procedures 
to ensure that new investments and initiatives are subject to 
an appropriate level of due diligence and probity and are supported 
by a robust process of economic and business appraisal. 
Where issues do arise, the Group acts quickly to address them 
and learn from the experience.
Health & Safety
With over 85,000 employees and six million customers 
visiting Kingﬁ sher stores each week there is always a risk 
of accidents involving either customers or staff and, as a result, 
robust health and safety systems are a priority. While regulatory 
requirements vary from country to country, each operating 
company is required to designate a director with speciﬁ c 
responsibility for health and safety, who is then responsible 
for ensuring that a written health and safety policy is communicated 
to all staff, that appropriate health and safety arrangements 
are in place to protect our employees and that we comply with 
local regulatory requirements. The ultimate responsibility within 
each operating company remains with the unit head.
Kingﬁ sher Head Ofﬁ ce is responsible for facilitating the sharing 
of best practice and the development of minimum Group 
standards, which in some cases will be higher than local 
regulatory requirements and has this year validated progress 
through independent third party veriﬁ cation.
Attracting and retaining the best people
Retail is fundamentally a people business and the ability to attract, 
recruit and retain quality staff is a risk in a highly competitive labour 
market. We continue to invest in our people, ensuring that we 
recruit and retain the right calibre of staff with the skills, experience 
and talent to grow the business. We have introduced appropriate 
management development programmes to ensure that we assess, 
manage and develop our people’s leadership skills, talents and 
experiences from the Board down.
Strategy effectiveness
In retail, change remains the only constant and we continually 
seek to identify, and anticipate the risks regarding our assumptions 
and understanding of consumer trends and respond to our 
customers’ demands for goods and services. In order to ensure 
that our strategies meet both current and future customer needs, 
each individual operating company is responsible for implementing 
the necessary processes and procedures to monitor the efﬁ ciency, 
economy and effectiveness of the delivery of its strategic plans. 
Similarly, corporate planning processes are in place to ensure that 
our businesses’ strategies are aligned and contribute to delivering 
sustainable shareholder value.

Investment opportunities
Investment in the business is fundamental to achieving Kingﬁ sher’s 
aim of providing shareholders with sustainable returns. Despite 
difﬁ cult economic conditions and concerns regarding prospects 
for consumer spending throughout 2008, we remain committed to 
our modernisation programmes at B&Q UK and Castorama France. 
We also continue to invest in our growth UK and international 
businesses. These businesses continue to deliver sustainable 
growth as well as offering opportunities for economic diversiﬁ cation 
and offsetting tough trading conditions in our developed markets.
Kingﬁ sher will continue to review the balance of risk between 
its ability to generate sufﬁ cient cash to maintain its investment 
programme, paying a dividend to shareholders and maintaining 
a healthy balance sheet in the face of the pressures created by 
the global “credit crunch” and its associated impact on global 
liquidity and cash markets. 
Kingﬁ sher has also sought to maximise its ﬁ nancial resources 
through ongoing reviews of its business portfolio, for example the 
sale of the joint venture in Taiwan and the closure of South Korea, 
and will continue to initiate programmes to reduce current working 
capital in order to free up funds to ﬁ nance investment opportunities.
Group synergies
In ever increasingly competitive and cost-sensitive consumer 
markets it is imperative that we are able to drive efﬁ ciency and 
promote innovation through the effective leveraging of our Group 
structure and by taking advantage of the potential economies 
of scale created by the breadth and range of our operations.
This year has seen the continued development of the beneﬁ ts 
derived from Group Commercial, particularly with regards to 
an increased emphasis on both direct sourcing and collaborative 
product initiatives, particularly between our two biggest 
businesses, B&Q UK and Castorama France. 
Similarly, the creation of Kingﬁ sher Information Technology Services 
is driving greater efﬁ ciency and beneﬁ ts of scale for our information 
technology architectures, hardware and capabilities.
The careful management of formats such as Brico Dépôt, Screwﬁ x 
and Trade Depot, which complement our more developed 
businesses, will also continue to drive enhanced overall value 
for the Kingﬁ sher Group as a whole.
Business continuity
A crisis can come in many different forms and there is a risk that 
either a single catastrophic loss or a cumulative series of failures 
will impact our ability to trade or have a major impact on our 
reputation. Crisis management programmes are established 
throughout the business and clear communication strategies 
are in place in order to manage any major crisis.
Our level of crisis readiness is subject to review by both internal 
and external audit as directed by both local audit committees 
and the Kingﬁ sher Audit Committee. We are also supported 
by a comprehensive risk ﬁ nancing programme to ensure we 
are appropriately insured.
Corporate responsibility
Kingﬁ sher is committed to promoting both ethically sound and 
sustainable business ethics and practices in addition to promoting 
products to help our customers make choices regarding their 
contribution to creating a more sustainable environment. 
This commitment is based on an understanding of the risks, 
to both our brand and our customers’ expectations, of not operating 
in an ethical manner and is supported by a long-term and 
demonstrable investment in promoting ethics, social responsibility 
and environmental sustainability, supported by a clear policy 
and framework which sets consistent and measurable targets 
and standards for all of our operating companies. 
We also engage with key Non-Governmental Organisations and 
industry forums (e.g. Forum for the Future, FTSE4Good, Business 
in the Community) to ensure that we are at the forefront of the 
environmental debate and assume a leadership position amongst 
our peers. For more details see pages 24 and 25.
Regulatory
The geographic and cultural diversity of the markets in which 
we operate exposes us to wide-ranging and complex legal 
and regulatory risks. Individual operating companies, supported 
where necessary by Group Governance & Corporate Services, 
are responsible for ensuring that they have access to adequate 
and sufﬁ cient legal and governance resource. 
Operational management is also responsible for liaising with 
either local legal resources or Group Governance & Corporate 
Services to resolve any potential issues arising from new legislation 
or any suspected breaches of existing legislation and practices.
Where new operating companies are either acquired or created, 
formal Group-deﬁ ned governance structures are established 
from the outset and, at a minimum provide guidance regarding 
local capital expenditure sign-off, Board, and Audit Committee 
processes and procedures, the implementation of which are subject 
to a review by the Director of Governance as well as Internal Audit.

Directors’ report
The directors are pleased to present their report for the ﬁ nancial 
year ended 2 February 2008.
Principal activities and developments in the year
Kingﬁ sher is an international home improvement business 
operating in markets that ﬁ t strategic criteria of attractive scale, 
structure and economics. Operating principally through its main 
retail brands B&Q, Castorama, Brico Dépôt and Screwﬁ x, 
Kingﬁ sher operates in nine countries across Europe and Asia 
and is market leader in ﬁ ve countries. This continues to give 
the Group an excellent platform for growth in all of its markets. 
In addition, Kingﬁ sher has property interests in the countries 
in which it operates, which are primarily managed through the 
relevant retail business. 
A review of the business, providing a comprehensive analysis 
of the main trends and factors likely to affect the development, 
performance and position of the business, including environmental, 
employee and social and community issues, together with the 
Group’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the business and 
which should be treated as forming part of this report by reference 
is detailed on pages 2 to 31 as follows:
Kingﬁ sher at a glance (page 2), KPIs (pages 4 and 5), review of the 
business and progress, including the Operating review (pages 8 
to 17), and an overview of markets, Group talent development, the 
Group sourcing programme and corporate responsibility (pages 18 
to 25), Financial Review (pages 26 to 29) and risks (pages 30 and 31).
In total, 85 net new stores (excluding discontinued operations) 
were opened in the year, taking the Group’s total to 780.
In the UK, B&Q continued its modernisation programme, with 
38 larger stores now trading in the new format. 60% of its product 
ranges were updated during the year. Screwﬁ x continued the 
expansion of its trade counters nationwide, taking the number 
of branches from 38 to 93.
In August 2007 Kingﬁ sher agreed to sell its freehold interest in 
B&Q’s distribution centre in Worksop, Nottinghamshire for a total 
of £73m. The sale gave rise to a pre-tax exceptional gain of £40m. 
In France, 42% of Castorama’s selling space is now trading in the 
new format and Brico Dépôt opened eight stores during the year.
On 4 January 2008 Kingﬁ sher sold its 50% joint venture stake 
in B&Q Taiwan to its joint venture partner, Test Rite International.
In South Korea where the Group’s two trial stores were making 
progress, opening sufﬁ cient stores to achieve economic scale in a 
reasonable timeframe appeared unlikely. Accordingly, the business 
was closed during the year.
In Russia, Castorama continued to make good progress with two

Results and dividends
The proﬁ t before taxation of the Group amounted to £395m (2006/07: 
£450m) with a proﬁ t after taxation of £272m (2006/07: £338m).
During the year, the market value of the Group’s land and buildings

16 November 2007. The directors recommend a ﬁ nal dividend 
of 3.4p (2006/07: 6.8p) per ordinary share amounting to £80m 
(2006/07: £159m) to be paid on 13 June 2008 to those 
shareholders whose names are on the register of members 
at the close of business on 18 April 2008, making a total for 
the year of 7.25p (2006/07: 10.65p) per ordinary share amounting 
to £170m (2006/07: £249m). The ex-dividend date will be 
16 April 2008. Dividend cheques and tax vouchers will be posted 
on 11 June 2008. 
The Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) is available to all shareholders 
who would prefer to invest their dividends in the shares of the 
Company. If shareholders wish to elect for the DRIP for the ﬁ nal 
dividend and have not already done so, a letter or completed 
DRIP mandate form must be received by the Company’s Registrars 
by 22 May 2008. Certiﬁ cates for shareholders electing for the DRIP 
will be posted by no later than 26 June 2008. Further details of the 
DRIP and an application form are available from the Company’s 
Registrars whose details can be found on page 104.
Directors
Details of the directors of the Company are shown on page 32, 
and in the Corporate Governance Report on page 37.
John Nelson stepped down from his role as Deputy Chairman 
at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) in 2007 but remained 
as Senior Independent Director. Gerry Murphy stepped down from 
his role as Group Chief Executive on 2 February 2008. Ian Cheshire 
was appointed Group Chief Executive on 28 January 2008.
Re-election of directors
The Articles of Association require one third of the directors who 
are subject to retirement by rotation to retire and submit themselves 
for re-election at the AGM each year and, in any event, at least 
once every three years. Accordingly, Ian Cheshire and Hartmut 
Krämer retire by rotation and are offering themselves for re-election. 
Having served for over 10 years as a non-executive director, and 
in accordance with the Combined Code, Michael Hepher is also 
retiring and offers himself for re-election. He has taken this step 
to provide continuity of Board membership as Kingﬁ sher’s new 
Group Chief Executive takes ofﬁ ce. The Board continues to believe 
that the two non-executive directors standing for re-election 
are independent, and that they make an effective and valuable 
contribution to the Board, demonstrating continued commitment 
to the role. In Mr Hepher’s case, his independence is assured 
through his continued application of his breadth of experience 
in a manner that provides challenge within a supportive context. 
He maintains strong principles, acting as the conscience of 
shareholders as well as an ambassador for the business.
Neither of the non-executive directors standing for re-election 
has a service contract with the Company.

Duncan Tatton-Brown    83,845 57,688
Between 2 February 2008 and 26 March 2008 there was no change 
in the relevant interests of the directors.
As at 26 March 2008 no person who was then a director had any 
interest in any derivative or other ﬁ nancial instrument relating to the 
Company’s shares and, so far as the Company is aware, none of 
their connected persons had any relevant interest.
The directors’ interests in options over shares of the Company as 
at 2 February 2008 are shown within the Remuneration report on 
pages 42 to 52.
Deeds of indemnity 
As at the date of this report, indemnities that are ‘qualifying third 
party indemnity provisions’ for the purposes of the Companies 
Act 2006 are in force under which the Company has agreed to 
indemnify the directors, to the extent permitted by law, in respect 
of all losses arising out of, or in connection with, the execution 
of their powers, duties and responsibilities, as directors of the 
Company or any of its subsidiaries. Such indemnities were also in 
force in respect of each person who was a director of the Company 
at any time during the ﬁ nancial year ended 2 February 2008.
Going concern
The directors conﬁ rm that, after reviewing expenditure commitments, 
expected cash ﬂ ows and borrowing facilities, they have a reasonable 
expectation that Kingﬁ sher has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
these accounts.
Employee involvement 
The Board continues to emphasise high standards of customer 
care and service in each operating company. The commitment 
of employees to this principle is vital, and each operating company 
has developed channels of communication to help people to 
expand their knowledge of, and involvement with, Kingﬁ sher.
These channels include engagement surveys, brieﬁ ng groups, 
internal magazines and newsletters that report on business 
performance and objectives, community involvement and other 
issues. Kingﬁ sher’s intranet systems are also used to 
communicate results announcements to employees throughout 
the Group and to distribute information about other important 
business developments.
Directors and senior management regularly visit stores and discuss 
with employees matters of current interest and concern.
To supplement existing communication within each business, 
the Kingﬁ sher European Forum was established in 2003. 
The Forum provides information and consultation with employee 
representatives from Kingﬁ sher’s businesses in EU countries on 
speciﬁ ed trans-national business issues affecting those countries.
We are committed to, and focused on, the development of 
our people and have identiﬁ ed a talent population across the 
organisation in whom we will invest signiﬁ cantly to further the 
capability of our leaders, both now and in the future. We are 
committed with passion and energy to the challenges we face 
across our business and strive for excellence in our leadership.
The use of in-house and specialist training programmes as well 
as links with the general educational sector, reinforces Kingﬁ sher’s 
commitment to employee involvement and development. Employees 
are also represented on the trustee board of Kingﬁ sher’s UK 
pension arrangements.
All UK employees (as well as those in Ireland and Hong Kong) are 
entitled to participate in Kingﬁ sher’s long-standing Savings-Related 
Share Option Scheme (ShareSave), regardless of number of hours 
worked, provided they meet certain service conditions. In addition, 
save-as-you-earn plans, not linked directly to the purchase of 
Kingﬁ sher shares, operate in other countries along similar lines to 
the UK scheme, taking account of local tax and legal requirements.
Respect for the diversity of people
Kingﬁ sher is committed to treating its employees and customers 
with dignity and respect, and to valuing diversity. 
Kingﬁ sher strives to create an environment that respects, welcomes 
and enables employees to reach their full potential for their own 
beneﬁ t and that of the Company. 
It is Kingﬁ sher’s policy to:
Ensure there is no discrimination in employment on the grounds 
of race, gender, age, disability, marital status, sexual orientation 
or religious belief; 
Implement measures in stores to ensure a level of customer 
service for disabled people equivalent to that offered to non-
disabled people; and 
Maintain a mechanism which customers and employees 
can use to give feedback on our performance and ensure 
that all customer comments are analysed, responded to 
and acted upon.
Kingﬁ sher sets speciﬁ c standards on diversity across the Group 
through its social and environmental programme ‘Steps to 
Responsible Growth’ (see page 24). Guidance has been developed 
for Kingﬁ sher’s subsidiaries to help them understand diversity and 
to ensure they meet the standards required within Steps. Diversity

data is published in the Corporate Responsibility Report, available 
on the website www.kingﬁ sher.com/CR
Charitable donations 
Kingﬁ sher and its subsidiaries made contributions to charity/
community projects worth an estimated £1.5m in the ﬁ nancial 
year ended 2 February 2008 – equivalent to 0.4% of pre-tax 
proﬁ ts. This included cash donations (£0.3m) and gifts-in-kind 
(£1.0m – retail cost). Support was also given through the donation 
of time by employees (£0.2m). 
Supplier payment policy
The Company does not impose standard payment terms on its 
suppliers but agrees speciﬁ c terms with each of them, and then 
pays in accordance with those terms. The Company is a holding 
company and therefore has no trade creditors.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each person who is a director at the date of approval of this report 
conﬁ rms that: so far as he or she is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; 
and each director has taken all the steps that he or she ought 
to have taken as a director to make him or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information. This conﬁ rmation is given 
and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions 
of Section 234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
Takeover directive
Pursuant to Section 992 of the Companies Act 2006, which 
implements the EU Takeovers Directive the Company is required to 
disclose certain additional information. Such disclosures, which are 
not covered elsewhere in this Annual Report, include the following:
Signiﬁ cant agreements – change of control
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, 
such as bank loan agreements, Eurobond documentation, private 
placement debt and employees’ share plans. None of these are 
deemed to be signiﬁ cant in terms of their potential impact on the 
business of the Group as a whole except for the following: 
The £500m credit facility dated 15 March 2005 between, the 
Company, HSBC Bank plc (as the facility agent) and the banks 
named therein as lenders, contains a provision such that in the 
event of a change of control, any lender may, if they so require, 
notify the agent that they wish to cancel their commitment 
whereupon the commitment of that lender will be cancelled 
and all their outstanding loans, together with accrued interest, 
will become immediately due and payable;
The $466.5m US Private Placement notes, issued pursuant to a 
note purchase agreement dated 24 May 2006 by the Company 
to various institutions, contains a provision such that in the event 
of a change of control, the Company is required to make an offer 
to the holders of the US Private Placement notes to prepay the 
principal amount of the notes together with interest accrued;
The €550m Medium Term Notes (MTNs), issued on 23 
November 2005 under the Group’s €2,500m MTN programme 
by the Company to various institutions, contains an option such 
that in the event of a change of control and as a result of the 
–
–
–
change of control the Company’s credit rating is downgraded 
below investment grade (BBB-, or equivalent or better) any 
holder of the MTNs may require the Company to prepay the 
principal amount of that note together with interest accrued.
A change of control will be deemed to have occurred if any person 
or persons acting in concert (as deﬁ ned in the City Code on 
Takeovers and Mergers) at any time is/are or become(s) interested 
in more than 50% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company or shares in the capital of the Company carrying more 
than 50% of the voting rights normally exercisable at a general 
meeting of the Company.
Share capital and control
Details of the Company’s issued share capital are set out on page 
99. All of the Company’s issued ordinary shares are fully paid up 
and rank equally in all respects.
The ordinary shares are listed on the Ofﬁ cial List and traded on 
the London Stock Exchange and are also listed on the Paris 
Bourse in France. In addition, the Company has entered into 
a level I American Depositary Receipt programme with the Bank 
of New York Mellon, under which the Company’s shares are 
traded on the over-the-counter market in the form of American 
Depositary shares.
During the year ended 2 February 2008, options were exercised 
pursuant to the Company’s share option schemes, resulting in 
the allotment of 1,789,548 new ordinary shares. No new ordinary 
shares have been allotted under these schemes since the end 
of the ﬁ nancial year to the date of this report.
Rights attaching to shares
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares, in addition to those conferred on their holders by law, are 
set out in the Company’s Articles of Association (“the Articles”), 
copies of which can be obtained from Companies House in the 
UK or by writing to the Company Secretary.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s 
reports and accounts, to attend and speak at general meetings 
of the Company, to appoint proxies and to exercise voting rights.
Transfers of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares or 
on the exercise of voting rights attached to them, except (i) where 
the Company has exercised its right to suspend their voting rights 
or to prohibit their transfer following the omission of their holder 
or any person interested in them to provide the Company with 
information requested by it in accordance with Part 22 of the 
Companies Act 2006 or (ii) where their holder is precluded from 
exercising voting rights by the FSA’s listing rules or the City Code 
on Takeovers and Mergers.
Purchase of own shares
At the AGM on 31 May 2007 , shareholders approved a resolution 
for the Company to make purchases of its own shares to a maximum 
number of 235,920,341 ordinary shares. This resolution remains 
valid until the conclusion of this year’s AGM. As at 2 February 2008 
the directors had not used this authority. It is Kingﬁ sher’s present

intention to cancel any shares acquired under such authority, 
unless purchased to satisfy outstanding awards under employee 
share incentive plans. A resolution will be proposed at this year’s 
AGM to renew this authority.
Issue of shares
At the 2007 AGM shareholders approved a resolution to give 
the directors authority to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal 
value of £104,267,996. In addition, shareholders approved a 
resolution giving the directors a limited power to allot shares for 
cash other than pro rata to existing shareholders. These resolutions 
remain valid until the conclusion of this year’s AGM. Resolutions 
will be proposed at this year’s AGM to renew these authorities. 
The directors have no present intention to issue ordinary shares, 
other than pursuant to employee share schemes and pursuant 
to the DRIP .
Further explanation of the resolutions is included with the notice 
of the meeting circulated to shareholders with this report.

of directors are contained in the Articles and accord with usual 
English company law provisions. The powers of the directors 
are determined by UK legislation and the Memorandum and 
Articles of Association of the Company in force from time to time.
New Articles of Association
Changes to the Articles must be approved by the shareholders 
passing a special resolution. A resolution will be put to this year’s 
AGM to adopt new Articles with effect from 1 October 2008, 
primarily as a result of changes to English company law introduced 
by the Companies Act 2006. An explanation of the main changes 
proposed to be made to the Articles is included with the notice 
of the meeting circulated to shareholders with this report.

Corporate Governance report
Combined Code statement
Kingﬁ sher is committed to maintaining the highest standards 
of corporate governance. The Board endorses the principles set 
out in the Combined Code 2006, and throughout the year ended 
2 February 2008 the Company has complied in full with the 
requirements of the Code. 
Board of Directors
The role of the Board is to determine the Group’s strategy and provide 
appropriate leadership. It oversees management’s implementation 
of the strategy and acts as a sounding board for senior executives. 
It also provides a critical overview of strategic risks and monitors the 
adequacy of the Group’s control environment.
The matters which are reserved to the Board and the authorities 
delegated to management are contained within Matters Reserved 
for the Board (available at www.kingﬁ sher.com) as well as within 
various policies covering such matters as treasury management, 
capital expenditure approvals, legal matters and internal audit. 
The policies referred to above and the system of internal controls 
are also supported by Kingﬁ sher’s Code of Conduct. The Code 
of Conduct is available to all employees in their own language 
and, to the extent possible, forms part of the employees’ contract 
of employment.
Kingﬁ sher’s Board currently comprises the Chairman, Deputy 
Chairman, ﬁ ve other independent non-executive directors, the 
Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director. John 
Nelson stepped down from his role as Deputy Chairman at 
the AGM in 2007 but remained as Senior Independent Director. 
Gerry Murphy stepped down from his role as Group Chief 
Executive on 2 February 2008. Ian Cheshire was appointed 
as Group Chief Executive on 28 January 2008. 
Having regard to the Combined Code, and the output from the 
Board evaluation process, the Board believes all the non-executive 
directors to be independent, including Michael Hepher, 
notwithstanding the fact that he has served for more than 
10 years as a director. Michael Hepher has offered himself for 
re-election at the AGM this year to provide continuity of Board 
membership as Kingﬁ sher’s new Group Chief Executive takes 
ofﬁ ce. The Board sets out its reasons for determining his 
continued independence on page 33.
There is a clear and documented division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive, which 
is available at www.kingﬁ sher.com. 
The non-executive directors share responsibility for the 
execution of the Board’s duties and are actively involved in 
the development of the Company’s strategy. They are also 
required to provide advice to the Group Chief Executive to 
ensure that individual business decisions conform to agreed 
strategies and policies, and where they sit on a relevant 
committee, to scrutinise performance and assess risks 
and the integrity of ﬁ nancial information and controls, and to 
ensure appropriate remuneration and succession planning 
for executive directors.
All directors are provided with, and have full and timely access 
to, information that enables them to make informed decisions 
on corporate and business issues, including operational and 
ﬁ nancial performance, risk management and business plans. 
In particular, the Board receives monthly information on the 
performance and results of the Group and the individual 
operating businesses.
In addition to the schedule of matters reserved for itself, the 
Board has delegated certain matters to a number of standing 
committees with deﬁ ned terms of reference, which are published 
on the Company’s website at www.kingﬁ sher.com. The Board 
members’ length of service and their committee membership 
is shown in the following table:

2007/08
The directors’ biographies, which can be found on page 32, 
illustrate the directors’ range of experience, which is intended 
to provide an effective Board to lead and control Kingﬁ sher. 
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of 
three years.
On appointment, each director receives a tailored induction 
programme which includes:
Individual time with the Chairman, the Group Chief Executive, the 
Group Finance Director and other senior corporate executives;
Visits to Group and competitors’ stores;
Meetings with management of the operating businesses; and
External training courses at the Company’s expense, if required.
External training at the Company’s expense is available on an 
ongoing basis and the Board visits and meets with a number of 
operating companies and their management teams each year. In 
addition, ad-hoc update training is provided on appropriate matters.
Comprehensive Directors & Ofﬁ cers liability insurance is provided 
by a reputable insurer covering all past, present and future director 
and ofﬁ cer appointments. Cover is in respect of any actual or 
–

alleged breach of duty, breach of trust, neglect, error, misleading 
statement, omission, breach of warranty or authority or other act.
The Board regards independent performance evaluation as an 
important part of monitoring and improving its effectiveness. This 
year a further evaluation of the Board and its Committees was 
undertaken using bespoke board evaluation software from Evalu8 
Limited, a board evaluation and corporate governance compliance 
consultant, and the output and implications for improvement were 
considered by the whole Board. As a result, a speciﬁ c programme 
of actions has been agreed to enhance Board agenda planning 
and to deliver more focused summary information to directors in 
addition to that already provided.
Each year the results of the Board evaluation are used by the 
Chairman for assessing the individual performance of directors 
and inform the Nomination Committee’s assessment of the skills 
required by any new non-executive directors.
The attendance record of individual directors at Board and 
Committee meetings is detailed below. In addition the non-executive 
directors meet separately, once each year, without the Chairman.

Annual Report
and Accounts
2007/08
Non-attendance at Board and Committee meetings is rare, 
usually when either an unexpected commitment arises, or, for 
newly appointed directors, there is a prior clash with a meeting 
which had been timetabled and could not be rearranged. 
Directors are generally provided with the papers for Board and 
Committee meetings a week in advance and directors who are 
unable to attend provide comments and feedback to either the 
Chairman, the Chairman of the relevant Committee or the 
Company Secretary, who ensure those comments and views 
are raised at the meeting. Additional Board meetings are also 
held to approve quarterly ﬁ nancial reports and preliminary 
statements at the half and year end.
Details of the Audit and Nomination Committees are provided 
in the individual reports of those Committees on page 53. 
The details of the Remuneration Committee are in the 
Remuneration report on pages 42 to 52.
The Executive Committee formally comprises the executive 
directors of the Company. In addition, members of the senior 
management team attend the meetings. The Committee’s 
terms of reference can be found at www.kingﬁ sher.com. 
The Committee provides an effective method of ensuring 
the active participation of senior operational management in 
understanding the key issues facing Kingﬁ sher, as a UK listed 
company. The Committee’s responsibilities in relation to risk 
management and internal control, and corporate responsibility, 
are set out below and on pages 40 and 41.
Company Secretary
On 27 July 2007 Nick Folland was appointed as Company 
Secretary and Director of Governance and Corporate Services 
and Helen Jones resigned. All directors have access to, and 
the services of, the Company Secretary and may also take 
independent professional advice at Kingﬁ sher’s expense.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to all of the Board 
Committees.
The Company Secretary is also responsible for facilitating the 
induction and professional development of Board members 
as well as ensuring good information ﬂ ows within the Board, 
its committees and between the non-executive directors and 
senior management.

Kingﬁ sher is committed to an active dialogue with its shareholders 
through a planned programme of investor relations. This activity 
is a key component of its corporate communications programme 
and is headed by the Group Communications Director, Ian Harding.
Shareholders also receive Annual and Interim Reports and the investors’ 
section of Kingﬁ sher’s website (www.kingﬁ sher.com/investors) includes 
copies of all these, all trading updates, press announcements and 
presentations to shareholders.
This year’s investor relations programme included formal 
presentations of full year and interim results, conference calls 
to discuss quarterly trading statements on three other occasions 
during the year, and regular meetings between institutional 
investors and senior management.
The Board believes that there are sufﬁ cient opportunities for 
the necessary dialogue with shareholders and the Board. 
Apart from the consultation noted above, these include regular 
meetings between investors and management, the availability 
of all the non-executive directors for meetings if so requested by 
the shareholders and a standing invitation for the non-executive 
directors to attend any of the major presentations by management 
to shareholders. The Senior Independent Director, John Nelson, 
is available to shareholders if there are concerns that cannot 
be resolved through normal channels of communication.
The Board receives regular reports concerning institutional 
shareholder meetings and their issues and concerns. This process 
and reporting allows the directors to develop the necessary 
understanding of the views of the shareholders and also enables 
the Board to judge whether the investors have a sufﬁ cient 
understanding of the Company’s objectives.
Both institutional and private shareholders are welcome at the 
AGM, which includes a presentation on the Group’s business by 
the Group Chief Executive. The AGM also provides an opportunity 
for shareholders to discuss with executive and non-executive 
directors any issues concerning the Company and its activities.
Auditor independence 
Kingﬁ sher’s rules and authorisation processes for the instruction 
of the auditors for non-audit work were reviewed and updated in 
2005 and details can be found at www.kingﬁ sher.com. The auditors 
are precluded from engaging in non-audit services that would 
compromise their independence or violate any laws or regulations 
affecting their appointment as auditors. Approval of the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee is required prior to awarding contracts for 
non-audit services to the external auditors in excess of a speciﬁ ed 
amount. The external auditors report to the Audit Committee 
annually on their independence from the Company. Periodic 
rotation of key partners is also required.
Each of the Group’s businesses are consulted on the effectiveness 
and independence of the Auditors annually. In addition, the Auditors 
provide the Audit Committee with a schedule of each matter on 
which there was an initial difference between them and management 
in relation to the accounting treatment, with the advice (if needed) of 
the ﬁ rm’s technical committee, and with the ﬁ nal decisions on these 
issues. The Audit Committee considers whether the audit should 
go out to tender but has taken the view that partner rotation at both 
the Group and operating business level has been sufﬁ cient to 
maintain the necessary independence.
Accountability, risk management and internal control
The Board considers risk assessment, identiﬁ cation of mitigating 
actions and internal control to be fundamental to achieving Kingﬁ sher’s 
strategic corporate objectives.
This system of internal control is:
The Board’s overall responsibility;
Regularly, and at least annually, reviewed for its effectiveness 
by both the Board and the Audit Committee;
In compliance with the Turnbull guidance 2005; and
Supported by Kingﬁ sher’s policies in such areas as code 
of conduct, legal and secretarial, ﬁ nance and treasury.

However, such a system is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and 
can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The key elements of the internal control process are summarised 
below:
The Board, which: 
Has approved a set of policies, procedures and frameworks 
for effective internal control, including, the provision of quality 
internal and external reporting and compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations, which are periodically reviewed and updated;
Regularly reviews and updates the Group’s strategy and those 
of its operating companies;
Reviews and assesses Kingﬁ sher’s key risks at least annually; 
Reviews performance through a comprehensive system 
of reporting, based on an annual budget with monthly business 
reviews against actual results, analysis of variances, key 
performance indicators and regular forecasting;
Has well deﬁ ned policies governing appraisal and approval 
of capital expenditure and treasury operations;
Seeks assurance that effective control is being maintained 
through regular reports from the Audit Committee and various 
independent monitoring functions.
The Audit Committee which, in respect of the Group: 
Monitors the integrity of the ﬁ nancial statements and any formal 
announcements relating to ﬁ nancial performance;
Reviews and evaluates the internal ﬁ nancial risk, and other internal 
controls and their associated systems; 
Monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the internal audit function;
Considers and reviews the reports from the external auditors 
on the principal reporting issues faced by the Group.
The Executive Committee which, in respect of the Group: 
Reviews and makes recommendations to the Board, where 
appropriate, regarding:
–  The strategic and business plans of individual businesses 
and the strategic choices of the Group;
–  The annual budget and capital expenditure proposals 
for the Group;
–  Management development and senior executive 
succession plans.
Oversees and reviews the Group’s corporate responsibility 
programme and operating companies’ individual progress; 
with the Group Chief Executive reporting to the Board at least 
annually on issues, progress and recommendations for change.
Approves or, where appropriate, recommends to the Board 
any acquisitions or disposals of companies, businesses or 
signiﬁ cant assets;
Reviews periodically as necessary the communications 
messages to the investor community for effectiveness and 
relevance. It also ensures any issues regarding strategy and 
performance that the investor community are expressing are fully 
understood, that these are communicated appropriately to the 
Board and actions are taken to address any legitimate concerns;

of ﬁ nancing documents within the Committee’s terms of 
reference and authority limits; and
Allots new shares in the Company to employees following the 
exercise of share options in schemes approved by the Board 
and shareholders.
The business head of each operating company/business area who: 
Maintains systems that continually identify and evaluate 
signiﬁ cant risks affecting their strategies and that apply to their 
areas of the business;
Has responsibility for identiﬁ cation and evaluation of signiﬁ cant 
risks to their business area, together with the design of 
mitigating controls;

systems through an operating company audit committee 
and reports from internal and external audit functions;
Has responsibility for and ensures the effective functioning 
of their operating company audit committee;
Self-certiﬁ es that internal control processes are in place and 
that they comply with Group policies; and
Supported by their operating company audit committee, reports 
on any control weaknesses or breakdowns that could be 
material to the Group.
The Internal Audit and Risk Management function which:
Works with the operating companies to develop, improve 
and embed risk management tools and processes into their 
business operations;
Oversees the operation of the individual operating businesses’ 
audit committees;
Ensures that business risks are identiﬁ ed, managed and 
regularly reviewed at all levels of the Group and that directors 
are periodically appraised of the key risks in accordance with 
the Turnbull guidance;
Provides the Board with objective assurance on the control 
environment across the Group;
Monitors adherence to the Group’s key policies and principles; and
Provides the Group Audit Committee with necessary 
assurances on the control environment.
Whilst management at each operating business has responsibility 
for the identiﬁ cation and evaluation of signiﬁ cant risks applicable 
to their business and any mitigating actions to be taken through 
the Executive Committee, Group executive management reviews, 
identiﬁ es and evaluates the risks which are signiﬁ cant at a Group 
level as well as the mitigating actions against those risks. These are 
then considered by the Board after review by the Audit Committee. 
The type of risks identiﬁ ed include strategic risk, external factors 
(such as competition, environment and regulation), change 
management programmes, health and safety, retention of key 
management and macro market risks. The Internal Audit plans are 
designed to address the controls and actions in relation to each 
business’s signiﬁ cant identiﬁ ed risks.

The directors conﬁ rm they have reviewed the effectiveness of 
this system of internal control, that any necessary action has been 
or is being taken to remedy any signiﬁ cant failings or weaknesses 
identiﬁ ed from the review and that it accords with the guidance 
of the Turnbull Committee on internal control.
Environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
The Executive Committee oversees corporate responsibility 
including environment, social and governance matters and its 
terms of reference can be found on the website www.kingﬁ sher.com. 
The Board recognises the importance of ESG matters and 
receives information concerning any risks that may be posed 
regarding such matters from the Group Chief Executive and the 
Executive Committee. The Board formally reviews corporate 
responsibility progress on an annual basis.
Kingﬁ sher has developed a Corporate Responsibility Risk Register, 
to deliver a common approach to the way risks are identiﬁ ed 
and managed across the Group. An initial set of risks has been 
identiﬁ ed and is being ﬁ nalised following a trial of the register 
with Koçta¸ s in January 2008. The register is designed to be used 
by Kingﬁ sher’s operating companies to help them identify their own 
speciﬁ c risks, including the magnitude and probability of occurrence 
and the range of mitigating controls in place to minimise the potential 
impacts of the risks. Following evaluation and review, further 
guidance is being developed for use by all Kingﬁ sher’s subsidiaries.
Key ESG matters are managed through Kingﬁ sher’s Corporate 
Responsibility Policy and Steps to Responsible Growth programme 
(see page 24). In addition, Kingﬁ sher has a Code of Conduct for 
Ethical Business practice which provides guidance on governance 
issues. Non-compliance with the Code can result in disciplinary 
action for employees or termination of contract for vendors 
and contractors.
Kingﬁ sher is working to identify sustainability opportunities and 
challenges for the business over the next ten years. In order to 
prepare for these changes, the Company has set the ambitious 
objective to fully integrate sustainability into its business thinking 
and has also developed a set of sustainability goals (see page 25). 
Kingﬁ sher is working to achieve these goals through its Steps 
to Responsible Growth programme. 
An overview of progress on corporate responsibility can be 
found on page 24. A more detailed Corporate Responsibility 
Report is available on the website www.kingﬁ sher.com/CR.
Directors’ responsibility for preparing ﬁ nancial statements
The following statement is made with a view to distinguishing 
for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the directors 
and the auditors in relation to the ﬁ nancial statements.
The directors are required by company law to prepare ﬁ nancial 
statements for each ﬁ nancial year which give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and Group as at the end of 
the ﬁ nancial year and of the proﬁ t for the year to that date. Under 
that law the directors have prepared the Group ﬁ nancial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS’s) as adopted by the European Union, and the parent 
company ﬁ nancial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). In preparing the ﬁ nancial statements the 
directors are required to:
Ensure that the Company keeps accounting records which 
disclose with reasonable accuracy the ﬁ nancial position of the 
Company and which enable them to ensure that the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and that the parent company 
ﬁ nancial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 1985;
Take such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Company and Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities;
Apply suitable accounting policies in a consistent manner and 
supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and 
estimates where necessary;
Comply with applicable accounting standards (except where 
any departures from this requirement are explained in the notes 
to the ﬁ nancial statements); and
Ensure the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. 
Information published on the internet is accessible in many 
countries with different legal requirements. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
ﬁ nancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Kingﬁ sher 
Annual Report
and Accounts
2007/08
This report to shareholders provides information on the remuneration 
and share interests of all Kingﬁ sher directors and has been prepared 
in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and 
the applicable Listing Rules.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the broad policy 
governing senior executives’ pay and remuneration. It sets the 
actual levels of all elements of the remuneration of all executive 
directors of the Company and for certain senior operating 
executives. The Committee also oversees the administration of 
Kingﬁ sher’s employee share schemes and determines the level 
of fees for the Chairman of the Board. The Committee’s terms 
of reference are available at www.kingﬁ sher.com.
The Committee aims to ensure that senior executives (including 
executive directors of the Company) are rewarded for their contribution 
to Kingﬁ sher and are motivated to enhance returns to shareholders. 
It advises the Board on the remuneration framework and policy for 
such senior executives and, once formally endorsed by the full 
Board, it applies the policy.
The Committee members are John Nelson (Chairman), Michael 
Hepher and Janis Kong, all independent non-executive directors. 
Since the year-end Peter Jackson, who was independent on initial 
appointment as Company Chairman, also became a member 
of the Committee on 20 March 2008. The Group Chief Executive 
is invited to attend meetings of the Committee but not when his 
own arrangements are considered. The Committee met six times 
during the year.
The Committee consults with shareholders to ensure their views 
are understood and taken into account in the work of the Committee, 
particularly in relation to changes in Kingﬁ sher employee share 
scheme arrangements and wider trends in executive remuneration.
Advice
During the year the Committee sought the advice of Kingﬁ sher’s 
Group Human Resources Director, Tony Williams, and was supported 
by the Company Secretary; Nick Folland from 27 July 2007 and, 
prior to that, Helen Jones. The Committee has also appointed the 
following external advisers:
Hewitt New Bridge Street (HNBS) provides advice on the 
ongoing operation of employee and executive share plans 
together with advice on executive remuneration; and
Allen & Overy LLP provides legal advice to the Committee on 
service and employment contracts and for other employment 
and remuneration issues in relation to executive directors and 
senior executives. Allen & Overy LLP also advises the Company 
separately on other legal matters; and
Watson Wyatt provides advice and benchmarking on the 
market competitiveness of remuneration for executives in the 
UK and overseas.

Information subject to audit
The following sections, on pages 42 to 52, of the Remuneration 
report are audited:
‘Components of executive directors’ remuneration – Annual 
bonus and long-term incentives, including the (‘PSP’)’ – the 
summary of performance criteria upon which the vesting of 
performance shares are conditional; 
‘Executive directors’ remuneration overview’; 
Kingﬁ sher Incentive Scheme ‘(‘KIS’) Share Awards’;
‘Performance Share Awards’;
‘ShareSave Option Scheme’; 
‘Closed incentive plans’ – except for compliance with guidelines 
on dilution limits; 
‘Directors’ pension beneﬁ ts’; and 
‘Non-executive directors’ remuneration table and notes.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
The Committee intends that executive director remuneration should 
be competitive by reference to the experience of the executive 
concerned, the role fulﬁ lled, internal relativities and the markets in 
which the Company competes. This is designed to promote 
business success through the recruitment, retention and motivation 
of the highest quality executives.
Executives are eligible for annual bonus awards under the KIS 
Cash and KIS Shares schemes and separately receive annual 
awards of Performance Shares under the Performance Share 
Plan (‘PSP’). The Committee believes that this structure is weighted 
towards the achievement of stretching, individually targeted annual 
bonus measures, but also aligns the interests of executives with 
those of shareholders through a continued emphasis on equity 
based incentives which also provide a better ‘lock-in’ of key 
executives. During the year, the Committee reviewed the Group 
Chief Executive’s maximum bonus opportunity as well as annual 
award levels under the PSP for executive directors. The results of 
this review are described below. Following resultant changes the 
Committee is satisﬁ ed that there is an appropriate balance between 
the different elements of pay (including the split between ﬁ xed and 
variable pay).
Gerry Murphy stood down as Group Chief Executive of Kingﬁ sher 
plc on 2 February 2008. Under the terms of his service agreement, 
termination payments are staged and subject to a requirement for 
him to mitigate in respect of his future earnings. The agreement 
provided for Mr Murphy to receive a monthly payment equal to 
15% of annual salary for up to 12 months. Payments reduce if he 
commences lower paid employment during the 12 month period 
and cease immediately if he commences employment providing 
the same or higher value remuneration. In addition, he continues 
to receive a supplement at a reduced rate of 30% of monthly salary 
above the Pension Scheme Cap over the same period. From 
1 March 2008 Gerry Murphy’s monthly payment has been reduced 
as a result of him being paid a salary by The Blackstone Group.

Annual Report

2007/08
In addition, unvested awards under Kingﬁ sher’s long-term incentive 
arrangements at the date of termination of his appointment lapsed 
although Multiplier awards (see below) will vest on their respective 
vesting dates, subject to the satisfaction of the applicable 
performance condition and subject to the time pro-rating formula 
set out in the rules of the Kingﬁ sher Incentive Scheme.
Following the termination of Gerry Murphy’s service agreements 
the Board, through its Nomination Committee, conducted a 
rigorous search and selection process with the assistance of 
specialist recruitment consultants, which identiﬁ ed Ian Cheshire 
as the most suitable candidate for the role of Group Chief 
Executive. His remuneration was the result of an extensive review 
carried out by the Committee with the assistance of HNBS.
A key consideration when determining Ian Cheshire’s package 
was the Committee’s desire that a signiﬁ cant proportion of the 
package should be performance related and that the incentives 
should support Kingﬁ sher’s primary objective of a recovery in 
the Group’s performance.
Future annual bonus objectives will be focused on key strategic 
goals rather than solely on the annual budget and indicative targets 
will be pre-set for the next four years and conﬁ rmed annually. 
Given the current outlook for the retail market generally, the 
performance parameters for Ian Cheshire and Duncan Tatton-
Brown for 2008/2009 will be focused on key strategic goals. 
For the long-term incentive element, the Committee has decided 
that the current TSR-based plan should largely continue and an 
award under the plan has been made to Ian Cheshire to coincide 
with his appointment as Group Chief Executive. However, as an 
encouragement for him to make a direct purchase of shares, a 
supplemental earnings per share (‘EPS’) based recruitment award 
has been made which only rewards superior EPS growth. As a 
result of his acquiring and holding at least 266,667 shares, he has 
been awarded 1,114,206 shares which will vest in four years on the 
basis of signiﬁ cant growth in proﬁ tability. Ian Cheshire acquired 
268,924 shares on 1 February 2008. Consensus analyst forecasts 
for this coming year (2008/09) indicate no growth (or a decrease) 
in EPS but, if the year were broadly in line with current estimates 
of the prior year (2007/08) just ﬁ nished, then the annual growth 
required in adjusted EPS for the subsequent three years would be 
between c.12% and c.20% per annum. In proﬁ t before tax terms 
this would reﬂ ect a range of approximately £560m to £690m which 
is felt to be appropriate but challenging in light of internal business 
plans. The performance conditions set by the Committee are 
outlined under the paragraph headed ‘The PSP’. 
Components of executive directors’ remuneration
Salaries and beneﬁ ts
Salaries are reviewed annually in August, taking into account 
market conditions, affordability, the level of increases awarded 
to staff generally and the individual’s contribution. In addition, 
the Company provides a range of additional beneﬁ ts, including 
life and medical insurance, membership of a Company pension 
scheme, a subsidised staff canteen, a staff discount card, 30 working 
days holiday per year and a company car or cash allowance.
With effect from 1 August 2007 , Gerry Murphy, Ian Cheshire and 
Duncan Tatton-Brown were all awarded base salary increases of 
3% per annum.
Upon Ian Cheshire’s appointment as Group Chief Executive, 
effective 28 January 2008, his salary was increased to £800,000.
The current annual base salaries of the executive directors as at 
26 March 2008 are:
Ian Cheshire £800,000
Duncan Tatton-Brown £453,200
Annual bonus and long term incentives 
Annual bonuses are awarded under the KIS. The KIS comprises 
the Kingﬁ sher Annual Cash Incentive Scheme 2003 (KIS Cash 
scheme) and the Kingﬁ sher Incentive Share Scheme 2003 (KIS 
Shares scheme). Under these arrangements senior executives 
may receive a performance-related cash bonus under the KIS 
Cash scheme and a contingent share award under the KIS Shares 
scheme equal to half the value (at the time of award) of the cash 
bonus. The contingent share award must normally be held for three 
years before it vests, with the shares being normally subject to 
forfeiture should the executive leave Kingﬁ sher during the three-
year deferral period as a result of voluntary resignation or dismissal 
for cause. Contingent share awards awarded from April 2007 , in 
line with ABI best practice, receive a dividend roll-up on vesting 
calculated on the basis of a notional purchase of shares on each 
relevant ex-dividend date using that day’s closing mid-market price.
Substantial awards under the KIS Cash scheme and the KIS Shares 
scheme are only payable to executives on achievement of the 
performance targets agreed by the Committee at the beginning 
of each year, based on Kingﬁ sher’s strategic and ﬁ nancial planning 
process and the economic and competitive environment in which 
the Company and its principal businesses operate. 
In respect of the ﬁ nancial year ended 2 February 2008, the 
key performance parameters for Gerry Murphy and Duncan 
Tatton-Brown were:
1. Group return on invested capital;
2. Group cash generation;
3. Group proﬁ t after tax; and
4. Individual targets.
For Ian Cheshire, 25% of his bonus focused on Group proﬁ t 
after tax with 75% being targeted in respect of B&Q UK’s 
performance on:
1. Return on invested capital;
2. Cash generation; and
3. Individual targets.
The overall bonuses earned were below on-target levels. The return 
on invested capital target was not achieved, the cash generation 
target at Group was met but not for B&Q and the proﬁ t after tax 
measure was partially met. The individual objectives set for the 
executive directors, which principally related to speciﬁ c measures 
regarding the B&Q development programme, were partially met.

2007/08
Remuneration report
Following the review undertaken to determine Ian Cheshire’s 
remuneration as Group Chief Executive, the Committee has 
decided that the maximum bonus payable under the Kingﬁ sher 
Incentive Scheme (“KIS”) will be increased from 150% of salary 
(100% of salary in cash and 50% of salary in deferred forfeitable 
shares) to 200% of salary (133% in cash and 67% in deferred 
forfeitable shares). The indicative annual targets to be set for 
the next four years tie in with the growth assumptions explained 
earlier so the concept of an on-target bonus becomes redundant 
and, in future, an on-target bonus will not be disclosed. However, 
the level of growth required to achieve signiﬁ cant bonuses will be 
materially higher than was the case in previous years.
Maximum vesting under the KIS and PSP result in up to 
approximately 75% of total remuneration being performance-
related, an approach the Committee believes is appropriate for 
Kingﬁ sher as a dynamic international retailer.
If an executive does not work for Kingﬁ sher throughout the whole 
of a ﬁ nancial year, the Committee has the discretion to determine 
the appropriate level of payment under the KIS Cash scheme for 
that year. Where Kingﬁ sher terminates an executive’s contract 
except for cause, or on retirement, then, reﬂ ecting the fact there 
will be no entitlement to awards under the KIS Shares scheme, the 
executive may receive a cash replacement of the equivalent value 
of the KIS Shares scheme award, pro rata for the period of the 
ﬁ nancial year employed, subject to the discretion of the Committee 
to decide the appropriate level of such bonus.
The PSP
Under the PSP provisional awards of Performance Shares have 
been granted to selected senior executives at six-monthly intervals 
following the publication of the annual and half yearly results. 
Awards were made on 11 April and 1 October 2007.
As part of the terms of his recruitment, awards were made to Ian 
Cheshire on 1 February in respect of his current year (2008/2009) 
allocations under the plan and therefore no further awards will be 
made to him during the ﬁ nancial year.
Previously the Committee has operated an annual limit on awards 
under the PSP of 125% of salary, although the plan rules allow for 
awards of up to 200% of salary to be made in normal circumstances. 
Going forward, and for the award made on Ian Cheshire’s 
appointment, in order to bring long-term incentive provision into 
line with median practice in other FTSE 100 companies and other 
retailers of a similar size, the annual limit is likely to be increased 
to 200% of salary with the performance measures made 
correspondingly more demanding as follows. 
Performance Shares will normally vest three years from the award 
date, provided that the executive is still employed by the Group and 
Kingﬁ sher’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance is above 
median for the FTSE 100 during the three year performance period. 
No vesting will occur at or below median performance. 
In order for any of an award of shares subject to the TSR 
performance condition to vest, the Company’s TSR must be at 
least 1 percentage point above the median over the relevant three 
year period (at which level of performance 15.625% of this award 
will vest) and in order for all of this award to vest it must increase 
by at least 1 percentage point above the upper quintile. Previous 
awards vested at 1 percentage point above the upper quartile. 
15.625% will vest at threshold as this preserves the same percentage 
of salary vesting at threshold based on an increase in the normal 
award level from 125% to 200% of salary.
In addition, awards will only vest to the extent that the Committee is 
satisﬁ ed that the Company’s TSR over the period is reﬂ ective of the 
underlying ﬁ nancial performance of the Company.
  Percentage this part of the 
  award of performance shares 
TSR at the end of the Performance Period under an award that will vest
Less than median plus 1 percentage point Nil
Median plus 1 percentage point  15.625%
Between median plus 1 percentage point  Straight-line vesting 
and upper quintile plus 1 percentage point between 15.625% 
  and 100%
Upper quintile plus 1 percentage point 100%
TSR was selected as the most appropriate performance 
measure for the PSP as it is robust, aligns executives’ interests 
with those of shareholders and is generally favoured by the 
Company’s major shareholders. The FTSE 100 was chosen as 
the comparator group because there is a general lack of directly 
quoted home improvement businesses against which to compare 
the Company’s TSR speciﬁ cally and because major shareholders, 
when consulted previously, indicated their preference for the 
chosen comparator group. HNBS independently carries out 
the relevant TSR calculations for the Committee. 
Performance Shares also receive a dividend roll-up calculated 
on the basis of a notional purchase of shares on each relevant 
ex-dividend date using that day’s closing mid-market price. Shares 
used to satisfy awards under a plan are normally purchased in the 
market via an employee beneﬁ t trust.
The Committee intends to carry out a wider review of long-term 
incentive provision during 2008 although it has concluded that 
the award to the Group Finance Director to be made in 2008 
should be over shares then worth 200% of salary with 50% 
subject to the TSR condition outlined above in respect of the 
award to Ian Cheshire and the other 50% subject to the same 
EPS conditions as are summarised below in respect of the special 
award to Ian Cheshire.
As part of the terms of his recruitment, the Committee offered 
Ian Cheshire the opportunity to purchase 266,667 shares in 
the Company and in return receive a matching award of 200% 
of salary (i.e. broadly a 4:1 match; although the actual purchase 
was 268,924 shares at 148p and the matching award price was 
based on a share price of 143.6p, being the three day average 
share price prior to grant). The matching award was granted 
pursuant to the exemption from the need for prior shareholder 
approval contained in Listing Rule 9.4.2. The matching award 
is non-pensionable and non-transferable (other than on death). 
This award has been linked to challenging performance conditions 
linked to the Group’s recovery (see page 45) and also required

Ian Cheshire to make a signiﬁ cant personal investment in Kingﬁ sher 
shares upfront. The Committee conﬁ rms that the matching award 
was felt to be necessary to facilitate Ian Cheshire’s recruitment as 
Group Chief Executive. 
The one-off award to Ian Cheshire is subject to the following 
performance condition:
The award will vest four years after grant subject to the extent 
to which demanding performance conditions based on growth 
in the Company’s adjusted EPS measured over four years have 
been achieved. The award is subject to the retention of the 
shares purchased on 1 February 2008 and will lapse pro rata 
to the extent of any disposal.
The performance condition for this award will be as follows:
  Percentage this part of the 
  award of performance shares  
EPS at the end of the Performance Period  under an award that will vest
Less than 15.9p  Nil
15.9p  15.625%
Between 15.9p and 17.0p Straight-line vesting 
  between 15.625% – 50%
17.0p  50%
Between 17.0p and 19.6p Straight-line vesting 
  between 50% – 100%
19.6p  100%
The Committee may in its absolute discretion amend the range 
of EPS targets set out in the table above to take account of:
any material change in the retail prices index over the 
Performance Period;
any change to, or event that affects, the structure or business 
of the Kingﬁ sher group;
any other material change in circumstances.
Any such amendment will be disclosed in the relevant Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
The Committee may also vary the performance condition if 
an event has occurred which causes it to consider that it would 
be appropriate, provided the Committee considers the varied 
condition to be fair and reasonable and not materially less 
challenging than the original condition would have been but for 
the event in question.
The award is subject to substantially the same terms that apply 
to awards granted under the PSP . In particular:
As a general rule, the award will lapse upon Ian Cheshire ceasing 
to hold employment or be a director within the Kingﬁ sher group. 
However, if he ceases to be an employee or a director because 
of his death, ill-health, injury, disability, retirement, redundancy or 
in other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, then his 
award will vest on the date when it would have vested if he had not 
ceased such employment or ofﬁ ce. The extent to which the award 
will vest in these situations will depend upon two factors: (i) the 
extent to which the performance condition has been satisﬁ ed; and 
(ii) the pro-rating of the award to reﬂ ect the reduced period of time 
–
–
–
between its grant and vesting, although the Committee can decide 
not to pro-rate the award if it regards it as inappropriate in the 
particular circumstances. 
If Ian Cheshire ceases to be an employee or director of any 
company in the Group for one of the good leaver reasons speciﬁ ed 
above, the Committee can decide that his award will vest when 
he leaves, subject to: (i) the performance condition being measured 
at that time; and (ii) pro-rating by reference to the time of cessation 
as described above. 
In the event of a takeover or winding up of the Company (not 
being an internal corporate reorganisation) the award will vest early 
subject to: (i) the extent that the performance condition has been 
satisﬁ ed at that time; and (ii) the pro-rating of the award to reﬂ ect 
the reduced period of time between its grant and vesting, although 
the Committee can decide not to pro-rate the award if it regards 
it as inappropriate to do so in the particular circumstances. 
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, the award 
will be replaced by an equivalent new award over shares in a 
new holding company unless the Committee decides that the 
award should vest on the basis which would apply in the case 
of a takeover.
If a demerger, special dividend or other similar event is proposed 
which, in the opinion of the Committee, would affect the market 
price of shares to a material extent, then the Committee may 
decide that the award will vest on the basis which would apply 
in the case of a takeover as described above.
The Award will not confer any shareholder rights until shares have 
been acquired on the exercise of the award. 
In the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital or in 
the event of a demerger, payment of a special dividend or similar 
event which materially affects the market price of the shares, the 
Committee may make such adjustment as it considers appropriate 
to the number of shares subject to the award. 
The Committee may, at any time, amend the agreement in any 
respect, provided that the prior approval of shareholders is 
obtained for any amendments that are to the advantage of Ian 
Cheshire in respect of the rules governing the basis for determining 
Ian Cheshire’s entitlement to, and the terms of, the shares or cash 
to be acquired and the adjustment of the award.
The requirement to obtain the prior approval of shareholders will 
not, however, apply to any minor alteration made to beneﬁ t the 
administration of the agreement, to take account of a change in 
legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control 
or regulatory treatment for Ian Cheshire or for any company in the 
Group. Shareholder approval will also not be required for any 
amendment to the performance condition.
A copy of the Performance Share Award agreement dated 
1 February 2008 will be available for inspection prior to and for 
at least 15 minutes before and during the AGM.

Other long-term incentive plans
Apart from the ShareSave Option Scheme, all other option and 
incentive arrangements have been discontinued, but awards made 
under these schemes in previous years will vest over time, in 
accordance with the rules governing the various plans. The details 
are shown in the section entitled Closed Incentive Plans on pages 
49 and 50. 
Share Ownership Guidelines 
The Committee has established formal share ownership guidelines 
which prohibit executive directors selling shares obtained through 
the KIS Shares scheme and long-term incentive plans including the 
PSP (except to meet tax obligations) until they hold shares costing 
or worth at least one times base salary (two times for the Group 
Chief Executive). The Committee believes that this will provide a 
longer-term retention mechanism and mean that, over time, executives 
will have a signiﬁ cant personal interest in Kingﬁ sher shares. 
The Committee believes these arrangements align executives’ 
and shareholders’ interests effectively and encourage a long-term 
view of performance. 
Executive directors’ service contracts
All executive directors and UK senior executives have service 
contracts terminable by no more than 12 months’ notice by either 
side, with no different arrangements applying in the event of 
termination following a change of control. For senior executives 
not employed from the UK, the same principles apply, but there 
are local laws and regulations which mean it is possible that, 
subject to length of service and reasons for termination, more 
than 12 months’ notice has to be given. Details of the executive 
directors’ contracts are summarised below.
The contracts for all executive directors provide that termination 
payments would be paid on a phased basis at a monthly rate 
of 15% of annual salary for a maximum of 12 months from the 
termination date. Lower amounts are payable if the director 
commences lower paid employment during the 12 month period, 
and payments cease immediately when employment providing 
the same or higher value remuneration is started.
To reﬂ ect the arrangements entered into on his appointment, 
Gerry Murphy continues to receive for the same period a 
monthly pension contribution or Scheme Cap supplement at 
a reduced rate of 30% of his monthly salary above the Scheme 
Cap (see Pension provision below).

Kingﬁ sher allows each executive director (and senior executives), 
to accept and hold one non-executive role outside the Group. 
The following fees for acting as non-executive directors of companies 
not part of the Kingﬁ sher Group were earned and retained by the 
relevant individual during 2007/08:
Ian Cheshire £48,000
Duncan Tatton-Brown £50,000
Gerry Murphy £70,000
Pension provision
Ian Cheshire and Duncan Tatton-Brown are members of the 
main deﬁ ned beneﬁ t funded arrangement, the Kingﬁ sher Pension 
Scheme, which was closed to new employees of the Group on 
1 April 2004, and which provides a pension on retirement at 
normal retirement at age 65 of 1/60th of base salary up to the 
Earnings Cap for each year of pensionable service. In the event 
of death during employment, dependants would receive a pension 
and a lump sum from the Scheme (relating to the employee’s 
contributions during the period of membership) and life insurance 
equal to four times the amount of base salary up to the Earnings 
Cap. On leaving the employment of the Group before retirement, 
members would become entitled to a deferred pension.
In addition to the Scheme beneﬁ ts, Gerry Murphy, pursuant to his 
service agreement, received a pension supplement of 40% of his 
earnings above the Scheme Cap. 
During the year the Committee conducted a review of the pension 
provision offered to the executive directors, as a result of which 
provision above the Scheme Cap for Ian Cheshire and Duncan 
Tatton-Brown was increased so that it now comprises a 7.5% cash 
supplement together with a 12.5% Company contribution directly 
to any of the funds available through the Kingﬁ sher pension 
arrangements. For the six month period, August 2007 to January 
2008, executive directors have received the following additional 
company contributions to pensions. Ian Cheshire received £21,275 
and Duncan Tatton-Brown received £21,275.
Going forward the salary supplement will be phased out over the 
next three years, reducing Duncan Tatton-Brown’s cash supplement 
by 2.5% each year and increasing the Company contribution by 
2.5% each year until such time as Duncan Tatton-Brown receives 
a 20% Company contribution to pension fund only, with no cash.
Following his appointment as Group Chief Executive, Ian 
Cheshire receives a 30% Company contribution, but no longer 
any cash supplement.

 Total beneﬁ ts include cash payments representing Scheme Cap Supplements of £325,432 for Gerry Murphy, £29,200 for Ian Cheshire and £29,198 for Duncan Tatton-Brown; 
non-cash beneﬁ ts comprised medical, life and permanent health insurance; Ian Cheshire received a cash allowance in lieu of a company car until his appointment as Group 
Chief Executive. Upon his appointment, his cash allowance was increased by the difference in the car allowance for an executive director and the Group Chief Executive. 
He now receives a company car and also receives a cash payment as he has not taken full entitlement of his allowance for his car.

 The maximum sum due in respect of Gerry Murphy’s basic salary compensation will be £1.7m and the maximum payment due in respect of the reduced pension supplement 
will be an additional £248,000; each being paid monthly and subject to mitigation.
KIS Share Awards 
Once the contingent share award is made in respect of the bonus earned, the only qualifying condition for the award normally to vest is 
to be in the employment of the Company at the vesting date. In respect of bonuses paid in 2004, 2005 and 2006, an additional Multiplier 
Award of shares was potentially receivable by certain executive directors – details of these are shown under Closed Incentive Plans on 
page 50. Following the introduction of the PSP, no further Multiplier Awards have been granted.

 As disclosed in last year’s Remuneration Report these awards under the KIS Shares scheme were made on 11 April 2007 , in respect of the ﬁ nancial year ended 3 February 2007. 
These awards are structured as nominal cost options (on payment in aggregate of a maximum of £1). They will normally vest in April 2010 and will be exercisable within the 
period of six months starting from the vesting date. 
Awards of contingent shares, in respect of the ﬁ nancial year ended 2 February 2008, are due to be made on 21 April 2008, vesting in 
April 2011, to Ian Cheshire and Duncan Tatton-Brown under the KIS Shares scheme to the value of £26,739 and £56,499, respectively, 
at the average mid-market price over the three dealing days, 16, 17 , and 18 April 2008. As the awards will be made after publication of 
the results for the ﬁ nancial year ended 2 February 2008, the detail will be disclosed fully in next year’s Annual Report.

 In accordance with the terms of his appointment, the Committee offered Ian Cheshire the opportunity to purchase 266,667 shares in the Company and in return receive a 
matching award of 200% of salary (i.e. broadly a 4:1 match although he bought 268,924 shares at 148p) subject to performance conditions and his continuing to hold the 
purchased shares. The value of the matching award was £1,600,000 as of the date of his appointment. Awards were granted on 1 February 2008 at a share price of 143.6p.

 No Matching Shares vest unless EPS at the end of the four year performance period is greater than 15.9p, at which level of performance 15.625% of the award will vest. The 
percentage vesting increases on a pro rata basis so that 50% of the Matching Shares vest if EPS is 17.0p. Full vesting occurs if EPS is 19.6p at the end of the performance 
period with pro rata vesting between 17.0p and 19.6p.

 If Ian Cheshire’s employment terminates before any vesting date by reason of death, injury, ill health, early termination by Kingﬁ sher (other than for cause) or resignation 
for ‘good reason’ (as deﬁ ned in his service contract), then subject to the discretion of the Committee in certain limited circumstances, such of the Matching Shares as can 
be treated as vested will vest, taking into account EPS performance up to the date of cessation of his employment, but reduced on a time pro-rated basis.

The last grants under the Executive Share Option Scheme were made on 17 April 2003. Other than those granted to Gerry Murphy 
which have lapsed, the options vest from three to 10 years of the grant date subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition which 
generally requires the growth in the Company’s Earnings Per Share (EPS) over a three-year period to have exceeded that of the Retail 
Price Index (RPI) plus 6%. The criteria were set and approved by shareholders when the scheme was established in 1993 and were 
judged at the time to be appropriate criteria.

Multiplier Awards relating to prior year KIS Share Awards
Bonuses paid under the KIS Shares scheme in April 2004 (in respect of Gerry Murphy only as he did not receive the normal grant of options 
in April 2003), 2005 and 2006 were matched at a ratio of 0.4:1 by a conditional Multiplier Award of shares. Vesting of these awards is subject 
to the TSR performance of the Company against the constituents of the FTSE 100 over the three-year period following the year for which 
the bonus was earned. No vesting will occur at or below median performance. At above median performance, 25% of these shares vest, 
increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% at above upper quartile performance. In addition, the Committee must also be satisﬁ ed that the 
TSR performance is reﬂ ective of underlying Company performance for such awards to vest.

 Since the end of the ﬁ nancial year ended 3 February 2007 the TSR performance has been calculated in respect of the potential Multiplier Award vesting in April 2007 and median 
performance was not achieved accordingly, this Multiplier Award did not vest and therefore lapsed.

Remuneration policy for non-executive directors 
The Board determines the fees paid to non-executive directors under a policy which seeks to recognise the time commitment, 
responsibility and technical skills required to make a valuable contribution to an effective Board. During 2007 the basic non-executive 
director’s fee was increased from £50,000 to £51,500 per annum with effect from 1 August 2007. No additional fees are paid for 
membership of committees. The fee paid for chairing the Audit Committee is £15,000, and the fee paid for chairing the Remuneration 
Committee is £10,000, each per annum. The fee for the Senior Independent Director is £13,000 per annum.
The fee paid to Daniel Bernard as Deputy Chairman was increased from €200,000 to €206,000 (£142,344) per annum with effect from 
1 August 2007 and reﬂ ects his considerable international retailing experience.
The Chairman’s fees are set by reference to his time commitment and relevant benchmark data. The fee paid to Peter Jackson was 
increased to £284,000 per annum with effect from 1 August 2007.

The Audit Committee consists of four independent non-executive 
directors. It is chaired by Phil Bentley, who is a qualiﬁ ed accountant 
and was, until his promotion to Managing Director of British Gas, 
the Group Finance Director of Centrica plc and as such is considered 
to be suitably qualiﬁ ed to be the Audit Committee Chairman. He, 
Daniel Bernard, John Nelson and Michael Hepher served for the 
whole year. 
At the invitation of the Committee, the Chairman of the Board and 
the Group Chief Executive regularly attended meetings, as did the 
Group Finance Director, the Head of Internal Audit and the external 
auditors. Private meetings were also held with the external and 
internal auditors at which management were not present.
The Committee provides an independent overview of the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control systems and ﬁ nancial reporting 
processes. Its terms of reference are available at www.kingﬁ sher.com. 
The principal responsibilities include monitoring the integrity of the 
ﬁ nancial statements, including a review of the signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial 
reporting judgements contained in them, and overseeing the work 
of both the internal and the external auditors.
During the year, the internal audit function was independently 
reviewed by an external consultant. Whilst there were no signiﬁ cant 
concerns raised, all actions required as a result of the ﬁ ndings were 
discussed and agreed at a scheduled Committee meeting.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the 
external audit and PricewaterhouseCoopers’ role in performing it. 
The results of this process were discussed and it was agreed that 
the performance of the auditors was acceptable.
In 2007/08 there were four Committee meetings, with four planned 
for 2008/09. Should the need arise, additional ad-hoc meetings are 
held. A standing forward agenda covering the whole year was used to 
ensure that the Committee’s terms of reference were fully addressed.
As part of the Board effectiveness evaluation, the Audit Committee’s 
work was assessed and no signiﬁ cant issues or concerns were 
highlighted. The actions required as a result of the ﬁ ndings from the 
assessment process were discussed at one of the four scheduled 
Committee meetings across the year.
During the year and as part of its normal programme, the 
Committee has considered and reviewed a number of matters, 
some of which were:
Progress on Audit Plans across the businesses;
Risks and controls in certain overseas subsidiaries; and 
Group minimum control standards, including IT.

Audit Committee report
The Nomination Committee comprises the Chairman, all the 
non-executive directors and the Group Chief Executive. It is 
chaired by Peter Jackson. Its terms of reference are available 
at www.kingﬁ sher.com.
The Committee reviews annually the succession plans for the 
Board and the senior executives and monitors agreed actions. 
The succession plan for executive directors is considered by the 
full Board so that the necessary input of the serving executive 
directors can be given. Suitably qualiﬁ ed external search consultants 
assist in the search process for all new Board appointees. 
The Nominations Committee conducted a formal, rigorous and 
transparent process to identify a new Group Chief Executive during 
the year under review. This process involved the appointment of a 
qualiﬁ ed external search consultant to assist in providing a thorough, 
independent and objective assessment of a comprehensive range 
of internal and external candidates. Prior to initiating this search, the 
consultant was provided with a comprehensive brieﬁ ng as to the 
skills, knowledge and experience required and, from this, a list of 
potential candidates was identiﬁ ed. Following a series of interviews 
involving a number of directors, a short-list of candidates was 
presented to the Nomination Committee and a ﬁ nal recommendation 
made by it to the Board for approval.
The Committee keeps the composition of the Board under review 
to monitor the continuing independence of the non-executive 
directors, to identify any gaps in skills or experience so that 
appropriate training can be arranged, and to inform the succession 
plan for future Board appointments.
As a result of this work, the Committee agrees, for recommendation 
to the Board, plans and processes for ensuring continuity of 
experience as well as compliance with the requirement that at least 
half the Board (excluding the Chairman) is comprised of 
independent non-executive directors.
The Committee met six times during the year.

1 General information
Kingﬁ sher plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together the Group) retail 
home improvement products through a network of retail sites, located mainly 
in the United Kingdom, continental Europe and Asia. 
Kingﬁ sher plc is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The nature 
of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Operating 
review and the Financial review on pages 8 to 29.
The address of its registered ofﬁ ce is 3 Sheldon Square, Paddington, 
London W2 6PX.
The Company has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and 
a secondary listing on the Paris Bourse.
These consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been approved for issue 
by the Board of Directors on 26 March 2008.
2 Principal accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
a. Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries 
are made up to the nearest Saturday to 31 January each year, except 
as disclosed in note 4 of the Company’s separate ﬁ nancial statements. 
The current ﬁ nancial year is the 52 weeks ended 2 February 2008. 
The comparative ﬁ nancial year is the 53 weeks ended 3 February 2007. 
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union, IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies 
Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, 
as modiﬁ ed by the use of valuations for certain ﬁ nancial instruments, share-
based payments and post employment beneﬁ ts. A summary of the principal 
Group accounting policies is set out below. 
The preparation of ﬁ nancial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires 
the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, 
or areas where assumptions and estimates are signiﬁ cant to the consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements are disclosed in note 3.
Use of adjusted measures 
Kingﬁ sher believes that retail proﬁ t, adjusted pre-tax proﬁ t, adjusted post-tax 
proﬁ t and adjusted earnings per share provide additional useful information 
on underlying trends to shareholders. These measures are used by Kingﬁ sher 
for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements 
for employees. The terms ‘retail proﬁ t’, ‘exceptional items’ and ‘adjusted’ 
are not deﬁ ned terms under IFRS and may therefore not be comparable with 
similarly titled proﬁ t measures reported by other companies. It is not intended 
to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measurements of proﬁ t. The term 
‘adjusted’ refers to the relevant measure being reported excluding exceptional 
items, ﬁ nancing fair value remeasurements and amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles. Retail proﬁ t is deﬁ ned as operating proﬁ t before central costs 
(principally the costs of the Group’s head ofﬁ ce), exceptional items, amortisation 
of acquisition intangibles and the Group’s share of interest and tax of joint 
ventures and associates.
The separate reporting of non-recurring exceptional items, which are presented 
as exceptional within their relevant income statement category, helps provide 
an indication of the Group’s underlying business performance. The principal 
items which will be included as exceptional items are:
non-trading items included in operating proﬁ t such as proﬁ ts and losses 
on the disposal or closure of subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates 
and investments which do not form part of the Group’s trading activities;
gains and losses on the disposal of properties; and
the costs of signiﬁ cant restructuring and incremental acquisition 
integration costs.
b. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements incorporate the ﬁ nancial statements 
of the Company, its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. 
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiary undertakings are all entities over which the Group has the power 
to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating policies generally accompanying a 
shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. Subsidiary undertakings 
acquired during the period are recorded under the acquisition method of 
accounting and their results included from the date of acquisition. The results 
of subsidiaries which have been disposed of during the period are included 
up to the effective date of disposal.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition 
of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the 
fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred 
or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition. Identiﬁ able assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values 
at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. 
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share 
of the identiﬁ able net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost 
of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary 
acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions 
between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the 
asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed 
where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

(ii) Joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures are entities over which the Group has equal joint control, with 
a third-party, to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating activities of that entity. The 
equity method is used to account for the Group’s investments in joint ventures.
Associates are entities over which the Group has the ability to exercise 
signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding 
of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. The equity method is used 
to account for the Group’s investments in associates.
Under the equity method investments are initially recognised at cost. 
The Group’s investments in joint ventures and associates include goodwill 
(net of any accumulated impairment losses) identiﬁ ed on acquisition.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition proﬁ ts or losses is recognised in the 
income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves 
is recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are 
adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s 
share of losses equals or exceeds its interest, including any other long-term 
receivables, the Group does not recognise any further losses, unless it has 
incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures 
and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of joint ventures and 
associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with 
the policies adopted by the Group.
c. Foreign currency translation
(i) Functional and presentational currency
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the 
Group’s presentational currency. Items included in the ﬁ nancial statements of 
each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). 
(ii) Transactions and balances
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional 
currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction or, 
for practical reasons, at average monthly rates where exchange rates do not 
ﬂ uctuate signiﬁ cantly. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement. 
Exceptions to this are where the monetary items form part of the net 
investment in a foreign operation or are designated and effective net 
investment or cash ﬂ ow hedges. Such exchange differences are initially 
deferred in equity.
(iii) Group companies
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are expressed in 
Sterling at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Proﬁ ts and losses 
of overseas subsidiary undertakings are expressed in Sterling at average 
exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation 
of foreign operations are recognised in a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the 
net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency 
instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to equity. 
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised 
in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign 
entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated 
at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Principal rates of exchange:
euro/£ 2007/08 2006/07
Year end rate 1.33 1.52
Average rate 1.45 1.47
d. Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises retail sales and services supplied. Revenue excludes 
transactions made between companies within the Group, Value Added Tax, 
other sales-related taxes and is net of returns, staff and trade discounts.
Revenue relating to the sale of in-store product is earned at the point of cash 
receipt. All other revenue is recognised when the product has been delivered 
or, for installation income, when the service has been performed. Delivered 
products and service income represent only a small component of the Group’s 
revenue as a majority of the Group’s sales relate to in-store purchase of product.
e. Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid to the Company’s 
shareholders. Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by 
the Company’s shareholders.
f. Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill 
is not amortised and is tested annually for impairment by assessing the 
recoverable amount of each cash generating unit to which the goodwill 
relates. When the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than 
the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include 
the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.

(ii) Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs 
incurred to acquire and bring to use the speciﬁ c software. These costs are 
amortised over their estimated useful lives of two to ﬁ ve years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identiﬁ able and 
unique software products controlled by the Group, which are expected 
to generate economic beneﬁ ts exceeding costs beyond one year, are 
recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include software development, 
employee and consultancy costs and an appropriate portion of relevant 
overheads. Costs associated with identifying, sourcing, evaluating or 
maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
g. Property, plant and equipment
(i) Cost 
Land and buildings held for use in the business are carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment. Fixtures, ﬁ ttings 
and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
provisions for impairment. 
(ii) Depreciation
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided to reﬂ ect a 
reduction from cost to estimated residual value over the estimated useful life 
of the asset to the Group. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is 
calculated using the straight line method and the annual rates applicable to 
the principal categories are:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings – between 2% and 5%
Short leasehold land and buildings – over remaining period of the lease
Fixtures and ﬁ ttings – between 5% and 25%
Computers and electronic equipment – between 25% and 50%
Motor cars – 25%
Commercial vehicles – between 10% and 33%
Freehold land is not depreciated. Asset lives and residual values are reviewed 
at each balance sheet date.
(iii) Impairment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is 
assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future pre-tax 
cash ﬂ ows of the relevant cash generating unit or fair value less costs to sell 
if higher. The discount rate applied is based upon the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital with appropriate adjustments for the risks associated 
with the relevant business. Any impairment in value is charged to the income 
statement in the period in which it occurs. 
(iv) Disposal
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined 
as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and is recognised in the income statement. Sales of land and buildings 
are accounted for when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts. 
(v) Subsequent costs
Subsequent costs are included in the related asset’s carrying amount or 
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic beneﬁ ts associated with the item will ﬂ ow to the Group and 
the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance 
are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
h. Leased assets
Where assets are ﬁ nanced by leasing agreements which give rights approximating 
to ownership, the assets are treated as if they have been purchased outright. 
The amount capitalised is the lower of the fair value or the present value of the 
minimum lease payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease. 
The assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful 
life. Obligations relating to ﬁ nance leases, net of ﬁ nance charges in respect 
of future periods, are included, as appropriate, under borrowings due within 
or after one year. The ﬁ nance charge element of rentals is charged to ﬁ nance 
costs in the income statement over the lease term. 
All other leases are operating leases and the rental payments are generally 
charged to the income statement in the period to which the payments relate, 
except for those leases which incorporate ﬁ xed minimum rental uplift clauses. 
Leases which contain ﬁ xed minimum rental uplifts are charged to the income 
statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Where a lease is taken out for land and buildings combined, the buildings 
element of the lease may be capitalised as a ﬁ nance lease if it meets the 
criteria for a ﬁ nance lease, but the land element will always be classed as an 
operating lease. If the contracted lease payments are not split between land 
and buildings in the lease contract, the split is made based on the market 
values of the land and buildings at the inception of the lease. 
Incentives received or paid to enter into lease agreements are released 
to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
i. Investment property
The Group’s investment properties are carried at cost less depreciation 
and provision for impairment.
j. Capitalisation of borrowing costs
Interest on borrowings to ﬁ nance the construction of properties held as 
non-current assets is capitalised from the date work starts on the property 
to the date when substantially all the activities which are necessary to get 
the property ready for use are complete. Where construction is completed 
in parts, each part is considered separately when capitalising interest. 
Interest is capitalised before any allowance for tax relief.
k. Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, on 
a weighted average cost basis. Cost includes appropriate attributable 
overheads and direct expenditure incurred in the normal course of business 
in bringing goods to their present location and condition.
Rebates receivable from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of 
inventory in the period in which they are earned.
Costs of inventories include the transfer from equity of any gains or losses 
on qualifying cash ﬂ ow hedges relating to purchases.

l. Employee beneﬁ ts
(i) Post employment benefi ts
The Group operates various deﬁ ned beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned contribution pension 
schemes for its employees, some of which are required by local legislation. 
A deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan is a pension plan which deﬁ nes an amount of pension 
beneﬁ t which an employee will receive on retirement. A deﬁ ned contribution 
plan is a pension plan under which the Group usually pays ﬁ xed contributions 
into a separate entity. In all cases other than some of the legally required 
schemes, a separate fund is being accumulated to meet the accruing liabilities. 
The assets of each of these funds are either held under trusts or managed 
by insurance companies and are entirely separate from the Group’s assets.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t pension plans is the fair value of plan assets less the present value 
of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation at the balance sheet date, together with an 
adjustment for any past service costs not yet recognised. The deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected 
unit credit method. The present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation is 
determined by discounting the estimated future cash outﬂ ows using interest 
rates of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in 
which the beneﬁ ts will be paid and which have terms to maturity approximating 
to the terms of the related pension liability. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes 
in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of recognised 
income and expense as they arise. 
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless 
the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining 
in service for a speciﬁ ed period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the 
past service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
For deﬁ ned contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to privately 
administered pension plans on a contractual basis. The Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions 
are recognised as an employee beneﬁ t expense when they are due. Prepaid 
contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or 
a reduction in future payments is available. 
(ii) Share-based compensation
The Group operates several equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. 
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant 
of options or deferred shares is recognised as an expense and is calculated 
using Black-Scholes and stochastic models. The total amount to be expensed 
over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the 
options or deferred shares granted, excluding the impact of any non-market 
vesting conditions. The value of the charge is adjusted to reﬂ ect expected 
and actual levels of options vesting due to non-market vesting conditions.
m. Taxation
The income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable 
and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁ t for the year. Taxable 
proﬁ t differs from proﬁ t before taxation as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense which are taxable or 
deductible in other years or which are never taxable or deductible. The 
Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates which have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the ﬁ nancial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation 
of taxable proﬁ t and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable proﬁ ts will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences or unused tax losses can be utilised. Such assets 
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from 
goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) 
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the taxable 
proﬁ t nor the accounting proﬁ t. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets 
is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufﬁ cient taxable proﬁ ts will be available to allow all 
or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising 
on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where 
the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply 
in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction and when the 
Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Current and deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, 
except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in 
which case the current or deferred tax is also recognised directly in equity. 
n. Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outﬂ ow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be 
reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. 
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected future cash ﬂ ows at a pre-tax rate which 
reﬂ ects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where 
appropriate, the risks speciﬁ c to the liability.

o. Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance 
sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights 
to the cash ﬂ ows from the ﬁ nancial asset expire. Financial liabilities (or a part 
of a ﬁ nancial liability) are derecognised when the obligation speciﬁ ed in the 
contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
(i) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held on call with 
banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities 
of three months or less.
(ii) Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are amortised to the income statement 
using the effective interest method.
(iii) Other investments
Other investments are measured at fair value. Gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the investment 
is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income 
statement for the period.
(iv) Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value 
as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
(v) Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
(vi) Derivative fi nancial instruments and hedge accounting
Where hedge accounting is not applied, or to the extent to which it is not 
effective, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income 
statement as they arise. Changes in the fair value of derivatives transacted as 
hedges of operating items and ﬁ nancing items are recognised in operating 
proﬁ t and net ﬁ nance costs respectively. ‘Financing fair value remeasurements’ 
represent changes in the fair value of ﬁ nancing derivatives, excluding interest 
accruals, offset by fair value adjustments to the carrying value of borrowings 
and other hedged items under fair value hedge relationships.
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date a derivative contract 
is entered into and are subsequently carried at fair value. The accounting 
treatment of derivatives classiﬁ ed as hedges depends on their designation, 
which occurs on the date that the derivative contract is committed to. The 
Group designates certain derivatives as:
a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability or unrecognised ﬁ rm 
commitment (‘fair value hedge’);
a hedge of a highly probable forecast transaction or ﬁ rm commitment 
(‘cash ﬂ ow hedge’); or
a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (‘net investment hedge’).
–

Fair value hedges 
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, the hedged 
item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged 
with the corresponding entry being recorded in the income statement. 
Gains or losses from remeasuring the corresponding hedging instrument 
are recognised in the same line of the income statement.
Cash fl ow hedges 
Changes in the effective portion of the fair value of derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments that are designated as hedges of future cash ﬂ ows are 
recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement where relevant. If the cash ﬂ ow hedge 
of a ﬁ rm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of a 
non-ﬁ nancial asset or liability, then, at the time it is recognised, the associated 
gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in 
equity are included in the initial measurement of the non-ﬁ nancial asset or 
liability. For hedges that result in the recognition of a ﬁ nancial asset or liability, 
amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in 
the same period in which the hedged item affects net proﬁ t or loss. 
Net investment hedges
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign operations through 
currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the retranslation of the 
borrowings are recognised in equity. If the Group uses derivatives as 
the hedging instrument, the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in 
equity, with any ineffective portion being recognised in the income statement. 
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are recycled through the income 
statement on disposal of the foreign operation. 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group documents in advance 
the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument. 
The Group also documents and demonstrates an assessment of the 
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which 
shows that the hedge has been and will be highly effective on an ongoing 
basis. The effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure 
that the hedge remains highly effective.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or 
is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁ es for hedge accounting. 
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognised in equity is retained in equity until the highly probable forecast 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, 
the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the 
income statement for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁ nancial instruments or other host contracts 
are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not 
closely related to those of host contracts, and the host contracts are not carried 
at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.

p. New standards
The following new standards, amendments and interpretations became effective in these ﬁ nancial statements:
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures and the 
complementary amendment to 
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial 
Statements: Capital Disclosures
Requires new disclosures relating to ﬁ nancial instruments and share capital. Also introduces new 
disclosures regarding the signiﬁ cance of ﬁ nancial instruments for an entity’s ﬁ nancial position and 
performance and qualitative and quantitative disclosures on the nature and extent of risks. This has 
no impact on the classiﬁ cation and valuation of the Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments, nor to the disclosures 
relating to taxation and trade and other payables.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 Requires consideration of transactions involving the issuance of equity instruments, where the identiﬁ able 
consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity instruments issued in order to establish 
whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 2. This had no impact on the Group’s results.
IFRIC 9 Re-assessment of embedded 
derivatives
Requires that a re-assessment of whether embedded derivatives should be separated from the underlying 
host contract should be made only where there are changes to the contract. This had no impact on the 
Group’s results.
IFRIC 10 Interim ﬁ nancial reporting and 
impairment
Prohibits the impairment losses recognised in an interim period on goodwill and investments in equity 
instruments and in ﬁ nancial assets carried at cost to be reversed at a subsequent balance sheet date. 
This did not have any impact on the Group’s results. 
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – The limit on a deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t asset, minimum 
funding requirements and 
their interaction
Provides guidance on assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of the surplus that can be recognised 
as an asset. It also explains how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or 
contractual minimum funding requirement. This has been adopted early by the Group and has not had 
any impact on the Group’s results.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations became effective but were not relevant to the Group’s results:
IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement 
Approach under IAS 29 
Financial Reporting in 
Hyperinﬂ ationary Economies 
Addresses the application of IAS 29 when an economy ﬁ rst becomes hyperinﬂ ationary and in particular 
the accounting for deferred tax. 
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁ nancial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these ﬁ nancial statements 
were issued but not yet effective:
IAS 23
(Amendment)
Borrowing costs (effective from 
1 January 2009)
(Still subject to endorsement by the European Union). Requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs 
directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset (one that takes 
a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) as part of the cost of that asset. The option 
of immediately expensing those borrowing costs will be removed. This will be applied in the Group’s 
2009/10 ﬁ nancial statements.
IFRS 8 Operating segments (effective 
from 1 January 2009)
IFRS 8 will replace IAS 14 and will align segment reporting with the requirements of the US standard 
SFAS 131 “Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information”. The new standard 
requires ‘a management approach’, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as 
that used for internal reporting purposes. This will be applied in the Group’s 2009/10 ﬁ nancial statements.
IFRIC 12 Service concession 
arrangements (effective from 
1 January 2008)
Applies to contractual arrangements whereby a private sector operator participates in the development, 
ﬁ nancing, operation and maintenance of infrastructure for public sector services. This is not expected 
to be relevant to the Group as none of the Group’s companies provide public sector services. 
IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes 
(effective from 1 July 2008)
Clariﬁ es that where goods or services are sold together with a customer loyalty incentive (for example 
loyalty points or free products), the arrangement is a multiple-element arrangement and the consideration 
receivable from the customer is allocated between the components of the arrangement using fair values. 
This will be applied in the Group’s 2009/10 ﬁ nancial statements.

Notes to the consolidated 
fi nancial statements
3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of consolidated ﬁ nancial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies 
and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions 
which have a signiﬁ cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁ nancial year are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and other assets
The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amounts of cash generating units have been determined based 
on value-in-use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash ﬂ ows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash 
generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. Actual outcomes could vary signiﬁ cantly from these estimates. 
See note 12 for further information.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations 
prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates.
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Signiﬁ cant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes in each territory. 
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises 
liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the ﬁ nal tax outcome of these matters is different 
from the amounts which were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination 
is made. See notes 9 and 26 for further information.
Post employment beneﬁ ts
The present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t liabilities recognised on the balance sheet is dependent on interest rates of high quality corporate bonds. The net 
ﬁ nancing charge or return is dependent on both the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds and the assumed investment returns on scheme assets. 
Other key assumptions for pension obligations, including mortality rates, are based in part on current market conditions. See note 27 for further information. 
Restructuring provision
The Group provided £224m in 2005/06 relating to the closure and downsizing of stores in B&Q UK and the termination of the B&Q UK ﬁ nancial services 
arrangement. The ultimate costs and timing of cash ﬂ ows are dependent on exiting the property lease contracts on the closed stores and sub-dividing and 
sub-letting the surplus space released from those stores to be downsized, as detailed in note 28.

The Group’s primary reporting segments are geographic, with the Group operating in four main geographical areas, being the UK, France, Rest of Europe 
and Asia. The Group only has one business segment, being retail, therefore no secondary segmental disclosure is given.
The ‘Rest of Europe’ segment consists of B&Q Ireland, Castorama Poland, Castorama Italy, Castorama Russia, Brico Dépôt Spain, Koçta¸ s and Hornbach. 
Poland has been shown separately as it meets the reportable segment criteria as prescribed by IAS 14 Segment Reporting. The ‘Asia’ segment consists 
of B&Q China, B&Q Taiwan, B&Q Home in South Korea and the Asia head ofﬁ ce. 
Central costs have not been allocated. These principally comprise the Head Ofﬁ ce operations of Kingﬁ sher plc.

Closure costs of £13m have been expensed in relation to the closure of B&Q Home in South Korea and the Asia head ofﬁ ce. A further £22m exceptional 
charge has been recognised as part of a restructuring project in B&Q China, comprising store impairment costs and onerous lease contracts.
The Group has recorded £39m exceptional proﬁ t on disposal of properties, which includes a £40m proﬁ t on the sale and leaseback of the Worksop 
Distribution Centre by B&Q UK. In the prior year, total proﬁ ts recognised on the disposal of properties totalled £49m. The Group recognised £43m proﬁ t on 
disposal of properties on the sale and leaseback of seven large UK stores to The British Land Company.
The Group has recognised £5m income in relation to the repayment of a loan made to ProMarkt which had previously been written off as an exceptional item.
On 4 January 2008, the Group disposed of its 50% interest in B&Q Taiwan (B&Q International Co. Ltd) to its joint venture partner, Test Rite International Co. Ltd, 
for cash consideration of £50m. This resulted in a £27m proﬁ t before goodwill being recognised and a £5m loss after goodwill. The goodwill was allocated to 
B&Q Taiwan on the Group’s acquisition of the minority interests of Castorama in 2002/03.

of issue costs of borrowings of £1m (2006/07: £1m).
The amount of borrowing costs capitalised in the year was £3m (2006/07: £1m). Borrowing costs included in the cost of qualifying assets during the year 
arose on the centrally held borrowing pool and are calculated by applying a capitalisation rate of 6.6% (2006/07: 5.5%) to expenditure on such assets.
Financing fair value remeasurements comprise a net gain on derivatives, excluding accrued interest, of £66m (2006/07: £46m loss), offset by a net loss from 
fair value adjustments to the carrying value of borrowings of £61m (2006/07: £50m gain). The net gain on derivatives includes ineffectiveness gains on net 
investment hedges of £3m (2006/07: £3m).

A tax credit of £2m has been recognised in the income statement relating to exceptional items, of which £14m is charged against the current year tax charge 
in relation to the £4m net exceptional income, with the remaining £16m credit in respect of prior periods, relating to tax previously provided on exceptional items. 
The tax credit on exceptional items for the year ended 3 February 2007 was £8m, of which £3m related to adjustments in respect of prior years.
In addition to the amounts charged to the income statement, tax of £19m (2006/07: £30m) was charged directly to equity. Of the £19m, £13m is included 
in deferred tax and £6m is included in current tax.
Kingﬁ sher paid €137 .5m tax to the French tax authorities in the year ended 31 January 2004 as a consequence of the Kesa Electricals demerger and recorded this 
as an exceptional tax charge. Proceedings for the recovery of this tax have been initiated and although this may take several years to be resolved, Kingﬁ sher 
believes that the risk of ultimately being liable for this amount is low. No asset has been recognised in these ﬁ nancial statements as the recovery of this amount 
is not sufﬁ ciently certain at this time.
In certain circumstances, it is possible that the conditions of the UK and French tax clearances for the demerger of Kesa Electricals in the year ended 
31 January 2004 could be breached. Whilst the consequences of such a breach could be signiﬁ cant, the Group actively monitors compliance with these 
conditions and believes that the likelihood of any breach is remote.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (ESOP) which for the purpose of this calculation 
are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. 
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s shares during the year.
Adjusted earnings per share ﬁ gures are also presented. These exclude the effect of exceptional items, ﬁ nancing fair value remeasurements and amortisation 
of acquisition intangibles, to allow comparison of underlying trading performance on a consistent basis.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. The CGUs for which the carrying amount of goodwill is deemed 
signiﬁ cant are the UK and France. The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are set out below:
United Kingdom 
The cash ﬂ ow projections are based on ﬁ nancial forecasts and strategic plans approved by the Board covering a ﬁ ve year period, based on both past 
performance and expectations for future market development and include planned working capital movements and capital expenditure. Cash ﬂ ows beyond 
this ﬁ ve year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2.25% (2006/07: 2.25%) which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for retail 
businesses in the UK. 
The risk-adjusted discount rate of 9.0% (2006/07: 8.7%) is pre-tax and reﬂ ects the speciﬁ c risks inherent in retail businesses, determined relative to 
comparable retail companies in the UK. 
France
The cash ﬂ ow projections are based on ﬁ nancial forecasts and strategic plans approved by the Board covering a ﬁ ve year period, based on both past 
performance and expectations for future market development and include planned working capital movements and capital expenditure. Cash ﬂ ows beyond 
this ﬁ ve year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 1.8% (2006/07: 1.8%) which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for retail 
businesses in France. 
The risk-adjusted discount rate of 9.1% (2006/07: 8.9%) is pre-tax and reﬂ ects the speciﬁ c risks inherent in retail businesses, determined relative to 
comparable retail companies in France.

During the year the Group recognised £17m of impairment losses in selling and distribution expenses. As a result of closing B&Q Korea a £2m impairment 
charge was recognised. A further £15m impairment charge was recognised in relation to certain loss making stores in China. The Group reviews property, 
plant and equipment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. This is based on value-in-use calculations 
with the key assumptions being the stores’ long-term plans and the risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate (13.1% in China).
The amount of borrowing costs capitalised in property, plant and equipment in the year was £3m (2006/07: £1m). The cumulative total of borrowing costs 
included at the balance sheet date, net of depreciation, was £20m (2006/07: £17m).

Net carrying amount     2,176 147 337 2,660 2,286
Properties held at 1 February 2004 are at deemed cost, being the fair value of land and buildings as at the transition date to IFRS. Fair value is taken to be 
the open market value at the date of valuation. All property acquired from 1 February 2004 is carried at cost.
Included in land and buildings is leasehold land in the UK, China, Poland, Russia and Germany. This leasehold land is in effect a prepayment for the use 
of land and is accordingly being amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. The cost and depreciation of leasehold land 
included in land and buildings at 2 February 2008 were £273m and £50m (2006/07: £254m and £45m) respectively. 
The Group does not revalue properties within its ﬁ nancial statements. A valuation exercise is performed for internal purposes annually in October by independent 
external valuers covering over one third of the property portfolio with the remaining portfolio valued internally. Based on this the value of property would be 
£3.5 billion (2006/07: £3.1bn). The key assumption used in calculating this is the estimated yields. The average income yields used were 6.3% in the UK 
(2006/07: 5.5%), 6.5% in France and Italy (2006/07: 6.7%), 6.9% in Poland (2006/07: 6.8%) and 7.7% in China (2006/07: 7.7%).

Finance lease commitments
The Group leases certain of its buildings and ﬁ xtures and equipment under ﬁ nance leases. The average lease term maturity for buildings is eight years 
(2006/07: nine years) and for ﬁ xtures and equipment is two years (2006/07: two years). Building leases include a clause to enable upward revision of the rental 
charge to prevailing market conditions.
Future minimum lease payments under ﬁ nance leases, together with the present value of minimum lease payments, are as follows:

The interest rates inherent in the ﬁ nance leases are ﬁ xed at the contract date for the lease term. The weighted average effective interest rate on the Group’s 
ﬁ nance leases is 9.1% (2006/07: 8.7%).
Fair value of borrowings 
The fair values of current borrowings approximate to their carrying amounts.
Where available, market values have been used to determine the fair value of non-current borrowings. Where market values are not available, fair values have been 
calculated by discounting cash ﬂ ows at prevailing interest and exchange rates. The carrying amounts and fair values of non-current borrowings are as follows:

The fair values are calculated by discounting future cash ﬂ ows arising from the instruments using market rates.
Fair value hedges
Interest rate swap contracts convert ﬁ xed rate debt issued under the Group’s MTN programme and the US Private Placement to ﬂ oating rate liabilities. 
At 2 February 2008 the Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts was £1,202m (2006/07: £1,151m). Inﬂ ation swaps hedge inﬂ ation rate exposures 
in certain property lease contracts. The swaps limit the annual inﬂ ation uplift on the underlying lease payments at 3% each year until April 2021 and are 
accounted for as a fair value hedge of unrecognised future commitments. At 2 February 2008 the Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts 
was £10m (2006/07: £10m).
Cash ﬂ ow hedges
Forward foreign exchange contracts hedge currency exposures of forecast inventory purchases. At 2 February 2008 the Sterling equivalent notional amount 
of such contracts was £172m (2006/07: £158m). The associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred to inventories when the purchases occur during 
the next 12 months. Losses of £8m (2006/07: £3m) have been transferred to inventories for contracts which matured during the year.
Net investment hedges
Forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps hedge currency exposures of overseas investments. At 2 February 2008 the 
Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts was £343m (2006/07: £295m).
Non-designated hedges
The Group has entered into certain derivatives to provide a hedge of ﬂ uctuations in the income statement arising from balance sheet positions. At 2 February 2008 
the Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts was £609m (2006/07: £424m). These have not been hedge accounted, since the fair value movements 
of the derivatives in the income statement offset the retranslation of the balance sheet position. These include forward foreign exchange instruments hedging 
part of the funding of the Group’s overseas operations, a cross-currency swap converting a euro-denominated debt into a Sterling liability and short-term 
foreign exchange and interest rate contracts.
The Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives. The Group does not have any embedded derivatives which are not closely related to the host 
contract and therefore is not required to account for these separately.

25 Financial risk management
Kingﬁ sher’s Treasury function has primary responsibility for managing certain ﬁ nancial risks to which the Group is exposed. The Board reviews the levels 
of exposure regularly and approves treasury policies covering the use of ﬁ nancial instruments required to manage these risks. Kingﬁ sher Treasury is not run 
as a proﬁ t centre and it does not enter into any transactions for speculative purposes.
In the normal course of business the Group uses ﬁ nancial instruments including derivative ﬁ nancial instruments. The main types of ﬁ nancial instruments used 
are Medium Term Notes and other ﬁ xed term debt, bank loans and deposits, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, spot and forward foreign 
exchange contracts and foreign exchange options.
Interest rate risk
Borrowings arranged at ﬂ oating rates of interest expose the Group to cash ﬂ ow interest rate risk, whereas those arranged at ﬁ xed rates of interest expose the 
Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group manages its interest rate risk by entering into certain interest rate derivative contracts which modify the interest 
rate payable on the Group’s underlying debt instruments, principally the Medium Term Notes and other ﬁ xed term debt.
Kingﬁ sher’s policy is to manage the currency and interest rate proﬁ le of its issued debt using derivative contracts. The effect of these contracts on the Group’s 
net debt was as follows:
   Sterling  euro  US Dollar  Other
£ millions Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Total

Net debt  (29) (511) (235) (542) – 2  58  (37) (1,294)
Currency risk
The Group’s principal currency exposures are to the euro, the US Dollar, the Polish Zloty and the Chinese Renminbi. The euro and Zloty exposures are operational 
and arise through the ownership of the retail businesses in France, Italy, Spain and Poland. Balance sheet euro translation exposure is substantially hedged by 
maintaining a proportion of the Group’s debt in euro. In China, balance sheet translation exposure is partly hedged by local debt in China and partly by forward 
foreign exchange contracts entered into to hedge this exposure. However, it is the Group’s policy not to hedge the translation of overseas earnings (primarily 
euro) into Sterling. In addition, the Group has signiﬁ cant transaction exposure arising on the purchase of inventories denominated in US Dollars, which it hedges 
using forward foreign exchange contracts. Under Group policies, the Group companies are required to hedge committed inventory purchases and a proportion 
of forecast inventory purchases arising in the next 12 months, and this is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Financial instruments affected by interest rate and currency risks, being the principal market risks impacting Kingﬁ sher, include borrowings, deposits and 
derivative ﬁ nancial instruments. The following analysis illustrates the sensitivity to changes in Sterling and euro interest rates and the US Dollar/Sterling and 
US Dollar/euro exchange rates.

25 Financial risk management continued
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying amount of post employment beneﬁ ts and provisions. It has been 
prepared on the basis that the Group’s debt, hedging activities, hedging designation, foreign currency proportion of debt and derivative contracts remain 
constant, reﬂ ecting the positions at 2 February 2008 and 3 February 2007 respectively. As a consequence, the analysis relates to the position at those dates 
and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended. The following assumptions have been made in preparing the sensitivity analysis:
the ﬂ oating leg of any swaps, ﬂ oating rate debt and cash and cash equivalents are treated as not having had the interest rate set. A full 12 month effect 
of a change in interest rates is shown;
the Group’s designated fair value hedges are assumed to be fully effective, with gains or losses on derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and underlying hedged 
items offsetting fully in the income statement;
forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash ﬂ ow hedges of future US Dollar inventory purchases are assumed to be fully effective. Changes 
in their carrying value due to sensitivity to US Dollar/Sterling and US Dollar/euro exchange rates are reﬂ ected in equity;
the Group’s designated net investment hedges are assumed to be fully effective, and as such do not expose the Group to currency risk and are not 
included in this analysis.
The above assumptions are made when illustrating the effect on the Group’s income statement and equity given reasonable movements in foreign exchange and 
interest rates, before the effect of tax. The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement to be 0.50%, based on recent interest rate history for Sterling 
and the euro. Similarly, sensitivity to movements in US Dollar/Sterling and US Dollar/euro exchange rates of 10% are shown, reﬂ ecting changes of reasonable 
proportion in the context of movements in those currency pairs over recent years.
Liquidity risk
The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives through both short and long-term 
cash ﬂ ow forecasts, supplemented by forecasts of ﬁ nancial headroom. It promotes a diversity of funding sources and debt maturities, utilising committed bank 
revolving credit facilities to provide additional liquidity, which are available to be drawn for general corporate purposes including working capital requirements.
The analysis below is of the contractual undiscounted cash ﬂ ows payable under ﬁ nancial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date.

Inﬂ ation risk
The Group is exposed to inﬂ ation risk in certain property lease contracts and uses inﬂ ation swaps to hedge some of this exposure.
Credit risk
Credit risk of third parties that the Group deals with is managed by setting a credit limit using published credit ratings. The exposure against this limit 
is determined by taking account of the full value of deposits and a proportion of the value of derivative contracts. Credit risk is reduced by spreading the 
Group’s debt, investment and derivatives transactions across a range of markets using counterparties with strong credit ratings.
The Group has a very low retail credit risk due to the transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity. The maximum credit risk 
exposure of the Group’s ﬁ nancial assets at the balance sheet date is represented by the amounts reported under the corresponding balance sheet headings. 
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and unrelated and therefore no further 
credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables. There are no other signiﬁ cant concentrations of credit risk associated 
with the ﬁ nancial instruments of the Group.
At 2 February 2008, trade and other receivables that were past due but not impaired amounted to £19m (2006/07: £10m), of which £3m (2006/07: £2m) 
were over 120 days past due.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £180m (2006/07: £156m) available for offset against future proﬁ ts. A deferred tax asset 
has been recognised in respect of £21m (2006/07: £25m) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £159m 
(2006/07: £131m) due to the unpredictability of future proﬁ t streams. Included in unrecognised tax losses are tax losses arising in China and South Korea 
of £73m (2006/07: £55m) which can only be carried forward in the next one to ﬁ ve years and tax losses arising in Spain of £24m (2006/07: £18m) which 
can only be carried forward for up to 15 years. Other losses may be carried forward indeﬁ nitely.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures. As the earnings are continually reinvested by the 
Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. Earnings which could be remitted on which there would be tax to pay total £191m 
(2006/07: £127m).

27 Post employment beneﬁ ts
The Group operates a variety of post employment beneﬁ t arrangements covering both funded and unfunded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes and funded deﬁ ned 
contribution schemes. The most signiﬁ cant are the funded, ﬁ nal salary deﬁ ned beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned contribution schemes for the Group’s UK employees; 
however various retirement beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned contribution schemes are operated in France, Poland, Italy and China. In France and Poland, they are retirement 
indemnity in nature; and in Italy, termination indemnity in nature. 
a) Deﬁ ned contribution schemes
Pension costs for deﬁ ned contribution schemes, at rates speciﬁ ed in the individual plans’ rules, are as follows:
£ millions        2007/08 2006/07
Deﬁ ned contribution schemes            5 3
b) Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes 
The Group’s principal deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plan is in the UK. The assets of this plan are held separately from the Group in trustee-administered funds. 
The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plan’s beneﬁ ciaries. The Group also has other retirement beneﬁ t plans in other territories but these 
are not material in relation to the Group as a whole.
The Group has one main deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plan in the UK (“the UK plan”) which was closed to new entrants in 2004. A full actuarial valuation of the 
UK plan is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the plan Trustee and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2007. 
The Company monitors the plan funding level on a regular basis and will review with the plan Trustee at future valuations the continued appropriateness 
of the repayment schedule currently in place.
c) Principal actuarial valuation assumptions
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans, as shown in the tables below, are set by the 
Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualiﬁ ed actuaries. The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time. Movements in the 
ﬁ nancial assumptions can lead to signiﬁ cant movement in the estimated obligations of the plan, as illustrated in the sensitivity analysis in section d) of this note.
The UK discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index. The overall expected rate of return on plan assets 
reﬂ ects market expectations at the valuation date of long-term asset returns and the mix of assets in the plans.

Mortality assumptions
The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Group’s UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension liabilities have been selected with regard to the characteristics 
and experience of the membership of the plan from 2004 to 2007.
For the UK plan, the base mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables (PA 92 tables) projected forward to 2007 with 
the medium cohort improvement factors for males and with the standard improvement factors for females. In addition, allowance has been made for future 
increases in life expectancy. For males, the allowance is in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 1% pa, 
and for females, the allowance is in line with the standard improvements, subject to a minimum of 0.5% pa. These improvements have been set with regard 
to trends observed within the plan over the past decade. The corresponding assumptions for life expectancy of UK pension plan members are as follows:
         2007/08 2006/07
Age to which current pensioners are expected to live (60 now)  
– Male        87.2 85.1
– Female         85.9 86.3
Age to which future pensioners are expected to live (60 in 15 years time)  
– Male        88.8 86.2
– Female        87.1 87.5

Within the onerous property contracts provision, Kingﬁ sher has provided against future liabilities for all properties sublet at a shortfall and long-term idle properties. 
The provision is based on the value of future cash outﬂ ows relating to rent, rates and service charges. This excludes idle properties related to restructuring 
programmes which are included in the restructuring provisions.
Restructuring provisions include the estimated cost of the B&Q UK store and head ofﬁ ce restructuring programme. This provision has been discounted to reﬂ ect 
the time value of money and the risks associated with the speciﬁ c liabilities. The provision is expected to be utilised over the next two years. The ultimate costs 
and timing of cash ﬂ ows are dependent on exiting the property lease contracts on the closed stores and sub-dividing and sub-letting the surplus space released 
from those stores to be downsized. Also included in the restructuring provisions are amounts relating to certain loss-making stores in China and the closure 
of B&Q Korea and the Asia head ofﬁ ce.

 The charge to the income statement for the years ended 2 February 2008 and 3 February 2007 in respect of share-based payments includes the ﬁ rst year’s charge of the 
2008 and 2007 Kingﬁ sher Incentive Scheme (KIS) share grants respectively, based on the cash bonus for the year. Since grants under the KIS are made following the year 
end to which the ﬁ rst year of charge relates, it is not possible to give the number of options granted until after the year end. 
2
 The weighted average exercise price for options granted during the period represents a blend of nil price KIS and Performance Share Plan options and discounted ShareSave 
options (see below).
Options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the period. On that basis, the weighted average share price during the year, rather than at the date of exercise, 
was £2.11 (2006/07: £2.43). The options outstanding at the end of the year have exercise prices ranging from nil to £2.45 and a weighted average remaining 
contractual life of 2.2 years (2006/07: 3.6 years).
The Group recognised a total expense of £6m in the year ended 2 February 2008 (2006/07: £9m) relating to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.

Expected volatility was determined for each individual award, by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price (plus reinvested dividends) immediately 
prior to the grant of the award, over the same period as the vesting period of each award, adjusted by expectations of future volatility. The expected life used in 
the model has been adjusted for estimated effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

2007/08
We have audited the Group ﬁ nancial statements of Kingﬁ sher plc for the 
year ended 2 February 2008 which comprise the Consolidated income 
statement, the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, 
the Consolidated balance sheet, the Consolidated cash ﬂ ow statement 
and the related notes. These Group ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared 
under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Parent company ﬁ nancial statements of 
Kingﬁ sher plc for the year ended 2 February 2008 and on the information in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Group ﬁ nancial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been 
prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. 
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose 
hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group ﬁ nancial statements 
give a true and fair view and whether the Group ﬁ nancial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion 
the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements. The information given in the Directors’ report includes 
that speciﬁ c information presented in the Operating review and Financial review 
that is cross referred from the business review section of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information 
speciﬁ ed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions 
is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reﬂ ects the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the Combined Code 
(2006) speciﬁ ed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider 
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and 
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider 
whether it is consistent with the audited Group ﬁ nancial statements. The other 
information comprises only the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s 
review, the Operating review, the Financial review, the Directors’ report, 
the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Corporate Governance report, 
the Audit Committee report and the Nomination Committee report. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts 
and disclosures in the Group ﬁ nancial statements. It also includes an 
assessment of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgements made by the 
directors in the preparation of the Group ﬁ nancial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and 
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group ﬁ nancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 2 February 2008 and of its proﬁ t and cash ﬂ ows for the year 
then ended;
the Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements.

1 Principal accounting policies
The ﬁ nancial statements of Kingﬁ sher plc (the Company) are made up to 
the nearest Saturday to 31 January each year. The ﬁ nancial statements 
have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modiﬁ ed by 
the use of valuations for certain ﬁ nancial instruments, share-based payments 
and pensions, and are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards in the United Kingdom and the Companies Act 1985.
The Company’s ﬁ nancial statements are included in the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements of Kingﬁ sher plc. As permitted by section 230 of the Companies 
Act 1985, the proﬁ t and loss account and statement of total recognised gains 
and losses are not presented. The Company has taken advantage of the 
exemption from preparing a cash ﬂ ow statement under the terms of FRS 1 
Cash Flow Statements. The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 8 
Related Party Disclosures from disclosing related party transactions with 
subsidiaries of Kingﬁ sher plc. The Company has taken advantage of the 
exemption to provide ﬁ nancial instrument disclosures under the terms of 
FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these ﬁ nancial 
statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied 
to the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences on monetary items are taken to the proﬁ t and loss 
account.
Principal rate of exchange:
euro/£ 2007/08 2006/07
Year end rate 1.33 1.52
Tangible ﬁ xed assets
Tangible ﬁ xed assets are carried in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any provisions for impairment. Depreciation of tangible ﬁ xed 
assets is provided to reﬂ ect a reduction from cost to estimated residual value 
over the estimated useful life of the asset to the Company. Depreciation of 
tangible ﬁ xed assets is calculated using the straight line method and the annual 
rates applicable to the principal categories are:
Fixtures and ﬁ ttings – between 10% and 25%
Computers and electronic equipment – between 25% and 50%
Motor cars – 25%
Tangible ﬁ xed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is 
assessed by reference to the higher of value-in-use and net realisable value. 
Any impairment in value is charged to the proﬁ t and loss account in the 
period in which it occurs.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are included in the balance sheet 
at cost, less any provisions for impairment.
Operating leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the proﬁ t and loss account 
in the period to which the payments relate. Incentives received or paid to 
enter into lease agreements are released to the proﬁ t and loss account on 
a straight line basis over the lease term or, if shorter, the period to the date 
on which the rent is ﬁ rst expected to be adjusted to the prevailing market rate.
Pensions
The Company operates deﬁ ned beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned contribution pension 
schemes for its employees. A deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan is a pension plan that 
deﬁ nes an amount of pension beneﬁ t that an employee will receive on 
retirement. A deﬁ ned contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 
Company usually pays ﬁ xed contributions into a separate entity. In all cases a 
separate fund is being accumulated to meet the accruing liabilities. The assets 
of each of these funds are either held under trusts or managed by insurance 
companies and are held entirely separate from the Company’s assets.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t pension plans is the fair value of plan assets less the present value 
of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation at the balance sheet date, together with an 
adjustment for any past service costs not yet recognised. The deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected 
unit credit method. The present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation is 
determined by discounting the estimated future cash outﬂ ows using interest 
rates of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency 
in which the beneﬁ ts will be paid and which have terms to maturity approximating 
to the terms of the related pension liability. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes 
in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited directly to the proﬁ t and loss 
reserve as they arise.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the proﬁ t and loss account, 
unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees 
remaining in service for a speciﬁ ed period of time (the vesting period). In this 
case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the 
vesting period.
For deﬁ ned contribution plans, the Company pays contributions to privately 
administered pension plans on a contractual basis. The Company has no 
further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The 
contributions are recognised as an employee beneﬁ t expense when they are 
due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a 
cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.

Annual Report
and Accounts
2007/08
Share-based compensation
The Company operates several equity-settled, share-based compensation 
plans. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the 
grant of options or deferred shares is recognised as an expense and is calculated 
using Black-Scholes and stochastic models. The total amount to be expensed 
over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the 
options or deferred shares granted, excluding the impact of any non-market 
vesting conditions. The value of the charge is adjusted to reﬂ ect expected 
and actual levels of options vesting due to non-market vesting conditions. 
Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (ESOP)
The ESOP is a separately administered discretionary trust. Liabilities of the 
ESOP are guaranteed by the Company and the assets of the ESOP mainly 
comprise shares in the Company. 
Own shares held by the ESOP are deducted from equity shareholders’ funds 
and the shares are held at historical cost until they are sold. The assets, 
liabilities, income and costs of the ESOP are included in both the Company’s 
and the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
Deferred tax
Provision is made for deferred tax using the incremental provision approach 
and is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates 
and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences that have 
originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date subject to the following:
Deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets 
such as property unless a binding sale agreement exists at the balance 
sheet date. Where rollover relief is available on an asset then deferred tax 
is not recognised. 
Deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries and associates only where dividends are accrued as 
receivable or there is an intention to remit these in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as 
recoverable. Assets are regarded as recoverable when it is regarded as 
more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable proﬁ ts from which 
the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outﬂ ow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be 
reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s 
balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the 
contractual rights to the cash ﬂ ows from the ﬁ nancial asset expire. Financial 
liabilities (or a part of a ﬁ nancial liability) are derecognised when the obligation 
speciﬁ ed in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
(i) Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are amortised to the proﬁ t and loss 
account using the effective interest method.
(ii) Trade creditors
Trade creditors are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
(iii) Derivative fi nancial instruments and hedge accounting
Where hedge accounting is not applied, or to the extent to which it is not 
effective, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the proﬁ t 
and loss account as they arise.
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date a derivative contract 
is entered into and subsequently carried at fair value. The accounting 
treatment of derivatives classiﬁ ed as hedges depends on their designation, 
which occurs on the date that the derivative contract is committed to. 
The Company designates certain derivatives as a hedge of the fair value 
of an asset or liability (‘fair value hedge’).
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value, the hedged 
item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged 
with the corresponding entry being recorded in the proﬁ t and loss account. 
Gains or losses from remeasuring the corresponding hedging instrument are 
also recognised in the proﬁ t and loss account.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company documents in advance 
the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument. 
The Company also documents and demonstrates an assessment of the 
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which 
shows that the hedge has been and will be highly effective on an ongoing 
basis. The effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure 
that the hedge remains highly effective.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or 
is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁ es for hedge accounting. 
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁ nancial instruments or other host contracts 
are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are 
not closely related to those of host contracts, and the host contracts are 
not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the proﬁ t 
and loss account.

9 Net pension asset/(liability)
The Company participates in both a funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme and a funded deﬁ ned contribution scheme. 
The total pension charge in the proﬁ t and loss account for the deﬁ ned contribution scheme was £1m (2006/07: £nil). 
Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme
With reference to the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme, the Kingﬁ sher Pension Scheme, Kingﬁ sher plc is one of a member of Group companies that participates in the 
scheme, and therefore the Company has accounted for its share of the scheme assets and liabilities. The valuation of the scheme used for FRS 17 has been 
based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2007 and has been updated to 2 February 2008.
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plan, as shown in the tables below, are set by the Directors after 
consultation with independent professionally qualiﬁ ed actuaries. The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time. Movements in the ﬁ nancial 
assumptions can lead to signiﬁ cant movement in the estimated obligations of the plan.
The discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index. The overall expected rate of return on plan assets 
reﬂ ects market expectations at the valuation date of long-term asset returns and the mix of assets in the plan.

Overall expected rate of return         6.8 6.5
The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension liabilities have been selected with regard to the characteristics and 
experience of the membership of the plan from 2004 to 2007.
The base mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables (PA 92 tables) projected forward to 2007 with the medium cohort 
improvement factors for males and with the standard improvement factors for females. In addition, allowance has been made for future increases in life expectancy. 
For males, the allowance is in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 1% pa, and for females, the allowance is in 
line with the standard improvements, subject to a minimum of 0.5% pa. These improvements have been set with regard to trends observed within the plan over 
the past decade. The corresponding assumptions for life expectancy of pension plan members are as follows:
         2007/08 2006/07
Age to which current pensioners are expected to live (60 now)  
– Male        87.2 85.1
– Female         85.9 86.3
Age to which future pensioners are expected to live (60 in 15 years time)  
– Male        88.8 86.2
– Female        87.1 87.5
The main ﬁ nancial assumption is the real discount rate, representing the excess of the discount rate over the rate of inﬂ ation. If this assumption increased/
decreased by 0.1%, the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation would decrease/increase by approximately £1m.

 Shares are held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (ESOP) to cover certain exercises of these options.
The last grant of options under the Executive, International Executive and Phantom Share Option schemes was made in April 2003. Under these schemes, 
participants received a bi-annual grant of options based on their position in the Group. These options are normally exercisable from the third anniversary of 
the date of the grant (up to the tenth anniversary), except where the performance condition has not been met, in which case this date is deferred accordingly. 
The performance conditions for all options have now been met, except for the grant made in April 2003. On the exercise of Phantom Share Options, participants 
receive in cash the increase in value of the allocated number of notional shares in the Company. All permanent employees (excluding those receiving Executive 
Options) were each granted options over 529 shares in both 1997 and 1998, provided that they were employed as at 19 March 1997 and in employment on 
the date of grant. These options were granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme.
Group employees, including directors, are granted contingent share awards under the Kingﬁ sher Incentive Share Scheme as part of their annual performance award.
In the prior year the Group made its ﬁ rst contingent share awards under the Performance Share Plan and the Kingﬁ sher Retention Plan. 
Under the UK ShareSave Scheme, eligible UK employees have been invited to enter into Inland Revenue approved savings contracts for a period of three or 
ﬁ ve years, whereby shares may be acquired with repayments under the contract. The option price is the average market price over three days shortly before 
an offer to subscribe, discounted by 20%. Options are exercisable within a six month period from the conclusion of a three or ﬁ ve year period. The International 
ShareSave Plan, which operates along the lines of the UK ShareSave Scheme, includes eligible employees in certain overseas locations. There are 7 ,375 employees 
in Group ShareSave Schemes, of which 111 are in the International Plan at 2 February 2008.
The rules of all schemes include provision for the early exercise of options in certain circumstances.
The Company has not repeated the disclosures required by FRS 20 as these are already included in note 31 of the Kingﬁ sher plc consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. 
The Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (ESOP)
The ESOP has been funded by a £114m interest free loan from the Company and its subsidiary undertakings to acquire shares in Kingﬁ sher plc.
The ESOP has undertaken:
to transfer shares to employees on exercise of certain options granted under the Executive and International Executive Share Option Schemes;
to pay the cash sum due on exercise of rights granted under the Phantom Share Option Scheme (the ESOP will realise the due sum if necessary by selling 
in the market sufﬁ cient of its shares to realise that sum);
to transfer the shares due on exercise of the Share Appreciation Rights granted to overseas employees under the International ShareSave Plan; and
to hedge employers NIC liabilities in relation to certain options granted under the Executive Share Option Schemes.
The ESOP’s shareholding at 2 February 2008 was 17m shares (2006/07: 21m shares) with a nominal value of £3m (2006/07: £3m) and a market value of £26m 
(2006/07: £53m). Dividends on these shares were waived for the interim and ﬁ nal dividends.
14 Contingent liabilities
The Company has an obligation to provide a bank guarantee for £50m (2006/07: £50m) to the liquidators of Kingﬁ sher International France Limited in the event 
that the Company’s credit rating falls below ‘BBB’. The obligation arises from an indemnity provided in June 2003 as a result of the demerger of Kesa Electricals.

Annual Report
and Accounts
2007/08
We have audited the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements of Kingﬁ sher plc 
for the year ended 2 February 2008 which comprise the Company balance 
sheet and the related notes. These Parent company ﬁ nancial statements 
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have 
also audited the information in the Remuneration Report that is described 
as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁ nancial statements of Kingﬁ sher 
plc for the year ended 2 February 2008. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Remuneration 
Report and the Parent company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Directors’ 
responsibility statement.
Our responsibility is to audit the Parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the 
part of the Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant 
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 
of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any 
other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Parent company ﬁ nancial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the Parent company 
ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. 
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ report is consistent with the Parent company ﬁ nancial statements. 
The information given in the Directors’ report includes that speciﬁ c information 
presented in the Operating review and Financial review that is cross referred 
from the business review section of the Directors’ report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper 
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁ ed by law regarding directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether 
it is consistent with the audited Parent company ﬁ nancial statements. The other 
information comprises only the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s 
review, the Operating review, the Financial review, the Directors’ report, 
the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Corporate Governance report, 
the Audit Committee report and the Nomination Committee report. We 
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent 
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Parent company ﬁ nancial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts 
and disclosures in the Parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the part 
of the Remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment 
of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the 
preparation of the Parent company ﬁ nancial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and 
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Parent company 
ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Remuneration report to be audited 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the Parent company ﬁ nancial 
statements and the part of the Remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Parent company ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 2 February 2008;
the Parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Remuneration 
report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985; and
the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the Parent 
company ﬁ nancial statements.

Annual Report

2007/08
The amounts disclosed for 2003/04 are stated on the basis of UK GAAP because it is not practicable to restate amounts for periods prior to the date of transition 
to IFRS. The principal differences between UK GAAP and IFRS impacting the Group are the treatment of goodwill, post employment beneﬁ ts, deferred and 
current taxes, accounting for share-based payments, leases and the valuation of properties. The Group has undergone a signiﬁ cant amount of restructuring 
including the demerger of Kesa Electricals in 2003/04. The income statement information presented below represents continuing operations only.

Protecting your investment
Kingﬁ sher plc is legally obliged to make its share register available to the 
general public. Consequently some shareholders may receive unsolicited 
mail, including correspondence from unauthorised investment companies.
Over the last year a number of companies have become aware that their 
shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas-based 
brokers who target UK shareholders offering to sell what often turn out to 
be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. They can be very 
persistent and extremely persuasive. Shareholders are advised to be very 
wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers 
of free company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation; 
Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting 
involved. You can check at www.fsa.gov.uk/register; 
The FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised overseas 
ﬁ rms who are targeting, or have targeted, UK investors and any 
approach from such organisations should be reported to the FSA so 
that this list can be kept up to date and any other appropriate action 
can be considered. If you deal with an unauthorised ﬁ rm, you would 
not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme. The FSA can be contacted by completing 
an online form at www.fsa.gov.uk; 
Inform our Registrars on 0870 702 0129. 
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company endorses will be 
included in company mailings.

This report is printed on Look paper which has been independently certiﬁ ed according to the 
rules of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The ﬁ bre used in its production has been

Tips on protecting your shareholding
Ensure all your certiﬁ cates are kept in a safe place or hold your shares 
electronically in CREST via a nominee; 
Keep all correspondence from the Registrars which shows your 
shareholder reference number in a safe place, or destroy correspondence 
by shredding; 
If you change address inform the Registrars. If you receive a letter from 
the Registrars regarding a change of address and you have not recently 
moved, please contact them immediately; 
Know when the dividends are paid and consider having your dividends 
paid directly into your bank (you will need to ﬁ ll out a dividend mandate 
form and send it to the Registrars), thus reducing the risk of the cheque 
being intercepted or lost in the post. If you change your bank account, 
inform the Registrars of the details of your new account. Respond to any 
letters the Registrars send to you about this; 
If you are buying or selling shares, only deal with brokers registered in the 
UK or in your country of residence. 
Change of Address and Bank Mandate Security 
Kingﬁ sher’s Registrar, Computershare Investor Services PLC, will not register 
a change of address or change of Bank Mandate instructions unless in writing 
and signed by the shareholder. They will take any other measures they feel 
reasonable to protect shareholders from fraudsters. Please note, shareholders 
can also update addresses and mandates via Investor Centre. This service 
can be accessed at www.computershare.com/investor/uk.

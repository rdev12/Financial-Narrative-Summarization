T wenty four  
hours at ITE
ITE is an expanding business  
and on 1 7 March 20 1 1 , the Group 
was simultaneously organising 
1 4 events in nine venues, 
six cities, four countries and 
covering seven industry sectors.
Spring and Autumn seasons are 
traditionally busy for ITE and 
each exhibition and conference 
has to be meticulously planned 
to deal with the sometimes 
unpredictable challenges that 
are associated with live events. 
Consistently delivering large 
numbers of successful events is 
a testament to the organisational 
abilities of the Group and the 
skill and commitment of its staff.

Overview
ITE’s business
ITE is an organiser of exhibitions and 
conferences specialising in emerging and 
developing markets. ITE organises high-quality 
events of an international standard throughout 
the 14 countries in which it operates. The 
business is managed in five main geographic 
sectors: Russia, Central Asia & Caucasus, 
Eastern & Southern Europe, UK & Western 
Europe and Rest of World (see Divisional Review 
on pages 22 to 31 and the Financial Highlights 
section on pages 1 to 2). 
As an exhibition organiser, ITE hires venues 
at which it stages its events and markets 
the events to both exhibitors and visitors. 
Exhibitions and conferences provide an 
opportunity for participants from national 
and international companies to meet, network 
and transact business. The exhibition media 
is the best media for suppliers to display and 
demonstrate their products to potential buyers. 
This is particularly powerful in emerging and 
developing markets where culturally face to face 
meetings are the norm and where alternative 
media, B2B publishing and on-line marketing 
opportunities are less developed. 
ITE’s strength derives from its focus on 
organising B2B exhibitions and conferences, the 
development of strong brands in key industry 
sectors and the regional expertise in the markets 
in which it operates. ITE has been operating 
in these markets for over 1 5 years and its 
experience and local knowledge are unique.
ITE’s principal business of organising B2B trade 
exhibitions accounts for 97% of the Group’s 
revenues. Conferences account for circa 2% 
of the Group’s revenues and other activities 
relating to the core exhibition business (mostly 
publishing) account for 1% of revenue. 
ITE’s sector brands are a key asset. The brands 
have been established through a sustained 
record of presenting high quality events which 
meet customer expectations. ITE events serve 
key industries including construction & interiors, 
oil & gas, food & drink, travel & leisure, motor & 
transport, fashion, medical & healthcare and IT 
& telecoms. 
ITE has an extensive office network, covering 
both the territories where our events are 
held and international sales offices in other 
countries. ITE is able to operate at national level 
where local staff are close to local industry 
trends and at an international level where our 
sales teams are in regular communication with 
key industry suppliers in our sectors. The Group 
has 26 offices across the world, each of them 
employing almost exclusively local staff.
The offices of the Group co-operate in a unique 
way. Each office sells its own exhibitions, but 
participates with equal levels of commitment in 
the exhibitions organised by other offices. This 
holistic approach has been carefully cultivated 
through the years and enables ITE’s business to 
follow long-established trading patterns.

Group performance
The Group has delivered record financial  
results following a strong operating 
performance. Revenues of £1 55.5 million  
(2010: £1 1 3.5 million) and headline profit 
before tax of £51.4 million (2010: £36.6 million) 
have resulted from increased volume sales of 
644,000m
2
 (2010: 491,000m
2
). Pre-tax profit for 
the year was £39.1 million (2010: £31.3 million). 
This growth combines a first time contribution 
from acquisitions made during the year with a 
strong recovery in the Group’s principal trading 
market, Moscow, and with the holding of its 
largest biennial event, the Moscow International 
Oil & Gas Exhibition.
Headline diluted earnings per share of 16.6p  
is a 43% improvement on last year’s comparable 
figure of 1 1.6p per share; fully diluted earnings 
per share was 1 2.6p (2010: 9.8p). The Group 
has finished the year with a positive net cash 
balance of £5.5 million (2010: £23.0 million) 
after making investments of about £50 million 
to expand its portfolio of events. The Group 
remains highly cash generative and, as at  
25 November 201 1, had a net cash balance of  
£4.6 million, after paying for the recently 
announced Autoexpo acquisition. 
The Group made three important acquisitions 
in the year, all of which were consistent with 
its strategy for growth in its target emerging 
markets. MVK, primarily a Moscow exhibition 
business, was acquired in December 2010 and 
brought good market positions in sectors where 
ITE had little or no representation. The Group 
extended its presence in the growing regional 
markets of Russia by acquiring an exhibition 
business based in Krasnodar in March 201 1. In 
July 201 1, the Group completed the acquisition 
of 60% of Yapibuild which is the major 
construction event in Turkey.
Board and management
The Board has seen some changes during 
the year. Malcolm Wall moved abroad and 
consequently stepped down as a Non-executive 
Director at the end of August 201 1. I would like 
to thank Malcolm for his contribution over the 
last five years and particularly for chairing the 
Remuneration Committee since 2008. Linda 
Jensen joined the Board as a Non-executive 
Director in July 201 1. Linda has relevant and 
current experience having worked in Russia for 
five years and is now running a media business 
based in Eastern Europe. She brings to the 
Board substantial emerging market business 
knowledge. Neil England, who has been a 
Non-executive Director of the Group since 
2008, has taken on the role as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee.
To support its growth strategy, the Board has 
worked to strengthen further the executive 
and senior management team. Outstanding, 
committed employees support the management 
team throughout our territories and the Board 
would like to extend its thanks and appreciation 
for their efforts over the past year.
The Board fully supports the updated UK 
Corporate Governance Code and recognises 
that good governance supports the long-term 
health of the Group. We are conscious of our 
stewardship responsibilities including our role 
in setting values which underpin our Group 
culture. As Chairman, I am mindful of my 
personal responsibility for leading the Board 
and ensuring it operates effectively. The Board 
Effectiveness Review carried out during the 
year confirmed the Board and its Committees 
continue to work effectively and the insights 
provided have been used to set a clear action 
plan for the year ahead.
Dividend
The Board has a good record of maintaining 
a progressive dividend policy while ensuring 
earnings cover of more than two times across 
the biennial cycle. The interim dividend was 
increased from 1.7p to 1.9p and the proposed 
final dividend is 4.2p (2010: 4.0p), making a full 
dividend for the year of 6.1p (2010: 5.7p. The 
final dividend will be paid on 1 3 February 201 2.
Outlook
The Group has enjoyed a strong recovery in 
its core Moscow market. The regional markets 
in Russia have also enjoyed a recovery and 
the adjacent CIS markets are now showing 
improving results, albeit not yet as strongly 
as in Russia. There is expected to be further 
economic growth in Russia this year as well as a 
continuation of the recovery in the CIS markets.
At 25 November, forward bookings are 
£93 million which is in line with the Board’s 
expectations and on a basis represents growth 
of circa 8% over last year’s revenues booked at 
the same time. The Group has a strong portfolio 
of exhibitions in emerging and growing 
markets. With its cash flow and strong balance 
sheet, the Group is in an excellent position to 
continue to grow its business both organically 
and through selective acquisitions. The Board 
remains focused on executing its strategy and, 
whilst ITE is not immune to changes in the 
world economy, the Board remains confident  
of the Group’s future prospects.

Governance Financial statements Business review Overview
The Group’s performance 
The Group has delivered a strong financial and 
operating performance in a year which saw 
the momentum of last year’s nascent recovery 
in the Moscow business continuing through 
the year and spreading to related CIS markets. 
Trading conditions have been strongest in the 
Moscow exhibition market which accounts 
for circa 51% of the Group’s annual revenues. 
The Group’s like-for-like volume sales reflect 
this improved trading environment with a 1 5% 
increase over last year. In addition, the Group 
completed three important acquisitions in the 
year. These acquisitions and the reported return 
to economic growth in its markets have helped 
ITE to become a broader and stronger business. 
Revenues for the year increased by 37% to 
£1 55.5 million (2010: £1 1 3.5 million). A first 
time contribution from the newly acquired 
businesses accounted for £16 million of the 
increase and £26 million was from organic 
growth and the biennially recurring Moscow 
International Oil & Gas Exhibition. On a 
like-for-like basis revenues grew 18% year on 
year. The effect of currencies on the Group’s 
revenues was negligible as average Euro-
Sterling exchange rates over the year were 
largely unchanged from the previous year. The 
Group’s reduced gross margin of 48% has been 
affected by the addition of lower yielding event 
portfolios in the newly acquired businesses. 
The additional overhead costs associated with 
adding two large portfolios of events has 
contributed to an increase in administrative 
expenses before amortisation costs to £24.1 
million (2010: £19.9 million). The net impact 
of these changes on operating profit margins 
(before amortisation and transaction costs) has 
been an increase from 32% to 33%.
Business development
The Group has successfully completed three 
significant acquisitions in the last year. In 
December 2010, the Group announced the 
acquisition of the MVK portfolio of events in 
Moscow. This portfolio of events had little 
overlap with ITE’s existing Moscow portfolio 
and has provided the Group with access to 
new sectors as well as a broader exposure to 
the Russian economy. The principal events 
acquired through MVK include packaging, 
printing and furniture events, which can now 
be counted alongside ITE’s traditional Moscow 
sector strengths in construction, oil and gas, 
travel and tourism, food, transport and security. 
The new events have local Russian exhibitors 
as their main customer base and ITE now has 
the opportunity to increase the international 
customer base for these events. The MVK 
portfolio contributed £9.2 million of revenue 
and £3.7 million of profits before tax to the 
201 1 result.
In March 201 1 the Group announced the 
acquisition of a regional exhibition business 
in Krasnodar that is located in the South-West 
of Russia. Krasnodar is in an increasingly 
prosperous region and is near to the cities 
of Sochi (Winter Olympics venue in 2014 and 
FIFA world cup venue in 2018) and Rostov-
on-Don. The exhibitions acquired reflect the 
local industries and agricultural bias of the 
region. The biggest events are agriculture, 
construction, wine and tourism but overall 
the business runs more than 20 exhibitions 
covering all aspects of the local economy. 
ITE is now the principal organiser both in the 
local venue and the region. This expansion 
provides a more balanced geographic 
exposure to Russia complementing the existing 
businesses operating in St Petersburg, Moscow 
and Novosibirsk. The Krasnodar portfolio 
contributed £4.3 million of revenue and £1.2 
million of profits before tax to the 201 1 result.
In July 201 1 ITE announced the acquisition of 
60% of the leading construction events portfolio 
in Turkey. The Yapi portfolio comprises the 
largest and longest running construction 
exhibition in Istanbul, Yapibuild, together with 
two smaller regional exhibitions taking place 
in Izmir and Ankara. Construction is one of 
Turkey’s main industries and strongest sectors. 
There is good potential for growth in these 
exhibitions as well as synergy with the rest 
of the ITE’s portfolio, especially as Russia and 
CIS remain strong export markets for Turkish 
construction businesses. The Yapi portfolio 
contributed £0.6 million of revenue and £0.1 
million of operating profit to the 201 1 result. 
Expanding ITE’s portfolio has created a number 
of opportunities to leverage the customer base 
and achieve synergies across the Group. Within 
the existing markets the aim is to replicate some 
of the new sectors acquired in Moscow into the 
other regional Russian and CIS markets. There 
are also added benefits from cross marketing 
the Moscow customer and visitor base into the 
new regional Russian markets and vice versa. 
The opportunities to extract additional value 
from the steps taken this year mean that the 
main focus of the Group for 201 2 in Russia will 
be on consolidation and integration.
The acquisition of the MVK portfolio triggered 
an unexpected renegotiation of ITE’s existing 
trading terms with the venue. As a result, in 
March 201 1, ITE Moscow took the decision to 
relocate a number of its leading events from 
the Crocus venue to more centrally located 
venues. The move will provide a more stable 
future for these events, but in the short term the 
scope for growth of some of the events could 
be restricted. Bookings for these re-located 
events are currently progressing in line with 
management’s expectations.

Business review
Chief Executive’s review continued
Alongside this expansion of the business we 
have continued to develop the strength and 
depth of its management team as well as the 
Group’s infrastructure. There are a number of 
initiatives to develop the Group’s management 
and the internal communication systems to 
reflect the expanded size of the business. A 
Group Human Resources Director has been 
recruited to bring more focus on Group wide 
talent development and succession planning.
While ITE’s focus in Russia and CIS will be  
largely on developing the newly acquired 
businesses, the Group will continue to look 
for opportunities to expand the business 
model both in market and by diversifying 
geographically. There are opportunities to 
increase the Group sales from Asia into ITE’s 
existing markets through expanding the 
Group’s network of international sales offices  
in the region beyond the Beijing office.
Strategy
ITE’s primary business objectives are to:
 > Create sustainable growth in headline 
earnings per share; and 
 > Create and maintain sustainable positions of 
market leadership in the exhibition business 
in emerging markets.
ITE’s strategic priorities for achieving these 
objectives are: 
(i) to continue to strengthen and develop its 
existing positions of market leadership 
(ii) to expand its business model into new 
sectors and geographies where there is 
potential to develop strong market positions 
(iii) to grow and improve its portfolio of 
international exhibition brands 
(iv) to invest in the development of management 
talent in ITE. 
ITE’s performance against its strategic 
objectives is set out below:
i) To continue to strengthen and develop 
its existing positions of market leadership
ITE’s positions of market leadership are founded 
on its strength in international sales, its strong 
brands, its established local offices and its 
longstanding relationships with venues.
International sales strength 
ITE’s strength in international sales differentiates 
it from most of its competition in Russia and 
the related CIS markets. Through its subsidiary 
sales offices the Group has established a loyal 
customer base and a specialism in promoting 
sales into ITE’s Russian and CIS exhibitions. In 
201 1 the total net metres sold by the Group’s 
international sales offices increased by 7% 
to 98,000m
2
. As a proportion of total sales 
the international element has fallen from 
41% to 38%, reflecting the acquisition of new 
businesses which are mostly weighted towards 
local sales. The Group has invested in building 
up its sales offices this year and expects to see 
an increase in international sales next year. This 
year the majority of sales were generated by 
its London office 1 2%, its German office 4%, its 
Chinese office 2% and its Turkish office 2%. 
ITE’s market leading brands
ITE has established strong brand identity in 
certain exhibition sectors. In particular, the 
Build brand in construction, the Oil & Gas events 
brand, the ITE Travel exhibition and World Food 
brands all have strong reputations as leading 
events in the Russian and CIS markets earned 
through more than 1 5 years of sustained 
good performance. The Group is working to 
establish more recognition for these brands 
outside their current identification with the 
Russian and CIS market places. There are also 
a number of new and developing local brands 
in security, packaging, furniture, printing and 
mining events. The Group is also working to 
consolidate and establish these brands more 
visibly in the international exhibition world.
The Group will continue 
to look for opportunities 
to expand the business 
model both in market 
and by diversifying 
geographically ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Governance Financial statements Business review Overview
Enhancing local office strength 
ITE’s brands have built their reputation through 
sustained delivery of successful exhibitions to 
customers. The foundation of this are ITE’s local 
offices which, like its exhibitions and brands, 
have been in place for over 1 5 years and 
today employ over 1,000 staff who organise 
the details of staging an exhibition. Critically 
they own and manage the database of visitors 
necessary for making an exhibition successful 
for ITE’s customers. ITE’s local office skills in 
Russia and CIS are a competitive advantage over 
other international organisers and a barrier to 
entry for new organisers wishing to run events 
in these markets. ITE continues to strengthen 
its local office presence through investment in 
infrastructure and training its staff. There is a 
high level of equity ownership in the Group with 
more than 56% of staff participating in equity 
schemes of some description. 
Maintaining venue relationships
ITE has established long-standing relationships 
with the venues that host its exhibitions. 
Historically ITE has supported the development 
of venue facilities which in turn has helped 
the Group’s exhibitions to grow. Through this 
ITE has acquired the rights to run its main 
exhibition themes in its chosen venues at the 
time of its choice. ITE has continued to work 
on maintaining its good relationships, though 
as noted earlier there has been a significant 
relocation of events between venues in Moscow 
this year. This year ITE have reached agreement 
to be the anchor tenant of a new 14,000m
2
 
facility in Novosibirsk. However, there will be 
new opportunities in the future with a new 
venue development expected in St Petersburg 
by 2014, and possible new venue developments 
mooted in Moscow by 2016.
(ii) To expand the business model into 
new sectors and geographies where there 
is potential to develop strong market 
positions
In existing markets this strategy means targeting 
new sectors or regions in which to acquire or 
develop businesses where there is potential for 
the participation of international exhibitors. In 
new markets ITE is targeting the development 
of exhibition businesses where there is clear 
opportunity for strong future growth.
The Group has expanded the sector exposure 
of its Moscow business through the acquisition 
of the MVK portfolio of events and in Turkey 
through the acquisition of Yapibuild. The MVK 
portfolio of events has no overlap with ITE’s 
existing Moscow portfolio and brings to the 
Group strength in the packaging, printing 
and furniture sectors. Construction is in an 
existing Group sector, and Yapibuild acquisition 
extends the Group’s representation to a new 
market. ITE also extended its regional business 
exposure in Russia through the acquisition of an 
exhibition business in Krasnodar. The exhibition 
business acquired reflects the local industries 
and agricultural bias of the region. The largest 
events are in construction, agriculture and 
tourism.
(iii) To grow and improve its portfolio of 
international brands 
The Group’s management has been developing 
initiatives to improve the strength of ITE’s 
existing international brands and to improve 
the international awareness of its strong 
local brands. By developing the international 
recognition and strength of its brands ITE 
improves the Group’s ability to ‘clone’ its  
events into new geographies. 
(iv) To invest in the development of 
management talent in ITE
ITE has benefited over the years from the 
commitment, loyalty and expertise of its 
employees. As ITE grows in its staff numbers 
and geographic spread it is important to 
maintain its culture. The Group has continued 
with last year’s process of identifying, training 
and developing selected individuals to ensure 
that quality management is generated internally 
in the future.

To increase revenues from existing exhibition portfolio Sterling revenues from existing products have increased by 18% 
in the year under review. This reflects an economic recovery in 
the Group’s principal markets. 
To increase the annually recurring volume base of ITE’s 
exhibition business 
The annually recurring volume base of the exhibition business 
increased by 35% in 201 1 from 434,000m
2
 to 587 ,000m
2
. The 
net increase in volume sales is comprised of a 1 5% increase in 
like-for-like sales of 63,000m
2
, and an additional 90,000m
2
 from 
the new acquisitions made in the year. Additional volume was 
added through 43,000m
2
 of acquired events in Moscow (MVK) 
and 33,000m
2
 of new events in Krasnodar. In addition to events 
taking place in the year the new acquisitions are expected to 
generate another 40,000m
2
 of annually recurring exhibition 
sales in the next financial year when the full year effect of the 
new businesses is reported. 
To make incremental bolt on acquisitions in support of the 
Group’s objectives
In December 2010 the Group acquired a portfolio of 
complementary exhibition subjects in Moscow through the 
acquisition of MVK, a Moscow based exhibition business. 
In March 201 1 the Group acquired an exhibition organising 
business in Krasnodar, South Russia. The acquisition is 
complementary to ITE’s existing Russian exhibition organising 
offices in St Petersburg, Moscow and Novosibirsk. In July 201 1 
ITE acquired Yapibuild, a portfolio of leading construction events 
in Turkey. 
Secure forward venue rights for significant exhibitions Of ITE’s top ten exhibitions and conferences, three have secured 
rights for three years, five for two years and two for one year. 
The Group’s management are engaged in an ongoing process of 
agreeing venue terms to ensure this objective is met. These ten 
exhibitions represent 52% of revenues.

02. Leverage our business 
model into new markets 
and geographies.
ITE’s business is about creating 
the opportunities for buyers and 
sellers of products to meet in a 
face-to-face environment. Over 
the past 20 years the Group has 
built its relationships with all 
parties involved in establishing 
a successful exhibition such as 
exhibitors, visitors, venues, staff 
and local businesses.
All parties trust ITE to deliver 
events of the highest quality – 
this trust affords the Company a 
unique opportunity to leverage 
those relationships and continue  
to grow its business in new 
markets and geographies.
The expansion of the Group over the past years has  
opened up opportunities for the Group’s exhibitors  
in several new sectors, including furniture manufacturing, 
printing and packaging in new regions of the world,  
including Southern Russia, Siberia and India. The ability  
to take existing brands to those new territories such as 
build and food to India is a compelling part of the ongoing 
relationship ITE has with its customers.

03. Grow and develop  
our portfolio of 
international brands.
In the last two decades, ITE has 
developed a number of successful brands 
that are renowned for providing effective 
marketplaces for business. ITE has 
established leading brands in a number of 
key sectors, in particular the Build brand 
in construction, but the Group also leads 
in Oil & Gas, T ravel and Food.
The Group is continuing to establish and 
enhance further brands through their 
extension into new geographies, these 
include Aquatherm, which the Group 
are now running in Moscow, Ukraine, 
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan.
Product enhancement is designed to 
accelerate the speed at which ITE’s 
events develop by focusing on delivering 
an improved ‘customer experience’ to 
help maintain market leading status. 
For example, MosBuild has recently introduced a series of initiatives  
that expand the event into a more progressive ‘365 model’ where 
it continues to produce business opportunities before and after the 
exhibition itself. The new MosBuild website supports the full range of 
interactive functions that are associated with the world’s leading trade 
events. The site will become the fulcrum of the MosBuild community, 
members of which will have access to MyMosBuild which contains 
exhibitor profiles, product databases, the facility to request meetings, 
create personalised floorplans and set reminders for attending  
conference sessions, seminars and presentations. Access to  
MyMosBuild is also available via mobile devices and ‘apps’ are  
in development and will be tested in spring 201 2. MosBuild

04. Invest in the  
development of our  
management.
ITE is committed to investing in staff development 
throughout the Group and in particular, the 
management team that supports growing events 
and the continued expansion of the business.
 
The Group employs a management structure that 
encourages creativity, promotes responsibility and 
facilitates the change that is required to maintain 
and strengthen ITE’s position as a market leader. 
This structure relies on experienced and skilled 
managers who are either nurtured through the ITE 
system or recruited for their ability to contribute 
towards the development of the business.
The management support structure has 
been strengthened in recent years with the 
introduction of a Senior Management Board 
(‘SMB’). The SMB consists of a small group of 
senior managers who represent the business by 
territory and job function. They meet quarterly 
and discuss a range of strategic and operational 
issues, sharing ideas, improving best practice 
and developing a strong sense of unity as each 
part of the Group strives to deliver better events 
for its customers year after year.
 
In 201 1, ITE created the new position of Group 
HR Director in order to continue improving 
the programme of management and staff 
training and development across all parts of 
the Company. New communication tools have 
been employed so that valuable information 
and ideas can be shared across the Group and 
more specialist roles have been created to 
develop greater levels of expertise in key areas 
of the business such as branding, database 
management, business development and 
digital.
 
ITE has talented staff and the Company will 
continue to invest in the development of its 
workforce by creating the right environment, 
the right opportunities and the right level of 
support for that talent to flourish.
Staff numbers per office
Over two decades, ITE has built a reputation for 
producing effective and respected trade events 
in growing and developing markets. This has 
been achieved by setting standards that exceed 
customer expectations as well as the standards 
delivered by rival organisers.
 
As competition naturally intensifies and 
expectations grow, ITE has to meet the 
challenge of constant improvement. The 
Company recognises that this doesn’t happen 
by chance – it happens because of the skills, 
qualities and commitment of the Group’s staff.
 
Job satisfaction and staff retention have 
always been strengths associated with ITE. 
The Company encourages staff to seize career 
development opportunities. Staff can switch 
job functions if they possess the necessary 
skills and drive to succeed in another role. 
Others move offices, relocating to a new city or 
country in order to progress. There are no fewer 
rewards for those who chose to stick with their 
profession of choice, because working for ITE 
provides the variety of products, markets and 
projects for people to constantly develop and 
test their talents. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

The year has been one of improving trading 
conditions, most notably in Moscow which 
was in full recovery from the beginning of 
the financial year and has been operating in 
a ‘business as usual’ environment from the 
middle of 201 1. The Group’s other Russian and 
CIS markets have followed this trend, albeit at a 
slower pace, and the Group is now experiencing 
a recovery in these markets. 
Overall in 201 1 the Group ran 21 1 events  
(2010: 167). The increase in the number of 
events a mix of acquisitions and new launches. 
A detailed analysis of volumes, revenues and 
gross profits from the Group’s exhibition and 
conference activities is detailed below:
This has been a record year for ITE with the 
results reflecting a return to economic growth 
in the Group’s markets, a first time contribution 
from newly acquired businesses and the 
positive effect of the Group’s stronger biennial 
events running in the year. In total the Group 
saw volume sales increase by 31% to 644,000m
2
 
and revenues by 37% to £1 55.5 million. Like-for-
like volume sales grew by 1 5% and revenues 
grew by 18%. The Group’s largest events are 
the leading international events in their territory 
and their sector. Such large international events 
respond strongly and quickly when economic 
recovery begins, which is evidenced in the 
Group’s trading performance this year.

In Russia ITE now operates through four offices, 
Moscow, St Petersburg, Novosibirsk and from 
March this year Krasnodar, a city in the South 
West of Russia. During the year the Group held 
104 events in Russia, with total volume sales of 
344,500m
2
 (2010: 205,300m
2
). Revenues of £106 
million were 60% higher than last year, reflecting 
a combination of organic growth, acquisitions 
impacting for the first time in the period and the 
return of the biennial Moscow International Oil 
and Gas event. On a basis volume sales in Russia 
were up 1 9% and revenues 25%.
The Russian economy is growing at a good 
pace, with GDP growth in excess of 4% in 
201 1 and similar levels forecast for 201 2. 
This backdrop of economic growth allied to 
the late cycle nature of the industry and the 
Group’s market leading events has resulted 
in an improved performance for the region’s 
exhibitions. This has been reflected in all the 
Group’s Russian offices with Moscow, the 
Group’s principal operation, leading the way and 
the smaller regional offices following. Overall, 
sales to local exhibitors have recovered more 
quickly than international exhibitors and have 
been the driving force behind the growth.
In Moscow where seven of the Group’s largest 
events are held, the recovery was well under 
way from the beginning of the financial year 
supporting a strong performance from the 
first half events. The Moscow International 
Travel and Tourism exhibition posted a record 
performance with volume sales of 21,000m
2
 
(2010: 19,500). The strong growth of this event 
was despite a reduction in space from leading 
Southern European travel destinations such as 
Greece and Italy, where Government support 
(to their own national exhibitors) was affected 
by austerity measures. The second half of 
the year had already experienced a recovery 
in the previous year and saw further growth 
with the Group’s leading events performing 
strongly. TransRussia, the Group’s leading 
logistics event has weathered the recession 
well and volume sales this year increased by 
18% to 8,700m
2
 (2010: 7 ,400m
2
). There was an 
excellent recovery for the Group’s construction 
event, Mosbuild, which grew volumes sales 
by 24% to 77 ,600m
2
 (2010: 62,700m
2
). The 
event remains the clear market leader in the

Governance Financial statements Business review Overview
Russian construction sector, but following a 
change in venue arrangements this year, future 
growth may be restricted in the short-term. 
In June the Group held the biennial Moscow 
International Oil & Gas Exhibition, which 
recorded exceptional growth with volume 
sales increasing by 32% to 22,800m
2
 (2009: 
17,300m
2
) and produced record revenues. In 
September WorldFood Moscow, which had been 
the first of the Group’s large events to return to 
growth last year, posted a further 9% volume 
increase to 22,800m

 (2010: 20,900m

).
In December 2010, the Group purchased the 
exhibition portfolio of MVK, at the time the 
third largest portfolio of exhibitions by volume 
operating in Moscow. On acquisition the 
operations of MVK were merged with the Group’s 
existing Moscow business, and this proved 
invaluable in ensuring a very smooth integration 
of the business. However, the acquisition of MVK 
triggered a change in the relationship with the 
Crocus venue who announced their intention 
to run events competitive to some of the ITE/
MVK events held at the venue. Consequently 
ITE has re-located some events to other venues 
in Moscow for 201 2. MVK brings to the Group 
a number of new sectors including two events 
which now feature within the Group’s ten 
most profitable events. EuroExpoMebel takes 
place each May and is one of Moscow’s largest 
furniture events with volume sales of 1 4,200m
2
, 
and Rosupak which takes place in June serves 
the packaging industry and this year recorded 
volumes sales of 1 1,500m
2
. Both results were 
ahead of initial expectations. 
In St Petersburg, where the recovery lagged 
Moscow by six months, trading was markedly 
improved over the previous year with volume 
sales up 20% and revenues up by 14%. There 
was good growth across all sectors, but most 
importantly for this construction dominated 
portfolio, a strong return to growth for 
Interstroyexpo, the region’s leading event, 
which improved its volume sales by 34% to 
8,600m
2
 (2010: 6,400m
2
). The St Petersburg 
business has not yet recovered its 2008 market 
size, but further recovery is expected albeit 
at a slower pace than this year. A new venue 
development is planned for St Petersburg due 
for completion in 2014.
Sibfair, the Group’s operation in Novosibirsk, 
Siberia, held 34 events during the year with 
volume sales of 37 ,500 m
2
 (2010: 36,000), an 
improvement of 4% over the previous year. The 
region had a similar trading pattern to that of 
St Petersburg, with growth improving as the 
year progressed, although the broader based 
portfolio of this region which had protected it 
during the downturn resulted in less marked 
levels of rebound growth. ITE has recently 
agreed terms to become the anchor tenant of a 
new 14,000 m
2
 state of the art exhibition centre 
located close to the airport. The additional 
international quality space is expected to 
provide a platform for growth in the Group’s 
exhibition business. 
In March 201 1 the Group purchased Karsnodar 
Expo, the principal organiser of the area’s 
exhibitions. Krasnodar is in the South West of 
Russia, will be one of the host cities for the 2018 
FIFA World Cup and is located just two hours 
from Sochi where the 2014 Winter Olympics 
will take place. The region which is the centre 
of the Russian agricultural industry is one of the 
most prosperous outside Moscow and is now 
attracting increasing numbers of international 
manufacturers. The exhibition portfolio covers 
a broad range of sectors, the largest events 
being in the agriculture and construction 
sectors. During the seven months under ITE 
ownership the office ran 1 7 events, the largest 
of which was the construction event. In total the 
new business contributed volume sales of over 
32,000m
2
 and generated over £4 million  
in revenues.

Governance Financial statements Business review Overview
The Eastern and Southern Europe region is 
represented by the Group’s offices in Turkey and 
Ukraine. Overall the region sold 185,900m
2
 in 
201 1 (2010: 1 78,600m
2
) which on a like-for-like 
basis represented an increase of 1 2% in volumes 
and 1 1% in revenues. Both regions experienced 
solid growth, with Ukraine reflecting the benefit 
of some economic stability. In Turkey, which 
was relatively unaffected by the economic 
recession, the Group acquired 60% of the 
Yapibuild portfolio, which comprises the leading 
construction events in the Turkish market. The 
acquisition strengthens ITE’s leading position in 
the building materials and construction sectors 
and is consistent with the Group’s strategy of 
building market leading positions in its core 
markets and sectors.
Ukraine
Despite the recent economic and political 
difficulties, Ukraine remains an attractive 
market for ITE. The country has a population in 
excess of 45 million and forecast GDP growth 
of 5% per annum in the short to medium-term. 
It has significant natural resources, notably 
iron ore and coal, plus recent findings of shale 
gas reserves which provide opportunities for 
sustained growth that should impact positively 
on ITE’s operations in this country.
Following a return to steady economic growth in 
201 1, the Group’s Ukrainian business delivered 
modest growth of 5% with volume sales for the 
year of 33,600m
2
 (2010: 32,000m
2
). The largest 
event in the portfolio is Aquatherm (serving 
the heating, ventilation and air conditioning 
sectors), acquired by the Group in 2010. This 
event continued to grow in 201 1 delivering 
volume sales of 1 5,300m
2
 (2010: 14,200m
2
).
Turkey
The Turkish economy is continuing to grow 
and the country is now established in the 
second tier of emerging market economies. 
These economies are seen as offering potential 
for long-term above average economic 
growth, and are characterised by a growing 
aspirational middle class population, expected 
to drive consumer demand. The market is 
characterised by two types of exhibitions, those 
that principally serve the domestic market 
and are dominated by local trade associations 
which tend to be low cost/low margin 
events, and those that attract international 
exhibitors which tend to be higher yielding/
higher margin events. ITE’s portfolio of events 
has until recently been biased toward the 
domestic market. The acquisition of EMITT (East 
Mediterranean International Travel & Tourism 
event) in 2009 and of Yapibuild in July this year 
has changed the composition of the Turkish 
business. In the medium-term the Group aims to 
raise the margins in its more domestic events by 
increasing the level of international participation
During 201 1, the existing portfolio performed 
well with volume sales of 1 52,400 m
2
 (2010: 
15 3,900m
2
) these figures include some biennial 
events, and on a basis volume sales were ahead 
of last year by 5% and revenues by 7%. The 
most significant contribution was from  
the biennial TATEF (industrial metal working) 
event, which offset the non-occurrence of 
the biennial Ankomak event this year. The 
exhibition industry in Turkey is fragmented  
and offers the Group further opportunities  
for investment in events.

Governance Financial statements Business review Overview
ITE’s principal offices in Central Asia are in 
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. This 
year the ITE organised a total of 70 events 
across these territories delivering total volume 
sales of 67 ,000m
2
, an increase of 1 1% over 
the previous year. Revenues of £22 million 
also represented an increase of 1 1% over the 
previous year.
All of the economies in this region are 
dependent on Oil & Gas for their overseas 
earnings and economic wealth. The return to oil 
prices in excess of $100 a barrel has increased 
confidence within these economies and helped 
fuel good economic growth, which has been 
reflected in the growth of ITE’s business in the 
region this year. 
Kazakhstan
Kazakhstan began to emerge from economic 
recession in early 2010 with accelerated growth 
in 201 1, delivering volume growth of 7% and 
revenue growth of 5%. The late-cycle nature 
of the exhibition industry means that this 
growth is only now being fully reflected in the 
performance of the Kazakhstan business.
The region has two principal sectors of 
operation, Oil & Gas and Construction. The 
region’s largest event is the Kazakhstan Oil & 
Gas exhibition which took place in Almaty in 
October 2010 and achieved sales of 7 ,800m
2
, 
similar to the prior year performance. 
The related conference was affected by a 
competitive conference in Astana and revenues 
were circa 1 5% lower than the previous year. 
However, ITE has since acquired the rights to 
run the competitive conference, which has 
helped an improved performance in the 201 1 
event. The construction sector is recovering 
slowly after the property crash of 2008. 
Kazbuild, ITE’s local construction event grew by 
9% to 5,500m
2
, but is still considerably below its 
2007 peak.
ITE continues to enjoy a good working 
relationship with Atakent, the principal venue 
in Almaty. At present Atakent offers the Group 
sufficient space in which to operate its events.
Azerbaijan
ITE became the anchor tenant at the new 
20,000m
2
 exhibition centre in June 2010. This 
new larger venue has afforded the Group 
the opportunity to grow previously space 
constrained events and to launch new events in 
new sectors such as automotive and plastics. 
This year the region achieved volume sales of 
18,600m
2
 a 23% increase over the previous year 
and advanced revenues by over 30%.
Uzbekistan
ITE’s Uzbekistan business showed steady 
growth in 201 1, following very strong growth in 
2010. The Oil & Gas event remains the region’s 
dominant event, accounting for over one third 
of revenues. Overall the region sold 10,100m
2
 
an improvement of 4% on a like-for-like basis.

Governance Financial statements Business review Overview
Revenue and gross profit 
Revenue for the year was £1 55.5 million  
(2010: £1 1 3.5 million) and gross profits for the 
year were £74.9 million (2010: £55.3 million). 
Administrative expenses across the Group 
increased to £35.1 million from £25.8 million 
in the previous year. Administrative expenses 
include significant non-cash items, including 
an amortisation charge of £10.7 million on 
acquired intangibles (2010: £5.8 million) 
reflecting the impact of acquisitions made 
during the year together with a full-year’s 
charge for acquisitions made during 2010,  
a charge for share-based payments of  
£1.7 million (2010: £1.4 million), foreign 
exchange losses of £0.2 million (2010: loss of 
£0.1 million) arising on the translation of foreign 
currency denominated assets held by overseas 
Group companies and an impairment charge of 
£0.1 million against a small event in Turkey. 
Excluding these non-cash items administrative 
expenses increased by £3.9 million to £22.4 
million (2010: £18.5 million), with £1.4 million 
being overheads relating to acquisitions 
made during the year, and £0.3 million being 
an increase in transaction costs relating to 
completed and pending acquisitions, which 
totalled £1.2 million in 201 1 (2010: £0.9 million). 
Overall, Group administrative expenses 
excluding non-cash items and transaction 
related costs represented 14% of revenue  
(2010: 16%).
Operating profit was £40.0 million against a 
prior year profit of £29.9 million, resulting in 
net operating margins of 26% (2010: 26%) for 
the year. The result in both years is impacted 
by the significant increase in amortisation 
and impairment charges. After adjusting for 
amortization on acquired intangibles and 
impairment operating profit for this year is 
£50.8 million (2010: £35.8 million), yielding an 
operating margin of 33% (2010: 32%)
Headline pre-tax profit this year was £51.4 
million (2010: £36.6 million).
Other operating income £0.3 million 
(2010: £0.3 million)
Other operating income represents rental 
income earned from subletting surplus office 
space, principally at ITE’s London office.
Investment revenue £0.6 million  
(2010: £1.1 million)
Investment revenue came primarily from 
interest on bank deposits which increased  
to £0.4 million this year (2010: £0.3 million). 
Gains on derivative financial instruments  
were £14,000 during the year compared to  
£0.2 million in 2010. 
Finance costs £1.5 million 
(2010: £0.6 million)
Finance costs of £1.5 million (2010: £0.6 million) 
represent the interest cost of the Group’s 
borrowings in Euro and US Dollar (£0.7 million), 
bank charges (£0.3 million) and the additional 
cost of the exercise of the first part of the Ekin 
Fuar put option (£0.3 million). This additional 
cost results from a better than anticipated 
performance of Ekin Fuar in comparison to the 
Group’s expectations at the time of acquisition.
The Group enters into currency borrowing 
arrangements as part of its currency hedging 
activity and at 30 September 201 1 the Group 
had currency borrowings in the form of 
overdrafts of €1 3.3 million, and US$3.7 million, 
equivalent to a total of £1 3.9 million (2010: 
£10.2 million). In addition the Group had term 
loans drawn in Euros totalling £14.5 million 
which were used to finance the acquisition of 
MVK in December 201 1.
Tax charge
The tax charge of £8.3 million represents 21% 
of profit before tax (2010: 23%). The Group 
continues to focus on tax efficiency across 
the Group, with the reduction in the tax rate 
this year resulting from further effects of 
the lowering of underlying corporation tax 
rates within the main operating economies, a 
reduction in the tax charged on the repatriation 
of overseas profits and the release of provisions 
as a result of agreeing prior year tax positions 
in the UK. The lower levels of underlying 
corporation tax, if sustained, will continue to 
benefit the Group’s tax rate in the future.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share increased by 28% to 
1 2.8p (2010: 10.0p). Diluted earnings per share 
increased to 1 2.6p (2010: 9.8p).
The Group achieved headline diluted earnings 
per share of 16.6p (2010: 1 1.6p). Headline 
diluted earnings per share are based upon profit 
for the financial year attributable to equity 
holders of the parent, before amortisation and 
impairment of acquired intangible assets and 
goodwill, any profits or losses on disposal of 
Group undertakings, revaluation of financial 
liabilities in relation to put options over non- 
controlling interests and transaction costs 
relating to completed and pending acquisitions 
and disposals.
Dividends
The Group has recommended a final dividend 
of 4.2p per share for 201 1, to bring the total 
dividend for the year to 6.1p per share  
(2010: 5.7p).
The group continues to 
focus on tax efficiency ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Return to shareholders
ITE is committed to maximising shareholder 
value through a long-term progressive dividend 
policy, set against a principle of maintaining 
at least two times cover across the biennial 
cycle, together with the re-investment of profits 
into expanding the business. Since 2007 the 
company has increased the dividend by 36% 
from 4.5p per share to a record level of 6.1p per 
share in 201 1.
Cash flow
Cash generated from operations in the year was 
£65.1 million, representing 1 27% of headline 
profits (2010: £49.7 million, 1 36%). The principal 
applications of cash were £46.5 million applied 
to acquisitions (net of cash acquired) (2010: 
£1 5.6 million), £6.9 million applied to new venue 
loans and advances (2010: £9.2 million); £1 1.6 
million was paid in tax (2010: £7 .4 million); 
and £14.1 million was distributed as dividends 
(2010: £1 3.3 million). The net decrease in cash 
balances over the year was £1 7 .5 million, with 
the Group holding £5.5 million in net cash at 30 
September 201 1 (2010: £23.0 million).
 
Acquisitions 
On 1 7 December 2010, ITE acquired 100% of the 
issued share capital of International Exhibition 
Company CJSC (MVK) for £27 .4 million in cash. 
During the financial year this group of Moscow 
based exhibitions contributed revenue of £9.2 
million and £3.7 million profit before interest 
charges to the Group’s headline results.
On 3 March 201 1, ITE acquired 100% of the 
issued share capital of Krasnodar Expo 
(‘Krasnodar’) for £8.8 million of which £4.6 
million was satisfied in cash, the vendor 
retained assets valued at £2.0 million and a 
further contingent consideration payment of 
£2.1 million. Total contingent consideration 
of £2.1 million is paid in two tranches, £0.9 
million in June 201 1 and a further £1.2 million is 
expected to be paid in December 201 1. During 
the financial year this group of exhibitions 
contributed revenue £4.3 million and £1.2 
million profit before interest charges to the 
Group’s headline results.
On 1 2 July 201 1, ITE acquired 60% of the issued 
share capital of YEMF Fuar (YAPI) for £1 5.5 
million, £1 2.5 million was satisfied in cash 
and £3.1 million is to be paid in contingent 
consideration based upon the results of the 
business for the year ended 31 December 201 1. 
During the financial year this group of Turkish 
based construction exhibitions contributed 
revenues of £0.6 million and £0.1 million profit 
before interest charges to the Group’s results.
During the year the Group paid £1.6 million 
in deferred and contingent consideration in 
relation to acquisitions made in prior years. 
As at 30 September 201 1 the Group had a 
contingent consideration liability of £4.1 million, 
the majority of which it expects to pay during 
201 2.
Net assets increased by £8.3 million to £80.9 
million. The main changes are in goodwill and 
intangibles (an increase of £50.1 million) and 
trade receivables (an increase of £5.7 million) 
offset by deferred income (an increase of £1 2.7 
million) and a bank loan of £14.5 million. 
Investment and capital expenditure
The Group’s capital expenditure on plant and 
equipment for the year was £1.3 million (2010: 
£1.1 million) and included exhibition equipment, 
office fixtures and fittings and computer 
equipment and associated software. 
Venue arrangements
The Group has long-term arrangements with its 
principal venues in its main markets setting out 
ITE’s rights over future venue use and pricing.
Expocentr is ITE’s principal venue in Moscow 
and hosts seven of its largest exhibitions 
including MosBuild, Moscow International Oil 
& Gas exhibition, Moscow International Travel 
& Tourism, World Food Moscow, TransRussia,

VVC is located in Central Moscow and hosts 
a number of events acquired with the MVK 
portfolio purchased December 2010, including 
Euroexpomebel and Intercomplekt. ITE has an 
agreement with VVC, providing rights to hold 
its exhibitions at the venue on agreed rates  
to 201 2.
Lenexpo is located in St Petersburg and hosts 
the recently acquired Interstroyexpo and Baltic 
Building Week events. ITE has an agreement 
with Lenexpo, providing rights to hold its

confirms its rights to hold its exhibitions at the 
venue on agreed rates until 201 7 .
CNR is the principal venue in Istanbul, located 
close to the City’s international airport, and 
holds all but one of the Group’s Turkish 
exhibitions. ITE has an agreement with 
CNR which secures its rights to conduct its 
exhibitions at the venue on agreed rates

The Group funds the development of venues 
and facilities where improvements will enhance 
the prospects and profitability of its business. 
The funding can take the form of a prepayment 
of future venue fees (‘advance payment’), 
or a loan which can be repaid by cash or by 
offset against future venue fees (‘venue loan’). 
Generally the funding brings rights over 
future venue use and advantageous pricing

Capital
During the year the Company issued 256,547 
ordinary shares of 1p in the year. All of the total 
new issues were pursuant to the exercise of 
options and yielded aggregate consideration 
of £38,478. During the year the Company 
made no additional purchases of shares for the 
Employees Share Option Trust (‘ESOT’). As at 
30 September 201 1 ESOT held 8,102,687 (3.3%) 
of the Company’s issued share capital (2010: 
9,978,386; 4.0%) 
Treasury
During the year, the Group experienced a net 
foreign exchange loss of £0.2 million (2010:  
loss of £0.1 million). The exchange rate for  
the Euro at 30 September 201 1 was €1.1 5:£1  
(30 September 2010: €1.16:£1); the exchange 
rate for the US Dollar at 30 September 201 1 was 
$1.56:£1 (30 September 2010: $1.58:£1).
During the year, 61% of the Group’s sales were 
priced in Euros, 19% in Rubles, 8% in GBP , 4% in 
US Dollars, the balance being in various local 
currencies. Overall 74% of the Group’s cash 
receipts for the period were collected in ‘hard’ 
currency (Sterling, Dollars or Euros) and 26% 
was collected in various local currencies, the 
majority being Rubles.
The Group uses derivative instruments and 
currency borrowings to protect itself against the 
effect of currency fluctuations on a proportion 
of its sales and its balance sheet. The Group’s 
policy on derivative instruments is that:
 > it will hedge no more than 75% of the value 
of anticipated hard currency collated sales; 
and
 > it will only enter into derivative transactions 
up to 36 months ahead.
At 30 September 201 1, the Group had entered 
into forward contracts to sell Euros for Sterling 
between October 201 1 and August 2014. The 
value of the contracts is €94.65 million at an 
average rate of €1.1 7:£1. These instruments are 
designated as hedging instruments.
During the year the Group entered into currency 
borrowing arrangements to minimise its 
exposure to foreign exchange risk on trade 
receivables. At 30 September 201 1 the Group 
had borrowings of €1 3.3 million, and US$3.7 
million, through an overdraft facility and €1 1 
million and £4.9 million through a term facility.
The Group finances its operations through cash 
holdings and banking facilities. The objective 
of the Group is to maximise investment income 
and minimise interest costs, bearing in mind its 
liquidity requirements.

Business review
Finance Director’s statement
continued
For short-term debt, such as overdraft facilities 
or debt with a term of less than 1 2 months, 
fixed or floating rates of interest are used. For 
debt with a term of greater than 1 2 months, 
when the borrowing is not covered by existing 
cash holdings, it is policy that at least 50% must 
have fixed rates of interest so as to minimise the 
Group’s exposure to interest rate movements. 
It is Group policy that its cash balances are 
not invested in instruments that would put the 
capital value at risk. All invested funds have a 
determinable rate of interest.
During the year the Group entered into a  
24 month multi-currency facility agreement  
with Barclays Bank, allowing it to borrow  
up to £1 5 million. The facility expires in 
November 201 2.
Liquidity risk
The Group policy is to ensure continuity of 
funding for operational needs through cash 
deposits and debt facilities as appropriate. 
The key requirement for the business is to 
maintain flexibility to allow the Group to take 
advantage of opportunities that could arise 
over the short-term. The needs of the business 
are determined on a rolling cash flow forecast 
basis, covering weekly, monthly and twelve 
monthly requirements. Short-term flexibility is 
maintained by holding cash in current accounts 
and high liquidity money market funds. The 
Group has overdraft facilities in place both to 
permit currency borrowing as part of its foreign 
exchange management and to allow flexibility 
in where it holds its cash balances.
Recent events in the world financial markets 
have highlighted the risks associated with 
holding deposits in foreign domiciled banks. 
The territories in which ITE operates do not 
all have internationally recognised banks and 
the Group has relationships with a number of 
domestic banks. The Group seeks to use the 
territories’ leading banks and to minimise the 
level of cash held in such banks. Of the Group’s 
total cash balance of £34.0 million as at 30 
September 201 1, 61% was held in institutions 
with a rating of grade A or above and 34% in B 
to BBB+.
Going concern
The Group and Company’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely to affect its 
future development, performance and position 
are set out in the CEO’s Review and Divisional 
Trading Summary. The financial position of 
the Group and Company, its significant cash 
balance, its cash flow, liquidity position and 
absence of long-term borrowings are described 
in the finance review on pages 32 to 37 . In 
addition, in the general information section and 
note 20 of the notes to the financial statements 
the Group and Company’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; its 
financial risk management objectives; details of 
its financial instruments and hedging activities; 
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk 
are referred to.  
After making enquiries, reviewing the Group 
and Company’s forecasts and projections and 
taking account of reasonably possible changes 
in trading performance, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue its operations 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they have adopted the going concern basis 
in preparing the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements.

Governance Financial statements Business review Overview
Risks and uncertainties
The Group identifies and monitors the key risks and uncertainties affecting the Group and runs the business in a way that minimises the impact  
of such risks where possible.
Operational risks Potential impact Mitigation
Political uncertainty and regulatory risk The Group’s business is principally carried out 
in Russia and the CIS. Changes in law or the 
regulatory environment could have an effect 
on some or all of the exhibitions of the Group. 
ITE has reduced the risk by establishing its 
business as independent Russian and CIS 
companies fully contributing to the local 
economy, and the diversity of businesses 
across sectors and geography provides 
protection for the longer-term prospects  
of the Group.
Economic instability reduces demand 
for exhibition space
Reduced demand for exhibition space would 
reduce the profits of exhibitions.
ITE operates across a wide range of sectors 
and countries to minimise the exposure to any 
single market. ITE, through its relationships 
with venues and staff has a relatively flexible 
cost structure, allowing it to manage its event 
margins in the short and medium-term. This 
was clearly evidenced during the Company’s 
performance during the recent recession.
Commercial relationships The Group has key commercial relationships 
with venues which secure the Group’s rights to 
run its exhibitions in the future.
These key relationships are regularly reviewed 
and the Group seeks to maintain its exhibition 
rights for at least three years forward for 
significant exhibitions where possible.
Venue availability Damage to or unavailability of a particular 
venue could impact the Group’s short-term 
trading position. 
The Group carries business interruption 
insurance policies which protect profits on 
its largest 23 events against such an event in 
the short-term. In the longer-term the Group 
seeks to maintain good relationships with its 
principal venues to ensure the continuance of 
availability.
Competitor risk Competition has existed in ITE’s markets for 
some years. ITE faces competitive pressures 
on a market-by-market basis.
In all of its overseas markets, ITE has a strong 
position as an international organiser, achieved 
through effective use of its international 
sales network and its established brands for 
major events. A single exhibition or sector in 
a market could have its prospects curtailed 
by a strong competitor launch; however, the 
breadth of ITE’s portfolio of events, with its 
geographic and sector diversity, reduce the 
risk of a competitive threat to the Group’s 
overall business.
People ITE’s employees have long-standing 
relationships with customers and a unique 
knowledge of the exhibitions business. Loss 
of key staff could impact the short-term 
prospects of a specific event or sector.
ITE has sought to build loyalty in its staff by 
ensuring remuneration is competitive and 
through a wide distribution of the Group’s 
long-term incentive plans. ITE has a good 
record of retaining its key staff through both 
growth and recessionary times.
Financial risk – foreign currency risk  The Group is exposed to movements in 
foreign exchange rates against Sterling 
for both trading transactions and for the 
translation of overseas operations. The 
principal exposure is to the Euro, which forms 
the basis of invoicing and to the Ruble which 
forms the base books of the Group’s Russian 
operations.
The Group seeks to minimise exposure by:
 > Protecting a certain amount of Euro 
denominated sales with forward contracts. 
 > Utilising currency overdraft and term loan 
facilities to hedge foreign currency balance 
sheet assets. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Business review
Corporate social responsibility
Overview
The Board of ITE believes that corporate and 
social responsibility is an important part of 
the Group’s culture and that the adoption of 
good practice will have a positive impact on 
profits and increase the long-term value for 
shareholders. Due consideration is given to 
risks arising from social, environmental and 
ethical issues as part of an ongoing risk  
review process.
Social interaction
The Board of the Company is aware of both 
the benefits to its business of engaging with its 
various constituencies in a socially-responsible 
manner and the risks of failing to do so. As an 
operator of internationally-focused businesses 
in emerging markets, the Company ensures that 
it is culturally sensitive in its dealings with the 
local community and that its employment and 
development policies are non-discriminatory 
and encourage the employment of local 
nationals at all levels in the Company. 
The Company actively supports its employees 
in their support of local community projects. 
Charitable donations across the group totalled 
over £32,000 (2010: £35,000).
In Moscow, ITE’s subsidiary contributed funding 
to the continuing restoration of St Nicolas’ 
Cathedral in central Moscow. In Kazakhstan 
the Group contributed funding to various local 
charities that support a number of good causes 
including educational scholarships. 
In St Petersburg the local office supports 
a number of initiatives involving children’s 
charities. During 201 1 this has included 
providing direct financial funding as well as 
providing volunteers to assist on specific 
projects and workshops.
The Group is looking to increase further 
the number of its offices which take part in 
charitable activities.
The Board of ITE believes that corporate  
and social responsibility is an important  
part of the Group’s culture
Employees 
Employees are selected and promoted on 
the basis of merit and ability, regardless of 
age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation 
or disability. The Group has a policy of 
encouraging employees, especially those from 
the locations in emerging markets, to move 
around the offices of the Group, thus providing 
development opportunities for all staff. In 
addition, employees are assisted in their career 
development through an annual appraisal 
scheme and sponsored training is provided 
where there is a benefit to both the individual 
and the Company. All staff are eligible to receive 
share options or awards under the Employee’s 
Performance Share Plan as the Board feels that 
it is important for them to take an active part in 
the success of the Company and to share in the 
long-term value they help to create. The Board 
recognises the need to provide a safe working 
environment for employees and exhibitors 
and visitors at the Group’s events. Each office 
is responsible for ensuring that their business 
operates in compliance with Group policies and 
the relevant local health and safety legislation. 
During the year, all employees in the London 
office have had a ‘refresher’ Health and Safety 
training session. Staff from all regions with lead 
responsibility for the operation of the Group’s 
exhibitions on-site also attended an updated 
training course.
Ethics
Integrity is core to the Group’s values which 
it actively promotes in its dealings with 
employees, shareholders, customers and 
suppliers and with the authorities of the 
countries in which it operates, and recognises 
that reputation is a valuable and fragile asset 
gained over a substantial period. The leadership 
position of the Group’s exhibitions and the long-
term growth of its core shows is a testament to 
the success of its practices. International children’s day at orphanage #1 2 in

Governance Financial statements Business review Overview
The Group promotes high ethical standards in 
carrying out its business activities and has clear 
guidelines for dealing with gifts, hospitality, 
corruption, fraud and the use of inside 
information. All ITE staff are required to comply 
with the laws and regulations of the country in 
which they operate. 
The Group is a member of UFI (the Worldwide 
Exhibition Organisers Association) and 
through this, the attendance figures at our 
key exhibitions are audited by independent 
services. This helps to provide assurance to our 
exhibitors and visitors as to the standard of our 
exhibitions.
The Group aims to provide high quality of 
service at all its events in all locations. The 
Group operates to a strict minimum quality level 
to ensure events are provided to exhibitors and 
visitors at international standards, irrespective 
of where they are held.
The Group ensures that all advertising and 
public communications avoid untruths or 
overstatements.
ITE builds a relationship with suppliers based on 
mutual trust and undertakes to pay suppliers 
on time and in accordance with agreed terms 
of business. All information regarding the 
relationship between the Group and a supplier 
must remain confidential.
Environment
As a media services company, the Group 
acknowledges that its business has an impact 
on the environment, albeit relatively minor, 
and ITE recognises the importance of following 
good environmental practice. The Company is 
aware that this is an area of increasing concern 
to employees, shareholders and customers 
alike. The Company does not manufacture or 
sell any tangible products and has identified 
the principal areas of environmental impact as 
energy use, waste recycling, paper and printing 
and travel. 
The London and Huddersfield offices continued 
to engage the services of ‘Carbon Smart’. During 
201 1, ‘Carbon Smart’ re-assessed these offices’ 
Carbon Footprint. Their carbon footprint was 
found to have been significantly reduced to 31 2 
tonnes CO
2
e (2010: 427 tonnes) which equated 
to 2.3 tonnes of CO
2
e per employee per year 
(2010: 3.3 tonnes). This compares favourably 
to the average UK employee (4 tonnes of CO
2
e 
emissions per year), however, it is recognised 
that improvements can be made. The London 
and Huddersfield offices have set themselves 
a target to reduce their carbon footprint by a 
further 5% over the next twelve months. 
As a result of the improvements made during 
201 1, the UK operation of the Group has been 
awarded the Carbon Smart Silver Award, 
following the award of the Blue Award in 2010. 
By identifying environmental improvements, 
we expect to see increased efficiencies and 
with that reduced costs and the management 
of environmental issues is part of our 
business strategy to create long-term value for 
shareholders. The Group already undertakes 
a number of initiatives aimed at reducing its 
carbon footprint:
 > The Group encourages the recycling of 
waste paper and other office waste and 
plans to increase the recycling rates and 
materials recycled throughout the Group. 
The Group continues to expand on the ‘paid 
for’ waste recycling initiative by introducing 
more waste recycling facilities to allow 
recycling of a wider range of materials.
 > The Group has installed video-conferencing 
facilities at its London, Huddersfield, 
Moscow, St Petersburg, Kiev, Istanbul, 
Almaty and Hamburg offices to reduce staff 
travel requirements.
 > Computers and IT equipment are recycled 
where possible and redundant equipment 
is either sold to staff or given to charitable 
organisations. 
 > The Group has been reducing its printed 
materials over the last few years, with a 
greater reliance on electronic media for its 
marketing materials. However, catalogues 
and delegate packs are still printed and the 
Group is implementing a set of operating 
standards to be followed by suppliers aimed 
at controlling paper sourcing and use of 
materials.
 > The Group encourages staff to use public 
transport through offering season ticket 
loans for London staff.
 > The Group is taking advantage of 
recent e-communications legislation for 
communicating with shareholders and so 
will be able to reduce the volume of printed 
materials produced with the publication of 
our Annual Report and Interim Statement.
The Group’s activities in staging exhibitions and 
conferences do impact on the environment. 
The environment is impacted through the 
utilisation of natural resources for assembling 
exhibition stands, and travel to both exhibitions 
and conferences for exhibitors, delegates and 
ITE staff. Presently, practice in controlling waste 
at different exhibition centres varies widely 
through the different regions in which the 
Group operates. The Group follows current best 
practice in each of its markets by observing 
industry and country legislation. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

(2010: 5.7p).
Capital structure
Details of the Company’s issued share capital and movements during the year are shown in note 22 of the Group accounts. The Company has one class 
of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions of the 
Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may 
result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 25. The Trustee of the ITE Group Share Trust is not permitted to vote on any unvested shares 
held in the trust unless expressly directed to do so by the Company. A dividend waiver is in place in respect of the Trustee’s holding.

Committees, copies of which are available on request, and the Corporate Governance Statement can be found on pages 46 to 56.
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company such as commercial contracts, bank 
facility agreements, property lease arrangements and employees’ share plans. None of these are considered to be significant in terms of their likely 
impact on the business of the Group as a whole. Furthermore, the Directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company and its Directors

ordinary shares to be held in treasury at a price between 1p (exclusive of expenses) and 105% of the average middle market price of a share for the five 
business days immediately preceding the date on which the share is purchased. 
No purchases were made during the year and the Directors propose to renew this authority at the 201 2 AGM.
Donations
The Group made £32,000 of charitable donations (2010: £35,000) during the year. No political donations were made (2010: nil).
Employees
The Group’s human resources strategy is to attract and retain talented, high-calibre employees focused on achieving excellent results. The 
remuneration policy is designed to achieve this aim.
The Group places great importance in the development of its staff to support the business in meeting its objectives. This is reflected in the training 
initiatives in place for staff, both internally and externally. The Group keeps employees informed on matters affecting them and on matters affecting 
the Group’s performance through regular newsletters and through meetings, both formal and informal. Employees are able and are encouraged 
to move around the Group in order to experience the business environment in other offices. The Group actively encourages the participation of 
employees in activities of offices other than their own. The Group distributes long-term incentives widely to staff in all offices. At 30 September 201 1 
approximately 56% of staff held long-term incentives in some form. As a result, the Group’s employees identify strongly with ITE’s overall objectives. 
It is the Group’s policy to consider fully applications for employment by disabled persons, bearing in mind a number of factors including their suitability 
and fit for the role, irrespective of any disability. In the event of a member of staff becoming disabled, every effort would be made to ensure their 
continued employment and progression in the Group. It is Group policy that training, career development and promotion of disabled employees match 
that of other employees as far as possible.
Supplier payment policy
The Company’s policy, which is also applied to the Group, is to agree payment terms with suppliers when entering into each transaction to ensure that 
suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment and abide by the terms of payment. The Company has no trade creditors. Trade creditors of the 
Group at 30 September 201 1 were equivalent to 4.0 days (2010: 4.5 days) purchases, based on the average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during 
the year. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4  
of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts  
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 > make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 > state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
 > prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard requires that Directors:
 > properly select and apply accounting policies;
 > present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
 > provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of 
particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 > make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 > the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
 > the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Governance
Corporate governance report
UK Corporate Governance Code Compliance
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance and supports the principles laid down in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council in May 2010 (‘the Code’). This statement describes how the principles of the Code are applied and reports on 
the Company’s compliance with the Code’s provisions. 
The Directors consider that the Company has been in compliance with the provisions of the Code throughout the financial year under review and to the 
date of this report. 
The Company has applied the principles set out in Section 1 of the Code, including both the main principles and the supporting principles, by 
complying with the Code as reported above. Further explanation of how the main principles have been applied is set out below and in the Directors’ 
remuneration report and Audit Committee report.
 
The Board
The Board of Directors (‘the Board’) currently has seven members, comprising the Non-executive Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director, an 
additional Executive Director, and three further independent Non-executive Directors. All of the Directors bring strong judgement to the Board’s 
deliberations. The Board is of sufficient size and diversity that the balance of skills and experience is considered to be appropriate for the requirements 
of the business. The Non-executive Directors are all independent of management and free from any business or other relationship, including those 
relationships and circumstances referred to in provision B.1.1 of the Code that could materially interfere with the exercise of independent and objective 
judgement. The Company considers that the Chairman was independent on appointment. The Non-executive Directors were all appointed for an initial 
three-year term and, thereafter, subject to satisfactory performance, may serve one or two additional three-year terms, with a thorough review of their 
continued independence and suitability to continue as Directors if they are to remain on the Board for more than nine years.
The Chairman and Chief Executive
The different roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are acknowledged. A responsibility statement for each of those roles has been agreed and 
adopted by the Board. 
Senior Independent Non-executive Director
The senior independent Non-executive Director, Michael Hartley, is available to shareholders if they have concerns which are not resolved through the 
normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance Director or for which such contact is inappropriate. 
The Directors
The biographical details of the Board members are set out on pages 40 and 41. The Directors have all occupied, or occupy, senior positions in UK and/
or non-UK listed companies and have substantial experience in business. The Non-executive Directors do not participate in any of the Group’s pension 
schemes or in any of the Group’s bonus, share option or other incentive schemes. At all times there has been a majority of Non-executive independent 
Directors on the Board, in compliance with Code provision B.1.2. All Directors must stand for election at the first AGM after they are appointed. In 
November 2010 the Board took the decision to adopt early Code provision B.7 .1 regarding annual re-election. At the AGM on 26 January 201 2 all the 
Directors will once again offer themselves for re-election.
Role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for the proper management of the Company. The Board normally meets not less than seven times each  
financial year and has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision making, including responsibility for the overall management and 
performance of the Group and the approval of its long-term objectives and commercial strategy, approval of annual and interim results, annual 
budgets, material acquisitions and disposals, material agreements and major capital commitments, approval of treasury policies, and assessment  
of its going concern position.
Board members receive appropriate documentation in advance of each Board or Committee meeting which normally includes a detailed report on 
current trading and full papers on matters where the Board will be required to make a decision or give its approval. 
There is an established procedure for the preparation and review, at least annually, by the Board of medium-term plans and the annual budget. The 
business reports monthly on its performance against its agreed budget. The Board receives a monthly update on performance and reviews any 
significant variances. All major investment decisions are subject to post-completion reviews.
During the year the Chairman met with the Non-executive Directors without the Executive Directors present. 
Directors’ and Officers’ insurance cover, is provided by the Company, in line with normal market practice, for the benefit of Directors in respect of 
claims arising in the performance of their duties. 
Board effectiveness review
The formal annual review of the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors was carried out before the year end. This consisted 
of an internally run exercise led by the Chairman with the assistance of the company secretary. The appraisal questionnaire used as part of the process 
was wide-ranging and included questions covering both Board and Committee performance. Individual performance was reviewed by the Chairman 
who, in turn, was appraised by the Senior Independent Director after consultation with both the other Non-executive Directors and the Executive 
Directors. 
The appraisal confirmed that the Board and its Committees were operating effectively, highlighting, as strengths, a continually improving risk 
management and control environment, an open relationship between Board members and the CEO, and strong Board dynamics in particular. The insights 
gathered from the Board review also resulted in a clear action plan for the year ahead which includes further refinement of the Group’s strategic priorities 
and options, and the development of a clear framework around succession planning and support and development of key managers. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
47
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Independent professional advice
The Board has approved a procedure for Directors to take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense, if necessary. No such advice 
was sought by any Director during the year. In addition, the Directors have direct access to the advice and services of the company secretary.
Training and development
An induction programme is arranged for newly-appointed Directors which includes presentations on the business, current strategy and shareholder 
expectations. Guidance is also given on the duties, responsibilities and liabilities of a Director of a listed company and key Board policies and 
documents. Business familiarisation involves Directors visiting exhibitions in markets in which the Group operates to gain a greater understanding of 
the Group’s activities and to meet senior managers throughout the business. Every Director has access to training as required and is encouraged to 
continue his or her own development. 
Conflicts of interest 
The Company’s Articles of Association were amended in 2009, in line with the Companies Act 2006, to allow the Board to authorise potential conflicts 
of interest that may arise and to impose limits or conditions, as appropriate. The Company has established a procedure whereby any decision of the 
Board to authorise a conflict of interest is only effective if it is agreed without the conflicted Directors voting or without their votes being counted. 
In making such a decision, as always, the Directors must act in a way they consider in good faith will be most likely to promote the success of the 
Company. 
Board committees 
There are a number of standing Committees of the Board to which various matters are delegated. The Committees all have formal terms of reference 
that have been approved by the Board which are available on the Group’s website (www.ite-exhibitions.com). Details are set out below:
The Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee comprises Neil England, Michael Hartley and Linda Jensen (following her appointment on 7 July 201 1) and is chaired by Iain 
Paterson. Malcolm Wall also served as a member until 31 August 201 1. It meets as necessary and is responsible for considering and recommending 
to the Board persons who are appropriate for appointment as Executive and Non-executive Directors. There is a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new Directors to the Board which involves the Nomination Committee interviewing suitable candidates proposed 
by either existing Board members or by an external search company. Careful consideration is given to ensure appointees have enough time available 
to devote to the role and that the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board is maintained. When dealing with the appointment of a 
successor to the Chairman, the senior independent Non-executive Director will chair the Committee instead of the Chairman. When the Committee has 
found a suitable candidate, the Chairman of the Committee will make a proposal to the whole Board and the appointment is the responsibility of the 
whole Board following recommendation from the Committee.
The Committee met five times during the year and was active in the appointment of a new Non-executive Director. An appointment specification was 
developed for the role by the Committee following a review of the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board. It included a preference 
for candidates with experience of doing business in emerging markets. External consultants were instructed to carry out a search and shortlisted 
candidates were seen by all Board members. As a result, the Committee’s recommendation of Linda Jensen’s appointment was unanimously passed by 
the Board with Linda formally joining the Company as a Non-executive Director on 7 July 201 1.
Other activities included:
 > Further development of succession planning and talent mapping processes for senior management
 > Considering the responses to the questionnaire used for the annual evaluation of the Board and its Committees, prior to review by the whole Board.
The Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises Neil England, Michael Hartley, Linda Jensen (following her appointment on 7 July 201 1) and Iain Paterson. 
Malcolm Wall served as Committee Chairman until 7 July 201 1 when he was succeeded in that role by Neil England. The Committee meets at least three 
times a year and full details of its activities and of Directors’ remuneration are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 56. Those 
pages detail compliance with the legal requirements with regard to remuneration matters. 
The Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee comprises Neil England and Linda Jensen (following her appointment on 7 July) and is chaired by Michael Hartley. Malcolm Wall 
also served as a member until 31 August 201 1. The Board is satisfied that Michael Hartley has appropriate financial expertise to fulfil this role. 
The role of the Audit Committee is to monitor the financial reporting process, the integrity of the Group’s interim and annual financial statements 
prior to their submission to the Board and the statutory audit of the annual and consolidated accounts. It is also responsible for reviewing the Group’s 
internal financial control and risk management systems, advising the Board on the appointment of external auditors, overseeing the relationship 
with the external auditors, approving auditor remuneration, reviewing the Group’s whistle-blowing procedures, reviewing accounting policies and 
compliance, and monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function.
The Committee met four times during the year. On each occasion the Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director, and other members of staff, as 
required, attended by invitation. The external auditors attended all four meetings. Significant areas of work covered by the Audit Committee included:
 > Reviewing the Group’s final and interim financial statements; 
 > Reviewing results from audits undertaken and progress against the internal audit plan;
 > Identifying, evaluating and managing the key risks faced by the Group; and 
 > Reviewing the Group’s internal control environment and its effectiveness.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
48
The Audit Committee regularly monitors the relationship with the auditors and assesses their performance, cost-effectiveness, objectivity and 
independence. It agrees the scope of the audit work and discusses the results of the full year audit and interim review each year. The audit partner who 
signs the report is not permitted to hold office for more than five years under professional rules established to safeguard independence, At each Audit 
Committee meeting the external auditors were able to meet with the Committee without management being present.
It is a specific responsibility of the Audit Committee to ensure that an appropriate relationship is maintained between the Group and its auditors. The 
Group has a policy of controlling the provision of non-audit services by the external auditors in order to maintain their independence and ensure 
that their objectivity and independence are safeguarded. This control is exercised by ensuring non-audit projects, where fees are expected to exceed 
£50,000, are subject to the prior approval of the Chairman of the Audit Committee. In addition, where a proposed service is outside the normal scope 
of non-audit services, the engagement must be approved in advance by the Chairman of the Audit Committee. In awarding work for non-audit services, 
the Group takes into account a range of factors including quality of service, cost effectiveness, and historic knowledge of the business or sector. The 
Committee has scrutinised the internal procedures of Deloitte LLP and satisfied itself that the independence and objectivity of the auditors are not 
affected by the non-audit work undertaken. 
Internal audit function 
The Group engages KPMG to perform internal control audits at its main offices. This work is coordinated by the Head of Internal Controls and 
Procedures who reports KPMG’s findings directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee considers the Group to have an effective independent 
internal audit function.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness. In discharging 
that responsibility, the Board confirms that it has established the procedures necessary to apply the Code, including clear operating procedures, lines of 
responsibility and delegated authority, which are reviewed regularly.
Business performance is managed closely and the Board has established processes, as part of the normal good management of the business, to 
monitor:
 > Strategic plan achievement, through a regular review of progress towards strategic objectives;
 > Financial performance, within a comprehensive financial planning and accounting framework, including budgeting and forecasting, financial 
reporting, analysing variances against plan, exchange rate volatility, and taking appropriate management action;
 > Capital investment and asset management performance, with detailed appraisal, authorisation and post investment reviews; and
 > Principal risks and risk management processes, which accords with the Turnbull guidance, and that the significant risks faced by the Group are 
being identified, evaluated and appropriately managed, having regard to the balance of risk, cost and opportunity. 
 
Risk management process
There is in place an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group, which has operated throughout 
the financial year. These are reviewed by the Board at each meeting and also in detail by the Audit Committee once a year. The risk framework governs 
the management and control of both financial and non-financial risks. The adoption of this policy throughout the Group enables a consistent approach 
to the management of risk at both regional and business unit level. 
In addition, during the financial year, the Audit Committee received:
 > Reports from the Head of Internal Controls and Procedures on the work carried out under the annual internal audit plan; 
 > Risk management reports, including the status of actions to mitigate major risks and the quantification of selected risks; and,
 > Reports from the external Auditors.
Through the monitoring processes set out above, the Board conducted a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control during the 
financial year. The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. In that context, the review, in the opinion of the Board, did not 
indicate that the system was ineffective or unsatisfactory and the Board is not aware of any change to this status up to the approval of this report.

Shareholder relations 
The Company is committed to ongoing engagement with shareholders and has a well established cycle of communication based on the Group’s 
financial reporting calendar. The Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director, have dialogue with individual institutional shareholders and general 
presentations are given to analysts and investors covering the annual and interim results. During the year, a presentation was made to Board members 
by the Company’s brokers to update them on the views of major shareholders about the Company. 
The Business Review set out on pages 8 to 39 details the financial performance of the Company as well as setting out the risks it faces and plans for 
the future. All shareholders will have the opportunity to ask questions at the Company’s AGM on 26 January 201 2. At the AGM, the Chairman will give a 
statement on current trading conditions. The Chairmen of the Nomination, Remuneration and Audit Committees will be available to answer questions 
at the AGM. In addition, the Group’s website containing published information and press releases can be found at www.ite-exhibitions.com.
Whistle-blowing arrangements
The Company has an established policy which enables and encourages staff to report in confidence any possible improprieties in either financial 
reporting or other matters.
Corporate social responsibility
Neil Jones, Finance Director, is the Board sponsor for environmental, social governance, community investment and other corporate social 
responsibility matters.
ASB guidance on narrative reporting
The Company considers that it is in compliance with the additional guidance on narrative reporting for UK companies published by the Accounting 
Standards Board in January 2008.
Anti-corruption policy
As part of ITE’s commitment to preventing bribery and establishing a culture that does not tolerate corruption wherever and in whatever form it may be 
encountered, a formal anti-corruption policy was approved by the Board earlier this year prior to the Bribery Act coming into force. A number of steps 
have been taken to put in place appropriate procedures in line with the guidance provided by the Ministry of Justice in order to ensure compliance with 
the legislation, the Company’s policy and related procedures. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Report on remuneration 
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and the UK Corporate Governance Code. As required by 
the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Company’s AGM at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’ remuneration report and to state whether in their 
opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the relevant regulations. This report has therefore been divided into 
separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) are the Group’s four Non-executive Directors, Neil England (Chairman) , Michael 
Hartley, Iain Paterson and Linda Jensen (following her appointment on 7 July 201 1). Malcolm Wall served as Committee Chairman until 7 July 201 1 and 
stepped down from the Board with effect from 31 August 201 1. He was succeeded in that role by Neil England. 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for:
 > Recommending to the Board the remuneration and terms and conditions of employment of the Chairman (who absents himself from discussions 
regarding his own remuneration), Executive Directors and key members of senior management; 
 > Measuring subsequent performance as a prelude to determining the Executive Directors’ and key managers’ total remuneration on behalf of the 
whole Board; 
 > Determining the structure and quantum of short-term remuneration; and
 > Granting awards under the ITE Group’s Performance Share Plans and options under the various ITE Group Share Option Schemes outlined below. 
During the year, the Committee consulted with New Bridge Street Consultants, for advice on executive remuneration and the operation of the various 
ITE Group share schemes. Neither New Bridge Street Consultants, nor any other part of the New Bridge Street Consultants group, provides any other 
services to the Company.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Company’s corporate website.
Remuneration policy 
The Company’s principal remuneration policy aim is to ensure that the compensation offered is appropriate to attract, retain and motivate Executive 
Directors and staff with the ability and experience to deliver the Company’s strategy and grow the business, having regard to the prevailing economic 
conditions and competition for such people in the markets in which the Company operates. 
In formulating its policies the Committee has regard to, and balances the following factors:
a) the remuneration packages offered to executives in companies competing in the same markets as the Company;
b) the remuneration practice in the markets in which the executive is principally based;
c) the need to align the interests of the executive with those of the shareholders;
d) the performance of the individual executive and of the Company as a whole; and
e) any amounts payable to executives in respect of services performed for the non-controlling interests of the Company.
The Committee Chairman liaises with the Group’s independent remuneration adviser and others to ensure that pay and employment conditions in 
the Group as a whole are taken into account (in determining salary levels, benefits, pension provision, bonus payments and long-term incentive 
opportunity) when framing the executive remuneration policy.
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure that the incentive structure 
for Executive Directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible 
behaviour. More generally, the Committee will ensure that the overall remuneration policy does not encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking.
In addition, the Committee regularly reviews the executive remuneration policy to ensure that it takes due account of market practice, best practice and 
the specific circumstances of the Company.
The remuneration packages of the executives comprise base salary and benefits, a performance-related bonus and longer-term share-based incentive 
arrangements. A significant proportion of Executive Directors’ remuneration is, therefore, performance related.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Policy criteria for various components 
Base salary 
Base salary levels are reviewed annually by the Committee taking into account each Executive Director’s role, experience, performance and the 
markets in which they perform their duties. The base salaries for Russell Taylor and Neil Jones, and the consultancy remuneration for Edward Strachan 
are regularly reviewed and are subject to benchmarking exercises against industry and sector comparators.
During the year under review, Russell Taylor’s base salary was increased to £400,000 pa from 1 February 201 1 and Neil Jones’ base salary was 
increased to £235,000 pa from 1 October 201 1.  These increases are broadly in line with the average annual increase awarded to UK based employees. 
A further one year consultancy agreement was entered into with Kyzyl Tan Eurasian Advisors Limited (‘Kyzyl Tan’) in respect of Edward Strachan’s 
services, resulting in a new base salary and consultancy fee payable to Kyzyl Tan from 1 April 201 1 of £300,000 pa in aggregate. The reduction in 
consultancy fee relates to a reduction in the scope of services provided by Kyzyl Tan.
Details of the Executive Directors’ base salaries for the year commencing 1 October 201 1 are also set out under ‘Directors’ service contracts’ on page 52 
of this report.
Variable bonus
Russell Taylor, Neil Jones and Edward Strachan together with a number of other members of senior management participate in performance-related 
annual bonus schemes (‘Executive Bonus Plan’), which recognise Company objectives to deliver growth of headline profit before tax. 
For the financial year commencing 1 October 201 1, Russell Taylor’s and Neil Jones’ maximum annual bonus potential provided under the Executive 
Bonus Plan will be 100% and 90% of base salary respectively. The Remuneration Committee considers that the increase in Neil Jones’ maximum bonus 
opportunity to 90% of base salary is justified due to his good performance and growing experience in the role. Edward Strachan’s annual bonus 
opportunity through the Company’s consultancy agreement with Kyzyl Tan is on the same basis as the Executive Bonus Plan. As indicated in the 
previous section, the Company entered into a one year contract with Kyzyl Tan on 1 April 201 1. For the financial year commencing 1 October 201 1, 
Edward Strachan’s bonus is capped at 100% of the Kyzyl Tan consultancy fee and his remuneration as a Director for the remaining six month period 
of the contract to 31 March 201 2. The maximum bonus potential for Mr Taylor, Mr Strachan and Mr Jones is split between financial targets (80%) and 
personal targets (20%). 
The financial element of the bonus in 201 1 was based upon the achievement of headline profit before tax. The target was based on the annual budget 
approved by the Board, but adjusted to provide an appropriate degree of ‘stretch’ and an incentive to outperform. A range for headline profit before 
tax was set of £40 million to £46 million (after excluding profits and costs attributable to the MVK acquisition), to be calculated on a straight-line basis 
from 0% of potential at £40 million to 100% of potential at £46 million. The actual results calculated on this basis were for headline profits before tax of 
£48.6 million and the maximum potential bonus for the financial element was earned by the Executive Directors. After taking account of their personal 
targets Russell Taylor, Edward Strachan and Neil Jones earned 94%, 97% and 97% of their respective potential bonus awards. 
From 201 1 payments under the Executive Bonus Plan will be subject to claw back in the event of a fraud or material misstatement of results being 
identified in relation to the year in which the bonus is earned.

The Company has operated the ITE Group plc Employees Performance Share Plan 2004 and the ITE Group plc Key Contractors’ Performance Share Plan

to key individuals who are not Group employees. 
Awards were granted in January 201 1 to Executive Directors up to 100% of salary subject to aggregate three year headline earnings per share targets. 
Further information regarding these targets can be found on page 55. The performance targets were chosen by the Committee to incentivise 
management to deliver sustained fully diluted headline earnings per share performance over the next three financial years. 
In line with past practice, it is proposed that awards for the year commencing 1 October 201 1 be made to Executive Directors in January 201 2. The 
targets calculated as above for these awards are for aggregated fully diluted headline earnings per share of 53p (for a 30% award) and 59p (for a 100% 
award) to be earned over the three financial years ending on 30 September 2014. Between 30% and 100% vesting will be calculated on a straight-line 
basis. The targets were calculated as follows:
 > Adjusting the fully diluted headline earnings per share figure achieved in the financial year ended 30 September 201 1 to remove the biennial effect
 > Applying a compound increase of 7% to establish a ‘threshold’ target for each of the three years 
 > Applying a compound increase of 1 3% to establish a ‘full vesting’ target for each of the three years
 > Aggregating the target figures for each year to produce the aggregated fully diluted headline earnings per share targets for threshold vesting (30%) 
and for maximum vesting (100%).  
Shareholding guidelines
Executive Directors are required to retain shares of a value equal to 25% of the after-tax gain made on the vesting of awards under the Plans, until they 
have built up a shareholding of a value equivalent to at least 100% of annual base salary. Further details of Directors’ interests in the ordinary shares of 
the Company are set out on page 43 of this report.
Share option plans
The Company has operated the ITE Group plc 2009 Discretionary Share Option Scheme. It is not intended that Executive Directors will participate in the 
2009 Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
Pensions 
The Company offers a stakeholder pension to its employees but currently makes no Company contribution under this scheme. 
Since his appointment as Chief Executive Officer in May 2008, the Company makes a contribution equal to 10% of Russell Taylor’s base salary to his 
personal pension scheme. 
Directors’ service contracts 
Executive Directors
Russell Taylor (Chief Executive) and Neil Jones (Finance Director) have UK contracts of employment which reflect market and best practice for senior 
management serving in the UK and have no fixed term. Notice periods and base salary details for all Directors are outlined in the tables set out below. 
Other than the contribution to Russell Taylor’s pension scheme described above, there are no contributions to pension schemes. The standard terms 
provide for medical insurance and life insurance but provide for no other benefits in kind such as company cars. 
In the event of early termination of an Executive Director’s contract, it is the Committee’s policy that (subject to the provisions of each contract) the 
amount of compensation (if any) paid to the Executive Director will be determined by reference to the relevant circumstances that prevail at the time. 
The Committee’s objective will be to avoid rewarding poor performance. Furthermore, the Committee will take account of the Executive Director’s duty 
to mitigate their loss.
Edward Strachan’s remuneration as a Director from 1 October 201 1 is £37 ,000. In addition, he is remunerated as a consultant through the Company’s 
agreement with Kyzyl Tan. This contract with Kyzyl Tan is due to expire on 31 March 201 2. The base consultancy fee under this agreement for the 
year commencing 1 October 201 1 is £263,000. Kyzyl Tan is entitled to a bonus based upon similar targets and criteria as the Executive Bonus Scheme, 
which is capped at 100% of Kyzyl Tan’s base consultancy fee and Edward Strachan’s remuneration as a Director pro rated for the six months to 31 
March 201 2. Under the Kyzyl Tan contract, Edward Strachan is required to reside in the markets where his management responsibilities are based and 
Kyzyl Tan is entitled to an annual living away from home allowance of up to $60,000 for its employee.
A new contract for the period 1 April 201 2 to 31 March 201 3 has recently been entered into with Kyzyl Tan in respect of Edward Strachan’s services for 
a base annual consultancy fee of £252,000 with an annual bonus potential of 75% of this fee. The reduction in consultancy fees reflects a reduction in 
the scope of services to be provided from 1 April 201 2.
Consistent with market practice, there are no service contracts or other employment arrangements with any of the Executive Directors with fixed 
terms or notice periods in excess of one year or terms which would expose the Company to compensation payments in excess of one year’s total 
remuneration. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

commitment and responsibilities. Accordingly the fees for the year commencing 1 October 201 1 for Michael Hartley will be £47 ,500, for Neil England 
£45,000 and for Linda Jensen £40,000. Iain Paterson’s fee will be £1 25,000 pa.
Executive Directors may accept outside appointments with the prior approval of the Board and provided only that these appointments do not prejudice 
the individual’s ability to fulfil their duties at the Company. Whether any related fees are retained by the individual or remitted to the Company will be 
considered on a case-by-case basis.

Report on remuneration continued
(1) For the long-term PSP awards granted in June/August 2009 that are exercisable from 31 December 201 3 to 30 December 2019, there are two 
performance targets applying. Half of the award is subject to a performance target based on the Group’s absolute earnings per share during the 
201 2/1 3 financial year as follows:
EPS for the 2012/2013 financial year Percentage of one half of award that vests
Below 14p Nil
14p 25%
Between 14p and 17p Between 25% and 100% calculated on a straight-line basis.
17p or more 100%
The other half of the award is subject to a performance target comparing the Company’s total shareholder return against the FTSE All-Share Media 
Sector between 1 June 2009 and 31 December 201 3. 25% of this portion of the award vests if ITE is at the median, with full vesting for upper quartile 
performance. Between median and upper quartile, an award vests on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100% based on rankings plus interpolation 
between intermediate rankings.
The cost of all share awards charged to the profit and loss account for the year ending 30 September 201 1 was £1.7 million (2010: £1.4 million). 
The ITE share incentive plans operate within a standard 10% in ten year dilution limit. This provision takes account of all potentially dilutive awards 
made by the Company under any of its share incentive plans. This is because (as with other London Stock Exchange companies) the Company does not 
operate any form of share incentive on an all employee basis and therefore does not have an internal dilution limit of 5% in ten years for discretionary 
schemes. The Committee continues to be of the view that this approach, which has been previously agreed with shareholders, remains appropriate 
and that, therefore, it would be inappropriate to introduce a dilution limit that relates to awards under discretionary/executive schemes only. However, 
the Committee will keep the dilutive impact of the share incentive schemes under regular review to ensure that the interests of shareholders are taken 
into account.
The maximum number of additional (ie in addition to the existing 1 3,565,1 21 in issue) new share issues possible under the ten year dilution limits in the 
option trust deeds is 1 1,291,753. Additionally the Employee’s Share Trust (‘ESOT’) can hold up to 5% of the Company’s issued share capital against share 
awards.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members 
of ITE Group plc 
We have audited the group financial statements of ITE Group plc for the year ended 30 September 201 1 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and the related notes 1 to 27 . The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the group financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
 > give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 30 September 201 1 and of its profit for the year then ended;
 > have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 > have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in the notes to the group financial statements, the group in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the group financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 > certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 > the directors cash-generating statement, contained within the Corporate Governance Section, in relation to going concern; and
 > the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified for our review;
 > certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of ITE Group plc for the year ended 30 September 201 1 and on the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

the consolidated results, financial position or cash flows of the Group.
Basis of accounting
ITE Group plc is a UK listed company and, together with its subsidiary operations, is hereafter referred to as ‘the Group’. The Company is required to 
prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted by the EU and therefore the 
Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. In addition, the Group has complied with IFRSs as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’). 
The preparation of financial statements under IFRSs requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application 
of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on 
past experience and other factors considered applicable at the time and are used to make judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
that cannot be readily determined from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes to estimates and assumptions are reflected in the financial 
statements in the period in which they are made. 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future as disclosed in the Directors’ Report on page 45. 
The statements are presented in pounds Sterling and have been prepared under IFRSs using the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of 
financial instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of ITE Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings controlled by the Company drawn up to 30 September 
each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated accounts continued
For the year ended 30 September 20 1 1
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the fair values of the identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. The interest of non-controlling shareholders is stated at the non-controlling 
interest’s proportion of the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised. Subsequently, any losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess 
of the non-controlling interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of 
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by  
the Group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries is identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Non-controlling interest 
consists of the amount of those interests as at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling interest’s share of changes in 
equity since the date of the combination. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of their interest in the subsidiaries equity are 
allocated against non-controlling interest even if this results in a deficit balance, except to the extent that the non-controlling interest has a binding 
obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
 
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, 
at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the 
acquiree. Any costs attributable to the business combination are expensed directly to the Income Statement. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-
current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations), which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over 
the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If the Group’s interest in the net fair 
value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured 
at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement 
period adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in 
accordance with relevant IFRSs. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured as the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net fair value of the assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and 
liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any 
impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of 
the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there 
is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit, pro rata on 
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for 
impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any 
subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill on acquisition of a foreign entity is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat 
goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs as Sterling denominated assets.
Intangible assets
Computer software is initially measured at purchase cost. Customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor databases are measured at fair 
value. Computer software, customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor databases have a definite useful life and are carried at cost or 
fair value less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. 
The estimated useful lives are typically between three and ten years for customer relationships, for some trademarks up to 20 years and for visitor 
databases between five and eight years. Computer software is amortised over four years. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Impairment of assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever 
there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or 
cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment is recognised immediately as an expense.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had 
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income 
immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation 
increase.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Leasehold improvements – term of lease
Plant and equipment – four to ten years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, or where shorter, over the term of 
the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying value 
amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation 
in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Investments in 
associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate, less any 
impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term 
interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal 
or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition 
is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that 
investment. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date 
of acquisition (ie discount on acquisition) is credited in profit or loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the relevant 
associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case an appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Venue advances
Where the Group has advanced funds to venue owners that can be repaid by either off-setting against future venue hire or by cash repayment. The 
loan balance is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the ‘effective interest rate method’. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Advances that are prepayments of future venue hire and do not permit the repayment of the principal in cash are recognised at cost as prepayments in 
venue advances and prepayments.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect 
is material. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Notes to the consolidated accounts continued
For the year ended 30 September 20 1 1
Financial instruments
Classes of financial instruments
The Group aggregates its financial instruments into classes based on their nature and characteristics. The details of financial instruments by class are 
disclosed in note 20 to the accounts.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: cash and cash equivalents, loans and receivables and derivative assets at fair 
value through profit or loss. The classification is determined by management upon initial recognition, and is based on the purpose for which the 
financial assets were acquired.
Financial assets are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether its financial assets are to be impaired. Impairment losses are recognised in the income 
statement where there is objective evidence of impairment. Financial assets are derecognised (in full or partly) when the Group’s rights to cash 
flows from the respective assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has neither exposure to the risks inherent in those assets nor 
entitlement to rewards from them.
Investments
The Group has investments in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market but that are classified as available for sale financial assets and 
stated at fair value. Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 20. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value are recognised 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve with the exception of impairment losses, interest calculated 
using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gain and losses on monetary assets which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the 
investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the investments revaluation reserve is 
reclassified to profit or loss.
Dividends on available for sale equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the Group’s right to receive the dividends is established. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible  
to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at initial recognition  
at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value with all realised gains or losses recognised in the 
income statement.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and 
cash equivalents for the purpose of the Cash Flow Statement.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. This category 
includes the following classes of financial assets: trade and other receivables and venue advances.
Loans and receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The estimates are 
based on specific credit circumstances and the Group’s historical bad receivables experience. No interest is charged on the loans and receivables, due 
to either their short-term nature or specific arrangements in place, and hence the effective interest rate method is not applied. 
Derivative assets
A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no or little net initial investment 
and is settled at a future date. Derivative assets are classified as at fair value through profit or loss. Derivative assets are measured at initial recognition 
at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the income 
statement. These derivatives are acquired in full compliance with the Group’s risk management policies.
Financial liabilities 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into the following categories: bank borrowings, trade and other payables held at amortised cost and 
derivative liabilities through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Written put options
Any contract with a single or multiple settlement option that contains an obligation for the Group to purchase equity in a subsidiary for cash gives 
rise to a financial liability for the present value of the repurchase price. An amount equal to the liability is recorded in equity on initial recognition of a 
written put option. The liability is subsequently remeasured through the income statement.
Where considered significant, the Group’s written put options are discounted to their appropriate value. The unwinding of the discount is charged 
through the income statement over the period to exercise. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income 
statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. Where bank 
loans and overdrafts are deemed to be integral to the Group’s cash management activities, they are presented within net cash and cash equivalents 
in the cash flow statement. Loan and overdraft interest and associated costs that are considered to be financing in nature are presented as financing 
activities in the cash flow statement.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade payables are derecognised in 
full when the Group is discharged from its obligation, it expires, is cancelled or replaced by a new liability with substantially modified terms. Trade and 
other payables are short-term and there is no interest charged in connection with these, hence the effective interest method is not applied.
Derivative liabilities
A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in an underlying variable, requires no or little net initial investment 
and is settled at a future date. 
Derivative liabilities are classified as fair value through profit or loss. Derivative liabilities are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are 
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the income statement. 
These derivatives are acquired in full compliance with the Group’s risk management policies.
Hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group uses derivative financial instruments 
such as foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at 
each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective 
as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The 
Group designates its derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability 
if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than twelve months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within twelve months. Other 
derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with the 
risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. At the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the 
Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values of 
cash flows of the hedged item.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured to their fair 
value at each balance sheet date. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
are deferred in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement, and is included in ‘Finance income/cost’ in the 
income statement. Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income 
statement, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or 
exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised 
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain 
or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group’s use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s financial policies. Further details on these policies can be found in the Business 
Review on pages 32 to 37 . 
Fair values
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed and 
willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
The Group determines the fair value of its financial instruments using market prices for quoted instruments and widely accepted valuation techniques 
for other instruments.
Valuation techniques include discounted cash flows, standard valuation models based on market parameters, dealer quotes for similar instruments and 
use of comparable arm’s length transactions. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Notes to the consolidated accounts continued
For the year ended 30 September 20 1 1
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business net of discounts, VAT and 
other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised on completion of an event. Billings and cash received in advance, and directly attributable costs relating to future events are 
deferred. The amounts so deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred event income and prepaid event costs respectively. Losses anticipated 
at the balance sheet date are provided in full.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Barter transactions
Where barter transactions occur between advertising and exhibition space and the revenue can be measured reliably, revenues and costs are 
recognised in the income statement. 
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after the share of results of associates and profit or loss on disposal of Group undertakings and before investment income 
and finance costs. 
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance 
sheet date. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that does not affect the tax profit or the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when 
they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or their contractual rate where applicable. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that 
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Gains and losses arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on  
the retranslation of monetary items, are included in income for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items 
carried at fair value are included in income for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which 
gains or losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly 
in equity.
Details of the Group’s accounting policies for forward contracts and options are included in the policy on derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at 
the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange 
rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transaction are used. Exchange differences arising are 
classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in the 
period in which the operation is disposed of. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
73
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Under the exemption permitted from IAS 21 (the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates), cumulative translation differences for all foreign 
operations prior to 1 October 2004 have been treated as zero. Consequently, any gain or loss on disposal will exclude translation differences that arose 
prior to 1 October 2004.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated 
at the closing rate.
Employee Share Trust
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust (‘ESOT’). Shares in the Company held by the ESOT have been 
valued at cost and are held in equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off to profit or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied IFRS 2 (share-based payment). IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were 
unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-
based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-
based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management’s best estimate.
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis. 
Benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the following judgements and assumptions have been made by management and have the 
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements or have the most risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash-generating units to which goodwill 
or intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an estimation of future cash flows expected from the cash-generating 
unit to perpetuity and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The period used in the calculation is based on management’s average 
expectation of the period over which the value will be derived from the cash-generating units. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at 
30 September 201 1 is £70.7 million and £58.9 million respectively.
Intangible assets
The valuation of intangible assets requires management to estimate the net present value of the additional future cash flows arising from customer 
relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor databases to determine the value of those intangible assets. This involves estimating the period over 
which these intangible assets affect future cash flows. 
Intangible asset useful economic lives
The life of an intangible asset is estimated by management based on the expected period over which cash flows generated from that asset will arise. 
The amortisation charge reflected in the financial statements is directly impacted by the estimation of useful lives by Management.
Share-based payments 
The Group makes share-based payments to certain employees. These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, 
calculated using an appropriate option pricing model. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options 
are the discount rate, the Group’s share price volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and expected option lives. Management regularly 
performs a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest; this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers. 
Taxation 
Being a multi-national Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a tax structure which makes the degree of estimation 
and judgement more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and is often dependent on the efficiency 
of legal processes. Such issues can take several years to resolve. The Group takes a considered view of unresolved issues, however the inherent 
uncertainty regarding these items means that the eventual resolution could differ significantly from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the 
Group’s results and future cash flows.

IFRS 8 introduces the term Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’). The Senior Management Board comprising the Executive Directors Russell Taylor 
(Chief Executive Officer), Neil Jones (Financial Director), Edward Strachan (Executive Director), Stephen Keen, Alexander Shtalenkov, Andy Braid, Colette 
Tebbutt and Suzanne King is considered to be the CODM.
ITE’s reportable segments are strategic business units that are based in different geographic locations, predominantly in the developing and emerging 
markets. Each business unit is managed separately and has a different marketing strategy as determined by the local management. The products and 
services offered by each business unit are identical across the Group. 
ITE Group evaluates performance on the basis of profit or loss from operations before tax expense not including non-recurring gains and losses and 
foreign exchange gains and losses.
The revenue and profit before taxation are attributable to the Group’s one principal activity, the organisation of trade exhibitions, conferences and 
related activities and can be analysed by geographic segment as follows:

Basic and diluted earnings per share
The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share are based on the profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent of 
£30.7 million (2010: £23.9 million). Basic and diluted earnings per share were 1 2.8p and 1 2.6p respectively (2010: 10.0p and 9.8p respectively).
Headline diluted earnings per share
Headline diluted earnings per share is intended to provide a consistent measure of Group earnings on a year-on-year basis and is 16.6p per share 
(2010: 1 1.6p). Headline basic earnings per share is 1 7 .0p per share (2010: 1 1.8p).

10 Goodwill acquired through business combinations
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from that business 
combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:
2011 
£000
2010 
£000
UK and Western Europe 14,920 14,850
Central Asia and Caucasus 7,583 7,437
Russia 37,505 23,231
Eastern and Southern Europe 9,505 3,794
Rest of the World 1,171 1,272
70,684 50,584
  
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to cash flows during the period. Management estimates 
discount rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the cash-generating units. The growth rates 
are based on management forecasts. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based upon the most recent financial plans approved by the Board and 
extrapolates the planned cash flows. Assumed growth rates based on GDP growth rates in the local markets and management judgements have been 
applied for the first three years beyond the detailed plans and a rate of between 1% and 8% is applied thereafter. These rates do not exceed the average 
long-term growth rate for the businesses in the relevant markets.
The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash-generating units are between 1 5% and 18%.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate and growth rates used. Management believes that no reasonable potential change 
in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test assumptions arising from a range 
of possible trading and economic scenarios. The scenarios have been performed separately for each cash-generating unit with the sensitivities 
summarised as follows:
 > An increase in the discount rate by 1%.
 > A decrease of 5% on forecast cash flows over the term for all cash-generating units.
The sensitivity analysis shows that an increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment of £230,000 and a decrease in the growth rate would 
result in an impairment of £200,000.

The values used in accounting for the identifiable assets and liabilities of these acquisitions are provisional in nature at the balance sheet date. If 
necessary adjustments will be made to these carrying values and the related goodwill, within twelve months of the acquisition date. The goodwill 
arising on acquisition of £3.9 million represents significant expected synergies with other operations of the Group. This acquisition is consistent with 
the Group’s existing strategy. The acquired business organises exhibitions in Krasnodar predominantly in the agricultural and building sectors.
No recognised goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Transaction costs relating to the above acquisition were £0.1 million.
Contingent consideration is due to be paid in December 201 1 and will be based on the final audited results of Krasnodar for the year ended  
31 December 2010. The Group’s current best estimate is £1.2 million. The contingent consideration is based on show profits and is unlimited. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

The values used in accounting for the identifiable assets and liabilities of these acquisitions are provisional in nature at the balance sheet date. If 
necessary adjustments will be made to these carrying values and the related goodwill, within twelve months of the acquisition date. The goodwill 
arising on acquisition of £5.7 million represents significant expected synergies with other operations of the Group. This acquisition is consistent with 
the Group’s existing strategy. The acquired business organises exhibitions in Turkey predominantly in the building and construction sectors.
No recognised goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Transaction costs relating to the above acquisition were £0.3 million.
Contingent consideration will be based on a multiple of the results of Yem Fuar for the year ending 31 December 201 1. It is estimated that this payment 
will be made by 3 April 201 2. The Group’s best estimate at date of acquisition was £3.1 million. The payment is due in Turkish Lira and is therefore 
retranslated at year end date. The contingent consideration is based on show profits and is unlimited.

Acquisition of 12.5% of EKIN (the organiser of EMITT)
On 25 July 201 1, Newex Marketing Limited, a subsidiary of the Group purchased a further 1 2.5% of the share capital of Ekin, the organiser of EMITT (the 
annual travel and tourism exhibition taking place in Istanbul, Turkey) for $1.25 million (£763,000) paid in cash. This takes the Group’s shareholding in 
Ekin to 87 .5%. Since its acquisition Ekin Fuar has performed ahead of initial expectations and consequently the Group has paid £269,000 more than was 
anticipated at the time of acquisition for the 1 2.5% stake. This additional cost is shown as a loss in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
This transaction has resulted in a decrease in the Group’s non-controlling interest in Ekin as can be see in note 23.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

The amortisation period for customer relationships is between three and ten years, for trademarks up to 20 years and for visitor databases between 
five and eight years. Computer software is amortised over four years.
The Group has split the intangible assets it acquired through business combinations during the year into three distinct categories; customer 
relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor databases. 
Previously, the Group classified all intangible assets acquired through business combinations as ‘customer relationships and trademarks’. The Group 
has not revisited the previous intangible asset classification and as such these assets remain in total in the ‘customer relationships’ category. 
The additions to customer relationships, trademarks and licences and databases of £42.4 million relate to the purchase of International Exhibition 
Company CJSC (‘MVK’), Krasnodar Expo and Yem Fuar. The carrying amounts of these intangibles at 30 September 201 1 were £1 7 .1 million, £5.5 million 
and £1 5.9 million respectively. The intangibles acquired during the year are amortised in accordance with the Group amortisation policy for intangibles 
as detailed above.

On 1 2 September 201 1, the Group purchased 40% of Scoop International Fashion Limited for £100,000. This has been accounted for using the equity 
method, recognised initially at cost. The carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the ITE’s share of the profit or loss of the associate 
after the date of acquisition. ITE’s share of the profit or loss of the associate is recognised in the income statement. Distributions received from the 
associate also reduce the carrying amount of the investment. No distributions or material losses have arisen since purchase. 
The Group has written a put option over the remaining 60% of Scoop International Fashion Limited. 
In the year ended 30 September 2010, ITE completed its exit from ITF, its 50% associate venture in Turkey by acquiring half of the associate’s events 
for its own portfolio and selling its shareholding in the associate to its former joint shareholder. This resulted in a gain of £834,000 in the year ended 
30 September 2010 and this is shown on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

The cash at bank and in hand comprises cash held by the Group and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying 
value of these assets approximates their fair value. The cash balance is represented by £4.4 million of Sterling, £9.6 million of Euros, £1.1 million of US 
Dollars, £1 2.4 million of Rubles and £6.5 million of other currencies. Surplus funds are placed on short-term deposit with floating interest rates.
The venue advances and other loans of £4.0 million due after one year are all due within five years (2010: £6.2 million due after more than five years). 
The venue loans repayable by cash are measured at fair value. The venue prepayments are held at cost. All venue advances are stated net of allowance

The bank overdrafts are all repayable on demand. Of the total overdraft, £1 1.5 million (2010: £8.6 million) is denominated in Euros and £2.4 million 
(2010: £1.6 million) is denominated in US Dollars. The borrowings are arranged at floating interest rates, thus exposing the Group to interest rate risk. 
The Euro and US Dollar overdraft are taken out to act as a partial hedge against UK monetary assets in those currencies.
The overdrafts have been secured by a guarantee between ITE Group plc, ITE Exhibitions & Conferences Limited, International Trade and Exhibitions 
(JV) Limited, ITE Overseas Limited, ITE Enterprises Limited, ITE Moda Limited, RAS Publishing Limited, ITE Moda Footwear Limited, ITE Expo UK Limited, 
ITE Russia LLC UK Limited, ITE Eurasian Exhibitions Limited and a charge over the assets of International Trade and Exhibitions (JV) Limited. The average 
interest rate on the bank overdrafts approximates 2.5% per annum (2010: 2.5%) and is determined by reference to base rate plus 1.5625%. The Directors 
estimate the carrying value of the overdrafts approximates their fair value. At 30 September 201 1 the Group had £6.1 million (2010: £10.2 million) of 
gross undrawn committed overdraft facilities.
Bank loan
The Group has a secured bank loan of £1 4.5 million (2010: nil) denominated in Euros. The average interest rate on the bank loan approximates 3.8% 
per annum and is determined by reference to a rate of 2.5% plus Euribor/Libor. The loan has been secured by a guarantee between ITE Group plc, ITE 
Exhibitions & Conferences Limited, International T rade and Exhibitions (JV) Limited, ITE Overseas Limited, ITE Enterprises Limited, ITE Moda Limited, RAS 
Publishing Limited, ITE Moda Footwear Limited, ITE Expo UK Limited, ITE Russia LLC UK Limited, ITE Eurasian Exhibitions Limited, ITE Holdings Limited, 
Intermedia Exhibitions & Conferences Limited, ITE Expo LLC, ITE LLC, ITE International Holdings BV and International T rade and Exhibitions (JV) Limited. 
The loan matures on 30 November 201 2. At 30 September 201 1 the Group had £0.5 million (2010: nil) of gross undrawn committed loan facility. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

relating to Yem Fuar has been discounted at a rate of 5% and the undiscounted amount is £1 2.5 million and has a maturity of 2–3 years. Out of the total 
of £0.3 million of derivative financial assets, £0.2 million had a maturity of one year or less and £0.1 million of one year or more.
In 2010, all financial liabilities except the put options and part of the derivative financial instruments (£0.5 million) have a maturity of one year or less. 
Out of the total £1.1 million of derivative financial assets, £0.9 million had a maturity of one year or less and £0.2 million has a maturity of one to three 
years. Out of the total of £0.6 million of derivative financial liabilities, £0.5 million had a maturity of one to three years.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate 
their fair value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments.

The Group seeks to minimise the effects of foreign currency risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the risk exposures. The use of 
financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board 
on a continuous basis. The Group does not enter into financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.

Financial risk management
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to a number of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency and interest rate), credit risk, 
liquidity risk and capital risk. This note presents the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks. The Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
measuring and managing risks can be found in the Business Review on pages 8 to 37 . 
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has established 
policies to identify and analyse risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial 
instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising 
the return on risk.
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group enters into 
derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk. Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. Exchange rate 
exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward-plus or forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:

Forward foreign exchange contracts 
As at 30 September 201 1 the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that the Group has committed to amounted to 
€94.65 million (2010: €99.7 million). These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for the next 36 months and are 
renewed on a revolving basis as required, subject to not committing the Group to less than six months or more than 36 months in the future.
At 30 September 201 1, the fair value of these derivatives is estimated to be a net liability of approximately £0.7 million (2010: net assets of £0.5 million). 
These amounts are based on market valuations.
The Group has taken out foreign currency overdrafts in Euros and US Dollars to act as a natural hedge against certain currency trade receivable 
balances. These borrowings have not been designated as hedging instruments by management. All foreign exchange movements on these borrowings 
and trade receivables are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
Interest rate risk management
As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, other than cash, the Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of 
changes in market interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its borrowings at floating interest rates. This risk is managed by the 
Group by maintaining an appropriate level of floating interest rate borrowings. The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial 
liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section of this note.

Credit risk management
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its contractual obligations. The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash 
equivalents, trade and other receivables, venue advances and derivative financial instruments. These represent the Group’s maximum exposure to 
credit risk. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy 
counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group’s objective is to ensure all customers have paid before any 
service is provided to them. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The ageing profile of the Group’s trade receivables and the details of the Group’s allowances for doubtful receivables can be seen below.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments arises due to where the liquid funds are held. The territories in which ITE operates 
do not always have banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies such as Moody’s and Fitch. The Group aims to 
minimise the exposure to credit risk by minimising the level of cash held in such banks. The Group’s exposure and credit ratings of its counterparties 
are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions.

Management review debtors ageing on a contractual basis and also based on when an event has been held. The Group raise invoices on events using 
stage payments. Any overdue amounts, after the stage payment due date, are reviewed and chased. Management also review the debts due based 
on when an event has taken place, as this is typically when the service is provided. Both measures are included in the table above as both are used by 
management to manage outstanding debts.
The trade receivables amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management 
based on prior experience, specific credit issues and their assessment of the current economic environment. Trade receivables consist of a large 
number of customers spread across diverse industries and geographical areas and the Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the 
individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the Group’s customer base, including default risk of the industry and country, in 
which the customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk. 
The Group establishes an allowance for doubtful debts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade receivables when there is 
objective evidence that the debt will not be collected in full. The allowance is recognised and measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of future cash flows. Where material, it is discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition. The 
main component of this allowance is a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposure on shows which have taken place but 
the debt has not been collected in full. This allowance is determined by reference to the specific circumstances of each show and past experience.
The details of the movement in the allowance for doubtful receivables are shown below.

Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations as they fall due. Such risk may result from inadequate market depth 
or disruption or refinancing problems. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. They have built an 
appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management 
requirements. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring continuity of funding for operational needs through cash deposits and debt facilities as appropriate. 
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to 
stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, bank 
overdraft and bank loan which is disclosed in note 16 and note 1 7 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, 
reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 22 and in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £3.0 million (2010: £1.9 million) available for offset against future profits. No deferred 
tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses in either year due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. These losses may be carried 
forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred 
tax liabilities have not been recognised was £1 3 million (2010: £4.5 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the 
Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

During the year, the Company allotted 256,547 (2010: 204,500) ordinary shares of 1 penny each pursuant to the exercise of share options. No ordinary 
shares (2010: nil) were issued in respect of Directors’ remuneration. The total consideration for the shares issued was £38,478 (2010: £1 74,1 10).
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 1 7 November 
1998, shareholders approved the establishment of the ITE Group ESOT. The terms of the ESOT allow the trustees to transfer shares to employees who 
exercise options under the Company’s Share Option Schemes, to grant options to employees and to accumulate shares by buying in the market or 
subscribing for shares at market value. The ESOT is capable of holding a maximum of 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. The ESOT 
reserve arises in connection with the ESOT. The amount of the reserve represents the deduction in arriving at shareholders funds for the consideration 
paid for the Company’s shares purchased by the Trust which had not vested unconditionally in employees at the balance sheet date.
The ESOT held 8,102,687 shares in ITE Group plc at 30 September 201 1 (2010: 9,978,386 shares). During the year 1,726,500 share options and 91 5,850 
nominal share options under the Employees Performance Share Plan were granted against ESOT held shares. The market value of the ordinary shares 
held by the ESOT at 30 September 201 1 was £1 2.8 million (2010: £1 7 .8 million).
The Company has agreed to make available to the ESOT an interest-free loan of up to £1 2.5 million for the purpose of buying shares. At 30 September 
201 1, the amount of the loan drawn down was £8.8 million. The Company only profit and loss account and balance sheet include the results of the 
ESOT for the year ended 30 September 201 1. 
The trustees have waived their current and future rights to all dividend entitlement on the shares held by the ESOT. 1,855,699 options were exercised 
by ESOT and 20,000 ITE Group plc shares were transferred by ESOT during the year. Of the total shares held by the ESOT, 7 ,489,299 are under options 
as at 30 September 201 1. Details of the options in issue and their exercise dates can be seen at note 25 to the accounts.

25 Share-based payments
The Company operate two share option schemes.
Share option plans
The Company operates a share option plan for all employees of the Group. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market 
price of the Company’s share on the date of grant. The vesting period is either three or five years and the options are exercisable up to ten years from 
granting. The options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Performance share plans
The Company operated a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for executives and staff. Awards under the PSP are at an exercise value of either 1p or nil. 
Awards can be made to an employee over shares up to a maximum of 100% of base salary each year based on market value. The vesting period is 
three years and awards are exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant. For conditional awards the vesting is automatic on the satisfaction of 
performance targets. The options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. The awards are also subject to a performance 
target. Further details of the performance targets can be found in the Report on Remuneration on page 55.

27 Post balance sheet events
On 1 7 November 201 1, ITE’s wholly owned Ukrainian subsidiary, Premierexpo, entered into binding agreements for the acquisition of the exhibition 
assets of Limited Liability Company Autoexpo (‘Autoexpo’). Completion is subject to the re-registration of the trademarks in Premierexpo’s name by the 
State Service of Intellectual Property in Ukraine. Consideration of US$6 million was settled in cash.
The portfolio of ten exhibitions acquired includes SIA, the Kyiv International Autosalon as well as others operating in ITE’s core market sectors of travel 
and tourism, building and construction and oil and gas.
This acquisition is expected to be earnings enhancing in ITE’s 201 2 financial year. 
Due to the proximity to the date of signing these accounts, the IFRS 3 acquisition accounting has not been finalised and the associated IFRS 3 
disclosures are therefore to be completed.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members 
of ITE Group plc 
We have audited the parent company financial statements of ITE Group plc for the year ended 30 September 201 1 which comprise the Parent Company 
Balance and the related notes 1 to 10. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent company financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
 > give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 30 September 201 1 and of its loss for the year then ended;
 > have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 > have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 > the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 > the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the parent 
company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 > adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
 > the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
 > certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of ITE Group plc for the year ended 30 September 201 1.

Notes to the Company accounts
For the year ended 30 September 20 1 1
1 Basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared 
on a going concern basis as discussed in the Group going concern disclosure on page 67 .
These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Companies Act 2006 and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and have been applied consistently.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for any impairment.
Intangible assets
Trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and have a definite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is 
calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives are up to 20 years.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors and creditors
Trade debtors and creditors are stated at their nominal value. Trade debtors are reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to profit or loss.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or 
events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing 
differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains 
and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be 
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be 
deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets 
and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements. Neither is deferred tax recognised when fixed assets are 
sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, 
based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are 
translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation of monetary assets are included in 
profit or loss for the period.
Employee Share Trust
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the ESOT. Shares in the Company held by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in 
equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off to profit or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Financial statements

For the year ended 30 September 20 1 1
1 Basis of accounting continued
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-
based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market- 
based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management’s best estimate.
2 Loss for the year
The loss after tax for the year ended 30 September 201 1 was £2.5 million (2010: £3.9 million). As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, 
no separate profit and loss account is presented in respect of the Company.
The auditors’ remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

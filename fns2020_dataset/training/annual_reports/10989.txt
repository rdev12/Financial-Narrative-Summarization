Ron Elder, Chairman of Netcall, commented: 
“Netcall continues to occupy a leading position in a niche market, 
adding a wide range of new customers during the year and increasing
our market reach through partnerships and distribution channels. Whilst
lower activity levels among some of our customers has had a short-term
impact on our top-line, our cash position continues to strengthen and we
are pleased with the operational strength of the Group. We are confident
that Netcall is well positioned to withstand the current economic climate.
We have had an encouraging start to the new financial year and we shall
contine to seek new opportunities to broaden our market reach, develop
our products in anticipation of market demand and explore all avenues to
deliver enhanced shareholder value.”

15587NETCALL:Layout 1  10/10/08  06:59  Page 1 Netcall has made good operational progress this year and achieved
this in a business environment which has been much more
demanding than previously, and it is clear that while Netcall has been
resilient, the Group has not been immune to the wider economic
downturn. The second half of the financial year showed improvement
and we continue to make solid progress, positioning us well to
achieve growth in the future. 
We have continued to sign new customers and our customer base is
broader than ever covering the financial sector, communications,
utilities, retail and the government sectors amongst others. With our
strong cash position, we therefore believe we are well positioned to
weather the current downturn and benefit from any changes in 
overall market conditions. The Group’s cash position continues to
strengthen and increased by 24% during the year to £2.92 million
(2007 — £2.68 million)
The figures reported today for the year to 30th June 2008 resulted in
revenues for the year of £3.6 million. Encouragingly revenues in the
second half grew by 13% when compared to the first half and
accordingly profit margins were restored.
Gross margins for the year grew to 89% (2007 — 87%) which
combined with a reduction in operating costs by 4% to £2.6 million
(2007 — £2.8 million) contributed to the Group achieving a solid profit
margin and generating significant cash.
It is clear that the strategy implemented in 2005, to move towards the
delivery of our products via a Software as a Service (SaaS) model, is
providing a robust stream of recurring revenues, reducing our reliance
on large licence deals, whilst at the same time increasing our market
reach through channel partners. This is enhancing the business in
today’s tough market, and we believe will continue to do so. 
We have had an encouraging start to the new financial year and we
shall continue to seek new opportunities to broaden our market
reach, develop our products in anticipation of market demand and
explore all avenues to deliver enhanced shareholder value.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff and our partners
for their continued support and contribution. Netcall consists of many
talented people, whose dedication to the Group and belief in the
power of our products is fundamental to our robust success.

15587NETCALL:Layout 1  10/10/08  06:59  Page 2 Netcall expanded its market footprint during the financial year by an
ongoing acquisition of new customers at a rate similar to the previous
year. This was achieved in a very different and more challenging
market environment where a number of our customers and prospects
experienced significant changes to their businesses which in some
cases had an effect on Netcall. 
Despite these challenges the Group’s overall health improved.
Margins increased which, combined with robust cost management,
resulted in a healthy double-digit profit margin making it the second
best year in the Group’s history. As a result the business has
continued to generate significant amounts of cash thereby improving
the strength of the balance sheet. 
While maintaining its core business strategies Netcall adapted its
execution during the financial year as a response to the changing
market conditions. As a result the Group delivered a significantly
improved performance in the second half compared to the first six
months of the financial year confirming the continued demand for
Netcall’s products.
Financial results
Revenue for the financial year was £3.60 million (2007 — £4.11
million) and the share of revenue from distribution channels grew to
52% of total revenues (2007 — 46%). The revenue split between
hosted services and product sales remained even with hosted
revenues contributing 49% of total revenues at £1.78 million (2007 –
£2.00 million), and product revenues accounting for the remaining
51% at £1.82 million (2007 — £2.11 million). 
Robust cost management resulted in a 4% reduction in administrative
expenses (excluding share based charges of £0.20 million) to 
£2.64 million (2007 — £2.77 million). 
Adjusted profits (profit before share based charges and tax) for the
year of £0.71 million (2007: £0.90 million) were healthy, with the
second half showing a substantial improvement compared to the first
6 months achieving £0.43 million compared to £0.28 million and
consequently the second half year margins returned to the level of 
the previous year. 
Profit before tax was £0.51 million, (2007 — £0.77 million) including
share option charges. Following the first time recognition of a
deferred tax asset the results incorporate a one off tax credit of 
£0.56 million which has resulted in an increase in net profit for the
year to £1.07 million (2007 — £0.77 million). Accordingly earnings per
share have grown to 1.62p (2007 — 1.16p).
These results are the first reported fully adopting IFRS. Following this
adoption there has been no significant change to previously reported
results.
Cash generated from operations for the year was £0.43 million 
(2007 — £0.64 million) and the Group’s net funds increased by 24%
to £2.92 million as at 30th June 2008 (2007 — £2.36 million).
Net assets increased by 47% to £3.95 million (2007 — £2.68 million),
reflecting the underlying strength and resilience of the Group and 
its strategy. 
Chief Executive’s Review
“After the outstanding success of QueueBuster in our Nottingham sales based call
centre we are now expanding the use of QueueBuster to our customer care site
based in Sleaford. We are so delighted with the success we have already had in
such a short space of time.”

15587NETCALL:Layout 1  10/10/08  06:59  Page 3 Review of Operations
Products
Netcall is the leading specialist in callback, auto-messaging and
contact solutions for companies of all sizes. The Group designs,
develops and supplies a range of innovative communication solutions
to organisations focusing on enhancing client businesses by: 
•
Improving operational efficiency 
•
Improving customer experience and satisfaction 
•
Increasing sales 
•
Improving employee morale 
All Netcall applications run on the Group’s Intelligent Communications
Platform (ICP), which has been built based on industry standards to
ensure full cross-platform compliance. Netcall has integrated its
solutions with all leading Automatic Call Dialing platforms, Carrier
switches, Network Routing and Computer Telephony Integration
Systems. During the financial year Netcall became a Gold member of
the Avaya developer program and also received the Cisco Technology
Development Program accreditation.
The Group’s ICP runs both on hardware at a client’s location or as a
supported service, hosted remotely and delivered as a Software as a
Service (SaaS) solution, enabling a rapid low-cost, low-risk and
flexible set-up with no capital investment. 
Netcall’s flagship product, QueueBuster, eliminates the need for
customers to be kept waiting on hold by contact centres by taking
the callers place in the queue and providing them with an automatic
call back when an agent is free. QueueBuster, delivering millions of
call backs, continued to provide excellent results for our customers
during the year by improving efficiencies, helping to drive sales and
improve customer service. During the year QueueBuster has saved
the public over 500 years of queuing.
Market
There continues to be a solid and ongoing requirement for
organisations and their contact centres to improve efficiencies and
customer service. In parallel consumers repeatedly rate waiting in call
centre queues as one of the biggest causes of customer
dissatisfaction. These are key issues that QueueBuster addresses for
the Group’s customers. 
Whilst the broader economic climate had an impact on a number of
customers and prospects, the core benefits that Netcall’s solutions
provide remain in demand resulting in the ongoing acquisition of new
customers. 
Expanded customer base 
Netcall acquired a number of new customers directly or via channel
partners during the year including Interflora and Virgin Holidays and
also expanded its footprint within its existing customer base, for
example, at Lloyds TSB. As a result the number of new customer
acquisitions remained stable compared to the previous year. However
the business was affected by reduced activity levels at some of our
customers which in turn impacted the recurring revenue stream and
delayed some purchase decisions.

15587NETCALL:Layout 1  10/10/08  06:59  Page 4 “We looked at a number of different solutions and the QueueBuster on-demand
solution was the one that really stood out in terms of the benefits offered, and
perfectly fitted our company requirements.”
Bournemouth & West Hampshire Water
Channel partnerships
The Group’s continued focus on expanding its market reach via
distribution partners has seen the proportion of total revenues
received from channel partnerships continue to grow to 52% 
(2007 —  46%). A significant development was the announcement of
a new partnership agreement with Cable & Wireless Europe, Asia and
US to integrate a hosted platform into its existing infrastructure to
deliver Netcall’s flagship product QueueBuster as part of its product
and service portfolio. This agreement started showing initial rewards
during the second half of the year with a number of new customers
signing up as a result of this relationship.
Strategy
Netcall’s ambition remains to increase the market acceptance of its
products and to work with distribution partners to achieve broader
market reach. The Group will continue its focus on business models
which generate a high element of recurring revenue thereby improving
future revenue visibility. 
By pursuing this business model, Netcall has transformed over the
past few years from a volatile license business model to one which
focuses on a high element of recurring and visible revenue which
continues to be converted into profit and cash. 
By staying focused on the long term strategy for growth, the Board is
confident that Netcall will achieve long term success and the Group
continues to explore all avenues to generate significant value for our
shareholders in the process.
Current Trading
The uptake of Netcall’s products is continuing to expand within our
existing customer base, and we are also seeing sign up with
additional blue chip organisations. I am pleased to report that the first
quarter is ahead of the same period last year, and this combined with
our continued cash generation, healthy balance sheet and ongoing
customer wins is encouraging for the future.
I would also like to thank the staff and our partners for their continued
support and contribution.

Future prospects
The Group anticipates future growth to derive from the growth in
sales of its products and services through increased activity from its
key partners.
The Board believes that hosted services and product support
recurring revenue continues to enhance the robustness in the Group’s
revenue streams across a broader customer base. This, coupled with
its tight control of costs and healthy cash balance, underpins the
Group’s strength in current market conditions.
Dividends
The Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend 
(2007 — nil).
Research and development
The Group continues an active programme of research and
development to continually enhance its product offerings.

The Group undertakes to make payments to suppliers for goods and
services supplied within the normal credit periods agreed with those
suppliers. It does not follow a specific code or apply a standard
payment practice. The proportion of trade creditors at the year end to
amounts supplied during the year gives an average payment term of
33 days (2007 — 30 days).
Political and charitable contributions
There were no political or charitable donations in the year 
(2007 — nil).

Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
The Company maintains insurance cover for the Directors and key
personnel against liabilities which may be incurred by them while
carrying out their duties.
Financial risk management objectives and policies
The main purpose of the Group’s financial instruments is to raise
finance for its operations. It is not the Group’s policy to trade in
financial instruments, although strategic acquisitions may be made
where it is considered that they will further the Group’s objectives.
(a) Liquidity and interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations primarily through the issue of share
capital. Funds from the issue of share capital are on deposit to
maximise the interest obtained from them whilst providing sufficiently
flexible access to the funds to meet the Group’s requirements. The
deposits are on floating interest rates based on bank base rates.
(b) Foreign currency risk
Overseas sales to customers are priced in sterling but invoiced in the
currencies of the customers involved. Any exchange gains or losses
arising from the settlement of these transactions are dealt with in the
profit and loss account.
Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to
prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards and the parent Company
accounts in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). The
financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of the profit
or loss of the Group for that year. In preparing these financial
statements, the Directors are required to:
•
Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently.
•
Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
•
State whether applicable International Financial Reporting
Standards for the Group and UK Accounting Standards for the
Parent Company have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
•
Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.

Report and accounts 2008 09
15587NETCALL:Layout 1  10/10/08  06:59  Page 9 Corporate governance
The Company is listed on AIM and is therefore not required to comply
with the provisions of the Financial Reporting Council 2006
Combined Code. Nevertheless, the Board is committed to high
standards of Corporate Governance incorporating best practice for a
Group of this size.
•
The Board meets a minimum of eleven times a year; it comprises
one Executive Director and two Non-Executives Directors (one of
whom is the Chairman); it is responsible for setting and
monitoring strategy, reviewing trading performance, ensuring
adequate funding, formulating policy on key issues and reporting
to shareholders. The Board has access to independent advice,
the cost of which is borne by the Company.
•
The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year; it consists of
the Chairman and one Non-Executive Director; the Executive
Director attends the meetings by invitation only; it meets the
external Auditor at least once a year. It reviews the half year and
annual accounts prior to submission to the Board for
consideration, monitors the Company’s controls ensuring integrity
of the financial information reported to shareholders.
•
The Remuneration Committee consists of the Chairman and one
Non-Executive Director and meets at least twice annually. Its
principal functions are to determine the Company policy for
executive remuneration and reward and the granting of share
options to employees.
•
Internal control is maintained by a system of financial controls
designed to meet the particular needs of a Group of this size to
provide appropriate assurance against misstatement or loss. The
Board does not consider it appropriate to set up an Internal Audit
function given the size and nature of the business at this time.
Auditor
In the case of each of the persons who are Directors of the Company
at the date when this report is approved:
•
so far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit
information (as defined in the Companies Act 1985) of which the
Company’s Auditor is unaware; and 
•
each of the Directors has taken all the steps that they ought to
have taken as a Director to make themselves aware of any
relevant audit information (as defined) and to establish that the
Company’s Auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance
with the provisions of S234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
Grant Thornton UK LLP have expressed their willingness to continue
in office as Auditor and a resolution to reappoint them will be
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Approved by the Board of Directors and signed on behalf of the
Board.

of Netcall plc for the year ended 30th June 2008 which comprise the
consolidated income statement, the consolidated and Parent
Company balance sheets, the consolidated statement of changes in
shareholders’ equity, the consolidated cash flow statement, notes 1
to 30 for the Group and notes 1 to 13 for the Parent Company. These
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have
formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the
Group financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom law
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted
by the European Union, and for preparing the Parent Company
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom law and
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in
the Report of the Directors is consistent with the financial statements.
The information given in the Report of the Directors includes that
specific information presented in the Chairman’s Statement and the
Chief Executive’s Review that is cross referred from the Business
Review section of the Report of the Directors.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Report of the
Directors, the Chairman’s Statement and the Chief Executive’s
Review. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any
other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s
and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In 
forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
•
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and of
the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30th June 2008 and of its
profit for the year then ended;
•
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985;

Year ended 30th June 2008
1 Nature of operations and general information
Netcall plc and its subsidiaries are a Group of companies which design, develop and market advanced technologies that enable
businesses to integrate and manage telephony efficiently.
Netcall plc, a limited liability company, is the Group’s ultimate Parent Company. It is registered in England and Wales. The address of
Netcall plc’s registered office is also its principal place of business. 
The financial statements for the year ended 30th June 2008 (including the reclassified comparatives for the year ended 30th June 2007)
were approved by the Board of Directors on 29th September 2008.
Netcall plc’s shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange’s Alternative Investment Market (AIM). Netcall plc’s consolidated full year
financial statements are presented in British pounds (£), which is also the functional currency of the ultimate Parent Company.
2 Transition to IFRS
Overall considerations
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards sets out the procedures that the Group must follow when it
adopts IFRS for the first time as the basis for preparing its financial statements. The Group established its IFRS accounting policies on its
transition date, 1st July 2006, and applied these to the IFRS opening balance sheet at its date of transition, 1st July 2006.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash
flows is set out below. The transition to IFRS has not resulted in any remeasurement adjustments and a reconciliation of profit is therefore
not included. The transition to IFRS has also not resulted in any change to equity and so a reconciliation of equity is not included.
Reclassification of intangible assets 
Under UK GAAP domain names and software costs were recognised within tangible fixed assets and patent costs in prepayments. There
is no tangible fixed assets category under IFRS and instead there is a category of property, plant and equipment. These costs have
therefore been reclassified in these IFRS financial statements and recognised within intangible assets.

Explanation of adjustments to the cash flow statement
The definition of cash is narrower under UK GAAP than under IAS 7 “Cash Flow Statements”. Under IFRS highly liquid investments, readily
convertible to a known amount of cash and with an insignificant risk of changes in value, are regarded as cash equivalents. The cash flow
statement in the last UK GAAP financial statements reported movements in cash. The cash flow statement in these IFRS consolidated
financial statements reports movements in cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents under IFRS include some investments that were recorded as liquid investments under UK GAAP . Cash and
cash equivalents includes £2,000,000 at 30th June 2007 which was accounted for as liquid resources under UK GAAP .

The overall presentation of the financial statements has been changed further to comply with IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”
and IAS 7 “Cash Flow Statements”.
IFRS exemptions
IFRS 1 permits companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the transition
period. These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of taking the following exemptions:
• Business combinations prior to 1st July 2006, the Group’s date of transition to IFRS, have not been restated to comply with IFRS 3
Business Combinations;
• Cumulative translation differences on foreign operations are deemed to be nil at 1st July 2006, any gains and losses recognised in the
consolidated income statement on subsequent disposal of foreign operations will exclude translation differences arising prior to the
transition date; and
• IFRS 2 Share-based payment has only been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7th November 2002 that were unvested as
of 1st July 2006.
Standards and interpretations currently in issue but not yet effective
The following new Standards and Interpretations, which are yet to become mandatory, have not been applied in the consolidated financial

Year ended 30th June 2008
3 Principal accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as
adopted by the European Union (EU).
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Netcall plc’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) until 30th June 2007. The date of transition to IFRS was 1st July 2006. The comparative figures
have been restated as a result of adoption of IFRS. The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS
are given in the reconciliation schedules, presented and explained in note 2.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the Group for the purposes of preparation of these financial
statements. The principal accounting policies for the Group are set out below: 
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings using the purchase method of
accounting. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies so as to obtain
benefits from its activities. The Group obtains and exercises control through voting rights. Where subsidiary companies are acquired during
the year, the profit or loss attributable to shareholders includes the profits or losses from the date of acquisition. Where subsidiary
companies are disposed of during the year, the profit or loss attributable to shareholders includes the profits or losses to the date of
disposal.
Inter-Company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Business combinations completed prior to date of transition to IFRS
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations prior to date of transition.
Accordingly the classification of the combination remains unchanged from that used under UK GAAP . Assets and liabilities are recognised
at date of transition, 1st July 2006 if they would be recognised under IFRS, and are measured using their UK GAAP carrying amount
immediately post-acquisition as deemed cost under IFRS, unless IFRS requires fair value measurement. All acquisitions prior to the date of
transition have been accounted for using the acquisition method except for the acquisition of Netcall Technologies Limited.
When Netcall plc acquired Netcall Technologies Limited in 1996, ordinary shares were issued to form the consideration. The UK GAAP
merger accounting criteria were met and so a merger reserve was recognised. The merger reserve has remained unchanged on transition
to IFRS.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of the
consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised and carried at cost less accumulated
impairment losses.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to date of transition to IFRS remains in reserves. There is no reinstatement of goodwill that was
amortised prior to transition to IFRS. Goodwill previously written off to reserves is not written back to profit or loss on subsequent disposal.
Revenue
Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable by the Group for goods supplied and services
provided, excluding VAT. Revenue is recognised upon the performance of services or transfer of risk to the customer.
Product
Product revenue is recognised upon delivery and acceptance by the customer.
Support and maintenance
Support and maintenance revenues are recognised on a straight-line basis over the support and maintenance period.

Netcall plc 18
1558
15587NETCALL:Layout 1  10/10/08  06:59  Page 18 3 Principal accounting policies continued
Service
Service revenues are recognised on a straight-line basis over the periods defined in the service agreements and where appropriate at time
of delivery. 
Interest
Interest is recognised using the effective interest method which calculates the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocates the interest
income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the
expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. 
Intangible assets
Domain names, trade marks, patents and software are measured initially at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful life. Carrying amounts are reduced by provisions for impairment where necessary.
Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates of 20% to 33% per annum, in order to write off the cost, less estimated residual
value, of each asset, over its expected useful economic life.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Disposal of assets
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying
amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual
instalments over their estimated useful economic lives. The rates generally applicable are 20–33% per annum for the fixtures and fittings
and equipment.
Material residual value estimates are updated as required, but at least annually.
Research and development
Expenditure on research (or the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense in the period to which it is incurred.
Development is only recognised as an intangible asset if each of the following conditions have been met:
•
It is reasonably expected that the asset is likely to generate net future economic benefit;
•
Development costs in relation to the asset can be reliably measured;
•
Completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible;
•
The Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
•
The Group has the ability to use the asset or sell it; and
•
There are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.
Impairment testing of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
The carrying values of intangibles and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Any impairment in the value of intangibles and property, plant and equipment is
charged to the income statement.
Leased assets
All leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are spread over the term of the lease.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs are assigned using the first in, first out basis.

Report and accounts 2008 19
15587NETCALL:Layout 1  10/10/08  06:59  Page 19 3 Principal accounting policies continued
Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the
difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial
recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or
affects tax or accounting profit. Tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for
recognition as deferred tax assets and are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement.
Financial assets
Trade receivables and other debtors are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured subsequent to initial
recognition at fair value, at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any change in their value
through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it
in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Available-for-sale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. All financial assets within this category are
measured subsequently at fair value, with changes in value recognised in equity, through the statement of changes in equity. Gains and
losses arising from investments classified as available-for-sale are recognised in the income statement when they are sold or when the
investment is impaired. In the case of impairment of available-for-sale assets, any loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the
income statement. 
An assessment for impairment is undertaken at least at each balance sheet date.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest-
related charges recognised as an expense in finance cost in the income statement. 
A financial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and available on demand deposits.
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
•
“Share capital” represents the nominal value of equity shares;
•
“Share premium” represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of
expenses of the share issue;
•
“Special and capital reserves” represents amounts set aside following a capital reduction scheme;
•
“Employee share schemes reserve” represents equity-settled share-based employee remuneration until such share options are
exercised; and
•
“Profit and loss reserve” represents retained profits.

Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets
and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at
which they were initially recorded are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
The Parent Company’s functional currency is sterling.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 and has deemed cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to
be nil at the date of transition to IFRS.
Employee benefits
Share based payments
The Group operates a number of employee share schemes under which it makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain
employees. In accordance with the exemptions available under IFRS 1, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 
7th November 2002 that were unvested as of 1st July 2006. 
Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference
to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is assessed at the grant date, using the Black–Scholes method,
and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions. The market vesting conditions are reviewed using the Binomial model.
The expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest.
Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous
estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense
recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately exercised are different to that estimated on vesting.
4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date, that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are
discussed below.
Valuation of share-based payments 
In order to determine the valuation of share-based payments, management are required to make an estimation of the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical
volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous three years. The list of inputs used in the Black–Scholes model to calculate the fair
values are provided in note 21. Where share options have a market condition a Binomial model is used to calculate the fair values.
Recognition of deferred tax 
Management have recognised a deferred tax asset based on the considered future economic benefit of the Group’s past trading losses.
Following three years of profitable trading and based on expected profitability, a tax asset of £560,000 has been recognised at 30th June
2008 (2007: £nil).

Financial instruments
The Group uses various financial instruments; these include cash and bank deposits, trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly
from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and currency risk. The Board
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to market risk for the changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s bank deposits. The exposure to
interest rate fluctuations on its deposits is managed by placing these at fixed rates of interest with varying maturity dates.
The aggregate amount of cash deposits on fixed interest terms as at 30th June 2008 was £2,750,000. The weighted average fixed interest
rate on the cash deposits was 4.80% (2007 — 5.2%) and the weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 1 month (2007 — 1
month). The aggregate amount of cash deposits on variable interest terms as at 30th June 2008 was £ 85,000 (2007 — £34,000). For cash
deposits held with the Group’s clearing bankers, the variable rate is indexed to National Westminster Bank PLC’s base rate. 
A fluctuation in the interest rates of +1% and -1% through the year would not materially impact on the Group’s results.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs.
As at 30th June, the Group’s financial liabilities have contractual maturities as summarised below: 
Current
Between
Within 6 6 and 12
months months
£’000 £’000
2008
Trade and other payables 270.6 28.8
2007
Trade and other payables 532.2 43.5
Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as
summarised below:
2008 2007
£’000 £’000
Cash and cash equivalents 2,915.3 2,360.5
Trade and other receivables 1,416.8 1,509.4
4,332.1 3,869.9
The Group’s management considers that all the above financial assets that are not impaired for each of the balance sheet dates under
review are of good credit quality, including those that are past due. See note 16 for fuller information of financial assets that are past due.
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash deposits and trade receivables. Risks associated with cash deposits are limited as the
banks used have high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The principal credit risk lies with trade receivables. In order to manage credit risk, the Directors set limits for customers based on a
combination of payment history and third party credit references. Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis in conjunction with debt
ageing and collection history.

Currency risk
The Group is exposed to transaction foreign exchange risk. Transaction exposures, including those associated with forecast transactions,
are managed through the use of bank accounts held in foreign currencies as summarised below:
Total US dollar Euros
£’000 £’000 £’000
Trade and other receivables 12.3 9.8 2.5
Cash and cash equivalents 41.8 10.9 30.9
54.1 20.7 33.4
A +/- 5% change of the pound sterling to US dollar exchange rate and a +/- 5% change of the pound sterling to euro exchange rate
would not have a material impact on the Group’s results in financial years 2008 or 2007.

Year ended 30th June 2008
1 Principal accounting policies
Accounting policies
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. The particular accounting
policies adopted are described below.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
Turnover
Turnover is commission received by the Company. It is recognised on a receivables basis.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on cost in equal
annual amounts over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 
The rates of depreciation are as follows:
Domain names, patents and trade marks — 20% per annum.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
Leased assets
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal annual amounts over the lease term.
Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences, which result in an obligation at the balance sheet
date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates
and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from
those in which they are included in financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely
than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date. Translation
differences arising are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments
The Group does not enter into derivative contracts for hedging or speculative purposes.
Share-based compensation
The Company issues share options to certain employees, including employees of its subsidiary undertakings. The fair value of such
options granted is calculated using the Black–Scholes option pricing model and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions.
The vesting conditions are reviewed using the Binomial model. The expense is spread over the period from the date of grant to the date
the options vest and are exercisable, based on the best estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
2 Employee remuneration
The Directors are the only employees of the Company. Directors’ remuneration has been disclosed within note 7 of the Group financial
statements.

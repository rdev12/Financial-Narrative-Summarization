Whitbread
Whitbread has built some of the  
UK‚Äôs most successful hospitality 
brands including Premier Inn and 
Costa. We employ over 43,000  
people in the UK and serve  
22 million customers every month. 
Our strategy is to grow  our  
leading brands with a clear focus  
on returns to deliver substantial 
shareholder value.
Hotels & Restaurants
Premier Inn is the UK‚Äôs leading hotel 
business, with over 670 hotels and more 
than 55,000 rooms across the UK. 
We have more rooms in more locations than our competitors, 
which allows our customers to stay closer to where they  
want to be.
We offer our customers a 100% money‚Äìback guarantee  
of a good night‚Äôs sleep with a quality room, comfortable 
surroundings and friendly service. We call it our Good  
Night Guarantee.
All Premier Inn UK bedrooms have an ensuite bathroom,  
TV with Freeview and Wi‚ÄìFi internet access. All our hotels  
have a bar and restaurant, either inside the building or next  
to it, offering a wide range of dishes. Whitbread‚Äôs unique  
joint site model means that 377 of these hotels are located 
alongside our own restaurant brands: Beefeater; Brewers  
Fayre; Table Table; and Taybarns. A further 149 hotels  
include one of our Thyme restaurants.
Internationally, we have five hotels in the Middle East and  
three in India with more in the pipeline.
For the Hotels & Restaurants Investor Day presentations  
please see www.whitbread.co.uk/investordays
We‚Äôve set our sights on ambitious and fast‚Äìpaced profitable 
growth and last year announced new growth milestones.  
By 2018 we plan to increase the size of Premier Inn to around 
75,000 UK rooms and the system sales of Costa to around  
¬£2 billion. 
Our businesses share common values and a clear vision  
on responsibility. We have demonstrated our ability to  
build strong brands through the consistent delivery of 
operational excellence and a great customer experience  
in people‚Äìintensive businesses.
Listed on the London Stock Exchange, Whitbread PLC  
is a member of the FTSE 100 and the FTSE4Good indices.

Costa
Costa, voted the UK‚Äôs favourite coffee 
shop, has grown significantly over  
the past five years and now has 1,755  
coffee shops in the UK and 1,106 
overseas. 
Only 1% of the world‚Äôs coffee beans are good enough  
to create the unique taste and aroma of our Costa Mocha 
Italia blend. Almost all the coffee we serve in the UK,  
and most of that served in the rest of the world, is roasted  
at our Lambeth roastery.
Costa is an international brand represented in 30 countries.  
It has a multi‚Äìchannel strategy, with equity stores, franchise 
stores and stores operated by joint ventures, as well as a 
wholesale operation. Costa Express now has over 3,500 
self‚Äìservice machines.

Chairman‚Äôs
statement
 This is another set of good results. Once again strong  
cash flow funded the necessary capital investment for  
our growth engines, Premier Inn and Costa, to increase  
their share of the market. We have recommended  
an increase in the full‚Äìyear dividend by 19.9% while 
maintaining debt at a prudent level. I am confident  
that the brand strength of Premier Inn and Costa will  
continue to fuel the Company‚Äôs growth into the future.
Whitbread continues to evolve in a fast changing trading and economic environment.  
Premier Inn has, for example, responded to the growing competitive presence of online  
travel agents by significantly increasing its digital capability and resources. It has also 
announced the launch of ‚Äòhub by Premier Inn‚Äô which is a new city centre focused hotel  
concept. Costa is consistently looking to find new ways of ensuring that its customers  
are never far from a cup of Costa Coffee ‚Äî for example through new distribution channels 
such as drive‚Äìthru and a new generation of Costa Express machine. Our restaurants have  
also been updating their brand propositions. This focus on innovation is essential for a  
modern company to prosper.
Dividend
The Board recommends a final dividend of 47.00p per share, making a total dividend of 
68.80p per share, up by 19.9%. The final dividend will be paid on 4 July 2014 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 30 May 2014. The Scrip Dividend Scheme,  
which was introduced in 2009, has been closed. It has been replaced by a new Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan, which will not have the effect of diluting shareholdings. Further  
information on how to participate in this new plan can be found on the Company‚Äôs website.

Chairman‚Äôs 
statement
Board
In December 2013, we announced that Susan Hooper would be stepping down from her 
position as a non‚Äìexecutive director of the Company so that she could focus her attention  
on her new role at British Gas. I would like to thank Susan for her contribution to the Board 
over the last two years and wish her well in her new role.
We also announced changes to the roles and responsibilities of two of our other non‚Äì
executive directors. Sir Ian Cheshire became Senior Independent Director with effect from  
1 January 2014, taking over from Stephen Williams who had fulfilled that role since March 
2008. Stephen took over from Sir Ian as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee with 
effect from the same date.
Nine fascinating years of transformation and focused growth
This is the final Annual Report during my tenure as Chairman of Whitbread. It has been a 
privilege to lead the Board during nine exciting and transformational years for the Company.
When I joined Whitbread in 2005, the Group had a collection of brands including, among 
others, David Lloyd Leisure, T.G.I. Friday‚Äôs and Pizza Hut. Premier Travel Inn, as it was  
called then, had 28,400 UK rooms with no international presence and represented 15%  
of Whitbread sales. Nine years on, Premier Inn has 55,035 rooms in the UK and Ireland,  
with hotels also in India, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Premier Inn‚Äôs sales have grown at over  
13% per annum and now represent 42% of Whitbread revenues. It is the country‚Äôs leading 
hotel brand. Costa, which had 426 stores in 2005 and represented 6% of Whitbread  
sales, has grown into an international brand with 2,861 stores in 30 countries. Its sales have 
grown at 23% a year and represent 38% of Whitbread‚Äôs revenues. It is now the UK‚Äôs leading 
coffee shop brand. Meanwhile we have focused our Restaurants business onto those 
sharing a site with a Premier Inn and we have almost doubled the number of these joint  
sites over the period.
This transformation has been achieved in a period that included the worst recession  
in living memory and has delivered significant value to our shareholders. The share price  
when I joined the Company in 2005 was ¬£8.54 and we had delivered underlying basic  
EPS of 61.25p. At the time of writing the share price is ¬£40.46 and our EPS for 2013/14  
was 179.02p.
In addition, I am immensely proud of the achievements of our Good Together programme.  
From a standing start five years ago, we are now fully engaged in many major and highly 
relevant areas to the business. These range from, for example, our leading apprenticeship 
programme to the highly successful school building programme in coffee‚Äìgrowing areas 
through the Costa Foundation. We are making a real difference.
None of this could have been achieved without the dedication and professionalism  
of thousands of members of the Whitbread team. I would like to take this opportunity  
to thank not just the 43,000 people currently working at Whitbread, but also thousands  
more that have contributed to this Company‚Äôs success during my time as Chairman.
Finally, on a personal note, I would like to thank my colleagues on the Board and in 
management for their support and wish Andy and his team every success as they lead  
the next phase of Whitbread‚Äôs development.

Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14
Chief 
Executive‚Äôs 
review
2013/14 was another record year for Whitbread, delivering 
excellent results for all our stakeholders: our customers:  
our people; the communities in which we work; and of 
course our shareholders. 
Strategy
Our strategy focuses on strengthening and growing our leading brands, Premier Inn and 
Costa. We have set ambitious growth milestones for 2018 to increase the number of Premier 
Inn rooms from 55,000 in the UK today to around 75,000 and to reach around 10,000 rooms 
overseas. We will achieve this by winning share from independents and other branded hotels 
and growing the brand in selected international markets using a capital right model. In Costa 
we have targeted around ¬£2 billion of system sales by 2018, up from the ¬£1.2 billion of system 
sales last year. This will see us reach more than 2,200 UK stores by 2018 at the same time as 
growing our franchise and equity business internationally, with particular focus on extending 
our footprint in China.
We have a simple but powerful business philosophy which is encapsulated in our ‚ÄòCustomer 
Heartbeat‚Äô model which puts the customer at the heart of everything we do. It can be 
found throughout Whitbread, from our Boardroom wall to the back of house in every single 
Whitbread operated hotel, restaurant and coffee shop.
We are a hugely people‚Äìintensive business, with our 43,000 team members in the UK aiming  
to make everyday experiences special for each and every one of our 22 million customers each 
month. Our Customer Heartbeat model forms the foundation of our strategy. The delivery of a 
consistently great customer experience drives strong unit sales growth, delivering the margins 
and cash flow to finance our rapid and focused organic growth and achieve our 2016 and 2018 
growth milestones.
Delivering for our customers ‚Äî building a strong Customer Heartbeat
We aim to build strong brands by putting customers at the heart of everything we do and we  
are proud to have the UK‚Äôs No. 1 coffee shop brand and No. 1 budget hotel brand as measured  
by Allegra Strategies and YouGov respectively. We measure our success through customer 
feedback in the form of both brand preference scores and net guest scores. We focus on 
increasing the number of customers who are very satisfied with their experience (and more likely 
to recommend us to their friends and family) and reducing the percentage who are dissatisfied. 
Once again we have delivered record guest scores for all our brands in the UK. 
Great customer service needs to be backed up with great products and we have invested  
over ¬£100 million in the year in maintaining and upgrading our existing hotels, restaurants and 
coffee shops to ensure that they are the best in their markets. An enduring focus on innovation is 
producing exciting fresh experiences for our customers, whether that‚Äôs a new range of speciality 
lattes or a completely new hotel concept in ‚Äòhub by Premier Inn‚Äô, which launches later this year.
Delivering for our people ‚Äî building Winning Teams
We are passionate about building highly engaged Winning Teams and we are committed to 
making sure we have a great place to work. In this Report you can read about some of the inspiring 
work we are doing to create jobs for young, often long‚Äìterm unemployed people who need that all 
important break to get into work and, once they‚Äôve joined, to give them the opportunity to develop 
their skills in a structured way through industry‚Äìleading training programmes.
We ask our teams through a six monthly ‚ÄòYour Say‚Äô survey about what it feels like to work  
at Whitbread. This year we achieved record engagement scores across all our brands and 
improved our rankings in the Sunday Times Best Big Companies to Work For 2014 and the  
UK Top Employers surveys, where we ranked 8th and 3rd respectively.

Our continuing success is a result of, and a tribute to,  
the passion and commitment of our team members.  
Let me take this opportunity to thank them all, on  
behalf of the Board, for their contribution.
‚Äô‚Äô
Delivering for our communities ‚Äî Good Together
Businesses should be a force for good in the communities and economies in which they 
operate. Our corporate responsibility programme, Good Together, has gone from strength  
to strength in the five years it has been running. We‚Äôve set ambitious targets and in this 
Report you can read how we are delivering these. We are also proud to hear the real‚Äìlife 
stories from around our business that illustrate the difference we make to people‚Äôs lives  
and the environment that we all share.
Delivering for our shareholders ‚Äî driving Profitable Growth
It is no coincidence that record performance scores for our Winning Teams and our 
Customer Heartbeat have driven record financial results. In 2013/14 we grew our total sales 
by 13.0% to ¬£2.3 billion. This growth in total sales was a combination of a 4.2% increase  
in like for like sales and continuing expansion of our network. During the year we opened  
23 net new Premier Inn hotels in the UK with 3,364 net new rooms. We are also continuing 
to grow Premier Inn in selected international markets. We opened a new Premier Inn hotel  
in Abu Dhabi, another in Pune, India and have firm agreements to build 22 hotels in three 
target regions. Alongside our new Premier Inn hotels in the UK we constructed eight new 
restaurants, reinforcing the unique Whitbread joint site model, consisting of a Premier Inn 
hotel closely adjacent to a Whitbread restaurant. Costa has also continued its strong organic 
growth with the opening of 334 net new coffee shops worldwide, including 177 in the UK, 
together with the installation of 955 net new Costa Express machines.
Our strong sales performance translated into a 16.5% growth in underlying pre‚Äìtax profit  
to ¬£411.8 million and a 20.1% growth in earnings per share, helped by a reduction in the 
corporation tax rate. We have maintained our strong balance sheet with our net debt  
falling from ¬£471.1 million to ¬£391.6 million over the course of the financial year. This was 
driven by our strong cash flow, which also financed capital reinvestment in the business  
of over ¬£300 million. Our strong profit growth and cash flow have led the Board to propose 
a 24.0% increase in the final dividend, which would deliver a full‚Äìyear dividend of 68.80p,  
an increase of 19.9%.
During the year we held a Costa Investor Day and a Hotels & Restaurants Investor Day.  
These provided an opportunity for investors to understand the strategy better for each 
business. We outlined how we will continue to focus on winning share in our domestic UK 
market and how we will grow Costa and Premier Inn in selected overseas markets where  
we believe they will prosper. Costa is now in 29 countries overseas with over 1,000 stores 
including 326 in China. Premier Inn has eight hotels in the Middle East and India and is 
exploring additional developing markets such as Indonesia and Thailand.
It is fitting that, in a year of record performance, our Board thanks our Chairman, Anthony 
Habgood, for his outstanding contribution to Whitbread‚Äôs success. When he joined Whitbread 
in May 2005 it was a very different business to that today. Together with the Board, he 
embarked upon a journey to transform Whitbread into a focused company, committed  
to investing in and building wholly‚Äìowned market leading brands which create sustained 
shareholder value. Under his stewardship shareholders have enjoyed significant returns, with  
a total shareholder return (which includes share price growth, dividends and capital returns)  
5.5 times greater than that of the FTSE 100 over the same period. He leaves Whitbread 
stronger and sharper, with a firm platform upon which to deliver our exciting growth ambitions.
In the following pages we have included more detail on the work our Winning Teams are 
doing to build a strong Customer Heartbeat and to drive Profitable Growth and create 
shareholder value. I hope you find this interesting and informative.

WINcard
We set key performance indicators for Winning Teams, Customer Heartbeat, Profitable Growth and Good Together. Behind 
each of these headings are clear and measurable targets which together make up our balanced scorecard or WINcard as  
we call it (Whitbread In Numbers). The Remuneration Committee takes account of a range of factors when setting targets,  
but in most cases the following principles are applied:
  A green score is achieved where the performance is better than both target and the previous year.
 An amber score is for performance which is better than the prior year but below target.
 A red score is for a result below the previous year.

Winning T eams
Across our 672 Premier Inns and  
401 restaurants we employ more than 
30,000 people. Success is all about 
making everyday experiences feel 
special for our customers and we rely 
on our Winning T eams to do just that. 
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so vital that our teams 
are highly engaged and passionate 
about what they do. 
We measure engagement through our six‚Äìmonthly ‚ÄòYour Say‚Äô 
survey and, in the most recent survey, we achieved our 
highest engagement scores to date.

 ‚ÄòYour Say‚Äô lets us know the things that matter most to our 
teams and we use the results to develop specific action plans. 
One of the priorities identified is to have better two‚Äìway 
communication and we have taken a number of steps to 
address this, including new listening forums. These have taken 
place in over 100 sites, enabling team members to have a 
voice and speak freely with the leaders of the business and  
to share ideas for improvement. This year, we launched 
 ‚ÄòAvenue‚Äô to the business. This is a digital internal social media 
platform which allows ideas to be shared across the Group 
and successes to be celebrated.
Premier Inn
At Premier Inn‚Äôs annual conference this year, we launched  
our Guest Purpose: ‚ÄòMaking our guests feel brilliant through  
a great night‚Äôs sleep‚Äô. At the same time, we launched the  
new Premier Inn ‚ÄòPeople Promise‚Äô: ‚ÄòPremier Inn, a place  
made by you‚Äô. The main purpose is to ensure that every  
team member understands the part they play in delivering  
our Guest Purpose.
Premier Inn‚Äôs ‚ÄòPeople Promise‚Äô is split into four areas:
‚Ä¢	
I feel really special ‚Äî we have developed a programme  
of management and leadership development as well  
as a programme of team member training. Its intention  
is to ensure that every member of the team understands  
the importance of the role that they play in delivering  
our Guest Purpose. 
‚Ä¢	
How will I know I am doing a good job? ‚Äî we have 
launched new training tools, an Ambassador programme 
to support our new starters, and we have launched our  
new induction ‚ÄòBrilliant Beginnings‚Äô ensuring our teams 
know how they‚Äôre doing every step of the way.
‚Ä¢	
I have lots of opportunities to grow ‚Äî we are focused  
on building our talent and succession pipeline in all regions  
and countries where we operate to meet our ambitious 
growth plans. In total we have held 3,180 days of 
management development training and a total of  
557 people completed an Intermediate or Advanced 
apprenticeship. We have also launched a ‚ÄòStretch 
Development‚Äô 12 month programme for our leaders with 
high potential. In total, 71% of Premier Inn‚Äôs appointments 
were internal. 
‚Ä¢	
I am rewarded and recognised ‚Äî this year has seen the 
launch of ‚ÄòMy Rewards‚Äô in Premier Inn. An innovative 
programme which uses pre‚Äìloadable, pre‚Äìpaid VISA debit 
cards for all reward and recognition payments. So far this 
year we have paid out ¬£520,000 to our teams through  
 ‚ÄòMy Rewards‚Äô, as recognition of their contribution to the 
reduction in complaints and improvement in guest 
feedback scores. To date over 13,000 (80%) of our team 
members have registered for their ‚ÄòMy Rewards‚Äô card and 
we are committed to continuing to create a culture of 
celebrating and recognising our teams who go the extra 
mile for our guests.

Winning Teams
Restaurants
This year Restaurants have focused on a single purpose;  
to ensure our 14,000 team members are willing and able to 
‚ÄòServe up Great Memories‚Äô. Over the last 12 months, we have 
developed a clear message to our team members under  
the heading ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre the Main Ingredient‚Äô with the belief that  
we all have a vital part to play in the success of Restaurants. 
Our progress in Restaurants is detailed below:
‚Ä¢	
I know you care ‚Äî as in Premier Inn, this year we introduced 
our new rewards programme ‚ÄòMy Rewards‚Äô to our teams, 
with over 90% of teams receiving financial recognition for 
their role in serving up great memories. We equipped our 
Regional Managers with mobile access to the ‚ÄòMy Rewards‚Äô 
system and recognition tools to enable them to instantly 
celebrate their teams‚Äô successes. Teams across Restaurants 
took part in a range of incentives to a total value of 
¬£550,000, which rewarded their contribution and boosted 
sales at key trading periods throughout the year.
‚Ä¢	
I know how to progress my career ‚Äî in total we have 
delivered 472 days of management development training  
in the year, helping our teams to improve their skills and 
realise their potential. We developed a simplified career 
journey to make progression accessible to a wider 
population. More recently we have launched our new 
 ‚ÄòProgressing Into General Management‚Äô programme, which 
aims to fast track our most high potential team members 
into general management positions. Out of our 333 
management appointments this year, 56% were internal 
development moves.
‚Ä¢	
I know what is expected of me ‚Äî we have focused on 
improving communications and engagement around our 
purpose of Serving up Great Memories across our business, 
enlisting the support of our team members to shape our 
two‚Äìway communication strategy.
‚Ä¢	
I know how I‚Äôm doing ‚Äî in partnership with our teams and 
managers, we have launched new ‚Äòteam chat‚Äô tools at site  
to support regular open dialogue, ensuring our teams know 
how they‚Äôre doing every step of the way.
‚Ä¢	
I know my stuff ‚Äî 350 of our very best team members 
graduated from our four day Heroes training programme 
during the year. The programme creates ambassadors,  
who help train others, improve guest experiences  
and engage their teams. 1,072 delegates attended a 
restaurants management academy course and 7,500  
days of training were delivered in our kitchen skills 
academies across the UK. 
‚Ä¢	
I feel part of something special ‚Äî we achieved record 
engagement scores and our most improved areas were 
 ‚Äòopen and honest two‚Äìway conversation‚Äô, ‚Äòthe Company 
really listens to what I have to say‚Äô, ‚Äòmy manager gives me 
helpful feedback‚Äô and ‚ÄòI see how I can develop my career‚Äô.
Skills development
Developing the skills and abilities of our teams is core to 
enabling our people to achieve their ambitions, have a good 
sense of wellbeing at work and deliver great experiences  
to our millions of customers. In 2013/14 we broadened our 
approach and are now reaching out into the communities  
in which we operate, supporting our Good Together goal  
to be a force for good.
We have hosted and taken part in several industry‚Äìled forums,  
 ‚ÄòBig Conversations in Hospitality‚Äô, to focus on three areas: 
youth unemployment; apprenticeships; and work experience. 
This has resulted in over 30,000 pledges from Whitbread  
and other industry employers to offer jobs, work experience 
and apprenticeships to young people. 
We have developed our WISE Programme (Whitbread 
Investing in Skills and Employment), which secured funding 
from the Government‚Äôs Employer Ownership of Skills project 
to support a number of initiatives including:
‚Ä¢	
building links with schools, colleges and universities;
‚Ä¢	
providing sustainable and inspirational work experience  
to young people;
‚Ä¢	
transitioning the unemployed into work; and
‚Ä¢	
developing a progression of apprenticeships.
Work placements
This year, we have provided opportunities to young and 
unemployed people who may struggle to gain experience  
and access to employment. In total over 1,045 placements 
were completed with structured work experience for school 
students and unemployed people to give them experience 
working in a highly customer‚Äìfocused environment.
Apprenticeships
We were proud to be recognised as one of the ‚ÄòTop 100 
Apprenticeship Employers‚Äô by the National Apprenticeship 
Service and were highly commended in the National 
Apprenticeship Awards for an outstanding contribution  
to raising the profile of apprenticeships and raising skills 
across our industry.
Since we introduced the programme in 2009, 7,000 
qualifications have been awarded including awards for 
 ‚ÄòSkills for Life‚Äô and functional English and maths. 
Creating opportunities
Our ambitious growth plans, both in the UK and 
internationally, make our Hotels & Restaurants business 
an exciting place to work with plenty of opportunities and  
we are proud of our ability to develop people and build 
exciting and diverse careers.
This year we have appointed over 17,000 people into positions 
across the business including 657 management roles. Out of 
these over 1,200 were brand new jobs in newly opened sites. 
We have a target to ensure that 50% of new roles go to 
people not in education, employment or training.

We‚Äôre guest obsessed
We operate the largest consumer survey in Europe with  
over 900,000 guests responding every year to our email 
questionnaire, providing daily feedback for every single site. 
We use this data to produce scores for each site and for  
the brand as a whole. In 2013/14 70% of our guests gave us  
nine or ten out of ten and the overall score has improved  
by 12% pts in the last three years.
At Premier Inn we really care about our guest experience  
and we offer a ‚ÄòGood Night Guarantee‚Äô, which gives the guest 
the ultimate guarantee that they can book our rooms with 
confidence. If they don‚Äôt get a good night‚Äôs sleep they get  
a full refund. 
Enhancing the customer experience
As well as giving our guests confidence, the Good Night 
Guarantee also gives our teams confidence as it alerts them  
to issues and encourages them to fix them quickly. This helps 
us to target our investment to maintain standards and in 
2013/14 we invested around ¬£80 million in repairs, maintenance, 
refurbishment and systems. To ensure a consistently superior 
product we follow a systematic refurbishment cycle across 
our estate which involves a light refurbishment after years 
three and nine, the replacement of TV and soft furnishings 
after six years and a full refurbishment every 12 years.
To maintain our leadership position, this year we have 
launched three key innovations, our new bed; our new room; 
and a new brand ‚Äî ‚Äòhub by Premier Inn‚Äô.
New TV advert featuring Lenny Henry  
promoting the new bed.
Whitbread‚Äôs hotels and restaurants 
welcome five million customers every 
month, whether that‚Äôs to enjoy a  
meal out or a great night‚Äôs sleep in a 
Premier Inn bed. We are committed  
to maintaining the excellent standards 
and levels of service that our guests 
expect, by growing the number of 
locations and investing in our product 
to ensure that we have brands that  
are the best in their marketplace and  
win share.
Our mission is to make every one of our guests  
feel brilliant by giving them a great night‚Äôs sleep.
Largest network
With over 670 hotels around the UK, Premier Inn is the UK‚Äôs 
largest hotel chain. We offer more rooms in more locations, 
which allows us to be closer to where our customers want to 
stay ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs to attend a family gathering, a business 
meeting or enjoy a weekend break.

At the heart of a great night‚Äôs sleep lies a great bed and we 
have partnered with leading bed‚Äìmaker, Hypnos, to develop 
our next generation bed. With 1,200 individual pocket coil 
springs, a super‚Äìcomfortable integrated topper, and a 
mattress made from 100% recyclable materials supporting 
our Good Together programme, our bed sets the standards 
for the sector and is now being rolled out.
We have also been developing the next generation of our 
room and, whilst the bed is clearly the hero, the new room 
also features a 40‚Äìinch flat screen TV, enhanced energy‚Äì
efficient lighting, aerated power shower, excellent working 
space and a fresh modern design. All the new hotels that we 
build will feature the new room and bed, which we will also roll 
out to our existing rooms in line with our refurbishment cycle.
Launched in July 2013, ‚Äòhub by Premier Inn‚Äô is a new 
generation of compact, city centre hotels with contemporary 
room design that will offer good value for money and appeal 
to customers who value price, location and design over  
space. It will target major UK city centres such as London and 
Edinburgh. The first one is due to open in the second half of 
2014 in St. Martin‚Äôs Lane, right in the heart of London‚Äôs West 
End and a further eight sites are in the pipeline, including two 
in Edinburgh.

Vision to be ‚Äòbest in class digital retailer‚Äô
Premier Inn is an online business and we have significantly 
increased our investment in digital to improve the overall 
customer experience.
We are doing this in a number of ways. Firstly, we drive  
traffic to our web and mobile sites through broad reach  
TV advertising and email promotions; secondly we are 
creating engaging and relevant content on our sites including 
customer reviews, Trip Advisor ratings and social media 
activity, to improve our presence on the web and enhance  
the customer experience; and thirdly once customers have  
come to our sites we then seek to convert as many of them  
as possible to book with us. Our seamless online check in  
facility means guests can book, pay and check in, all online.

Restaurants that serve up great memories
With around 47 million guests a year eating in our restaurants 
our teams are committed to making every single experience  
a memorable one.
Serving up great memories.
Of our 672 Premier Inn hotels in the UK and Ireland, 377 are 
adjacent to either a Beefeater, Brewers Fayre, Table Table  
or Taybarns restaurant and our Restaurants business plays  
an important role in supporting Premier Inn‚Äôs growth and 
success. A quality restaurant is critical to Premier Inn guests, 
especially for breakfast which is enjoyed by 60% of all guests. 
25 to 30% of Premier Inn guests also choose to have dinner  
in the adjacent restaurant and like the choice and great  
value dining experience that our Restaurant brands offer.
However, around 85% of our Restaurants‚Äô customer base are 
people who live locally and are not Premier Inn guests, so it is 
equally important to ensure that our Restaurant brands have  
a broad appeal within their communities.
We are equally guest obsessed in our Restaurants business 
and run a Guest Recommend survey receiving over 400,000 
responses annually. We use the responses to produce a guest 
score and in 2013/14 we achieved record guest scores across 
our three main brands of Beefeater Grill, Brewers Fayre and 
Table Table. For all Restaurant brands combined, the overall 
score increased in the year by 3.2% pts to 66.1%. 
The areas where we saw the most significant improvements  
in guest scores were in food quality and customer service. 
89% of our guests rated our food four or five out of five and 
92% of our guests rated our staff friendliness four or five out 
of five. The improvement in guest scores is down to a number 
of measures that internally we refer to as our ‚Äòrecipe for 
success‚Äô. This recipe boils down to having highly engaged 
team members, quality food and a great menu choice.
Another major factor in improving our guest scores has been 
the greater choice of dishes on the menus, improved food 
quality and better presentation on the plate. We have spiced 
up our menus with a more exciting range of dishes, including 
a greater choice of salads in Beefeater Grill and a new range 
of burgers in Table Table.
Building a loyal fan base
On the back of the highly popular Beefeater Rewards Club,  
we have rolled out loyalty schemes in our other two main 
brands during the year. The Brewers Fayre Bonus Club was 
launched in April 2013 and the ‚ÄòTable Table Tasty Rewards‚Äô 
was launched in August 2013.
These programmes help us to understand our guests much 
better than ever before. We know how often they dine with 
us, who they bring, what they eat and other facts such  
as their birthdays. We have already rewarded our most loyal 
customers with 57,000 free birthday meals and the good 
news is they invite friends and family. 
2013/14 has also been the year when our social media presence 
took off across our Restaurant brands and has helped us to 
really engage our customer base. We launched the Beefeater 
Facebook and Twitter accounts in June 2013 with the ‚ÄòBoss  
of Beef‚Äô campaign headed up by Sir Ian Botham and we now  
have 294,000 fans on Facebook and 6,100 followers on  
Twitter across our Restaurants business.

Growth milestones
At the end of 2012/13 we extended our growth milestone  
to reach around 75,000 UK rooms by 2018 through the 
addition of 23,000 rooms and for our share of the total hotel 
market to rise from 7.6% to around 11.0% across this period.  
In 2013/14 we made good progress against our growth 
objectives opening 3,364 net new Premier Inn rooms in  
23 net new hotels including eight new joint site restaurants. 
This increased our total number of rooms to 55,035 and  
hotels to 672. 
We analyse supply and demand in some 500 micro markets 
across the UK and see a significant growth opportunity in 
London where we currently have 8,729 Premier Inn rooms.  
We have plans to grow our London estate to 20,000 rooms 
by 2018 and our central London rooms from around 2,900  
to 8,250. The business case for operating in central London  
is particularly compelling with the profits of a leasehold room 
being twice that of a leasehold room in the regions due to 
higher RevPAR and a faster maturity profile. 
Our 2018 growth milestone includes 3,000 rooms of our  
new compact city centre hotel brand, ‚Äòhub by Premier Inn‚Äô.  
The footprint of a ‚Äòhub‚Äô room is 45% smaller than that of a 
Premier Inn room and, with 25% lower build and operating 
costs, would deliver similar returns on capital to a Premier  
Inn hotel at a 30% lower price point. Our first ‚Äòhub‚Äô hotel  
is due to open in the second half of this year.
During 2013/14 our Hotels & 
Restaurants business delivered  
a good performance with revenue 
increasing by 9.8% to ¬£1,494.0 million. 
Premier Inn grew total sales by 13.4% to ¬£967.9 million with 
the opening of 3,771 net new rooms worldwide and like for  
like sales growth of 5.0%. Restaurants grew total sales by  
3.9% to ¬£526.1 million with like for like sales growth of 1.6% 
and the opening of eight restaurants. Underlying profit rose 
by 11.2% to ¬£348.1 million and Hotels & Restaurants‚Äô return  
on capital increased by 0.9% pts to 13.3%.
Our strong cash flow generation fuelled both reinvestment in 
the business and organic growth as we invested ¬£231.1 million 
during the period. At the same time, we delivered consistently 
strong returns as we focus on growing profits and improving 
shareholder value year after year. 
We held an Investor Day in July 2013 and the presentation  
can be found at www.whitbread.co.uk/investordays
UK hotel market
Whilst the UK hotel market has seen little volume growth 
since the onset of recession in 2008 there are important shifts 
taking place. The independent sector has been in decline  
to the benefit of branded chains which are gaining share. We 
expect the structural change in the hotel sector to continue, 
providing further opportunity for branded penetration within 
the UK market. By using our competitive advantage of the 
largest hotel network, a consistent superior product and great 
value for money, combined with our brand strength and 
operational excellence, Premier Inn is ideally placed to benefit 
from this structural shift. 
Premier Inn offers more rooms in more locations, allowing  
our customers to stay closer to where they want to be.

Profitable Growth 
continued 
Our committed pipeline remains strong with 11,500 rooms  
of which 5,500 are in London. This puts us on track to achieve  
our 2016 growth milestone of 65,000 rooms and well on our 
way towards reaching our target of around 75,000 rooms  
by 2018.
Whilst we focus on delivering our organic growth strategy  
it is also important that we continue to deliver good like  
for like growth. Our focus on the quality and consistency  
of our product and services combined with the key levers  
of dynamic pricing, digital, reinvestment in our estate  
and network strength improved like for like sales by 5.0%  
for Premier Inn during 2013/14. 
Dynamic pricing
Dynamic pricing has been an important contributor to our 
sales growth as we have introduced more sophistication into 
our pricing. Today, we have two separate price points ‚Äî Flex 
and Saver ‚Äî each of which carry different benefits targeted  
at specific consumer segments.
As we build our digital capability this directly benefits our 
dynamic pricing model. By linking our online data, together 
with our customer data and bookings performance,  
we can get detailed information on demand and purchase 
patterns, which allows us to make more precise and  
profitable pricing decisions.
We continue to invest significantly in this key area of our 
business to enable us to improve our sales per available  
room, win market share and enhance overall returns.
Digital
Premier Inn is a leading digital retailer with over 85%  
of bookings derived through our digital channels. Online 
distribution remains a key focus for Premier Inn and we 
continue to invest in mobile innovation and driving direct  
sales to our website. The latter is our preferred method of 
distribution representing 77% of our bookings, compared  
with only 8% for a third‚Äìparty affiliate with the remainder 
being by telephone or walk‚Äìin guests.
Mobile platforms are a major contributor to growth with  
visits to our websites doubling across the past 12 months  
to represent 36% of all visits. We launched our first mobile 
app in 2011 with an updated version in 2012, for which there 
has been some two million downloads. Mobile development  
is an area of rapid growth and we are responding to this 
changing environment through investing in our digital 
capabilities. 
We believe digital offers a huge opportunity in our market, 
allowing us to maximise the capacity across our network 
through up selling and cross selling in order to deliver better 
cost efficiencies and greater profitability.
Restaurants
Restaurants made good progress in the year with like for like 
sales growth of 1.6%, outperforming the Coffer Peach industry 
benchmark outside of the M25. The growth in like for like  
sales has been driven by management actions including new 
menu ranges, better procurement, continuing focus on coffee 
and breakfast sales combined with smarter promotions as  
we have grown our email database to 1.7 million customers.
The joint site model continues to provide significant  
benefits to Whitbread through offering a superior customer 
experience. It also allows access to smaller catchment areas 
where there is demand for only 50 to 80 Premier Inn rooms, 
enabling us to offer consumers the widest choice of locations 
in comparison to our competitors. Together this translates 
into a higher guest recommend score which is a driver for 
RevPAR growth and better return on capital. 
International
Overseas, our five hotels in the Middle East and three hotels  
in India made good progress with like for like occupancy  
rising 10.9% pts to 77.5% and like for like RevPAR growing 
20.0%. Our hotels business in the Gulf is now generating 
profits and, whilst India has proven more challenging, we 
remain confident about our longer‚Äìterm prospects in India 
and the underlying trends in the market.
We started our international journey in 2008 through building 
Premier Inn hotels in the Middle East and India to establish  
the brand. We are now accelerating our growth through 
transitioning from an asset heavy to an asset light strategy  
and focusing on a small number of high growth, selected 
emerging markets which have attractive leisure and business 
fundamentals. We have a good committed pipeline of 22 hotels 
and 16 signed memoranda of understanding as we continue  
to expand the Premier Inn brand across the Middle East, India 
and South East Asia. 
Bringing the Premier Inn brand  
to the Middle East and India.

it feels to work at Costa and have a rigorous action planning 
process at stores and in our support teams to learn from  
the results and continuously strive to make Costa a better 
place to work.
Communication is a key area where we know we can improve. 
This year, we launched ‚ÄòAvenue‚Äô to the business, an online 
social media platform, encouraging conversation and 
enabling teams to showcase excellence and talk to each  
other as well as networking across our Whitbread brands.  
We also run regular focus groups at stores, in regions and  
in our support functions to explore important topics with our 
teams. Feedback from our teams has informed and fed into 
our ‚ÄòWhole Package‚Äô principles, a way of rewarding our  
teams and driving engagement even further.
Leadership and development
We offer exciting leadership opportunities around the world 
and are committed to developing talented leaders. This year 
we have focused on development and progression across  
all business divisions. We have done this in a number of  
ways. More than 1,000 barista maestros, assistant managers 
and store managers have been developed through one  
of Costa‚Äôs management development training workshops  
and 12 store managers have progressed through our high 
potential development programme, Shining Stars.
We work hard to encourage and enable moves and 
promotions across our business divisions, giving our team 
members the opportunity to develop their careers in 
stretching roles within a different business unit, including 
international positions and secondments.
We are passionate about our coffee and have taken over 
3,000 baristas through Barista Maestro and Coffee Champion 
training programmes at our academies, to ensure that perfect 
hand‚Äìcrafted coffees are created in all our stores and that we 
deliver an unbeatable coffee experience.
Skills development
The quality of our coffee and expertise of our baristas  
are vital to Costa‚Äôs success. This year we focused on further 
developing the knowledge of our skills trainers and we have 
given a facelift to our Newbury training academy with new, 
more advanced equipment and state of the art technology  
for the students to experience and learn from. We will  
shortly open our fifth academy, as demand for development 
programmes increases.
Job opportunities
With our ambitious growth plans, opening a store almost 
every day around the world, Costa is creating jobs and careers 
for thousands of people. In the UK, new openings of Costa 
stores have created over 1,800 new jobs in 2013/14. New roles 
have also been added in our Equity business in France, as well 
as support functions across the globe.
Our baristas enhance the

Local communities
Being part of the community is increasingly important to our

Foundation. This year, we have responded to teams who  
want to help the local communities where they work and have 
launched programmes to deliver this. Costa For Schools is 
another programme we have introduced. This is a website 
that informs and educates both teachers and pupils, linking  
to the national curriculum for geography.
Work experience programmes have been launched across  
all stores ‚Äî designed to bring students into Costa and  
inspire them in the world of work and the possibility of a 
career with Costa. 
We have worked with the Prince‚Äôs Trust on ‚ÄòGet into Coffee‚Äô 
programmes, across the country, in Manchester, Leeds, 
Bristol, Glasgow and Bedfordshire, resulting in young people 
being offered roles within our stores on completion of the 
programmes.

in 2006 as a part‚Äìtime barista while she was studying.  
Her dedication, hard work and skill saw her progress quickly 
through store roles as a Barista Maestro and then Assistant 
Manager in our equity business. Katja then moved to work  
in one of our individual franchise partner stores as a Store 
Manager, where her attention to detail and natural coaching 
ability made her the natural candidate for a key role in the 
HR team. Katja‚Äôs passion for development and drive for 
excellence in everything she does, led her to be promoted  
to her current role as Global Brand Excellence Manager.  
In this role Katja leads a team of six, supporting our franchise 
partners, as well as our equity and international businesses, 
to ensure consistency and excellence in Costa brand 
standards across the globe. She is inspirational to her team 
and peer group, delivering fantastic results in a way that  
very much reflects our Costa values.
Opportunities to share in Costa‚Äôs success 
 
The Whole Package 
Since implementing pay for progression in our UK Retail 
stores there has been a major shift in the way we reward  
our baristas after they complete their basic training.
We continue to pay above the national minimum wage and 
we also offer an incentive scheme called ‚ÄòFeel Good‚Äô that all 
our baristas can participate in. This year, we have significantly 
improved the scheme, particularly for our Barista Maestro 
population, in recognition of the level of responsibility in  
the role.
As part of our continued focus on improving Costa as a  
great place to work, we have talked to our teams about their 
‚ÄòWhole Package‚Äô and communicated all the benefits on offer. 
We have also worked on increasing the base rates of pay for 
our Barista Maestros and Assistant Managers, and recognising  
an increase in skill and specialism across our teams.
Reward and recognition
Other ways in which we reward and recognise our teams 
include campaign incentives, introduced at the beginning  
of our summer and Christmas campaigns to improve team 
engagement, enhance the customer experience and drive 
sales. Across all levels of the business, individuals and teams 
are recognised through the use of ‚ÄòGrazie‚Äô cards, which give  
a personalised ‚Äòthank you‚Äô message, and recognition pins  
in the form of flying coffee beans. Many of these individuals 
and teams are also celebrated at award events held across  
the business.
Costa Barista of the Year 
The 8th annual Costa Barista of the Year competition took 
place in October 2013 which saw Baristas from across our 
business come together to compete in the global Champion  
of Champions final in London. The competition tests 
competitors‚Äô pride, passion and personality in delivering 
exceptional coffee experiences. They are judged on their 
technical skill and coffee knowledge through a range  
of coffee‚Äìbased challenges throughout the two‚Äìday 
competition before the winner is crowned Champion  
of Champions in front of a live audience made up of 
representatives from across Costa and its supply chain.  
This year‚Äôs winner was Tony Huang, an Assistant Store 
Manager from Guangzhou Grand View Mall store in China.

Making it easy for customers to choose Costa
Customers won‚Äôt travel too far for a cup of coffee, which  
is why it is so important to make it convenient for them  
to choose Costa. The quickest way to get the convenience  
is through presence and hence our relentless drive to open 
stores at a fast pace in the UK and overseas. In the UK we 
have built a network that is bigger than the second and  
third brands combined. Our success in the UK has allowed  
us to extend the reach of the Costa brand across the world  
and develop new channels so that customers in 30 countries 
can now enjoy the special Costa ‚Äòexperience‚Äô. This year  
we celebrated the opening of our 1,000th overseas store  
in Bangkok, Thailand.
We are present across a broad range of channels ‚Äî from  
high street to shopping centres, from airports to cinemas, 
from motorway service stations and drive‚Äìthrus to corporate 
offices, hospitals and health clubs. Costa Express, our  
self‚Äìserve coffee bars, have enabled us to access even more 
locations and provide customers with a quick and easy way  
to grab a great tasting Costa coffee on the go. In all, we  
have nearly 10,000 points of distribution in the UK alone, 
making it easier for our customers to get a great cup of  
Costa as part of their daily routines. 
Coffee lovers can also enjoy our Tassimo ‚ÄòCosta at Home‚Äô 
range, which has been on sale in supermarkets for just  
over a year and already includes the two biggest‚Äìselling 
Tassimo lines in the UK.
Serving only the best quality coffee
Coffee quality is at the heart of what we do and we are 
passionate about only buying the best beans (only 1% of the 
world‚Äôs beans are good enough) and roasting them in our  
own roastery in London under strict quality control to create 
our famous unique Mocha Italia blend. 
We are constantly looking to enhance the customer 
experience by giving them more choice of drinks that 
leverage our superior Mocha Italia blend. In 2013/14 we 
launched a new range of Mocha drinks as well as launching 
the popular ‚ÄòFlat White‚Äô in the Emirates market.
Creating a warm and welcoming experience
Of course, what really creates the atmosphere and keeps  
the customers returning is our people, they provide the Costa 
magic ‚Äî the friendly smile and the great service. And this is 
why we work so hard to ensure that we have highly motivated 
and engaged teams who always put the customer first.  
Our ‚ÄòListen and Learn‚Äô customer insight programme inspires 
our teams to deliver great customer service as it provides  
real time customer feedback to each UK store and lets them  
know directly what their customers are saying about their 
experience. On average, each store receives 30 unique pieces 
of feedback each month, providing a snapshot of what  
is going well, what needs to be improved and opportunities  
to delight customers even further.
Social and economic changes have 
played their part in the phenomenal 
growth of coffee shop culture around 
the world. Over the past decade Costa 
has both benefitted from and fuelled 
this growth. Going from strength 
to strength in 2013/14 Costa has 
cemented its place as the UK‚Äôs and 
Europe‚Äôs leading coffee shop brand 
and is welcoming more and more 
customers every day around the world.
Day in and day out, we rely on our 30,000 colleagues across  
the world and our success is based on delivering a consistently 
great coffee experience, for each one of the millions of customers 
who use Costa every month. The secret, in our view, is friendly 
teams providing service that is fast and efficient for some and 
warm and friendly for others with more time. Understanding what 
our customers want is key and our ‚ÄòHierarchy of Needs‚Äô model 
is the cornerstone of our business, informing our decision 
making and focusing our time and energy.

Another important part of the overall customer experience  
is a store‚Äôs environment. All our stores must be warm, clean, 
inviting and geared to meeting the individual customer need, 
whether that‚Äôs fast and efficient service for those on the run 
or more inviting and comfortable for those who wish to relax.
We have distinct store formats that we use around the world. 
Our ‚ÄòEvolution‚Äô store design is perhaps the most familiar, 
whilst our ‚ÄòMetro‚Äô design is aimed at city locations potentially 
with a younger more style‚Äìconscious customer demographic. 
We recently used the ‚ÄòMetro‚Äô design in Paris and Bangkok.
One of our new Paris stores. 
Our drive‚Äìthru format is proving very successful and we  
now have 15 stores in the UK and one in the Middle East. 
Over the past three years 69% of our UK estate is new or 
refurbished and in 2013/14 we invested ¬£10 million in 
refurbishing 139 stores.
Innovating our food and drink to keep customers happy
At Costa we recognise the imperative of a strong focus  
on innovation to stay ahead of our competition and to keep 
delighting our customers.
Our Christmas ‚Äòcharacter‚Äô cups proved  
extremely popular with customers.
We have not confined our innovation to just coffee and have 
broadened our range of high quality teas into long jing green 
tea as well as trialling loose leaf teas. 
Costa provides a moment  
of relaxation. 
For the summer months, we added new drinks to our Costa 
Ice range which achieved record breaking sales in the UK.  
This year has also seen us putting much greater emphasis  
on seasonal innovation with the launch of our first Halloween 
campaign as well as great Christmas ‚Äòcharacter‚Äô cups that 
proved extremely popular with customers.
Record breaking Costa Ice sales.
Around 40% of all transactions include food and we have to 
ensure that we continue to offer customer favourites whilst 
regularly introducing new and exciting ranges. We have also 
introduced lower entry point foods, such as small cakes in 
China, which have driven higher food capture rates.

Understanding and engaging our customers 
Our Coffee Club card is a valuable tool that provides us with 
real time customer insight and tells us what we are getting 
right and how we keep them happy in the future. With  
2.3 million active card members we receive nearly 48,000 
pieces of customer feedback every month. Our ‚ÄòListen and 
Learn‚Äô customer insight programme is used to create our 
guest scores, which have risen by 7% pts to 54% in the year. 
This is fundamental to our success in creating an emotional 
connection between our customers and the Costa brand. 
Particularly exciting for our Coffee Club members is the 
recent trial of a mobile app which enables the collection  
and redemption of Coffee Club points using a mobile  
phone and we plan to roll this out to all members in 2014/15.
Our social media and digital presence is steadily improving 
and over the last few months we have achieved over a  
million Facebook fans. On Twitter we have recently been  
rated Number 3 on the leader board of ‚ÄòUK Twitter Customer  
Care‚Äô and are the only coffee shop operators to feature  
in the Top 100. 
A coffee shop is often at the heart of a local community  
and our Costa teams do some tremendous work in their 
communities to support local causes, at the same time 
strengthening customer engagement and connections. 
Our teams get involved 
in their local communities.

Growth milestones
During 2013/14 we continued to invest in our position as the 
UK‚Äôs leading coffee shop as well as growing our international 
presence. We opened 177 net new stores in the UK taking  
the total to 1,755 and 157 net new stores internationally taking 
the total to 1,106, leading to a total of 2,861 stores worldwide. 
At the end of 2012/13 we extended our growth milestone  
to double our system sales to around ¬£2 billion by 2018 and 
for the share of international to grow from 22% to around 33%. 
Organic growth has underpinned our success in the UK and 
we expect to open a further 400 to 500 equity stores and 100 
new franchise stores over this period. We use the data derived 
from our Coffee Club card along with detailed demographic 
analysis across some 40,000 micro markets to plot our  
UK expansion.

Costa delivered another outstanding 
performance during the year, with 
total sales up 20.1% driven by good  
like for like growth and a strong store 
opening programme. 
Total system sales, which are sales derived from Costa‚Äìowned 
and franchise stores, grew 19.4% to ¬£1,199.2 million. Following  
a strong top line performance, underlying operating profit 
increased by 21.9% to ¬£109.8 million. Once again, a disciplined 
approach to capital deployment combined with good cash 
flow generation has increased return on capital by 5.8% pts  
to 40.5%.

The UK coffee market
Over the last fifteen years there have been a series of social 
trends which have been of benefit to the coffee shop market. 
According to coffee experts Allegra Strategies, weekly coffee 
sales from UK branded chains have grown at a 9% CAGR 
since 2008 with further growth expected over the next few 
years. Five years ago there were just under 11,000 outlets  
in the UK, today there are over 16,000 and by 2018 this is 
expected to rise to over 20,000. Consumers increasing their 
knowledge and awareness of coffee, the changing face of  
the high street to become more leisure orientated and the rise 
of female spending power and mobile working are cited as 
some of the major drivers behind the growth of this sector. 
Our relentless focus on understanding the customer‚Äôs needs 
and our rigorous approach to providing excellent execution 
has played a major part in our success and helped 
differentiate us from the competition.

continued 
In addition to our successful roll‚Äìout programme, Costa has 
also delivered 48 quarters of strong like for like growth and 
we ended 2013/14 with like for like growth of 5.7%, mainly  
as a result of a 5.0% growth in transactions. 
Investment in our stores is a key differentiator and more  
than 69% of our UK store estate has either been opened  
or refurbished in the past three years. 
International
Internationally we have continued to grow our franchise 
network in Europe, the Middle East and India, with a net  
86 openings outside of the UK. We also entered Spain  
for the first time and added Thailand to our new South  
East Asia region. 
Progress in Poland has been difficult due to weak consumer 
confidence, the impact of a VAT increase on milk‚Äìbased 
drinks and the distraction to the business as we rebrand from 
coffeeheaven to Costa. However, market fundamentals are 
still positive and we remain focused on rebranding the estate 
and further expanding our presence. China, where we operate 
two joint ventures, remains an exciting opportunity for the 
Group. During the year we opened 73 new stores in China 
taking our total number of stores to 326 in 30 cities. Like for 
like stores in China made good progress, although some new 
openings have taken longer than expected to reach maturity.
We remain excited about the international opportunity for 
Costa and have commenced a programme of opening trial 
equity stores in France. The first equity store opened in 
October 2013 and we currently have a total of four equity 
stores with a further five expected to open in the next  
12 months. We also have two franchise stores in France.
Diverse operating model
In addition to our store portfolio, we provide access to Costa 
through a number of different channels such as Wholesale, 
Costa Express and Costa at Home. As already stated, Costa 
Express had a highly successful year adding 955 net new  
units taking the total to 3,515. We are now in the process of 
testing our new Costa Express machine which we believe will 
facilitate growth in new channels, including universities and 
hospitals, as well as spearhead our international expansion. 
Through this, we see the opportunity for an additional  
2,500 to 3,500 units by 2018.

Risk 
management
The matrices, together with the detailed risk registers 
containing current controls, mitigating actions and  
planned future actions, are reviewed on a regular basis  
by the management board of each business. The outputs  
of the process carried out by the businesses form the basis  
of the risk matrix for the Group. In addition a top‚Äìdown  
risk assessment exercise is conducted, to capture the  
Board‚Äôs views on the principal risks facing Whitbread. 
The most significant business‚Äìlevel risks are included in the 
Group risk matrix, together with other risks identified by  
the Executive Committee. The Group risk matrix is reviewed  
on a quarterly basis by the Board and annually by the Audit 
Committee.
The process:
‚Ä¢	
identifies risk to the achievement of strategy;
‚Ä¢	
assesses risks based on the impact and likelihood of a risk 
occurring on a gross (before taking controls and mitigating 
factors into consideration), net (post control and mitigation) 
and target basis;
‚Ä¢	
outlines key controls and mitigating factors; 
‚Ä¢	
assigns a risk owner to each risk; and
‚Ä¢	
ensures that risks, controls and mitigating factors are 
reviewed quarterly and updated as necessary.
The risk and control matrices form the basis of the annual 
assurance plan, which provides for the independent testing  
of controls and mitigating actions by NSF (an independent 
health and safety auditing company), the Company‚Äôs internal 
control evaluation process or PwC as part of the operational 
audit programme.
The current status 
In total, there were 16 risks (2013: 21 risks) identified on  
the Group risk matrix considered by the Audit Committee  
in March 2014. After taking account of the controls and 
mitigation plans the Audit Committee and the Board 
considered that six of the risks would be either unlikely to 
occur or would have a low impact. For this reason, these  
risks have not been categorised as principal risks for the 
purposes of this report.
The ten principal risks identified, together with a summary  
of controls, mitigation and assurance plans are summarised 
on pages 32 and 33. None of these risks are considered to 
have a high likelihood of occurring after taking account of 
controls and mitigation. The new risks included since last 
year‚Äôs report include the potential for death or serious injury 
as a result of Company negligence, the inability to operate the 
Costa roastery for an extended period and two information 
systems risks relating to the Premier Inn booking system and 
the ineffective implementation of a major systems upgrade.
Effective risk management is vital to 
the successful delivery of Whitbread‚Äôs 
strategy and helps us create legendary 
brands across all of our businesses.  
The principal risks to the achievement

Structure
Whitbread‚Äôs approach to risk management has been 
reinvigorated this year, with additional focus being placed  
on ensuring there is a consistent methodology used across 
each business. 
The structure and governance over the risk management 
process at Whitbread is shown in the diagram on page 31. 
Both Whitbread Hotels & Restaurants and Costa maintain risk 
matrices aligned to their own business model. These matrices 
analyse the risks to the achievement of each business‚Äôs strategic 
goals and prioritise those risks using a four level impact and 
likelihood scale.

Key Performance 
Indicators
Our key performance indicators are 
based on the strategic framework  
of the Company ‚Äî Winning Teams, 
Customer Heartbeat, Profitable 
Growth and Good Together. Behind 
each of these headings are clear and 
measurable targets which together 
make up our balanced scorecard  
or WINcard as we call it (Whitbread  
In Numbers). It is used throughout  
the Company. Every hotel, restaurant  
and coffee shop has its own WINcard. 
All support centres, each business  
and the Group as a whole have their 
own WINcards. Every month the results 
are published throughout the Group  
so that everyone knows exactly how 
they are doing against the key targets  
for the year.
As these are key strategic measures  
a number of them form an important 
part of the incentive schemes for our 
teams. Details of how the executive 
directors are rewarded for their 
WINcard performance are described  
in the remuneration report on page 68.
The WINcard targets are set at the 
beginning of each year and agreed  
with the Remuneration Committee. 
They are usually set above the level 
achieved in the previous year to  
improve performance. In general,  
a green WINcard is achieved where  
the performance is better than  
both target and the previous year.  
An amber score is for performance  
which is better than the prior year  
but below target and a red score  
is for a result below the previous year.

Winning Teams
Team engagement
Engagement measures how  
our teams feel about working for  
the Company. We find out by  
asking everyone in the Company  
to complete a survey twice a year  
that asks questions that give us  
a very clear idea as to how they  
are feeling at that time. 
Health & Safety
Nothing could be more important  
than the safety of our teams and  
our customers. Independent audits  
are carried out throughout the  
year to check that standards are  
being maintained with certain  
key areas resulting in automatic  
failure if they are not met.
Why this is important
We want our people to enjoy what  
they do and to know we will work  
to improve things if they tell us they  
are not happy. We also know that the 
happier our teams feel about their  
work the better they will serve our 
customers. We will attract as well  
as retain great people if we can  
achieve high levels of engagement. 
Why this is important
Our people have a right to work  
in a safe environment and our 
customers rightly expect us to  
look after them when they choose  
to sleep, eat or drink with us.  
A significant health and safety  
failure would also affect confidence  
in our business.

Brand standards ‚Äî  
Costa
Our customers rightly expect a 
consistently high standard of service 
and physical surroundings in our  
coffee shops. We have developed  
brand standards, which are designed  
to ensure we meet our customers‚Äô 
expectations.
Family measures ‚Äî  
Hotels & Restaurants
The provision of a quality restaurant  
is important to our Premier Inn guests 
and our joint site model provides us 
with good synergies.
Brand performance
With our aim to make everyday 
experiences special it is vital  
that we have a robust way of  
measuring how our customers  
rate our performance in terms  
of recommendations and  
preference over other brands. 
Why this is important
We know that our customers have a 
choice when they are choosing a coffee 
shop and that we have to be able to 
show that we operate at consistently 
high levels that make them want to 
choose us.
Why this is important
Measures have been developed  
to make sure that our Premier Inn and 
Restaurants teams work well together 
for the benefit of guests. For Premier 
Inn, we measure the proportion  
of guests that have breakfast in the 
restaurant. We audit breakfast 
standards for Restaurants.
Why this is important
Without this information we would  
not be able to measure and improve  
our customers‚Äô experience or  
compare the experience we provide  
to that provided by our competitors.

Profitable Growth
Profit
As with all businesses we measure  
our financial success by the profits  
we make through growing our 
brands and operating our businesses 
efficiently. A budget is agreed  
with the Board each year which  
sets a target profit level.
Like for like sales growth
We closely follow the sales  
growth performance of those  
hotels, restaurants and coffee  
shops that have been open  
for more than a year. 
Market performance/growth
Our strategy is based on the  
profitable growth of our brands  
which we measure in terms  
of our sales growth per available 
room compared to our  
competitors in hotels and the  
number of net new stores in Costa. 
Why this is important
Recognising that our shareholders have 
a choice in investing their money we 
need to be able to demonstrate that  
our businesses can produce sustainable 
profit growth. This should mean that  
the underlying value of the Company 
will increase and dividends can be  
paid in line with that growth.
Why this is important
While we are investing so much in the 
organic growth of Hotels & Restaurants 
and Costa we need to keep a close eye 
on how the mature parts of the business 
are performing. This enables us to make 
better investment decisions in terms  
of our new developments as well as 
being able to react to shorter‚Äìterm 
performance trends.
Why this is important
We need to be able to understand  
how we are performing on a constant 
basis to show our shareholders  
how we are performing against the  
rest of the market and to develop  
our strategy accordingly. 
How we have done in 2013/14
We grew our Group underlying profit 
before tax by 16.5% last year, with 
Hotels & Restaurants growing its  
profits by 11.2% and Costa by 21.9%. 
 
 
How we have done in 2013/14
The strength of our brands has meant 
we have beaten our like for like sales 
targets across the Company with  
Group at 4.2%, Hotels & Restaurants  
at 3.7% and Costa at 5.7%. 
How we have done in 2013/14
We opened 334 net new Costa stores 
worldwide, which was more than in the 
prior year, but marginally below our 
target of 346 stores.
We grew market share in Premier Inn, 
with 4.3% RevPAR growth and an 
increase of 3,364 net new rooms.  
Our budget competitors grew  
RevPAR by 8.3% from a low base.

Returns on investment 
A crucial factor in measuring our 
performance is how well we have  
invested our shareholders‚Äô money.  
We calculate this by dividing  
the underlying profit of an asset  
or business by the capital value  
of the asset it has been invested in. 
Carbon consumption/waste to landfill
Our corporate responsibility 
programme covers a number  
of areas against which we measure 
ourselves. Hotels & Restaurants  
has a carbon reduction target  
and Costa has a target to divert  
waste from landfill.
Why this is important
Our investors want to be able to  
judge how well we are using their 
money in comparison to other 
investments that they could make.  
We also want to be able to compare 
the performance of different types  
of businesses and assets to focus  
our own plans, and measuring  
returns helps us to do so.
Why this is important
Companies have a responsibility  
to reduce their impact on the 
environment which we fully endorse. 
There are also clear economic  
benefits in reducing carbon 
consumption primarily through  
reduced energy bills.
How we have done in 2013/14
The Group returns grew from  
13.9% to 15.3%. Hotels & Restaurants 
return on capital grew from 12.4%  
to 13.3% and Costa grew returns  
from 34.7% to 40.5%.
How we have done in 2013/14
Costa now diverts 67.0% of waste  
from landfill, which is in excess of the 
64.0% target. Hotels & Restaurants 
achieved a 6.1% reduction in like for  
like carbon consumption versus a  
target of 3.0%.
Return on capital is an important 
indicator used when considering all 
investment decisions and is a key 
measure for the Company‚Äôs Long  
Term Incentive Plan, but is not on  
the WINcard.

Premier Inn UK grew its market share with total sales of ¬£966.1 million. We opened 28 hotels with 3,546 new rooms increasing 
our rooms stock by 6.5% to 55,035. Like for like sales grew by 5.0% driven by an increase in the like for like revenue per 
available room of 4.3%. Internationally we opened two new hotels one in Abu Dhabi and the other in Pune, India. Restaurants 
like for like sales grew by 1.6% and eight new restaurants were opened during the year.
Hotels & Restaurants in the UK had a particularly strong fourth quarter, with like for like sales growth of 7.3% compared to 2.7% 
for the previous three quarters. This was caused by a combination of successful Christmas and New Year campaigns, unusually 
benign weather in January and February and softer comparatives last year. We also experienced higher than expected sales and 
margins in the quarter due to strong average room rates in the hotel market and less promotional discounting in Restaurants.
Costa
Costa‚Äôs revenue grew by 20.1% to ¬£807.7 million continuing to benefit from the socio‚Äìeconomic changes favouring coffee 
shops, further strengthening of the consumer‚Äôs preference for the Costa brand and a growing estate both in the UK and 
internationally. Costa‚Äôs UK sales grew to ¬£708.1 million, up 19.6%, with retail like for like sales increasing by 5.7% and 177 net 
new UK coffee shops. International sales grew to ¬£99.6 million with 157 net new stores. Costa Enterprises grew strongly  
with 955 net new Costa Express coffee machines taking the total to 3,515, with 178 installed internationally.
Whitbread has continued its strong financial performance, 
with revenue up 13.0% to ¬£2.3 billion, underlying profit

Whitbread‚Äôs underlying profit before tax was up 16.5% to ¬£411.8 million. Underlying profit before tax excludes the pension 
interest charge, the amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items.
Hotels & Restaurants profits grew to ¬£348.1 million up 11.2% with the UK profits up 10.9% to ¬£354.1 million. Due to the 
particularly strong fourth quarter, UK profits were up 15.2% in the second half of the year compared to 7.9% in the first  
half. Rent costs increased by 27.5% to ¬£88.5 million, reflecting the higher mix of leasehold openings. Our depreciation  
and amortisation charge also rose above the rate of sales at 15.2% to ¬£98.6 million (2012/13: ¬£85.6 million) as we aligned  
our depreciation period to our new refurbishment cycle, reducing a room‚Äôs economic useful life from 15 to 12 years. This  
change is applied to this and future years such that there is incremental depreciation of ¬£6.0 million in 2013/14 and 2014/15. 
As we continue to invest in our customer offering we will increase our refurbishment programme in 2014/15 to approximately  
12,700 rooms (5,433 in 2013/14) carrying out both a light and full programme and installing some 2,500 air conditioning  
units. In addition we will upgrade our customer Wi‚ÄìFi offering and increase our revenue investment in technology and  
process improvements as we evolve our systems to support future growth. These revenue investments will amount to 
approximately ¬£10.0 million in 2014/15.
International hotel losses were ¬£6.0 million with good progress in the Middle East. In 2014/15 we will continue our development 
of South East Asia with further revenue investments to create an operational hub.
Costa‚Äôs strong performance was led by UK Retail and Costa Enterprises with profits increasing by 26.5% to ¬£110.9 million. 
Internationally Costa made a loss of ¬£1.1 million (2012/13: profit ¬£2.4 million). We improved profitability in the Middle East,  
in our European franchises and in the like for like stores in China. Offsetting this, we are continuing to invest in new stores,  
the infrastructure and team in China and we have also invested in the start up of our equity business in France. In Poland  
we have seen a decline in our like for like sales and our profitability caused by a weak macro environment, an increase in  
VAT on milk based drinks, which took affect in April 2013, and some disruption as we reviewed our estate and rebranded  
the stores to Costa. These latter activities continue into the new year.
Total profit after tax and exceptional items was ¬£323.4 million up 10.7% on last year.
Interest
The underlying interest charge for the year was ¬£18.9 million, a reduction of ¬£4.7 million compared to last year. This resulted 
from the decrease in the proportion of fixed interest rate debt following the maturity of a number of fixed rate swaps  
in December 2012 and the strong cash flow generated in the year reducing net debt by ¬£79.5 million to ¬£391.6 million.  
The effective interest rate on average net debt reduced from 4.8% to 4.7%.
The total pre exceptional interest cost is ¬£42.5 million (2012/13: ¬£50.6 million) including the IAS 19 pension finance charge  
of ¬£23.6 million (2012/13: ¬£27.0 million).

Exceptional items
Exceptional items for the year amounted to a benefit of ¬£25.9 million. Full details are set out in Note 6 to the financial 
statements.
There are a number of significant items. The first item relates to a ¬£18.6 million release of the deferred tax liability following  
a reduction in the corporation tax rate from 23% to 20%. Secondly, we reassessed the indexation allowance on rolled over 
capital gains which gave rise to a further ¬£40.2 million release of deferred tax liability. Thirdly, there is a net impairment  
charge and loss on disposals of ¬£31.9 million of which ¬£10.5 million relates to the reorganisation of our Costa Poland business 
and ¬£6.8 million relates to additional provisions relating to property reversions. Lastly, in previous periods the Group disclosed  
a contingent liability in respect of a claim for repayment of VAT on gaming machine income of ¬£4.6 million. Following the  
Court of Appeal decision in October 2013 in favour of HMRC against the Rank Group Plc, Whitbread has decided to recognise 
this expected cash outflow plus a further amount of ¬£1.1 million in respect of interest on late payment.
Taxation
Underlying tax for the year amounts to ¬£94.1 million, an increase of 3.6% on the prior year. The effective tax rate was 22.9% 
(2012/13: 25.7%) following the reduction in corporation tax rates and one off adjustments in respect of previous years crediting 
the tax charge by ¬£4.7 million.
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share for the year is 179.02p up 20.1% on last year as a result of the strong profit growth, combined with 
a lower effective tax rate as explained above. Underlying diluted earnings per share for the year is 177.14p up 19.8% on last year.
Dividend 
The recommended final dividend is 47.00p, an increase on last year of 24.0%, making the total dividend for the year 68.80p  
up 19.9% in line with the Group‚Äôs basic earnings per share growth. With the final dividend we will offer our shareholders the 
option to participate in a dividend reinvestment plan. The scrip plan has been terminated.
Net debt and free cash
The principal movements in net debt are as follows:
  2013/14 2012/13 
   ¬£m ¬£m
Cash flow from operations before pension 601.3 526.0
Capital expenditure (306.2) (343.6)
Overseas investment (1.6) (4.8)
Disposal proceeds 1.0 51.0
Interest (19.1) (26.2)
Tax (81.4) (46.7)
Pensions (71.2) (45.7)
Dividends (62.4) (77.8)
Other 19.1 1.0
Net cash flow 79.5 33.2
Net debt brought forward (471.1) (504.3)
Net debt carried forward (391.6) (471.1)
Cash generated from operations before pension increased by 14.3% to ¬£601.3 million. This strong cash flow enabled Whitbread 
to fund its growth from internal resources, grow its dividend and reduce its net debt. Investment in capital expenditure  
was ¬£306.2 million (2012/13: ¬£343.6 million) ensuring that the Group continued to grow its market share through new site 
developments whilst improving the existing estate. The pension payments were ¬£71.2 million with the defined benefit 
contribution being in line with the triennial scheduled payments agreed with the pension trustee in 2011.
Dividend payments amounted to ¬£62.4 million. In the year there was a high take up of the scrip dividend at 41.6%. The gross 
dividend payment without the scrip dividend would have been ¬£106.9 million. It should be noted that the dividend reinvestment 
plan will replace the scrip dividend for the final dividend payment.

Whitbread 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14
Finance Director‚Äôs 
review
Corporation tax paid in the year was ¬£81.4 million (2012/13: ¬£46.7 million).
As a result of the strong cash flow, net debt as at 27 February 2014 reduced by ¬£79.5 million to ¬£391.6 million (2012/13:  
¬£471.1 million).
Capital expenditure
On an accruals basis, the Group‚Äôs capital spend was ¬£336.6 million (2012/13: ¬£341.1 million). 
The Group‚Äôs cash capital expenditure was ¬£306.2 million, with ¬£231.1 million in Hotels & Restaurants and ¬£74.2 million in  
Costa. Capital expenditure is split between expansionary (which includes the acquisition and development of properties)  
and maintenance. 
Expansionary cash expenditure was ¬£199.7 million (2012/13: ¬£220.1 million). Of this ¬£147.4 million relates to Hotels & Restaurants, 
supporting the 3,955 gross new rooms worldwide and eight new restaurants. Of this amount we spent ¬£127.8 million on 
freehold property (2012/13: ¬£134.0 million). Freehold property remains Whitbread‚Äôs preferred route to market for Hotels & 
Restaurants. It provides operational flexibility to develop the property to our requirements and the financial benefits of 
retaining a greater share of the value generated from the sites‚Äô performance.
Costa spent ¬£52.3 million (2012/13: ¬£61.9 million) on the opening of 423 gross new coffee shops and 1,149 gross new Costa 
Express machines. The lower spend this year was principally due to the timing of the rollout of Costa Express machines.
Maintenance cash expenditure was ¬£106.5 million (2012/13: ¬£123.5 million). In Hotels & Restaurants, cash expenditure was  
¬£83.7 million compared to ¬£103.1 million last year with an additional c.¬£30 million due to be paid in 2014/15 relating to 
refurbishments carried out at the end of 2013/14. In Costa we spent ¬£21.9 million (2012/13: ¬£18.2 million), a considerable  
amount of which was upgrading 139 Costa UK stores.
In 2014/15 we plan to open c.4,500 UK hotel rooms, with approximately 70% opening in the second half. Costa is planning  
to open c.300 coffee shops and install around 600 Costa Express machines. Our committed UK hotel pipeline is made up  
of 75% leasehold properties which will result in Hotels & Restaurants‚Äô rent increasing by approximately ¬£20 million. We expect 
capital expenditure to be around ¬£360 million with the exact amount depending on the timing of freehold land acquisitions. 
Pension
As at 27 February 2014, there was an IAS 19 pension deficit of ¬£534.3 million (2012/13: ¬£541.7 million). The decrease on last  
year was mainly as a result of the strong asset performance and the cash contribution of ¬£71.2 million from the Company, 
partially offset by an increase in the liability due to a reduction in the discount rate from 4.60% to 4.30%. The next triennial 
actuarial pension review will be based on a valuation as of 31 March 2014.
Financial status and funding 
Whitbread aims to maintain its financial position and capital structure consistent with retaining its investment grade status.  
To this end we work within a financial framework of net debt to EBITDAR (pension and lease adjusted) of less than 3.5 times.
In January 2014 we announced that Whitbread had signed an amendment to its existing ¬£650 million syndicated bank facility, 
extending its maturity by two years to 4 November 2018, and introducing two options to extend it by a year sequentially 
beyond that date, with the consent of the banks. The facility pricing remained unchanged. The maturity extension of the loan 
facility, together with our existing private placement notes, has ensured that the Group has access to facilities to meet the 
needs of our growth programme.
Return on capital
Return on capital is a prime focus for Whitbread. In the year the Group‚Äôs return on capital improved by 1.4% pts to 15.3%  
with Costa‚Äôs returns up 5.8% pts to 40.5% and Hotels & Restaurants up 0.9% pts to 13.3%. Of the 1.4% pts improvement  
to the Group‚Äôs return, 0.6% pts was due to the higher mix of leases within our Hotels & Restaurants estate.

At its heart, Whitbread is a people business. We believe  
that creating a great place to work, supporting our people 
to realise their full potential and building leadership strength 
is vital to the success of the Company.
We ensure that we recruit the best people and invest in training and development to grow

Diversity
We operate in a number of countries working with people, customers and suppliers from a 
broad range of backgrounds and cultures. We believe that a diverse organisation encourages  
a full range of ideas and leads to better decision making.
In order to champion the importance of diversity within all levels of the business, we have 
established a cross business diversity group that meets on a quarterly basis with attendees 
representing different areas of the business.
Various matters are discussed during these meetings and actions during the year have 
included:
‚Ä¢	
development of diversity targets and plans for each business; 
‚Ä¢	
a review of recruitment strategies and processes; and
‚Ä¢	
a review of the maternity and paternity policies.

Internal policies
We have a range of policies and programmes which are regularly reviewed and communicated 
to employees through various training modules. These include our Code of Conduct, human 
rights, anti‚Äìbribery, hospitality and gifts, and anti‚Äìfraud and theft policies.
Code of Conduct and human rights
We recognise the importance of taking care of our people by providing a healthy and safe 
working environment and working responsibly to be a positive part of the communities in 
which we operate. 
We have updated our Global Code of Conduct, which is applicable to all employees in all 
countries. This outlines the expected standards of behaviour and the core values of the 
Company. The Code of Conduct also includes details of our independent speaking out service, 
enabling employees to report any concerns regarding harmful behaviour or conduct in a 
confidential manner.
Everyone deserves the right to live and work with dignity. There are basic standards of human 
rights that Whitbread respects at all times. These relate to issues such as child labour, humane 
treatment, working conditions and fair pay. We expect our business partners to respect these 
standards and we will only work with organisations that have the same respect for people‚Äôs 
working conditions that we do.
Our environment
The impact of our business on the environment and the communities in which they operate  
is a key part of our business model and is incorporated in the Good Together element  
of the Customer Heartbeat diagram. Further details regarding Good Together in Hotels & 
Restaurants and Costa can be found on pages 19 and 29 respectively.
Disclosures regarding our Greenhouse Gas emissions as required by the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic and Directors‚Äô Report) Regulations 2013 can be found on pages 79 and 80.
Awards and recognition
We believe that Whitbread is a great place to work and I am proud to report that we were 
recently ranked 8th in The Sunday Times Best Big Companies to Work For 2014 and were 
recognised as the third top employer in the UK by the Top Employers Institute. External 
recognition such as this is helpful as we look to recruit around 3,000 new people every year  
to support our ambitious growth plans.

Corporate
governance
Introduction from Anthony Habgood, Chairman
At Whitbread we recognise that corporate governance touches all aspects of our business  
and affects all of our employees in many different ways. We are committed to maintaining  
high standards of governance to ensure that the Company is managed with integrity and 
transparency.
During the year key governance activities have included:
‚Ä¢	
an internal evaluation of the Board;
‚Ä¢	
a talent review and succession plan for key executive roles;
‚Ä¢	
a review of the way the Audit Committee reports to the Board on how it has carried out  
its responsibilities in relation to the Annual Report and Accounts; and
‚Ä¢	
developing the new form of remuneration report.
Statement of Compliance
The Board takes responsibility for leading on high standards of accountability and ethical 
behaviour. The 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code (‚Äòthe Code‚Äô), which can be found  
at www.frc.org.uk, was applicable to the financial year covered by this Report and is the 
standard against which we measured ourselves. In order to ensure our compliance we 
undertook a thorough review of our corporate governance arrangements including our:
‚Ä¢	
overall compliance with the Code with respect to business and corporate practices;
‚Ä¢	
matters reserved to the Board; and
‚Ä¢	
terms of reference for each of the three Board committees.
The results of this review were presented at the January Board meeting and formally adopted 
by the Board.
We are pleased to report that the Board considered that it and the Company complied with  
all the provisions of the Code throughout the financial year.
Details of how Whitbread has applied the main and supporting principles of the Code with 
regard to remuneration can be found in the remuneration report on pages 58 to 76. Details  
of the members and activities of the Remuneration Committee can be found on page 67. 
Details of the members and activities of the Audit and Nomination committees can be found 
on pages 53 to 57.
Maintaining high standards of corporate governance is vital to supporting our financial 
performance and protecting your Company. Further details are provided in the following 
pages on how Whitbread complied this year in the following areas:
‚Ä¢	
leadership and the Board of Directors;
‚Ä¢	
Board effectiveness;
‚Ä¢	
shareholder relations; 
‚Ä¢	
accountability and internal control; and
‚Ä¢	
Board committees.
The year ahead
Corporate governance is an area that continues to change. We keep all developments under 
review and always aim for a level of governance that is appropriate and relevant to the Company.

Board activities during the year
In advance of each Board meeting, a set of Board papers, 
including monthly financial and trading reports, is circulated 
so that directors have sufficient time to review them and 
arrive at the meeting fully prepared.
The Board has a rolling agenda which sets matters to be 
considered throughout the year. This allows all directors  
to contribute to the setting of the agenda. Having a rolling 
agenda ensures that there is a structured approach to the 
consideration of recurring issues with such items being  
evenly spread across the calendar. The Board gives its 
attention to each area of the business in turn so that a  
strong understanding of the entire Company is maintained. 
The rolling agenda is regularly reviewed and updated  
and is circulated as part of the secretariat report before  
each meeting.
The agendas for individual Board meetings are agreed with 
the Chairman and the Chief Executive on a monthly basis  
so that current events and potential future issues can be 
discussed alongside the regular reports. Standard items for 
each meeting are a review of the minutes from the previous 
meeting, matters arising and progress on action points, 
reports from the Chief Executive, the Finance Director and  
the Managing Directors of Whitbread Hotels & Restaurants 
and Costa and the secretariat report.
The Chairman meets with the non‚Äìexecutive directors  
without the executives present after Board meetings.
There is a schedule of matters reserved exclusively to the 
Board; all other decisions are delegated to management. 
These matters reserved exclusively to the Board include 
approval of Group financial statements and the preliminary 
announcement of half and full‚Äìyear results; changes relating  
to the Group‚Äôs capital structure; the annual budget and the 
Group‚Äôs business plan; approving capital projects, acquisitions 
and disposals valued at over ¬£12 million; interim dividends  
and recommendation of final dividends; establishment of 
Board committees, terms of reference and membership  
of Board committees; and maintaining sound risk 
management and internal control systems.

Board meetings and attendance
The Board generally holds meetings at monthly intervals 
during the year and on an ad hoc basis as and when required. 
Ten meetings were held during the year and attendance at 
meetings by directors is set out below:
Board

Members of the executive team attended committee meetings as 
appropriate. Anthony Habgood is not a member of the Audit Committee 
but attended all four meetings during the year. 
Two of the Nomination Committee meetings dealt with the appointment  
of the successor to the Chairman, therefore Anthony Habgood did not 
attend these meetings.
Wendy Becker was appointed as a member of the Nomination Committee 
in February 2014 and was therefore only eligible to attend one of the four 
scheduled meetings.
Susan Hooper resigned from the Board with effect from 1 January 2014 
and was therefore only eligible to attend 8 of the 10 scheduled meetings.
Insurance cover
The Company has appropriate directors‚Äô and officers‚Äô liability 
insurance in place. In addition to this, the Company provides 
an indemnity for directors against the costs of defending 
certain legal proceedings. These are reviewed periodically.
Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Board, committees and individual 
directors is reviewed annually in accordance with the Code.
Composition of the Board
It is believed that the Board and its committees have the 
appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence  
and knowledge of the Company to enable them to discharge 
their responsibilities effectively. The Board has a majority  
of independent non‚Äìexecutive directors. After assessing 
independence against the Code, the Board considers all  
non‚Äìexecutive directors to be independent in judgement and 
character. On appointment, the Board also considered the 
Chairman to be independent in character and judgement. 
No new directors were appointed during the financial year. 
Details of the appointment procedure can be found in the 
report of the Nomination Committee on pages 56 and 57.
External directorships
Non‚Äìexecutive directors may serve on other boards provided 
they continue to demonstrate the required commitment to 
discharge their duties effectively. The Nomination Committee 
has reviewed the extent of other interests of the non‚Äìexecutive 
directors and the Board is satisfied that the Chairman and  
each of the non‚Äìexecutive directors commit sufficient time  
to their duties and fulfil their obligations to the Company.
No executive director has taken on more than one non‚Äì
executive directorship in a FTSE 100 company. During the 
year Christopher Rogers became a non‚Äìexecutive director  
of Travis Perkins PLC. No other executive directors hold any 
non‚Äìexecutive directorships in any FTSE 100 companies.
Training and development
On appointment, all directors receive a full and formal 
induction that is tailored to their specific needs. Meetings are 
arranged with the Chairman, Chief Executive and all executive 
and non‚Äìexecutive directors. Meetings are also arranged  
with members of the senior management team, the Group‚Äôs 
advisers and, if appropriate, major investors. A detailed review 
of all our businesses is provided and several site visits to our 
brands are arranged to provide insight into the Company  
and to develop an understanding of each business.
In order to become more familiar with the international 
businesses, the November Board meeting was held in 
Bangalore, forming part of the Board visit to India and the 
United Arab Emirates.
During this visit the Board met the local teams in both India 
and the United Arab Emirates and received presentations 
from local experts on the economy and hospitality industry. 
Site visits to Whitbread hotels and coffee shops were 
undertaken, as well as visits to competitor sites.

continued 
The conclusions of the review were discussed at the February 
Board meeting and actions in response to the results have 
been developed. One particular area for discussion was the 
need to develop further international management capability 
and more reports will be made to the Board on this subject.
In response to last year‚Äôs evaluation, the following action  
has been taken:
‚Ä¢	
greater emphasis on the reporting of the WINcard at  
Board meetings;
‚Ä¢	
familiarisation with the Premier Inn International markets; 
and
‚Ä¢	
improvements in the presentation of Board papers.
Individual directors
The Chairman has one‚Äìto‚Äìone meetings with all directors  
to discuss their performance and to identify whether they 
continue to contribute effectively to the Board and 
demonstrate commitment to the role.
Chairman
The Senior Independent Director would normally meet with  
the non‚Äìexecutive directors without the Chairman present  
to discuss the performance of the Chairman. The Senior 
Independent Director would also speak with the executive 
directors to gain their views before discussing the results  
with the Chairman. It was decided that this process was not 
necessary this year in light of the Chairman stepping down 
later in the year and the positive feedback arising from the 
internal review questionnaire.
Conflicts of interests
Directors are required to disclose any conflicts of interest 
immediately as and when they arise throughout the year.  
In addition, a formal process is undertaken each year in 
February when each director confirms to the Board details  
of their external interests including any other directorships 
which they hold.
These are assessed by the Board to determine whether the 
director‚Äôs ability to act in the best interests of the Company 
could be compromised. If there are no such potential or actual 
conflicts, the external interests are authorised by the Board. 
All authorisations are for a period of 12 months. No director  
is counted as part of a quorum in respect of the authorisation 
of his or her own conflict situation.
It is recognised that all organisations are potential customers 
of Whitbread and, in view of this, the Board has authorised  
all directors‚Äô current external directorships.
Training and development continues beyond the induction 
process and is an ongoing process for all Board members. The 
Chairman reviews and agrees the training and development 
needs with each director on an annual basis.
Directors are made aware of formal training events to ensure 
that their skills and knowledge are continually updated. 
Training events were attended by Board members during 
the year on a range of issues including: 
‚Ä¢	
Board effectiveness;
‚Ä¢	
Audit Committee key issues;
‚Ä¢	
regulatory and legal updates; 
‚Ä¢	
cyber security; and
‚Ä¢	
remuneration updates.
Investor relations and market updates were also considered 
by the Board and regular updates from each of the brands are 
presented to the Board to ensure that familiarity with the 
Company is maintained. The Company‚Äôs auditor also prepared 
a paper for the Board on the key developments in accounting 
and governance practice. 
All directors have access to independent professional advice 
at the Company‚Äôs expense. Directors serving on the Board 
committees confirmed that they are satisfied that they 
received sufficient resources to enable them to undertake 
their duties effectively. Each director has access to the 
Company Secretary for advice on governance.
The Company Secretary prepares a monthly report that 
includes updates on corporate legislation and best practice 
on matters including corporate governance. This Report is 
presented and discussed at each Board meeting.
Evaluation
An evaluation of the Board, its committees, individual 
directors and the Chairman is carried out each year. 
Board and committees
An external evaluation was conducted in 2012 and in 
accordance with the Code, we intend to have an externally 
facilitated evaluation of the Board at least every three years. 
This year‚Äôs Board evaluation was conducted internally and  
had two aspects:
‚Ä¢	
each director completed a formal questionnaire on  
the performance of the Board and each of the Board 
committees, considering the balance of skills, independence 
and knowledge of the Company on the Board, how the 
Board works together as a unit, and other factors relevant  
to its effectiveness; and
‚Ä¢	
the Chairman met or spoke to all directors on a  
one‚Äìto‚Äìone basis.

Shareholder relations
In accordance with the Code, the Board recognises that it has 
responsibility for ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue with 
shareholders takes place and any major shareholders‚Äô issues 
and concerns are communicated to the Board.
The Company communicates with both the institutional  
and private shareholders through the following means:
Interaction with all shareholders
‚Ä¢	
the Company‚Äôs website (www.whitbread.co.uk), where 
information and news is regularly updated;
‚Ä¢	
the Annual Report, which sets out details of the Company‚Äôs 
strategy, business models and performance over the past 
financial year and plans for future growth;
‚Ä¢	
the Annual General Meeting, where all shareholders have 
the opportunity to vote on the resolutions proposed and  
to put questions to the executive team; and
‚Ä¢	
presentations of full‚Äìyear and interim results to analysts  
and shareholders, which are also available on the 
Company‚Äôs website.
Interaction with institutional shareholders
‚Ä¢	
the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Director  
of Investor Relations held meetings with institutional 
investors following the full‚Äìyear and interim results;
‚Ä¢	
the Chairman meets with institutional shareholders  
on request;
‚Ä¢	
the Board received updates on the views of major 
shareholders from the Company‚Äôs brokers; and
‚Ä¢	
investor days took place for both Costa and Hotels  
& Restaurants.
Interaction with private shareholders
‚Ä¢	
live webcast presentations of the full‚Äìyear and interim 
results as well as the Costa and Hotels & Restaurants 
investor days; and
‚Ä¢	
electronic communications with shareholders including  
use of the online share portal.
The Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) provides all shareholders 
with the opportunity to communicate directly with the  
Board and encourages their participation at the meeting. 
In accordance with the Code, the Notice of AGM and related 
papers are sent to the shareholders at least 20 working  
days before the meeting. The Company proposes a separate 
resolution on each substantially separate issue including a 
specific resolution to approve the Report and Accounts.  
For each resolution, proxy appointment forms provide 
shareholders with the option to vote in advance of the AGM  
if they are unable to attend in person. All valid proxy votes 
received for the AGM are properly recorded and counted  
by Whitbread‚Äôs registrars.
As in previous years, all voting by shareholders will be by poll 
using electronic handsets. The voting results, including proxy 
votes received, will be displayed on a screen at the end of the 
meeting. In addition, the audited poll results will be disclosed 
on the Company‚Äôs website following the meeting, and 
announced through the regulatory news service.
Share capital
The information that is required by DTR 7.2.6 relating to  
the share capital of the Company can be found within the 
directors‚Äô report on pages 78 and 79.
Accountability and internal control
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group‚Äôs systems of internal 
control and risk management, and for reviewing their 
effectiveness. These systems are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate risk of failure to achieve business objectives. 
They can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has established an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the Group‚Äôs significant risks. This 
process was in place throughout the 2013/14 financial year 
and up to the date of this Report. The process is regularly 
reviewed by the Board and accords with the internal control 
guidance for directors in the Code. A report of the key risks 
can be found on pages 32 and 33.
Risk analysis
‚Ä¢	
The Board identifies the principal risks of the Company on a 
regular basis and throughout the year it reviews the actions 
in place to mitigate the risks together with assurance and 
monitoring activity. The analysis covers health and safety, 
financial, market, operational and reputational risks which 
the Company may face as well as specific areas identified  
in the business plan and budget process.
‚Ä¢	
Each of the businesses also carries out its own risk  
analysis together with PwC as operational auditor and  
this is reviewed regularly by the management boards.
‚Ä¢	
All major capital and revenue projects, together with 
significant change programmes, include the consideration 
of the risks involved and an appropriate action plan.

are carried out and reported on to the Board.
Statement of the directors in respect of the Annual Report 
and Accounts
As required by the Code, the directors confirm their 
responsibility for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts 
and consider that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company‚Äôs 
performance, business model and strategy. Further detail on 
how this conclusion was reached can be found in the report  
of the Audit Committee on pages 53 to 55.

Board committees
The Board is supported by three committees; the Audit 
Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee. Their terms of reference are reviewed annually 
and updated in line with best practice. They have been 
reviewed in 2014 and approved by each of the Committees. 
They are available in full on the Company‚Äôs website.
A detailed report from the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee is set out on pages 58 to 76. Reports for the Audit 
and Nomination Committees can be found on pages 53 to 57.
Controls
‚Ä¢	
The Company reviews and confirms its compliance with  
the Corporate Governance Code on an annual basis.
‚Ä¢	
The matters reserved to the Board require that major 
projects and programmes must have specific Board 
approval.
‚Ä¢	
Limits of delegation and authority are prescribed to ensure 
that the appropriate approvals are obtained if Board 
authority is not required to ensure appropriate segregation 
of tasks.
‚Ä¢	
Group financial policies, controls and procedures are in 
place and regularly reviewed and updated. 
‚Ä¢	
The Whitbread Code of Conduct, setting out required levels 
of ethics and behaviour, is communicated to employees.
‚Ä¢	
The Code of Conduct makes reference to specific policies 
and procedures which have to be followed.
‚Ä¢	
Management is responsible for ensuring the appropriate 
maintenance of financial records and processes that ensure 
that financial information is relevant, reliable, in accordance 
with applicable laws and regulations and is distributed both 
internally and externally in a timely manner.
‚Ä¢	
A review of the financial statements is completed by 
management to ensure that the financial position and 
results of the Group are appropriately reflected.
‚Ä¢	
All financial information published by the Group is subject 
to the approval of the Audit Committee and the Board.
‚Ä¢	
An annual review of internal controls is undertaken by  
the Board with the assistance of the Audit Committee. 
Assurance
‚Ä¢	
The Board, with the assistance of the Audit Committee, 
approves an audit programme which ensures that the 
significant areas of risk identified are independently 
reviewed within at least a three year period. 
‚Ä¢	
The programme and the results of the audits are regularly 
assessed during the year.
‚Ä¢	
The Audit Committee reviews the major findings from  
both operational and external audits.
‚Ä¢	
PwC, as operational auditor, has been appointed to carry 
out the independent audits. Its reports are reviewed  
by the Audit Committee and on a monthly basis by the 
management team to ensure that the actions required  
to address issues identified are implemented. 
‚Ä¢	
PwC reports annually to the Audit Committee on the 
effectiveness of operational and financial controls across 
the Group.

Role of the Audit Committee
The principal role of the Audit Committee is to monitor and review the integrity of the 
Company‚Äôs financial results, to review the Company‚Äôs internal controls and risk management 
systems, to monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company‚Äôs internal audit function  
and to make recommendations to the Board in relation to the external auditor.
Key responsibilities
The key responsibilities of the Committee are to:
‚Ä¢	
review the half‚Äìyear and full‚Äìyear results and financial statements;
‚Ä¢	
report to the Board on the appropriateness of our accounting policies and practices 
including critical accounting policies and practices;

‚Ä¢	
review and evaluate the effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management system;
‚Ä¢	
review the operational audit process;
‚Ä¢	
review the Group‚Äôs contingent liabilities; and
‚Ä¢	
review the speaking out facility and consider any matters raised.
The full terms of reference are available on the Company‚Äôs website.
Committee meetings
The Committee meets at least three times a year and will hold additional meetings as and 
when required. Meetings are attended by the members of the Committee and, by invitation, 
the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group 
Financial Controller and other relevant people from the business when appropriate. The 
external and operational auditors are also invited to meetings.
Main activities during the year
During the year, the Committee focused on the following matters:
Financial reporting
‚Ä¢	
the quality and acceptability of accounting policies and practices;
‚Ä¢	
the clarity of the disclosures and compliance with financial reporting standards and  
relevant financial and governance reporting requirements;
‚Ä¢	
material areas in which significant judgements have been applied or where there has  
been discussion with the external auditor;
‚Ä¢	
whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess  
the Company‚Äôs performance, business model and strategy; 
‚Ä¢	
the regulatory announcement of the results;
‚Ä¢	
a going concern assessment; and
‚Ä¢	
any correspondence from regulators in relation to our financial reporting.
To aid its review, the Committee considers reports from the Group Financial Controller,  
the Tax Director and from PwC as operational auditor and also reports from the external 
auditor on the outcomes of their half‚Äìyear review and annual audit. The Committee looks 
for constructive challenge from EY as external auditor.

Whitbread 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14
The key areas of judgement considered by the Committee in relation to the 2013/14  
accounts were:
Taxation
The method of calculating the Group‚Äôs tax expense and liability and the provisioning for 
potential tax liabilities were considered. The Committee considered and challenged the nature 
of the exceptional tax items recorded in the year and the assumptions made by management 
used to determine the amounts recorded. The Committee reviewed the judgements exercised 
on tax provisioning as part of its annual review of key provisions.
Pension scheme 
The assumptions used to calculate the pension scheme assets and liabilities under IAS 19.  
The Committee considered the consistency of the basis of calculation of the assumptions  
with those used in 2012/13 and agreed with the judgements reached by management.
Liability provisioning 
The level of provisioning for contingent and other liabilities is an issue where management views 
and legal advice are important. These are addressed through the Committee discussing with 
management and challenging the key judgements made.
Asset impairment
The judgements in relation to asset impairment largely relate to the assumptions underlying 
the calculation of the value in use of the business being tested, primarily the achievability of 
the long‚Äìterm business plan and macroeconomic assumptions underlying the valuation 
process. The Committee addresses these matters through receiving reports from management 
outlining the basis for the assumptions used. In addition, the EY reporting to the Committee  
is considered.
During the year, the Board delegated authority to the Audit Committee to advise the Board  
on whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company‚Äôs performance, business model and strategy.
In order to confirm this position to the Board in addition to the processes described above, 
there has been a thorough verification and approval process for the Annual Report and 
Accounts, as outlined below:
‚Ä¢	
the Annual Report is drafted by the appropriate senior management with overall  
coordination by the Secretariat team to ensure consistency;
‚Ä¢	
comprehensive reviews of the drafts of the Report and Accounts are undertaken by 
management, the Main Board Committee and me, as the Audit Committee Chairman;
‚Ä¢	
the final draft is reviewed by the Audit Committee prior to consideration by the Board; and
‚Ä¢	
formal approval of the Annual Report and Accounts is given by a Committee of the Board.
Internal control and risk management
The Audit Committee holds an annual evaluation of internal controls in March. The Committee 
reviews the Group risk matrix and assesses the effectiveness of the internal processes that 
have been implemented to enable those risks to be mitigated and monitored. This review is 
completed in conjunction with an Internal Controls Effectiveness Review from PwC as 
operational auditor. Each risk is assessed and the level of assurance required is determined.
The Audit Committee then approves a plan from PwC to carry out reviews of the chosen  
risk areas during the following year.
At the meeting this year the Committee considered a revised version of the Group risk  
analysis (see risk management section on pages 30 to 33). This was discussed in detail and 
management were asked to provide further information on the mitigation plans for some  
of the key risks identified.

The Audit Committee monitors and reviews the scope, extent and effectiveness of the 
Company‚Äôs internal audit function. Reports from PwC as operational auditor are reviewed  
and contain updates on audit activities, the results of unsatisfactory audits and any relevant 
action plans to address these areas. Private discussions are held with the operational  
auditors as and when necessary and I also meet with PwC regularly outside of the formal 
Committee process.
External audit
The Committee oversees the relationship with the external auditor. There is a review of the 
performance of the external auditor and its independence and effectiveness.
The effectiveness of the external audit process is dependent on appropriate audit risk 
identification at the start of the audit cycle. We receive from EY a detailed audit plan, 
identifying their assessment of these key risks. For the 2013/14 financial year, the primary  
risks identified were in relation to the defined benefit pension scheme, taxation and revenue 
recognition. These risks were reviewed and the work done by the auditors was challenged  
to test management‚Äôs assumptions and estimates around these areas, as well as other areas 
reported upon, which included impairment and property provisions. The effectiveness  
of the audit process was assessed in addressing these matters through the reporting we 
received from EY at both the half‚Äìyear and year‚Äìend. In addition feedback was sought from 
management on the effectiveness of the audit process.
We hold private meetings with the external auditor at the half‚Äìyear and full‚Äìyear Committee 
meetings to provide additional opportunities for open dialogue and feedback from the 
Committee and the auditor without management being present.
In accordance with the Code it is intended that the external audit contract is put out to tender 
at least every ten years. A competitive tender of the external audit was carried out in 2010/11 
and it was recommended that EY be reappointed. In accordance with new EU regulations  
it is intended that the audit will be put out to tender again within the next six years. EY has 
been the external auditor for over 50 years.
To safeguard the objectivity and independence of the external auditor, the Committee‚Äôs  
Terms of Reference set out the non‚Äìaudit services that are permitted in certain circumstances 
and those not permitted at all. This prevents the auditor being able to provide certain services 
such as internal audits.
For certain specified audit and audit‚Äìrelated services, the Group can employ the external auditor 
without reference to the Audit Committee, subject to a specified fee limit. For the services 
permitted in certain circumstances, agreement must be sought from me, as Chairman of the 
Committee where fees are less than the limit specified, or with full Audit Committee approval 
where fees are anticipated to be greater. A tender process would be held where appropriate.
Committee evaluation
The Committee‚Äôs activities formed part of the internal review of the Board effectiveness 
undertaken during the year. Details of this process can be found on pages 49 and 50.

Role of the Nomination Committee
The role of the Nomination Committee is to review the composition of the Board and to 
identify and nominate directors who could enhance the Board‚Äôs performance. The Committee 
is also responsible for evaluating the directors on an annual basis.
The Committee meets at least twice a year. The main activities during 2013/14 included:
‚Ä¢	
the annual planning and review meeting;
‚Ä¢	
a review of the Board size, structure and composition;
‚Ä¢	
a review of the talent and succession planning for the Board;
‚Ä¢	
changing the Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee; 
and
‚Ä¢	
the re‚Äìelection of directors at the AGM.
The Committee is responsible for ensuring that Board and committee membership is 
progressively refreshed and that there is no undue reliance on any one individual. This is 
reviewed at the annual meeting in March.
The full terms of reference are available on the Company‚Äôs website.
Board appointments and diversity 
Appointments to the Board are based on merit against objective criteria having due regard  
for diversity, including gender. 
Diversity and equality have always been core values at Whitbread. The Board believes  
that diversity is highly important, not only for Board effectiveness but for the effectiveness  
of the Company as a whole. Whitbread appoints members of the Board on the basis  
of qualification and merit and does not discriminate on any grounds. We are committed  
to an active policy of equal opportunities and embrace diversity at all levels.
Our approach to the appointment of new directors
The Nomination Committee annually evaluates the balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge on the Board and, if necessary, prepares a description of the role and 
capabilities required for a particular appointment.
If necessary, an external search consultant would be engaged and a number of candidates 
identified. Selected candidates would meet with the Nomination Committee and further 
interviews would take place before an appointment was made.
Our approach to the annual re‚Äìelection of directors
As required by the Code, all directors will be subject to re‚Äìelection at the next AGM. The 
Nomination Committee held a planning and review meeting in March when the contribution 
and commitment of each member of the Board was reviewed. Following this discussion,  
it was recommended that all directors be proposed for reappointment at this year‚Äôs AGM. 
Details setting out why each director is deemed to be suitable for reappointment will be 
included with the AGM papers circulated to all shareholders.

Board and committee changes
As announced in December 2013, Susan Hooper decided to step down as a non‚Äìexecutive 
director of the Company in January 2014 so that she could focus all her attention on her  
new role at British Gas. There are no current plans to replace Susan on the Board. It was also 
decided that Sir Ian Cheshire would become the Senior Independent Director and Stephen 
Williams would, in turn, become the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. In February 
2014, Wendy Becker was appointed as a member of the Nomination Committee.
As announced in January 2014, I will be stepping down from the Board later this year. The 
process to find my successor will be led by Sir Ian Cheshire, the Senior Independent Director 
and he will chair the Nomination Committee when it is dealing with the appointment of  
my successor. A number of meetings have already been held to appoint advisers and agree  
a shortlist of candidates.

Remuneration report
Statement from 
Stephen Williams
Introduction
This year‚Äôs remuneration report is the first Whitbread has produced under the new disclosure 
regulations. You will see that, after this introductory statement, there is a policy report followed  
by our annual report on remuneration.
The policy report sets out details of our remuneration structure, which shareholders will be 
asked to approve at the 2014 AGM. The annual report on remuneration explains what directors 
were paid in 2013/14, including the awards under the incentive schemes, and also gives some 
detail on how our policy will be implemented in 2014/15.
Two years ago, we explained that we had taken the opportunity to redefine Whitbread‚Äôs 
remuneration principles and these have not changed. The intention of the principles, which 
have been used to guide the content of the new policy report, is to ensure that remuneration 
arrangements are aligned to and support the delivery of the Group‚Äôs business strategy and 
shareholder value creation.
Whitbread‚Äôs aim is to be competitive in each employee category so as to attract and retain as high a calibre of person as 
appropriate to the specific role. This central aim remains the same whether we are talking about senior executives or the 
thousands of team members in our hotels, restaurants and coffee shops. It is important that we employ the best people 
available in these vital customer‚Äìfacing roles and we must therefore remain an attractive employer. We achieve this by 
investing significant resources in the development of team members, giving them real opportunities to progress through  
the organisation and providing incentive schemes such as ‚ÄòMy Rewards‚Äô and ‚ÄòFeel Good‚Äô to reward high performance.  
Further details can be found on pages 12 to 13 and 22 to 23. 
Remuneration linked to strategy
Whitbread‚Äôs strategy, which is to invest in growing its leading brands, Premier Inn and Costa, has stretching targets which,  
if delivered successfully, will create significant value for our shareholders. The Committee believes that the executive team 
should be rewarded for the achievement of the strategy and therefore incentives should be clearly aligned to, and dependent 
upon, delivering earnings growth and returns above our cost of capital. 
The Customer Heartbeat schematic, which is described by Andy Harrison on page 6 shows how we intend to deliver our 
strategic aims by providing a great place to work for our people, so that they care for our customers and provide them with an 
experience that will make them come back time and time again. We intend to deliver these aims whilst being a force for good 
in the communities in which we operate. The diagram on page 59 shows how elements of the remuneration package are linked  
to this model.
Along with profit and returns targets, the WINcard remains a key element of our remuneration structure. It is designed  
to ensure that all executives are incentivised on both non‚Äìfinancial and financial measures. WINcard measures are ‚ÄòSMART‚Äô  
(i.e. specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timely). In addition to the WINcard measures, where appropriate, the 
Remuneration Committee may introduce further measures specific to an individual‚Äôs role. 
New Long Term Incentive Plan (‚ÄòLTIP‚Äô)
The 2004 LTIP has now reached the end of its ten‚Äìyear life and we are therefore asking for shareholders to approve a new  
LTIP at the 2014 AGM. The Committee believes that the expiring plan, as amended in 2012 following a shareholder consultation, 
was effective in incentivising the delivery of the Company‚Äôs strategy and, as such, the proposed new plan is substantially the 
same as the expiring plan. Amendments include the introduction of new clawback and malus provisions and a new holding 
period post vesting. 
The 125% of salary limit in the expiring LTIP rules was set in 2004 and all executive directors, including the Chief Executive, 
currently receive awards at this level. As I explained above, our strategy is to be competitive in each employee category  
in order to attract and retain high calibre individuals. To bring the Chief Executive‚Äôs package closer to competitive market 
practice, in terms of the absolute level of LTIP award and its relative level in comparison to the other executive directors,  
the Committee is proposing an increase in the level of award for the Chief Executive to 175% of salary with effect from 2015. 
There is no current intention to change the level of awards to the other executive directors.
LTIP awards made in 2014 under the current LTIP will be subject to a new one‚Äìyear holding period post vesting, with awards 
made under the new LTIP from 2015 being subject to a two‚Äìyear holding period post vesting. You will see in the policy table  
on page 61 that the maximum potential level of award under the new LTIP has been set at 200% of salary, although we have  
no current plans to make awards up to that maximum level. Any increase above this maximum would be put to shareholders  
for approval in a future policy report.

Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14
Statement from 
Stephen Williams
Whitbread is a fast‚Äìgrowing, capital‚Äìintensive business. The Group‚Äôs growth is based on a five‚Äìyear business plan and the 
delivery of our growth milestones along with strong returns is vital for the future success of the Company. It is for this reason 
that the LTIP performance conditions, a combination of ROCE and EPS, have been selected. For the second year running  
the Committee, having reviewed the latest performance and the changing mix of assets in the Group, has strengthened the 
ROCE targets. Further details can be found on page 76.
Shareholding requirement
A feature of Whitbread‚Äôs remuneration structure for some years now has been that a significant proportion of the incentives 
available to executives are paid in shares, a material element of which is deferred. This remains core to our remuneration 
structure. The Remuneration Committee believes that executives should build a significant shareholding in the Company  
in order to provide greater alignment between executives and shareholders. During the year we have further strengthened  
our position on this by replacing the previous guidelines with a new shareholding requirement and increasing the value of 
shares executives are required to hold. 
Reward for the successful delivery of strategy
It has been another very good year for Whitbread, with underlying PBIT up by 14.2% to ¬£430.7 million, underlying basic EPS  
up by 20.1% to 179.02p and Group return on capital up from 13.9% to 15.3%. Meanwhile, the Company remains on track to meet 
its growth milestones. In the light of this performance, it is entirely right that executives are rewarded for the successful delivery  
of the Group‚Äôs strategy during the year and, as you will see from this report, the incentive schemes have paid out towards the 
top end of the range.

Introduction
This report outlines the Company‚Äôs remuneration policy, which shareholders will be asked to approve at the 2014 AGM. Subject 
to shareholder approval the policy will be effective from the date of the 2014 AGM and is intended to apply for three years. 
For executives, our approach is designed to:
‚Ä¢	
align with the business strategy and the achievement of planned business goals;
‚Ä¢	
support the creation of sustainable long‚Äìterm shareholder value;
‚Ä¢	
provide an appropriate balance between remuneration elements that attract, retain and motivate the highest calibre of 
executive talent; and
‚Ä¢	
encourage a high‚Äìperformance culture by ensuring performance‚Äìrelated remuneration constitutes a substantial proportion 
of the remuneration package and by linking maximum payout opportunity to outstanding results.
The policy table below provides more detail on each key element of remuneration, including the maximum potential value  
of each element, a brief summary of how it works and details of any performance metrics.

Base 
salary
‚Ä¢	 Base salaries are set so as to 
be sufficient to attract and 
retain the calibre of executive 
talent needed to support the 
long‚Äìterm interests of the 
business.
Salaries are reviewed annually 
taking account of:
‚Ä¢	 the salary review across  
the Group;
‚Ä¢	 trading circumstances;
‚Ä¢	 personal performance  
against agreed objectives;  
and
‚Ä¢	 market data for an 
appropriate comparator 
group of companies.
‚Ä¢	 Annual salary increases will 
not normally exceed average 
increases for employees  
in other appropriate parts  
of the Group. 
‚Ä¢	 On occasion, increases  
may be larger where the 
Committee considers this to 
be necessary. Circumstances 
where this may apply include 
growth into a role, to reflect  
a change in scope of role and 
responsibilities, where market 
conditions indicate a level of 
under competitiveness and the 
Committee judges that there  
is a risk in relation to attracting 
or retaining executives. 
‚Ä¢	 Where the Committee 
exercises its discretion to 
award increases above the 
average for other employees, 
the resulting salary will not 
exceed the competitive 
market range.
None
Benefits ‚Ä¢	 Benefits are intended to be 
competitive in the market so 
as to assist the recruitment 
and retention of executives.
‚Ä¢	 Executive directors are 
entitled to benefits relating  
to car/participation in the 
Sharesave scheme/
healthcare/personal 
insurances. Assignee 
allowances or local market 
terms may be necessary for 
directors based overseas. 
‚Ä¢	In 2013/14 the benefits 
received by the executive 
directors amounted to 
between 3.5% and 6.5% of 
salary. We do not anticipate 
that the maximum payable 
would exceed 10% of salary. 
However, the Committee  
may provide benefits above 
this level in certain situations 
where it deems it necessary. 
This may include, for  
example, the appointment  
of a director based overseas 
or a significant increase  
in the cost of the benefits.

Annual Incentive Scheme
The Annual Incentive Scheme has been designed to 
incentivise outstanding performance across a number of  
key stakeholder measures and it rewards approximately  
90 executives with both a cash payment and an award  
of deferred shares. The scheme operates over a four‚Äìyear 
period as follows:
‚Ä¢	
performance in the first year is measured against  
both financial and non‚Äìfinancial measures to determine  
the level of awards;
‚Ä¢	
measures are set by the Remuneration Committee  
so that ‚Äòon‚Äìtarget‚Äô performance is challenging;
‚Ä¢	
at the end of the first year, cash payments are made and  
any deferred shares are awarded as appropriate;
‚Ä¢	
there is a further three‚Äìyear holding period for the deferred 
shares before they vest to the executive; and
‚Ä¢	
malus provisions apply to the deferred share awards  
in the event of a material misstatement of results.

 On‚Äìtarget performance assumes on‚Äìtarget profit, a mix of green and amber WINcard scores and threshold vesting under the LTIP. Maximum 
performance assumes maximum profit, all green WINcard scores and maximum LTIP vesting. In both cases, for simplicity, no share price growth  
is assumed.

Remuneration  
policy report
There are two types of measure used to determine the  
level of awards under the scheme. There is a profit measure 
and there are a number of WINcard measures (or other 
stakeholder measures as may be deemed appropriate by  
the Remuneration Committee). The scheme is designed to 
incentivise executives to deliver great results by providing  
an excellent environment for our people, and giving them the 
tools to make everyday experiences special for our customers. 
One Winning Teams measure and one Customer Heartbeat 
measure have been upweighted to reflect the importance  
of those elements to Whitbread‚Äôs success. In addition,  
there is a health and safety measure, which acts as a hurdle, 
demonstrating our determination to provide a safe 
environment for employees and customers alike. The profit 
measure is the most incentivised element with an award  
to the value of 137% of salary available for maximum 
performance, whilst the WINcard element has a potential 
value of 30% of salary.
Long Term Incentive Plan
For the LTIP, subject to shareholder approval of the new 
scheme at the 2014 AGM, the performance conditions  
will be structured as follows:
‚Ä¢	
EPS and ROCE measures on a matrix basis (as shown  
on page 76);
‚Ä¢	
up to 75% of awards are dependent on EPS growth  
over the three‚Äìyear performance period, subject  
to a satisfactory ROCE performance;
‚Ä¢	
ROCE will be used as a multiplier on a straight‚Äìline  
sliding scale basis to increase the EPS element by up  
to a further third;
‚Ä¢	
no element of the award will vest if a minimum level  
of ROCE, which is set materially above the Group‚Äôs  
cost of capital, is not achieved in the final year of the 
performance period;
‚Ä¢	
awards will be subject to clawback and malus provisions; and
‚Ä¢	
a two‚Äìyear post vesting holding period will apply.
These performance conditions were selected because the 
Committee believes that they closely align the LTIP with the 
strategic aims of the Group; to grow its leading brands whilst 
delivering returns in excess of the cost of capital in order to 
create significant shareholder value. The performance range 
for awards to be made in 2015 will be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee in April 2015 taking account of 
available information at that time. 
Changes to the remuneration policy in 2013/14
With the exception of the new LTIP scheme outlined in the 
Policy Table, which will be put to shareholders for approval  
at the 2014 AGM, and some amendments to the company  
car scheme there have been no other changes to the Group‚Äôs 
remuneration policy during the year and no new elements  
of remuneration have been introduced. Under the updated 
company car scheme, executive directors will no longer be 
entitled to a company car, but will receive cash in lieu of a car. 
As explained on page 71, new strengthened shareholding 
requirements have been introduced.
Service contracts and external appointments
The key terms of the executive directors‚Äô service contracts  
are as follows:
‚Ä¢	
notice period ‚Äî six months by the director and 12 months 
by the Company;
‚Ä¢	
termination payment ‚Äî see policy on payment for loss  
of office below;
‚Ä¢	
sickness ‚Äî full salary for a maximum of 12 months in any 
three‚Äìyear period or for a maximum of nine consecutive 
months; and
‚Ä¢	
non‚Äìcompete ‚Äî for six months after leaving.
The dates of the executive directors‚Äô service contracts, which 
can be found on the Company‚Äôs website, are as follows:
Andy Harrison 3 March 2010
Nicholas Cadbury 3 September 2012
Patrick Dempsey 26 March 2013
Christopher Rogers 18 February 2013
Louise Smalley 25 October 2012
The executive directors are entitled to retain fees from 
external directorships. 
Policy on payment for loss of office
 
Base salary and contractual benefits
All of the executive directors have a rolling service contract 
with a 12‚Äìmonth notice period from the Company. The 
Company may make a payment in lieu of notice to include up 
to 12 monthly payments of base salary and the cash equivalent 
of pension contributions. The Company may either allow for 
contractual benefits to continue during this time or, at its sole 
discretion, pay the value of those benefits on a monthly basis. 
Neither notice nor payment in lieu of notice would be given  
if a director left by reason of gross misconduct. 
A director is under a contractual duty to mitigate his or  
her position by actively seeking an alternative remunerated 
position and the Company will make a corresponding  
reduction in any payment made for loss of office. Where  
a payment in lieu of notice is not applicable, the payment  
of salary and contractual benefits would cease on the 
individual‚Äôs leaving date.

Annual Incentive Scheme
If a director leaves the Company for a ‚Äòpermitted reason‚Äô 
under the rules of the scheme (or if the Committee decides  
to apply ‚Äògood leaver‚Äô status in accordance with the discretion 
outlined on page 66 of this report), the default position would 
be that deferred shares would vest on the date of leaving and 
a pro‚Äìrated cash award would be made for the incentive year. 
No new deferred shares would be awarded and the director 
would receive a pro‚Äìrated cash payment in lieu of the 
deferred shares. Notwithstanding the above, the Committee 
has the discretion to make a deferred shares award for the 
incentive year, with such award due to vest at the same time 
as the awards made to continuing employees for that year.
If a director leaves the Company for any other reason, 25%  
of an outstanding award of deferred shares would vest if the 
leaving date was between one and two years from the date  
of grant and 50% of an outstanding award would vest if the 
leaving date was between two and three years from the date 
of grant. Any other unvested deferred shares would lapse  
on the date of leaving. The director would receive no cash 
incentive payment for the financial year in which they leave 
and no deferred shares would be awarded. 
In the event that a director was to leave the Company by 
reason of gross misconduct, the malus provisions may be 
applied and no deferred shares would vest.
Long Term Incentive Plan
If a director leaves the Company for a ‚Äòpermitted reason‚Äô 
under the rules of the plan (or if the Committee decides to 
apply ‚Äògood leaver‚Äô status in accordance with the discretion 
outlined on page 66 of this report), the default position would 
be that any unvested LTIP awards would be pro‚Äìrated for  
time served. Performance would be tested at the end of the 
standard three‚Äìyear performance period and the pro‚Äìrated 
awards would vest at the same time as for continuing 
employees. No LTIP award would be made in the final year  
of employment if the Company was aware that the director 
would be leaving at the point that awards are made.
If a director leaves the Company for any other reason any 
unvested LTIP awards would lapse at the date of leaving. 
Vested, but unexercised, LTIP awards (including those subject 
to a holding period) would be exercisable for the latter of six 
months from the date of leaving or six months from the end  
of the holding period. 
In the event that a director was to leave the Company by 
reason of gross misconduct, the clawback and/or malus 
provisions may be applied. 
Approach to remuneration on recruitment
Our approach to recruitment is that remuneration should  
be set in line with the policy table on pages 60 and 61.  
Whilst we would not seek to vary this approach there may  
be circumstances in which it is necessary to do so.
On the appointment of a new executive director, base salary 
levels will be set taking into account a range of factors 
including market levels, experience, internal salaries and cost. 
If an individual is appointed on a base salary below the market 
positioning contingent on individual performance, the 
Committee retains the discretion to realign base salary over 
the one‚Äìto‚Äìthree years following appointment which may 
result in an exceptional rate of annualised increase. If the 
Committee intends to rely on this discretion, it will be noted  
in the first directors‚Äô remuneration report following an 
individual‚Äôs appointment. 
Other elements of annual remuneration will be set in line  
with the policy set out in the policy table. As such, variable 
remuneration will be capped at 167% of salary under the 
Annual Incentive Scheme and an award of up to 200% of 
salary under the Long Term Incentive Plan. The following 
exceptions will apply:
‚Ä¢	
in the event that an internal appointment is made, the 
Committee retains the discretion to continue with existing 
remuneration provisions relating to pension and benefits;
‚Ä¢	
as deemed necessary and appropriate to secure an 
appointment, the Committee retains the discretion to  
make additional payments linked to relocation; and
‚Ä¢	
the Committee retains the discretion to make an additional 
award in exceptional circumstances up to 200% of salary 
under the Long Term Incentive Plan and/or an award on 
similar terms, to provide an immediate interest in company 
performance; and
‚Ä¢	
the Committee may also make an additional award of  
cash or shares on appointment of a new director in order  
to compensate for the forfeiture of an award from a 
previous employer. Such awards would be on a comparable 
basis, taking account of performance, the proportion of  
the performance period remaining and the type of award.  
The Committee will set appropriate performance conditions 
and vesting would be on the same time horizon as the 
forfeited award. The Committee would take into account 
the strategy at Whitbread and may also require the 
appointee to purchase shares in Whitbread to a pre‚Äìagreed 
level prior to vesting.
Service contracts will be entered into on terms similar to those 
for the existing executive directors, summarised in our service 
contract policy section. However, if necessary the Committee 
would authorise the payment of a relocation allowance and 
repatriation, as well as other associated international mobility 
terms or agree terms appropriate to the local market for a 
director based overseas.

Remuneration  
policy report
With respect to the appointment of a new Chairman or 
non‚Äìexecutive director, the approach will be consistent with 
that currently adopted. Variable pay will not be considered 
and as such no maximum applies. With respect to non‚Äì
executive directors, fees will be consistent with policy at the 
time of appointment. If necessary, to secure the appointment 
of a new Chairman not based in the UK, payments relating  
to relocation and/or housing could be considered.
A timely announcement with respect to any director 
appointment will be made to the regulatory news services  
and posted on Whitbread‚Äôs website.
Comparison of executive remuneration policy  
with wider employee population
This section of the report describes each element of the 
executive remuneration package and explains the extent  
to which those elements are made available to the wider 
employee population. The Committee did not consult 
employees, other than those in relevant roles, when 
developing the directors‚Äô remuneration policy.
Base salary
All employees, including the executive directors, receive an 
annual review of base salary. Under normal circumstances the 
annual increase in salary for an executive director will be in the 
same range as the increase for employees across the Group. 
However, the individual circumstances of each employee are 
taken into account and, if exceptional circumstances exist, any 
employee may receive an increase higher than the standard 
rate. In the case of the executive directors, the Remuneration 
Committee would take into account a range of factors when 
setting the level of a pay increase including changes to 
salaries across the Group, the personal performance of the 
director measured against agreed objectives, current trading 
circumstances and our remuneration policy.
Benefits
Approximately 840 employees across the Group are entitled 
to a company car or cash in lieu of a company car. The 
scheme is structured so that the level of the allowance is on  
a sliding scale with employees on higher grades receiving  
a larger allowance. The executive directors are no longer 
entitled to a company car under this scheme, but are entitled 
to receive cash in lieu of a car. 
Approximately 2,000 employees are entitled to participate  
in the Group‚Äôs private healthcare scheme, with 660 of these, 
including the executive directors, entitled to family cover.  
In addition, a small number of senior executives, including the 
executive directors, are entitled to annual health screening.
All employees receive discounts on Company products,  
but the directors have waived their right to this benefit. 
Employees, including the executive directors, have access  
to subsidised restaurants within the Company‚Äôs offices  
in Dunstable and Luton and to free Costa coffee within  
the Company‚Äôs offices.
Whitbread‚Äôs Sharesave scheme is a standard HMRC approved 
SAYE scheme. It is offered to all UK employees, including  
the executive directors, on equal terms. The Company has 
shareholder approval to extend its share schemes overseas 
and the Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to 
establish a Sharesave scheme outside of the UK in the future.
Annual Incentive Scheme
Approximately 6,000 employees are eligible to receive an 
annual incentive payment linked to the achievement of the 
same profit and WINcard targets as those described on pages 
75 and 76 for executives under the Annual Incentive Scheme. 
The majority of participants are entitled to earn a maximum 
annual incentive payment of 10% of salary paid in cash.  
As employees progress into more senior roles the maximum 
payment that can be achieved rises to 40%. Approximately  
90 executives, including the executive directors, are entitled  
to participate in the Annual Incentive Scheme with maximum 
payouts, split between cash and deferred shares, ranging  
from 60% to 167%.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Approximately 40 executives, including the executive 
directors, participate in the LTIP. This scheme is not available 
to the wider employee population.
Pension
Like all employees, the executive directors are entitled to 
participate in the Company‚Äôs pension scheme. The scheme is 
a defined contribution scheme. The levels of contribution for 
employees vary depending on the job grade of the individual, 
with employees at the entry level able to contribute 2% of 
their salary and receive a Company contribution of 3% of 
salary. Life assurance is provided to employees who choose  
to join the pension scheme. Employees who do not choose to 
participate may be automatically enrolled with contributions 
in line with the automatic enrolment regulations.
The policy on pension contributions for the executive 
directors is that there is an upper limit for Company 
contributions of 27.5% of salary. No future executive director 
will receive contributions above 25% of salary.

Consideration of shareholder views
We contacted our twenty largest investors, as well as the  
ABI and ISS, in February 2014 to consult on our proposed  
new LTIP. The responses received were positive and 
supportive and provided some helpful feedback on our 
proposals. In particular, the new post vesting holding period, 
the introduction of clawback and malus clauses and the 
strengthening of our shareholding requirements were 
welcomed.
Legacy matters
As previously disclosed, Alan Parker received 27,901 deferred 
shares under the Annual Incentive Scheme on 1 March 2011  
in respect of his final year with the Company. These shares are 
due to vest on 29 April 2014. There are no other outstanding 
share awards or payments due to former directors of the 
Company.
Remuneration Committee discretion
The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to apply 
‚Äògood leaver‚Äô terms to leavers in respect of both the Annual 
Incentive Scheme and the LTIP. In exercising its discretion, the 
Committee must consider the individual circumstances in the 
particular case and must not exercise its discretion in a way 
which would be discriminatory on grounds of sex, race, age  
or any other protected characteristic within the meaning of 
Section 4 of the Equality Act 2010. 
The Committee must also, so far as it is able to do so, exercise 
its discretion in a way which is consistent as between 
individuals who are in the same position.
Under the rules of the Annual Incentive Scheme, if ‚Äògood 
leaver‚Äô terms apply, any deferred share awards vest in full on 
the date of leaving and may be exercised within six months. 
Under the rules of the LTIP, the award would vest subject to 
the satisfaction of performance conditions, at the end of the 
performance period. The number of shares vesting would be 
on a pro‚Äìrata basis taking account of the proportion of the 
performance period that the individual had been employed 
within the Group. The vested award would be exercisable for  
a period of six months from the date on which the award is 
declared to be vested. On occasions where the Committee 
exercises this discretion the participant would be expected  
to continue to meet the shareholding requirement until the 
award vests and failure to do so would result in the lapsing of 
the award. No LTIP grants will be made within the last twelve 
months of employment to any employee who has requested, 
and been granted, ‚Äògood leaver‚Äô status.
In addition the Remuneration Committee has a number  
of discretions relating to the appointment of new directors  
as outlined on pages 64 and 65.
In exceptional circumstances, the Remuneration Committee 
has the discretion to amend the profit range (normally 
between 95% and 110% of target) as well as the split between 
the awards based on profit measures and WINcard or other 
stakeholder measures, and the split between awards paid  
in cash and deferred shares, for a new incentive year under 
the Annual Incentive Scheme.
The Committee sets the performance targets for the LTIP  
and the Annual Incentive Scheme on an annual basis. The 
Committee may change a performance target from time to 
time in the event that it considers it fair and reasonable to do 
so. Any change to an existing performance target must not 
have the effect, in the opinion of the Committee, of making 
the target materially easier or materially more difficult to 
achieve than it was when the award was initially granted.
The Chairman and non‚Äìexecutive directors‚Äô fees
Although the fees paid to the non‚Äìexecutive directors  
are not a matter for the Remuneration Committee, details  
are provided in this report in order to comply with regulations. 
The Chairman receives an annual fee and the non‚Äìexecutive 
directors receive a base fee, with additional fees for acting  
as the Senior Independent Director or for chairing, or being  
a member of, the Audit or Remuneration Committees. 
The fees are reviewed every two years by the executive 
directors taking into account a range of factors including  
the time commitment required of the directors, the 
responsibilities of the role and the fees paid by other similar 
companies. 
The Chairman and non‚Äìexecutive directors are entitled to 
claim business expenses, but do not receive any other fees  
or remuneration in connection with their roles at Whitbread.
Neither the Chairman nor any of the non‚Äìexecutive directors 
has a service contract.

Whitbread 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14
Details of each of the elements included in the table above  
are as follows:
Base salary
The base salary numbers shown in the table include two 
months‚Äô of pay based on the director‚Äôs salary from 1 May 2012 
(or at the date of appointment as applicable) and ten months‚Äô 
pay based on the director‚Äôs salary from 1 May 2013.
Benefits
The benefits received by each executive director include 
family private healthcare and a cash allowance in lieu of a 
company car.
Annual Incentive Scheme
The Annual Incentive Scheme payments shown above include 
both a cash payment to be made in May 2014 and deferred 
shares to be issued in April 2014. The awards were calculated 
as described below.
Awards based on profit measure
The profit targets for 2013/14 have not been disclosed, 
because the Board considers them to be commercially 
sensitive. Many of Whitbread‚Äôs competitors are private 
companies and not therefore subject to the same disclosure 
requirements. We believe that it would give those companies 
an advantage if they were able to see our profit targets.  
The Committee will keep this disclosure under review. 
The awards to be made based on the profit measure are  
as follows: 
Director
% of salary 
in¬†cash
% of salary in

Patrick Dempsey 36.7 66.7 103.4
Christopher Rogers 38.3 69.3 107.6
Louise Smalley 39.5 71.5 111.0
Awards based on WINcard measures
The WINcard targets in 2013/14 were appropriate to the 
director‚Äôs role. For example, Patrick Dempsey had WINcard 
measures specific to Hotels & Restaurants and Christopher 
Rogers had Costa specific measures. Nicholas Cadbury,  
Andy Harrison and Louise Smalley each had Group targets, 
some of which are a combination of the Costa and Hotels  
& Restaurants measures.

1  The team engagement and brand performance measures are 
upweighted, meaning that 9% of salary is payable for a green score  
and 4.5% of salary for an amber score. Payments in respect of all other 
measures (except for health and safety) are 3% of salary for a green 
score and 1.5% of salary for an amber score.
2  The health and safety measure acts as a hurdle. If the health and safety 
score had been red, payouts for the other WINcard measures would 
have been reduced by 20%. If the score had been amber, a 10% 
reduction would have applied.
More information on the actual targets and outcomes for 
these measures can be found on pages 34 to 37.

Long Term Incentive Plan
The amounts shown in the table on page 68 refer to the  
value of the LTIP awards made in 2011 and vesting in 2014.  
For Louise Smalley, the amount is pro‚Äìrated based on the 
proportion of the performance period that she has been  
a director (i.e. 16 months out of 36). Andy Harrison‚Äôs figure 
also includes a matching award that was made to him on  
his appointment, which was contingent on Andy purchasing, 
and retaining, Whitbread shares to the value of ¬£1 million.
The value given for the LTIP awards is based on the average 
market value over the last quarter of the financial year  
(3,816.8p), as the awards will not vest until after the date  
of this Report.
The LTIP awards made to executives in 2011 were subject  
to independently operating performance conditions as  
set out in the table below. The outcome of each condition  
is also shown in the table.

proportion of the performance period that Louise Smalley was a 
director as required by the regulations. This was 16 months out of 36. 
The total number of shares vesting to Louise will be 7,606.
In addition Andy Harrison was given a matching award  
over 67,468 shares on his appointment. This was disclosed  
in the 2010/11 Annual Report. The award was subject to 
performance conditions, which were in line with those for the 
general 2011 LTIP award. In addition Andy was required to 
retain at least the same number of shares until vesting, which 
he has done. As explained above, the performance conditions 
have been met in full and 67,468 shares will vest.

The deferred shares will, under normal circumstances, vest  
on 1 March 2017, subject to continued employment within the 
Group. No further performance conditions apply to these 
awards. Malus provisions apply to the deferred share awards 
in the event, for example, of a material misstatement of 
results. The share price used to calculate the awards was the 
average of closing price of a Whitbread share for the five 
business days preceding 1 March 2014 (i.e. 4,289.0p).

period will not be counted for the purpose of calculating 
whether an executive has met his or her requirement. When 
determining whether a director has met the requirement,  
both the current market price and the price at the point  
the shares were acquired will be taken into consideration. 
All of the executive directors except for Nicholas Cadbury, 
who was appointed in November 2012, have already met  
the increased requirement. Nicholas has begun to build  
a holding in the Company in advance of the first vesting  
of an award, which is due in 2015 subject to the satisfaction  
of performance conditions.
Since the year‚Äìend, shareholding requirements have  
been introduced for the Chairman and the non‚Äìexecutive 
directors. They are each required to build a holding to the 
value of 100% of their annual fee over a three‚Äìyear period.  
We will report on progress against this requirement in  
next year‚Äôs report.
Statement of directors‚Äô shareholding and share interests 
(audited information)
The Committee believes that the shareholding requirements 
for executives, which have replaced the previous guidelines, 
play an important role in the alignment of the interests of 
executives and shareholders and help to incentivise 
executives to deliver sustainable long‚Äìterm performance.
The Chief Executive is required to build and hold a 
shareholding at least equal to 200% of salary, whilst the other 
executive directors are expected to reach a holding to the 
value of 125% of salary and other senior executives 75%  
of salary. Until they reach this level, executives are expected  
to retain 100% of vested awards (after the deduction of 
income tax, national insurance contributions and dealing  
fees). In addition, a newly appointed executive director is 
expected to build a shareholding in the Company in advance 
of any share awards vesting. The failure to adhere to these 
requirements may lead to the executive being excluded  
from participation in future share scheme awards. It should  
be noted that any vested LTIP awards subject to a holding

on 1 March 2011. The award was subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and the retention of the same number of shares previously 
purchased by Andy. The performance conditions were in line with those for the general 2011 LTIP award, except that there would have been no 
vesting at median performance. This award will vest in full, as explained on page 69.

of closing price of a Whitbread share for the five business 
days preceding 1 March 2014 (i.e. 4,289.0p). The awards will 
be subject to strengthened performance conditions as shown 
in the matrix below. They will vest in April 2017, subject to 
the continued employment within the Group of the director 
and satisfaction of the performance conditions. The awards 
will be subject to a one‚Äìyear holding period post vesting.

Purchase of own shares
The Company is authorised to purchase its own shares in the 
market. Approval to renew this authority will be sought from 
the shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
The Company did not purchase any of its own shares during 
the year. 13.3 million shares (representing 6.85% of the total 
called up share capital at the beginning of the year) are held 
as treasury shares (28 February 2013: 13.8 million). During  
the course of the year, the Company transferred 453,000 
shares from treasury to the Employee Share Ownership  
Trust for the future satisfaction of awards under the 
Company‚Äôs incentive schemes.
Employee share schemes
Whitbread does not have any employee share schemes with 
shares which have rights with regard to the control of the 
Company that are not exercisable directly by the employees.
Major interests
As at the end of the financial year, the Company had received 
formal notification, under the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules, of the following material holdings in its shares (the 
percentages shown are the percentages at the time of the 
disclosure and have not been re‚Äìcalculated based on the 
issued share capital at the year‚Äìend):
Number of¬†shares % of issued share capital
BlackRock 17,184,930 9.73
Capital Group Companies, Inc. 10,646,212 5.87
Schroders PLC 10,531,421 5.35
Standard Life Investments 7,233,278 4.08
The Company was informed on 12 March 2014 that Capital 
Group Companies, Inc. had decreased its holding to 
9,000,289 shares, being 4.96% of the issued share capital.  
No other changes to the above have been disclosed to the 
Company in accordance with rule 5 of the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules between the end of the financial year  
and 28 April 2014.
Employment policies
Whitbread has a range of employment policies covering  
such issues as diversity, employee well‚Äìbeing and equal 
opportunities.
The Company takes its responsibilities to the disabled 
seriously and seeks not to discriminate under any 
circumstances (including in relation to training, career 
development and promotion) against current or prospective 
employees because of any disability. Fair and full 
consideration is given to applications for employment made 
by disabled persons, having regard to their aptitudes and 
abilities. Employees who become disabled during their career 
at Whitbread will be retained in employment wherever 
possible and given help with rehabilitation and training.
Employee involvement
The importance of good relations and communications with 
employees is fundamental to the continued success of our 
business. Each of the Group‚Äôs operating businesses maintains 
employee relations and consults employees as appropriate  
to its own particular needs. In addition, our employee opinion 
survey, ‚ÄòYour Say‚Äô, is conducted twice a year to provide insight 
into the views of employees.
Our employees are actively encouraged to take part in our 
Sharesave scheme, which is available to all employees and 
offers an option price discounted by 20%.
Regular internal communications are made to all employees 
to ensure that they are kept well informed of the performance 
of the Group and of financial and economic factors that may 
affect the Company‚Äôs performance.
Further information on employee involvement can be found  
in the Winning Teams sections on pages 12 to 13 and 22 to 23.
Mandatory Greenhouse Gas (‚ÄòGHG‚Äô) reporting 
In order to comply with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic and Directors‚Äô Report) Regulations 2013 
we have amended our environmental reporting accordingly. 
We have considered the six main GHGs and report emissions 
in tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent (‚ÄòCO
2
 e‚Äô) for our Scope 1 (direct) 
and Scope 2 (indirect) CO
2
 emissions. We have used the  
GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 
methodology to calculate our emissions and DEFRA GHG 
Conversion Factors for Company Reporting. 
Scope 1 relates to the direct emissions from the fuels we  
use in our hotels, restaurants, offices and coffee shops such  
as natural gas and liquid petroleum gas. It also includes 
emissions from owned vehicles (including company cars)  
but excludes logistics as this is an outsourced operation.  
We have reported our refrigerant gas and F‚ÄìGas emissions 
only in respect of our UK operations due to more limited 
reporting capabilities at other sites.
Scope 2 relates to the indirect emissions associated with  
the generation of the electricity consumed in our sites. 
When defining the scope of our data we do not report on 
operations under joint venture agreements where we do not 
have operational control such as Costa Beijing and Premier 
Inn (UAE). For reasons of materiality, small, one person offices  
in the Far East have been excluded. All other sites throughout 
the world are included.

Where possible we have reported billed or Automatic  
Meter Reader data which represents 88% of our total global 
emissions. For those operations which are currently beyond 
our reporting capabilities, such as Costa Shanghai, we have 
used an estimation approach using known sales data and  
local conversion factors. For further information about our 
estimation techniques and the number and location of 
Whitbread sites please view the Corporate Responsibility 
pages on our website.

Amendment of the Company‚Äôs Articles of Association 
Any amendments to the Articles of Association of the 
Company may be made in accordance with the provisions  
of the Companies Act 2006 by way of special resolution.
Significant agreements
The Company‚Äôs facility agreements and the private  
placement loan notes agreement, details of which can  
be found in Note 20 to the accounts, contain provisions 
entitling the counterparties to exercise termination or other 
rights in the event of a change of control of the Company.
Contractual arrangements
The Group has contractual arrangements with numerous  
third‚Äìparties in support of its business activities, none  
of which are considered individually to be essential to its 
business and, accordingly, it has not been considered 
necessary for an understanding of the development, 
performance or position of the Group‚Äôs business to disclose 
information about any of those third‚Äìparties.
Financial instruments
Information on the Company‚Äôs use of financial instruments, 
financial risk management objectives and policies and 
exposure is given in Note 24 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
Political donations
The Company has not made any political donations during  
the year and intends to continue its policy of not doing so  
for the foreseeable future.
Auditor
EY LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office 
as auditor of the Company and a resolution proposing their 
reappointment will be put to shareholders at the 2014 AGM. 
After proper consideration, the Audit Committee is satisfied 
that the Company‚Äôs auditor, EY LLP, continues to be objective 
and independent of the Company. In coming to this 
conclusion, the Audit Committee gave full consideration  
to any non‚Äìaudit work carried out by EY LLP.
The Audit Committee has considered what work should not 
be carried out by the external auditor and has concluded that 
certain services will not be carried out by EY LLP, as outlined 
in the Committee‚Äôs terms of reference.
Disclosure of information to auditor
The directors have taken all reasonable steps to make 
themselves aware of relevant audit information and to 
establish that the auditor is aware of that information. The 
directors are not aware of any relevant audit information 
which has not been disclosed to the auditor.
Going concern
The Group‚Äôs business activities, together with the factors  
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the strategic report on pages 6 to 43. 
The financial position of the Company, its cash flows, net debt 
and borrowing facilities and the maturity of those facilities  
are set out in the Finance Director‚Äôs review on pages 38 to 41. 
In addition there are further details in the financial statements 
on the Group‚Äôs financial risk management, objectives and 
policies (Note 23) and on financial instruments (Note 24).
A combination of the strong operating cash flows generated 
by the business and the significant headroom on its credit 
facilities supports the directors‚Äô view that the Group has 
sufficient funds available for it to meet its forseeable working 
capital requirements. The directors have concluded that the 
going concern basis remains appropriate.

Directors‚Äô responsibility 
statement
Statement of directors‚Äô responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual  
Report and the consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with applicable company law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union.
Under company law, the directors must not approve the 
consolidated financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they present fairly the financial position of the Group  
and the results and cash flows of the Group for that period.  
In preparing those consolidated financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
‚Ä¢	
select suitable accounting policies in accordance with  
IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting  
estimates and errors, and then apply them consistently;
‚Ä¢	
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
‚Ä¢	
state that the consolidated financial statements comply 
with IFRS subject to any material departures being 
disclosed and explained in the consolidated financial 
statements;
‚Ä¢	
prepare the consolidated financial statements on a going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that  
the Group will continue in its business;
‚Ä¢	
present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and
‚Ä¢	
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable  
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the Group‚Äôs financial 
position and financial performance.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the consolidated financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding  
the assets of the Group and hence, taking reasonable  
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
Responsibility statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the strategic 
report (including the Corporate Governance Report) and  
the directors‚Äô remuneration report in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and applicable regulations, including 
the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Annual Report included on the Group‚Äôs 
website, in accordance with the UK legislation governing  
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, whose name and functions are 
disclosed on pages 46 and 47, confirms that, to the best  
of their knowledge:
‚Ä¢	
the consolidated financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and result of the Group; and
‚Ä¢	
the strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Having 
taken advice from the Audit Committee, the Board considers 
the Report and consolidated financial statements, taken as  
a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable and that it 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company‚Äôs performance, business model and strategy.
By order of the Board,
Andy Harrison Nicholas Cadbury
Chief Executive Finance Director

Independent auditor‚Äôs report  
to the members of Whitbread PLC
Consolidated  
accounts 2013/14
Independent auditor‚Äôs report to the members  
of Whitbread PLC 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements  
of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 27 February 2014  
which comprise the consolidated income statement,  
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income,  
the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the 
consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated statement  
of cash flows and the related Notes 1 to 32. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International  
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted  
by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company‚Äôs members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken  
so that we might state to the Company‚Äôs members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor‚Äôs  
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company‚Äôs 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this Report,  
or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and of auditor 
As explained more fully in the directors‚Äô responsibility 
statement set out on page 84, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on  
the consolidated financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board‚Äôs Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group‚Äôs circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the  
overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non‚Äìfinancial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited consolidated financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent  
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on the consolidated financial statements
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements:
‚Ä¢	
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group‚Äôs  
affairs as at 27 February 2014 and of its profit for the  
year then ended;
‚Ä¢	
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union; and
‚Ä¢	
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
We identified the following risks of material misstatement 
which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy;  
the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team:
‚Ä¢	
the accounting for current and deferred taxation balances 
and assessment of uncertain taxation positions;
‚Ä¢	
revenue recognition ‚Äî including the treatment of franchise 
revenue;
‚Ä¢	
the accounting for the defined benefit pension scheme; and
‚Ä¢	
the risk of management override of internal control.
Our application of materiality
Materiality is a key part of planning and executing our audit 
strategy. For the purposes of determining whether the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement,  
we define materiality as the magnitude of an omission or 
misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, in light  
of the surrounding circumstances, could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of the users  
of the financial statements. As we develop our audit  
strategy, we determine materiality at the overall consolidated 
financial statement level and at the individual account level. 
Performance materiality is the application of materiality  
at the individual account level.
Planning the audit solely to detect individually material 
misstatements, overlooks the fact that the aggregate  
of individually immaterial misstatements may cause the 
consolidated financial statements to be materially misstated, 
and leaves no margin for possible undetected misstatements. 
Performance materiality is set to reduce to an appropriately 
low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected 
and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined  
a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged 
would be material for the consolidated financial statements  
as a whole. We determined materiality for the Group to be 
¬£18.0 million (2012/13: ¬£17.7 million), which is approximately 
5% (2012/13: 5%) of pre‚Äìtax profit. This provided the  
basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of our 
audit procedures, and identifying and assessing the risk  
of material misstatement.

Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14
Consolidated  
accounts 2013/14
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our 
assessment of the Group‚Äôs overall control environment,  
our judgement was that overall performance materiality  
(i.e. our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account  
or balance) for the Group should be 75% (2012/13: 75%)  
of planning materiality, namely ¬£13.5 million (2012/13:  
¬£13.3 million). Our objective in adopting this approach  
was to ensure that the total detected and undetected  
audit differences did not exceed our planning materiality  
of ¬£18.0 million for the consolidated financial statements  
as a whole.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would  
report to the Committee all audit differences in excess  
of ¬£0.9 million (2012/13: ¬£0.9 million), as well as differences 
below that threshold that, in our view warranted reporting  
on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the 
consolidated financial statements, our Group audit scope 
focused on the two operating segment locations in the UK, 
which were subject to full scope audits for the year ended  
27 February 2014. The audit of these two locations was 
performed at a materiality level calculated by reference to  
a proportion of Group materiality appropriate to the relevant 
scale of the individual business unit. Together with the  
Group functions, which were also subject to a full scope  
audit, these locations represent the principal business units  
of the Group and account for 97% of the Group‚Äôs total  
assets, 96% of the Group‚Äôs revenue and 96% of the Group‚Äôs 
operating profit. 
The Senior statutory auditor visited both of the full scope 
operating segment locations during the year and for each 
segment the Group audit team remained in continuous 
contact with component teams and reviewed the work  
on key audit areas.
Our response to the risks of material misstatement identified 
above included the following procedures.
The accounting for current and deferred taxation balances 
and assessment of uncertain taxation positions
‚Ä¢	
We challenged management‚Äôs calculation of current and 
deferred taxation liabilities and assessed the reasonableness 
of assumptions used by management in determining these 
estimates, particularly with respect to the deferred tax 
liabilities related to property, plant and equipment.
‚Ä¢	
We agreed a sample of amounts within management‚Äôs 
taxation calculations to those submitted within taxation 
returns and/or correspondence with HM Revenue and 
Customs.
‚Ä¢	
We critically evaluated the positions adopted by 
management in relation to uncertain taxation positions.
‚Ä¢	
We assessed whether specific taxation issues were treated 
correctly in accordance with tax law and practice.
‚Ä¢	
We ensured that the consolidated financial statement 
disclosures were in accordance with accounting standards.
Revenue recognition ‚Äî including the treatment  
of franchise revenue
‚Ä¢	
We tested a sample of franchise revenue transactions  
to identify anomalous entries potentially impacting  
Group revenue.
‚Ä¢	
We carried out testing relating to controls over revenue 
recognition, including the timing of revenue recognition. 
‚Ä¢	
We performed analytical procedures, cut‚Äìoff testing  
around the year‚Äìend and journal testing around revenue.
‚Ä¢	
We ensured that the consolidated financial statement 
disclosures were in accordance with accounting standards.
The accounting for the defined benefit pension scheme
‚Ä¢	
We challenged the assumptions used in the pension  
liability valuations and we used a pensions specialist  
to assist us with this procedure.
‚Ä¢	
We understood and challenged management‚Äôs input  
into the assumptions underpinning the determination  
of the liability.
‚Ä¢	
We tested a sample of the pension asset valuations  
to ensure they had been reasonably calculated.
‚Ä¢	
We ensured that the consolidated financial statement 
disclosures were in accordance with accounting standards.
The risk of management override of internal control
‚Ä¢	
We performed tailored procedures, sufficient to address  
the identified risk in respect of subjective areas which  
were considered to be most susceptible to management 
override.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the strategic report 
and the directors‚Äô report for the financial year for which  
the consolidated financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is: 
‚Ä¢	
materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
consolidated financial statements; or 
‚Ä¢	
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired  
in the course of performing our audit; or 
‚Ä¢	
is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the directors‚Äô statement that 
they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit 
Committee which we consider should have been disclosed.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
At 27 February 2014
1‚ÄÇ Authorisation of consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 27 February 2014, were authorised for issue  
by the Board of Directors on 28 April 2014. Whitbread PLC is a public limited company incorporated and fully domiciled  
in England and Wales. The Company‚Äôs ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The significant activities of the Group are described in Note 4, Segment information.
2‚ÄÇAccounting policies
Basis of accounting and preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance  
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted for use in the European Union and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred 
thousand except when otherwise indicated. The significant accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with those 
followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 28 February 2013, except as follows:
IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Amendment)
IAS 19 (revised 2011) has been applied retrospectively from 2 March 2012 and comparatives have been restated for the  
impact of its adoption. The standard replaces interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount  
that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net pension liability. In addition, certain administration costs in relation  
to the scheme, which were previously recognised as a reduction to the expected return on assets, are now recognised as an 
operating expense.
The impact of the adoption of IAS 19 (revised 2011) on the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and the calculation of earnings per share for each year was as follows:

In addition, the above decreases to profit and increases to other comprehensive income, have impacted the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity and the reconciliation of operating profit to cash generated from operating activities  
(see consolidated cash flow statement) for both financial years. There were no impacts on the consolidated balance sheet.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
The standard establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change  
when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS. Application 
of IFRS 13 has not materially impacted the fair value measurements in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
In addition to the above, the Group has adopted the following standards and interpretations which have been assessed  
as having no financial impact or disclosure requirements at this time:
‚Ä¢	
IAS 1 Presentation of items of Other Comprehensive Income;
‚Ä¢	
IFRS 7 Offsetting financial assets and liabilities; and
‚Ä¢	
The IASB‚Äôs annual improvement process, 2009‚Äî2011.
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries, together with  
the Group‚Äôs share of the net assets and results of joint ventures and associates incorporated using the equity method  
of accounting. These are adjusted, where appropriate, to conform to Group accounting policies. The financial statements  
of material subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company.
Apart from the acquisition of Whitbread Group PLC by Whitbread PLC in 2000/01, which was accounted for using merger 
accounting, acquisitions by the Group are accounted for under the acquisition method and any goodwill arising is capitalised  
as an intangible asset. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from, or up to, the date that control passes respectively. All intra‚ÄìGroup transactions, balances, income  
and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence  
of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Significant accounting policies 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of consideration over the Group‚Äôs 
interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is reviewed  
for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may  
be impaired. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit  
or loss on disposal.

2‚ÄÇAccounting policies continued 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are 
carried initially at cost. An intangible asset acquired as part  
of a business combination is recognised outside of goodwill  
if the asset is separable, or arises from contractual or other 
legal rights, and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight‚Äìline basis over  
the estimated life of the asset as follows:
‚Ä¢	
trading licences have an infinite life;
‚Ä¢	
brand assets are amortised over 15 years;
‚Ä¢	
IT software and technology is amortised over periods  
of three to ten years;
‚Ä¢	
the asset in relation to acquired customer relationships  
is amortised over 15 years; and
‚Ä¢	
operating rights agreements are amortised over the  
life of the contract.
The carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events  
or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not  
be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment
Prior to the 1999/2000 financial year, properties were 
regularly revalued on a cyclical basis. Since this date, the  
Group policy has been not to revalue its properties and, whilst 
previous valuations have been retained, they have not been 
updated. As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected to  
use the UK GAAP revaluations before the date of transition to  
IFRS as deemed cost at the date of transition. Property, plant 
and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost at transition 
to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment  
in value. Gross interest costs incurred on the financing of 
qualifying assets are capitalised until the time that the projects 
are available for use. Depreciation is calculated on a straight‚Äì
line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
‚Ä¢	
freehold land is not depreciated;
‚Ä¢	
freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated  
to their estimated residual values over periods up to  
50 years; and
‚Ä¢	
plant and equipment is depreciated over three to 30 years.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not  
be recoverable. Any impairment in the values of property, 
plant and equipment is charged to the income statement.
Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and 
equipment reflect the difference between net selling price 
and the carrying amount at the date of disposal and are 
recognised in the income statement.
 
Payments made on entering into, or acquiring leaseholds,  
that are accounted for as operating leases, represent pre‚Äìpaid 
lease payments. These are amortised on a straight‚Äìline basis 
over the lease term.
Impairment
The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  
that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. 
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment 
purposes, at the lowest level at which there are identifiable 
cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows  
of other groups of assets (cash generating units or CGUs).  
If such indication of impairment exists, or when annual 
impairment testing for an asset group is required, the  
Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether 
there is any indication that previously recognised impairment 
losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such 
indication exists, the CGU‚Äôs recoverable amount is estimated. 
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if 
there has been a change in the estimates used to determine 
the asset‚Äôs recoverable amount since the last impairment loss 
was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the 
asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased 
amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss 
been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such a reversal  
is recognised in the income statement. After such a reversal, 
the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to 
allocate the asset‚Äôs carrying amount, less any residual value, 
on a straight‚Äìline basis over its remaining useful life.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater  
of its fair value, less costs of disposal and value in use. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value, using a pre‚Äìtax discount  
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an  
asset that does not generate largely independent cash 
inflows, the recoverable amount is determined with reference 
to the CGU to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses  
are recognised in the income statement in operating costs.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount  
of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable  
amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of  
CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount  
of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce  
the carrying amounts of other assets in the CGU, on a  
pro‚Äìrata basis.
For the purposes of impairment testing, all centrally held 
assets are allocated in line with IAS 36 to CGUs based  
on management‚Äôs view of the consumption of the asset.  
Any resulting impairment is recorded against the centrally 
held asset.

2‚ÄÇAccounting policies continued 
Goodwill and intangibles
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is  
allocated to groups of CGUs at the level management monitor 
goodwill, which is at strategic business unit level. The Group 
performs an annual review of its goodwill to ensure that its 
carrying amount is not greater than its recoverable amount.  
In the absence of a comparable recent market transaction 
that demonstrates that the fair value, less the costs of 
disposal, of goodwill and intangible assets exceeds their 
carrying amount, the recoverable amount is determined  
from value in use calculations. An impairment is then made  
to reduce the carrying amount to the higher of the fair  
value less costs of disposal and the value in use.
Property, plant and equipment
For the purposes of the impairment review of property,  
plant and equipment, the Group considers each trading  
outlet to be a separate CGU.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment  
are reviewed for impairment when events or changes  
in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not  
be recoverable.
Consideration is also given, where appropriate, to the  
market value of the asset, either from independent sources,  
or in conjunction with, an accepted industry valuation 
methodology.
Investments in joint ventures and associates
The Group assesses investments for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable. If any such indication of 
impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment  
is compared with its recoverable amount, being the higher  
of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Where  
the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount,  
the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.
Assets held for sale
Non‚Äìcurrent assets and disposal groups are classified  
as held for sale only if available for immediate sale in  
their present condition and a sale is highly probable and  
expected to be completed within one year from the date  
of classification. Such assets are measured at the lower  
of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and  
are not depreciated or amortised.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost is calculated on the basis of first in, first out  
and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less  
any costs of disposal.
Provisions
Provisions for warranties, onerous contracts and restructuring 
costs are recognised: when the Group has a present legal  
or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; when  
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required  
to settle the obligation; and when a reliable estimate can  
be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Provisions are discounted to present value, using a pre‚Äìtax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The 
amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Non GAAP performance measure
The face of the income statement presents underlying profit 
before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax as required 
to be presented under the applicable accounting standards. 
Underlying earnings per share is calculated having adjusted 
profit after tax on the same basis. The term underlying profit 
is not defined under IFRSs and may not be comparable with 
similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies. 
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP 
measurements of profit. The adjustments made to reported 
profit in the income statement, in order to present an 
underlying performance measure, include:
Exceptional items
The Group includes in the non GAAP performance measure 
those items which are exceptional by virtue of their size  
or incidence so as to allow a better understanding of the 
underlying trading performance of the Group. The Group  
also includes the profit or loss on disposal of property, plant 
and equipment, property reversions, profit or loss on the sale 
of a business, impairment and exceptional interest and tax;
IAS 19 income statement finance charge/credit for defined 
benefit pension scheme
Underlying profit excludes the finance cost/revenue element 
of IAS 19;
Amortisation charge on acquired intangible assets
Underlying profit excludes the amortisation charge on 
acquired intangible assets; and
Taxation
The tax impact of the above items is also excluded in arriving 
at underlying earnings.

Foreign currency translation 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange 
quoted at the balance sheet date. Non‚Äìmonetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency, 
are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the 
initial transactions.
Trading results are translated into the functional currency 
(generally sterling) at average rates of exchange for the year. 
Day‚Äìto‚Äìday transactions in a foreign currency are recorded  
in the functional currency at an average rate for the month  
in which those transactions take place, which is used as a 
reasonable approximation to the actual transaction rate. 
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the 
income statement. The differences that arise from translating 
the results of foreign entities at average rates of exchange, 
and their assets and liabilities at closing rates, are also dealt 
with in a separate component of equity. On disposal of a 
foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised  
in equity relating to that particular foreign operation  
is recognised in the income statement. All other currency  
gains and losses are dealt with in the income statement.
A number of subsidiaries within the Group have a non‚Äìsterling 
functional currency. The financial performance and end 
position of these entities are translated into sterling in the 
consolidated financial statements. Balance sheet items are 
translated at the rate applicable at the balance sheet date. 
Transactions reported in the income statement are translated 
using an average rate for the month in which they occur.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards 
of the goods or services provided have transferred to the 
buyer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and  
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow to the Group.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
receivable from the sale of goods and services to third‚Äìparties 
after deducting discounts, allowances for customer loyalty 
and other promotional activities. Revenue includes duties 
which the Group pays as principal, but excludes amounts 
collected on behalf of other parties, such as value added tax. 
All sales between Group businesses are eliminated on 
consolidation.
Revenue of the Group comprises the following streams:
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of food, beverages and merchandise  
is recognised at the point of sale, with the exception of 
wholesale transactions which are recognised on delivery; 
Rendering of services
Revenue from room sales and other guest services is 
recognised when rooms are occupied and as services are 
provided;
Franchise fees
Revenue from fees received in connection with the franchise 
of the Group‚Äôs brand names is recognised when earned;
 
Customer loyalty programmes
Where award credits are granted as part of a sales 
transaction, a portion of revenue equal to the fair value  
of the reward points earned is deferred until redemption.  
The fair value of points awarded is determined with  
reference to the discount received upon redemption  
and the level of redemption; and
Finance revenue
Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues,  
using the effective interest method.
Leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and 
benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating 
leases. Rental payments in respect of operating leases are 
charged against operating profit on a straight‚Äìline basis  
over the period of the lease. Lease incentives are recognised 
as a reduction of rental costs over the lease term.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the  
period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest 
costs incurred on the financing of major projects, which  
are capitalised until the time that the projects are available  
for use.
Retirement benefits
In respect of defined benefit pension schemes, the obligation 
recognised in the balance sheet represents the present  
value of the defined benefit obligation, reduced by the fair 
value of the scheme assets. The cost of providing benefits is 
determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation 
method. Re‚Äìmeasurements are recognised in full in the  
period in which they occur in the statement of comprehensive 
income and are not classified to the income statement in 
subsequent periods.
For defined benefit plans, the employer‚Äôs portion of the  
past and current service cost is charged to operating  
profit, with net interest costs reported within finance costs.  
In addition, all administration costs, other than those relating 
to the management of plan assets or taxes payable by the 
plan itself, are charged as incurred to operating costs in the  
income statement. Net interest is calculated by applying  
the opening discount rate to the opening net defined benefit 
obligation taking into account the expected contributions  
and benefits paid.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Group‚Äôs  
defined benefit plan are recognised in the period in which  
the curtailment or settlement occurs.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are 
charged as an expense as they fall due.

Share‚Äìbased payment transactions 
Equity‚Äìsettled transactions
Certain employees and directors of the Group receive 
equity‚Äìsettled remuneration in the form of share‚Äìbased 
payment transactions, whereby employees render services in 
exchange for shares or rights over shares. The cost of equity‚Äì
settled transactions with employees is measured by reference 
to the fair value, determined using a stochastic model, at the 
date at which they are granted. The cost of equity‚Äìsettled 
transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding 
increase in equity, over the period in which the performance 
conditions or non‚Äìvesting conditions are fulfilled, ending  
on the relevant vesting date. Except for awards subject to 
market‚Äìrelated conditions for vesting, the cumulative expense 
recognised for equity‚Äìsettled transactions, at each reporting 
date until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired, and is adjusted to reflect the 
directors best available estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement 
charge or credit for a period represents the movement  
in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and  
end of that period. If options are subject to market‚Äìrelated 
conditions, awards are not cumulatively adjusted for  
the likelihood of these targets being met. Instead these 
conditions are included in the fair value of the awards.
Where an equity‚Äìsettled award is cancelled, it is treated as  
if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense  
not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. 
Where an equity‚Äìsettled award is forfeited, the related 
expense recognised to date is reversed.
Cash‚Äìsettled transactions
The cost is fair‚Äìvalued at grant date and expensed over  
the period until the vesting date, with a recognition of  
a corresponding liability. The liability is re‚Äìmeasured to  
fair value at each reporting date, up to and including the 
settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised  
in the income statement for the period.
Tax
The income tax charge represents both the income tax 
payable, based on profit for the year and deferred income tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability 
method, in respect of temporary differences between the tax 
base of the Group‚Äôs assets and liabilities, and their carrying 
amounts, that have originated but have not been reversed  
by the balance sheet date. No deferred tax is recognised if  
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not  
a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or  
loss. Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of taxable 
temporary differences associated with investments in 
associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent  
that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed  
at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that  
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will  
be available to allow all, or part of, the deferred income tax 
asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured  
at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when  
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted  
at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive 
income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to 
other comprehensive income. Similarly, income tax is charged 
or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are 
charged or credited directly to equity. Otherwise, income  
tax is recognised in the income statement.
Treasury shares
Own equity instruments which are held by the Group 
(treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss  
is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, 
issue or cancellation of the Group‚Äôs own equity instruments. 
Investments in joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures are established through an interest in a 
company (a jointly‚Äìcontrolled entity).
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially 
recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration 
given, including acquisition charges associated with the 
investment.
After initial recognition, investments in joint ventures and 
associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Recognition and derecognition of financial assets  
and liabilities
The recognition of financial assets and liabilities occurs when 
the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. The derecognition of financial assets takes place 
when the Group no longer has the right to cash flows, the 
risks and rewards of ownership, or control of the asset. The 
derecognition of financial liabilities occurs when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial assets 
 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Some assets held by the Group are classified as financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss. On initial recognition 
these assets are recognised at fair value. Subsequent 
measurement is also at fair value, with changes recognised 
through finance revenue or costs in the income statement.

Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non‚Äìderivative financial assets  
with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted  
in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and  
have not been designated as either fair value through  
profit or loss or available‚Äìfor‚Äìsale. Such assets are carried  
at amortised cost using the effective interest method  
if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses  
are recognised in the income statement when the loans  
and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as 
through the amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original 
invoice amount less any uncollectable amounts. An estimate 
for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full  
amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off  
when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short‚Äìterm deposits in the balance sheet comprise 
cash at bank, cash in hand and short‚Äìterm deposits with  
an original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose  
of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents  
consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above,  
net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into derivative transactions with a view  
to managing interest and currency risks associated with 
underlying business activities and the financing of those 
activities. Derivative financial instruments used by the  
Group are stated at fair value on initial recognition and at 
subsequent balance sheet dates. Cash flow hedges mitigate 
exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable 
to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or 
liability or a forecast transaction. Fair value hedges mitigate 
exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised  
asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment  
and include foreign currency swaps.
Hedge accounting is only used where, at the inception  
of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation 
of the hedging relationship, it meets the Group‚Äôs risk 
management objective strategy for undertaking the hedge 
and it is expected to be highly effective.
The fair value of derivative instruments is calculated by 
discounting all future cash flows by the applicable market 
yield curves at the balance sheet date. 
The portion of any gains or losses on cash flow hedges  
which meet the conditions for hedge accounting and are 
determined to be effective, is recognised directly in the 
statement of comprehensive income. The gains or losses 
relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately 
in the income statement. 
The change in fair value, of derivatives designated as part  
of a fair value hedge, is recognised in the income statement  
in finance costs. The change in the fair value of the hedged 
asset or liability, that is attributable to the hedged risk, is  
also recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
 
When a firm commitment that is hedged becomes an asset  
or a liability recognised on the balance sheet then, at the  
time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains  
or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are 
included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost  
or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. For all other 
cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised  
in equity are transferred to the income statement in the  
same period in which the transaction that results from  
a firm commitment that is hedged affects the income 
statement.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no 
longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, 
for cash flow hedges, any cumulative gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity  
until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction  
is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain  
or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income 
statement. When a fair value hedge item is derecognised,  
the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the 
consideration received, net of any directly associated issue 
costs. Borrowings are subsequently recorded at amortised 
cost, with any difference between the amount initially 
recorded and the redemption value, recognised in the  
income statement using the effective interest method.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates
Key assumptions concerning the future, and other key  
sources of estimation uncertainty, at the balance sheet  
date, have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the  
next financial year. 
The main assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty 
are outlined below:
‚Ä¢	
an impairment test of tangible and intangible assets  
is undertaken each year on both an EBITDA multiple 
approach and a discounted cash flow approach. Note 14 
describes the assumptions used together with an analysis  
of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions;
‚Ä¢	
judgement involving estimates is used in determining the 
value of provisions carried for onerous contracts. This is 
primarily based around assumptions on rent and property‚Äì
related costs for the period the property is vacant and then 
assumptions over future rental incomes or potential reverse 
lease premiums paid. Note 22 provides details of the value 
of the provisions carried;

‚Ä¢	
defined benefit pension plans are accounted for in 
accordance with actuarial advice using the projected unit 
credit method. Note 30 describes the assumptions used 
together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes  
in key assumptions; and
‚Ä¢	
the calculation of the Group‚Äôs total tax charge necessarily 
involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect  
of certain items, where the tax treatment cannot be finally 
determined until resolution has been reached with the 
relevant tax authority. The final resolution of some of these 
items may give rise to material income statement and/or 
cash flow variances.
  Corporation tax is calculated on the basis of income before 
taxation, taking into account the relevant local tax rates  
and regulations. For each operating entity, the current 
income tax expense is calculated and differences between 
the accounting and tax base are determined, resulting  
in deferred tax assets or liabilities.
  Assumptions are also made around the assets which  
qualify for capital allowances and the level of disallowable 
expenses and this affects the income tax calculation. 
Provisions may be made for uncertain exposures or 
recoveries, which can have an impact on both deferred  
and current tax. Assumptions are also made around the  
tax net book value of assets to which capital allowances 
apply, the level of capital allowances, the extent of  
rollover gains, indexation thereon and the tax base  
into which they have been rolled.
  A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for the carry 
forward of unused tax losses, pension deficits and unused 
tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profit will be available against which the unused  
tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised. 
  Detailed amounts of the carrying value of corporation  
and deferred tax can be found in Note 9.
Standards issued by the International Accounting  
Standards Board (IASB) not effective for the current  
year and not early adopted by the Group
The following standards and interpretations, which have  
been issued by the IASB and are relevant for the Group, 
subject to EU ratification, become effective after the current 
year‚Äìend and have not been early adopted by the Group:
Amendments to IAS 36: Recoverable Amount Disclosures  
for Non‚ÄìFinancial Assets
This amendment addresses the disclosure of information 
about the recoverable amount of impaired assets if that 
amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal and is 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2014. The impact on the Group is on disclosure in the 
consolidated financial statements only;
 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was first issued in November 
2009 and has since been amended several times. The 
standard will eventually replace IAS 39 and covers the 
classification, measurement and derecognition of financial 
assets and financial liabilities, together with a new hedge 
accounting model. The IASB intends to expand IFRS 9 to  
add new requirements for impairment and for it to become  
a complete replacement of IAS 39 for periods beginning  
on or after 1 January 2018. The adoption of the first  
phase of IFRS 9 will have an effect on classification and 
measurement of the Group‚Äôs financial assets, but will not  
have an impact on classification and measurements of 
financial liabilities. The Group will quantify the effect in 
conjunction with the other phases, when the final standard 
including all phases is issued; and
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities
IFRS 12 includes all of the disclosures that were previously  
in IAS 27 related to consolidated financial statements, as  
well as all of the disclosures that were previously included  
in IAS 31 and IAS 28. These disclosures relate to an entity‚Äôs 
interests, where they are material, in subsidiaries, joint 
arrangements, associates and structured entities. The impact 
on the Group is on disclosure in the consolidated financial 
statements only, where summarised information may need  
to be provided. The standard becomes effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014

.
Whilst the following standards and interpretations are relevant 
to the Group, they have been assessed as having no financial 
impact or additional disclosure requirements at this time

4‚ÄÇSegment information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into two strategic business units (Hotels & Restaurants and Costa)  
based upon their different products and services:
‚Ä¢	
Hotels & Restaurants provide services in relation to accommodation and food; and
‚Ä¢	
Costa generates income from the operation of its branded, owned and franchised coffee outlets.
The UK and International Hotels & Restaurants segments have been aggregated on the grounds that the International  
segment is immaterial.
Management monitors the operating results of its strategic business units separately for the purpose of making decisions  
about allocating resources and assessing performance. Segment performance is measured based on underlying operating 
profit. Included within the unallocated and elimination columns in the tables below are the costs of running the public  
company. The unallocated assets and liabilities are cash and debt balances (held and controlled by the central treasury 
function), taxation, pensions, certain property, plant and equipment, centrally held provisions and central working  
capital balances.
Inter‚Äìsegment revenue is from Costa to the Hotels & Restaurants segment and is eliminated on consolidation. Transactions 
were entered into on an arm‚Äôs length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third‚Äìparties.

1  In the year ended 3 March 2011, the Group received a refund of VAT charged on gaming machine income of ¬£4.6m together with some associated 
interest. HMRC appealed against the original ruling and the decision was overturned on 30 October 2013. Hence a liability has been booked this  
year for ¬£4.6m of revenue and ¬£1.1m of associated interest costs.
2  In 2013/14, a ¬£6.8m provision has been raised for previously sublet properties that have reverted back to Whitbread. In addition to this, a ¬£4.9m  
loss on disposal was recorded, mainly relating to Costa store closures in the international business. The non‚Äìcontrolling interest portion of this  
cost was ¬£0.7m (2012/13: ¬£nil). In 2012/13, a net gain of ¬£18.6m was recognised on disposals of property, plant and equipment, the majority of  
which related to a sale and leaseback agreement for seven properties.
3  This represents the net loss on the sale of the joint venture in Rosworth Investments to the joint venture partner in 2012/13.
4  During the year ended 28 February 2013, Coffeeheaven Hungary was closed and subsequently liquidated. The costs incurred in this process  
were classed as loss on disposal of business.
5  This was the partial release of a provision in the prior year, of ¬£13.5m, for an item which had been disputed by HMRC but has now been agreed.  
Interest which had been accrued for the late payment, amounting to ¬£10.8m, was also released.
6  The interest arising from the unwinding of the discount rate within provisions is included in exceptional interest, reflecting the exceptional nature  
of the provisions created.
7  Reduction in deferred tax liability for differences between the tax deductible cost and accounts‚Äô residual value of assets.

Total deferred tax liabilities released as a result of disposals during the year was ¬£nil (2013: ¬£0.2m).
The Group has incurred overseas tax losses which, subject to any local restrictions, can be carried forward and offset against 
future taxable profits in the companies in which they arose. The Group carries out an annual assessment of the recoverability  
of these losses and does not think it appropriate at this stage to recognise any deferred tax assets. If the Group were to 
recognise these deferred tax assets in their entirety, profits would increase by ¬£6.2m (2013: ¬£6.8m), of which, the share 
attributable to parent shareholders is ¬£5.0m (2013: ¬£5.4m).
At 27 February 2014, there was no recognised deferred tax liability (2013: ¬£nil) for taxes that would be payable on any 
unremitted earnings, as all such amounts are permanently reinvested or, where they are not, there are no corporation tax 
consequences of such companies paying dividends to parent companies.
Tax relief on total interest capitalised amounts to ¬£0.6m (2013: ¬£0.7m).
Factors affecting the tax charge for future years
The Finance Act 2013 reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax to 21% from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015.  
The effect of the new rate is to reduce the deferred tax provision by a net ¬£7.0m, comprising a credit of ¬£18.6m to the 
consolidated income statement, a charge of ¬£12.3m to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and a credit  
of ¬£0.7m to reserves.

10‚ÄÇEarnings per share
The basic earnings per share (EPS) figures are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary 
shareholders, therefore before non‚Äìcontrolling interests, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue  
during the year after deducting treasury shares and shares held by an independently managed employee share ownership  
trust (ESOT).
The diluted earnings per share figures allow for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the weighted 
average number of options outstanding during the year. Where the average share price for the year is lower than the option 
price, the options become anti‚Äìdilutive and are excluded from the calculation. The number of such options was nil (2013: nil).
The numbers of shares used for the earnings per share calculations are as follows:
     2013/14 2012/13 
     million million
Basic weighted average number of ordinary shares      179.2  177 .6  
Effect of dilution ‚Äî share options      1.9  1.5 
Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares     181.1  17 9.1 
The total number of shares in issue at the year‚Äìend, as used in the calculation of the basic weighted average number  
of ordinary shares, was 194.7m, less 13.3m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 1.2m held by the ESOT (2013: 193.0m,  
less 13.8m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 1.1m held by the ESOT).

The carrying amount of goodwill at 27 February 2014 comprised ¬£112.6m for Hotels & Restaurants and ¬£65.0m for Costa.  
The Hotels & Restaurants CGU and the Costa CGU are also operating segments and represent the lowest level within the  
Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The brand intangible asset arose with the acquisition of Coffeeheaven in 2009/10. This has been impaired in 2013/14, as the 
Coffeeheaven stores are to be rebranded to Costa.
The customer relationships asset arose with the acquisition of Coffee Nation in a previous financial year. It is being amortised 
over a period of 15 years.
IT software and technology has been assessed as having finite lives and will be amortised under the straight‚Äìline method  
over periods ranging from three to ten years from the date the asset became fully operational. 
Other intangibles
Other intangibles comprise Costa overseas trading licences and territory fees, and Costa Express operating rights agreements 
and development costs.
The trading licences, which have a carrying value of ¬£1.8m (2013: ¬£1.8m), are deemed to have infinite lives as there is no  
time limit associated with them. The operating rights agreements are being amortised between six years and ten years and 
have a carrying value of ¬£2.0m (2013: ¬£2.3m). Development costs have a carrying value of ¬£1.7m (2013: ¬£nil) and are being 
amortised over six years. The balance of ¬£0.4m (2013: ¬£0.4m) relates to territory fees which are being amortised over 20 years.

There is a charge in favour of the pension scheme over properties with a market value of ¬£408.0m. See Note 30 for further 
information. 
A change in estimate of the useful lives of certain assets within the Hotels & Restaurants estate has been implemented in 2013/14  
to bring them in line with the new refurbishment programme. This has led to an accelerated depreciation charge of ¬£6.0m in 2013/14 
and will have a ¬£6.0m impact in 2014/15.

In addition to the capital expenditure commitments disclosed above, the Group has also signed agreements with certain  
third‚Äìparties to develop new trading outlets within the Hotels & Restaurants strategic business unit as part of its pipeline.  
These developments are dependant upon the outcome of future events, such as the granting of planning permission, and 
consequently, do not represent a binding capital commitment at the year‚Äìend. The directors consider that developments  
likely to proceed as planned will result in further capital investment of ¬£210.0m over the next five years (2013: ¬£177.5m).
Capitalised interest
Interest capitalised during the year amounted to ¬£2.6m, using an average rate of 4.1% (2012/13: ¬£2.7m, using an average  
rate of 4.5%).
Assets held for sale
During the year, certain property assets with a net book value of ¬£4.7m (2012/13: ¬£2.1m) were reclassified as assets held  
for sale. Property assets sold during the year had a net book value of ¬£4.3m (2012/13: ¬£0.6m), and three trading sites  
with a combined net book value of ¬£1.5m (2012/13: ¬£1.5m) continued to be classified as held for sale at the year‚Äìend.  
An impairment loss of ¬£0.4m (2012/13: ¬£0.6m) was recognised in the year.

The Group considers each trading site to be a CGU and each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.
In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.  
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value, less costs of disposal and its value in use. In the absence of any 
information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use. 
The Group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, which applies a pre‚Äìtax discount rate of 9.9%  
in the UK (2012/13: 9.1%), 10.6% in China (2012/13: 10.2%) and 11.1% in Poland (2012/13: 10.6%). The future cash flows are  
based on assumptions from the business plans and cover a five‚Äìyear period. These business plans and forecasts include 
management‚Äôs most recent view of medium‚Äìterm trading prospects. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated  
using a growth rate based upon the relevant country‚Äôs inflation target, ranging from 2.0% to 6.0% with the UK, the most 
significant country, being 2.0% (2012/13: 2.0%).
The events and circumstances that led to the impairment charge of ¬£22.4m are set out below:
Hotels & Restaurants
The impairment of ¬£15.5m at 14 sites in this strategic business unit was driven by a number of factors:
‚Ä¢	
changes in the local competitive environment in which the hotels are situated;
‚Ä¢	
decisions to exit some sites where current market values are lower than book values; and
‚Ä¢	
high asset prices in the market at the point of acquisition for acquired sites and also anticipated higher growth rates  
at that time than are now expected.
Costa
The ¬£6.9m impairment charge includes assets affected by the rebranding of Coffeeheaven to Costa and three UK and  
45 international sites, where stores are to be closed or are underperforming. The non‚Äìcontrolling interest portion of this  
cost was ¬£0.7m (2012/13: ¬£nil).
Impairment reversals
Following an improvement in trading performance and an increase in amounts of estimated future cash flows of previously 
impaired sites, reversals of ¬£5.9m have been recognised, ¬£5.4m in Hotels & Restaurants and ¬£0.5m in Costa.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at future growth rates and the discount 
rates applied to cash flow projections. The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth 
rates used in the five‚Äìyear business plans and in the pre‚Äìtax discount rates would be an incremental impairment charge of:

    Restaurants Costa Total

Goodwill
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at strategic business unit level, being  
the level at which management monitor goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In the absence of a recent market 
transaction the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations. The future cash flows are based on 
assumptions from the business plans and cover a five‚Äìyear period. These business plans and forecasts include management‚Äôs 
most recent view of medium‚Äìterm trading prospects. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth  
rate (2012/13: 2.0%). The pre‚Äìtax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 9.9% (2012/13: 9.1%).
The resultant impairment review required no impairment of goodwill allocated to either the Hotels & Restaurants CGU  
or the Costa CGU.
Brand
The brand intangible arose upon the acquisition of the Coffeeheaven business. At the time, the stores were trading as 
Coffeeheaven branded stores. A decision has been taken to rebrand these stores to Costa and therefore the asset has been 
fully impaired by ¬£3.7m (2012/13: ¬£nil).

The maturity analysis is grouped by when the debt is contracted to mature rather than by repricing dates, as allowed under IFRS.
There are ¬£50.0m of swaps (2013: ¬£100.0m) with maturities beyond the life of the current revolving credit facility (2018), which 
are in place to hedge against the core level of debt the Group will hold.
The carrying amount of the Group‚Äôs borrowings is denominated in sterling and US dollars.
At 27 February 2014, the Group had available ¬£460.0m (2013: ¬£405.0m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect  
of revolving credit facilities on which all conditions precedent had been met.

Onerous contracts
Onerous contract provisions relate primarily to property reversions. Provision is made for rent and other property related  
costs for the period that a sublet or assignment of the lease is not possible. Where the property is deemed likely to be assigned, 
provision is made for the best estimate of the reverse lease premium payable on the assignment.
Where the property is deemed likely to be sublet, the rental income and the timing of the cash flows are estimated by  
both internal and external property specialists and a provision is maintained for the estimated cost incurred by the Group.
Onerous lease provisions are discounted using a discount rate of 3.74% (2013: 3.74%) based on an approximation for the time 
value of money.
The amount and timing of the cash outflows are subject to variations. The Group utilises the skills and expertise of both  
internal and external property experts to determine the provision held. Provisions are expected to be utilised over a period  
of up to 25 years.
Other
Other provisions relate to warranties given on the disposal of businesses. These are expected to be used over periods  
of up to three years.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
At 27 February 2014
23‚ÄÇFinancial risk management objectives and policies
The Group‚Äôs principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, private placement loans, cash,  
short‚Äìterm deposits, trade receivables and trade payables. The Group‚Äôs financial instrument policies can be found in the 
accounting policies in Note 2. The Board agrees policies for managing the financial risks summarised below:
Interest rate risk 
The Group‚Äôs exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Group‚Äôs long‚Äìterm sterling debt 
obligations. Interest rate swaps are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt in conjunction with private 
placement loan notes. The Group‚Äôs policy is to fix, on a long‚Äìterm basis, between 35% and 65% of projected net interest cost  
but significant transactions can lead to a short‚Äìterm deviation from this policy. This policy reduces the Group‚Äôs exposure  
to the consequences of interest rate fluctuations. At the year‚Äìend, ¬£296.5m (68.5%) of Group debt was fixed for an average  
of 5.88 years at an average interest rate of 5.0% (2013: ¬£310.8m, (61.8%), for 6.87 years, at 5.1%). 
Although the private placement loan notes are US dollar denominated, cross‚Äìcurrency swaps mean that the interest rate  
risk is effectively sterling only.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by 
changes in interest rates. This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio  
of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 27 February 2014 and 28 February 
2013 respectively. Consequently, the analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then  
ended. The following assumptions were made:
‚Ä¢	
balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt  
and deposits does not change as interest rates move;
‚Ä¢	
gains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in Note 2; and
‚Ä¢	
cash flow hedges were effective.
Based on the Group‚Äôs net debt position at the year‚Äìend, a 1% pt change in interest rates would affect the Group‚Äôs profit before  
tax by approximately ¬£1.4m (2012/13: ¬£1.9m), and equity by approximately ¬£5.2m (2013: ¬£6.6m).
Liquidity risk
In its funding strategy, the Group‚Äôs objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through 
the use of overdrafts and bank loans. This strategy includes monitoring the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk  
of a shortage of funds.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest‚Äìbearing deposit where maturity is fixed at no more than three 
months. Short‚Äìterm flexibility is achieved through the use of short‚Äìterm borrowing on the money markets. 
The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Group‚Äôs financial liabilities at 27 February 2014 and 28 February 2013 
based on contractual undiscounted payments, including interest:

23‚ÄÇFinancial risk management objectives and policies continued
Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.  
This is minimised by dealing with counterparties with high credit ratings. The amounts included in the balance sheet are  
net of allowances for doubtful debts, which have been estimated by management based on prior experience and any  
known factors at the balance sheet date which may indicate that a provision is required. The Group‚Äôs maximum exposure  
on its trade and other receivables is the carrying amount as disclosed in Note 18.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents,  
the Group‚Äôs exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of  
these instruments. The Group seeks to minimise the risk of default in relation to cash and cash equivalents by spreading 
investments across a number of counterparties.
In the event that any of the Group‚Äôs banks get into financial difficulty, the Group is exposed to the risk of withdrawal of  
currently undrawn committed facilities. This risk is mitigated by the Group having a range of counterparties to its facilities  
and by maintaining headroom.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange exposure is currently not significant to the Group. Although the Group has US dollar denominated loan  
notes, these have been swapped into sterling thereby eliminating foreign currency risk. Sensitivity analysis has therefore  
not been carried out.
The Group monitors the growth and risks associated with its overseas operations and will undertake hedging activities  
as and when they are required.
Capital management
The Group‚Äôs primary objective in regard to capital management is to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern  
and has sufficient funds at its disposal to grow the business for the benefit of shareholders. The Group seeks to maintain 
a ratio of debt to equity that balances risks and returns and also complies with lending covenants. See pages 38 to 41 
of this Report for the policies and objectives of the Board regarding capital management, analysis of the Group‚Äôs credit  
facilities and financing plans for the coming years.
The Group aims to maintain sufficient funds for working capital and future investment in order to meet growth targets.  
The Group has adopted a framework to keep leverage (debt divided by EBITDAR) on a pensions lease adjusted basis  
at 3.5 times or below, which was achieved for the year ended 27 February 2014. This calculation takes account of net debt, 
the pension deficit and the capital value of leases. The management of equity through share buy backs and new issues  
is considered as part of the overall leverage framework balanced against the funding requirements of future growth.  
In addition, the Group may carry out a number of small sale and leaseback transactions to provide further funding for growth.
The Group‚Äôs financing is subject to financial covenants. These covenants relate to the measurement of EBITDA against 
consolidated net finance charges (interest cover) and total net debt (leverage ratio, on a not‚Äìadjusted‚Äìfor pension and 
property lease basis). The Group has complied with all of these covenants.
The above matters are considered at regular intervals and form part of the business planning and budgeting processes.  
In addition, the Board regularly reviews the Group‚Äôs dividend policy and funding strategy.
24‚ÄÇFinancial instruments
Fair values
As in the prior year, the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities disclosed in Notes 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 25 are  
considered to be reasonable approximations of their fair values.
The fair value of loan capital and derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market  
yield curve at the balance sheet date using level 2 techniques.

24‚ÄÇFinancial instruments continued
Hierarchical classification of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value
IFRS 13 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source of inputs 
used to derive the fair value. The classification uses the following three‚Äìlevel hierarchy:
Level 1
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
Other techniques for which all inputs, which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value, are observable, either directly  
or indirectly.
Level 3
Techniques which use inputs, which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value, that are not based on observable 
market data.

instruments include ¬£nil assets (2013: ¬£7.0m) and ¬£24.7m liabilities (2013: ¬£18.7m) due after one year.
Derivative financial instruments 
Hedges 
Cash flow hedges
At 27 February 2014, the Group has interest rate swaps in place to swap a notional amount of ¬£100.0m (2013: ¬£100.0m) 
whereby, it receives variable interest rates based on LIBOR on the notional amount and pays fixed rates of between 5.145%  
and 5.372% (2013: 5.145% and 5.372%). The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in future cash flows  
from variable rate debt. The Group also has cross‚Äìcurrency swaps in place whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of  
between 3.92% and 4.86% (2013: 3.92% and 4.86%) on a notional amount of US$250.0m (2013: US$250.0m) and paid  
an average of 4.72% on a notional sterling balance of ¬£158.2m (2013: 4.72% on ¬£158.2m).
There are ¬£50.0m of swaps (2013: ¬£100.0m) with maturities beyond the life of the current revolving credit facility (2018)  
which are in place to hedge against the core level of debt the Group will hold.
Fair value hedges
At 27 February 2014, the Group has cross‚Äìcurrency swaps in place whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 5.23% (2013: 
5.23%) on a notional amount of US$75.0m (2013: US$75.0m) and pays a spread of between 1.715% and 1.755% (2013: 1.715%  
and 1.755%) over 6m GBP LIBOR on a notional sterling balance of ¬£50.1m (2013: ¬£50.1m).
Cash flow and fair value hedges are expected to impact on the income statement in line with the liquidity risk table shown  
in Note 23.
The cash flow hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 27 February 2014 and a net unrealised gain of ¬£1.4m (2012/13:  
net unrealised gain of ¬£8.3m) has been recorded in other comprehensive income. The fair value hedges were also assessed  
to be highly effective at 27 February 2014, with a debit of ¬£0.9m recorded within finance costs in the income statement 
(2012/13: a credit of ¬£0.4m). During the year, a loss of ¬£3.8m (2012/13: ¬£7.0m) was charged to the income statement in  
respect of hedged items affecting the net finance charge for the year.

At the 2013 Annual General Meeting, the Company was authorised to purchase up to 17.9m of its own shares on the open market. 
During the year, no ordinary shares were acquired (2012/13: nil). No shares were cancelled in the year (2012/13: nil).  
The remainder are being held in the treasury reserve (Note 27).
During the year, options over 0.2m ordinary shares, fully paid, were exercised by employees under the terms of various share 
option schemes (2012/13: 0.2m).
Shareholders were offered a scrip alternative to the 2012/13 cash final dividend of 37.90p and to the 2013/14 cash interim 
dividend of 21.80p. Ordinary shares issued in respect of this totalled 1,482,215. The issue of shares in lieu of cash dividends  
is treated as a bonus issue, with the nominal value of the shares being charged against the share premium account.
The total number of shares in issue at the year‚Äìend, as used in the calculation of the basic weighted average number  
of ordinary shares, was 194.7m, less 13.3m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 1.2m held by the employee share 
ownership trust (ESOT) (2013: 193.0m, less 13.8m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 1.1m held by the ESOT).

27‚ÄÇReserves
Share premium
The share premium reserve is the premium paid on the Company‚Äôs 76.80p ordinary shares. The issue of shares in lieu of cash 
dividends is treated as a bonus issue, with the nominal value of the shares being charged against the share premium account. 
During the year, shares with a nominal value of ¬£1.1m were issued in lieu of the 2012/13 final and 2013/14 interim cash dividends 
(2012/13: ¬£0.6m).
Capital redemption reserve
A capital redemption reserve was created on the cancellation of the Group‚Äôs B and C preference shares (Note 26) and also 
includes the nominal value of cancelled ordinary shares.
Retained earnings
In accordance with IFRS practice, retained earnings include revaluation reserves which are not distributable under UK law.
Currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the consolidated 
financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and other foreign currency investments.
Treasury reserve
This reserve relates to shares held by an independently managed employee share ownership trust (ESOT) and treasury shares 
held by Whitbread PLC. The shares held by the ESOT were purchased in order to satisfy outstanding employee share options 
and potential awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and other incentive schemes.

28‚ÄÇCommitments and contingencies
Operating lease commitments
The Group leases various buildings which are used within the Hotels & Restaurants and Costa businesses. The leases are  
non‚Äìcancellable operating leases with varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. The Group also leases various  
plant and equipment under non‚Äìcancellable operating lease agreements.
Contingent rents are the portion of the lease payment that is not fixed in amount but based upon the future amount of a factor 
that changes other than with the passage of time (e.g. percentage of future sales, amount of future use, future price indices, 
future market rates of interest).
Future minimum rentals payable under non‚Äìcancellable operating leases, on an undiscounted basis, are as follows:
     2014 2013 
     ¬£m ¬£m
Due within one year      173.0  16 3.1  
Due after one year but not more than five years      598.2  55 4.6  
Due after five years but not more than ten years     543.3  50 2.1  
Due after ten years     1,263.2  1, 240.7 
     2,577.7  2, 460.5 
Future minimum rentals payable under non‚Äìcancellable operating leases disclosed above includes ¬£109.7m in relation to  
privity contracts (2013: ¬£123.0m). Future lease costs in respect of these privity contracts are included within the onerous 
contracts provision (Note 22). Onerous contracts are under constant review and every effort is taken to reduce this obligation.
The weighted average lease life of future minimum rentals payable under non‚Äìcancellable operating leases is 14.0 years  
(2013: 14.7 years).
Group companies have sublet space in certain properties. The future minimum sublease payments expected to be received 
under non‚Äìcancellable sublease agreements as at 27 February 2014 are ¬£13.6m (2013: ¬£11.8m).
Contingent liabilities
There are no contingent liabilities to be disclosed in the year ended 27 February 2014. In the prior year, there was a ¬£5.3m 
contingent liability which has been recognised as a liability in this financial year. See Note 6 for further details.

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP awards shares to directors and senior executives of the Group. Vesting of all shares under the scheme will depend  
on continued employment and meeting earnings per share (EPS) performance targets over a three‚Äìyear period (the vesting 
period). In addition, awards from 2012 onwards are dependent on meeting a return on capital employed (ROCE) target over 
the vesting period. Grants prior to this were dependent on meeting a total shareholder return (TSR) target over the vesting 
period. Details of the performance targets for the LTIP awards can be seen in the remuneration report on pages 67 to 76.
The awards are settled in equity once exercised.
Movements in the number of share awards are as follows:
     2014 2013

Deferred equity awards
Awards are made under the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme implemented during 2004/05.
The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to continued employment 
at that date. If the director or senior executive of the Group ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date, 
normally three years after the award, by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other 
reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee, the awards will be released in full. If employment ceases 
for any other reason, the proportion of awards which vest depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date 
that employment ceased. If employment ceases in the first year after an award is made none of the awards vest, between the 
first and second anniversary, 25% vests and between the second and third anniversary, 50% vests.

Employee sharesave scheme
The employee sharesave scheme is open to employees with the required minimum period of service and provides for a 
purchase price equal to the market price on the date of grant, less a 20% discount. The shares can be purchased over the  
six‚Äìmonth period following the third or fifth anniversary of the commencement date, depending on the length chosen by  
the employee.

The weighted average contractual life of the share options outstanding as at 27 February 2014 is between two and three years. 
Outstanding options to purchase ordinary shares of 76.80 pence between 2013 and 2018 are exercisable at prices between 
¬£7.28 and ¬£27.46 (2013: between 2012 and 2017 at prices between ¬£7.28 and ¬£19.14). The fair value of share options granted  
is estimated as at the date of grant using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
options were granted.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for employee share scheme options exercised during the year was

Expected volatility reflects the assumption that historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily  
be the actual outcome.
The risk‚Äìfree rate is the rate of interest obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
The expected dividend yield is calculated on the basis of publicly available information at the time of the grant date which,  
in most cases, is the historic dividend yield.
No other features relating to the granting of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
Employees share ownership trust (ESOT)
The Company funds an ESOT to enable it to acquire and hold shares for the LTIP. The ESOT held 1.2m shares at 27 February 2014 
(2013: 1.1m). All dividends on the shares in the ESOT are waived by the Trustee.
30‚ÄÇRetirement benefits
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates a contracted‚Äìin defined contribution scheme under the Whitbread Group Pension Fund. Contributions  
by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested, trustee‚Äìadministered funds. The Group also had  
a contracted‚Äìout defined contribution pension scheme which was wound up during 2012.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution scheme, and thereafter 
has no further obligations in relation to the scheme. The total cost charged to income in relation to the defined contribution 
scheme in the year was ¬£6.8m (2012/13: ¬£4.1m).
At the year‚Äìend, 25,770 employees (2013: 2,897) were active members of the scheme, which also had 4,172 deferred members 
(2013: 4,104).
Defined benefit scheme
The defined benefit (final salary) section of the principal Group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, was closed  
to new members on 31 December 2001 and to future accrual on 31 December 2009.
At the year‚Äìend the scheme had no active members (2013: nil), 24,161 deferred pensioners (2013: 24,851) and 16,681 pensions  
in payment (2013: 16,662).
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The IAS 19 (revised 2011) pension cost relating 
to the defined benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with actuarial advice from Lane 
Clark & Peacock and calculations provided by Towers Watson, using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. Actuarial gains and 
losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. As the scheme is closed to future accrual, there is no future service cost.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit plan obligation at the end of the reporting period is 17.5 years  
(2013: 17.5 years).

Funding
Expected contributions to be made in the next reporting period total ¬£76.4m (2013: ¬£66.1m). In 2013/14, contributions were 
¬£71.2m with ¬£62.4m from the employer, ¬£8.7m from Moorgate SLP and ¬£0.1m of benefits settled by the Group in relation  
to an unfunded scheme (2012/13: ¬£45.7m, with ¬£37.2m from the  employer, ¬£8.4m from Moorgate SLP and ¬£0.1m of benefits  
settled by the Group in relation to an unfunded scheme).
A scheme specific actuarial valuation for the purpose of determining the level of cash contributions to be paid into the 
Whitbread Group Pension Fund was undertaken as at 31 March 2011. A deficit recovery plan and some protection whilst  
the scheme remains in deficit, have been agreed with the Trustee. The Group made a ¬£60.0m payment in 2013/14 and will  
make the following payments to the Fund: ¬£65.0m in each of August 2014 and August 2015; ¬£70.0m in August 2016; ¬£80.0m  
in August 2017 and ¬£70.0m in August 2018. For the period of the deficit, the Group has agreed to give undertakings to the 
Trustee similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements, up to the value of any outstanding 
recovery plan payments or the remaining deficit, if lower. Until the next valuation, the Trustee has also been given a promise  
of accelerated payments of up to ¬£5.0m per annum where increases in ordinary dividends exceed RPI and the right to 
consultation before any special distributions can be made. 
In addition to the scheduled deficit contribution payments described above, the Pension Scheme will receive a share of the 
income, profits and a variable capital payment from its investment in Moorgate Scottish Limited Partnership (SLP), which was 
established by the Group in the year ended 4 March 2010 (the share in profits is accounted for by the Group as contributions 
when paid). The partnership interests in Moorgate SLP are held by the Group, the general partner and by the Pension Scheme. 
Moorgate SLP holds an investment in a further partnership, Farringdon Scottish Partnership (SP), which was also established 
by the Group during 2009/10. Property assets with a market value of ¬£221.0m have been transferred from other Group 
companies to Farringdon SP and leased back to Whitbread Group PLC and Premier Inn Hotels Limited. The Group retains 
control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties. However, the Trustee has first  
charge over the property portfolio and certain other assets with an aggregate value of ¬£228.0m. The Group retains control 
over both partnerships and, as such, they are fully consolidated in these consolidated financial statements. 
The Pension Scheme is a partner in Moorgate SLP and, as such, is entitled to an annual share of the profits of the partnership 
over the next 11 years. At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the Pension Scheme partner will, depending 
on the funding position of the Pension Scheme at that time, be transferred in cash to the Pension Scheme up to a value of 
¬£150.0m (2013: ¬£150.0m). 
Under IAS 19 (revised 2011), the investment held by the Pension Scheme in Moorgate SLP, a consolidated entity, does not 
represent a plan asset for the purposes of the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly the pension deficit position  
in these consolidated financial statements does not reflect the ¬£141.0m (2013: ¬£141.0m) investment in Moorgate SLP held  
by the Pension Scheme. 
During the year ended 28 February 2013, the Group entered into a charge in favour of Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited  
over properties with a market value totalling ¬£180.0m at that date. The charge was to secure the obligations of the Group  
to make payments to the Pension Fund as part of the recovery plan to reduce the deficit. This, together with the properties 
secured as a consequence of the arrangement surrounding the Scottish Limited Partnerships, secures properties totalling 
¬£408.0m in favour of the Pension Scheme. 
Risks
Through its defined benefit scheme, the Group is exposed to a number of risks in relation to the IAS 19 deficit, the most 
significant of which are detailed below:
Risk Description
Principal impact on assets  
and obligation reconciliations
Market volatility The defined benefit obligation is linked to AA‚Äìrated corporate bonds whilst scheme 
assets are invested in equities, gilts, bonds, property and cash. This exposes the  
Group to risks including those relating to interest rates, equity markets, property 
markets and foreign exchange. Changing market conditions, in conjunction with 
discount rate fluctuations, will lead to volatility in the Group‚Äôs net pension liability on 
the balance sheet, pension expense in the income statement and re‚Äìmeasurement 
movements in other comprehensive income.
Return on plan assets
Inflationary risk Due to the link between the scheme obligation and inflation, an increased rate  
of inflation will lead to higher scheme liabilities. 
Actuarial movements in financial 
assumptions
Accounting 
assumptions
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by projecting the future cash flows  
of the scheme for many years into the future. Consequently, the assumptions used  
can have a significant impact on the balance sheet position and income statement 
charge. In practice, future Scheme experience may not be in line with the assumptions 
adopted. For example, an increase in the life expectancy of members would increase 
scheme liabilities.
Discount rate: interest income on 
scheme assets and cost on liabilities
Mortality: actuarial movements  
in demographic assumptions

The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the most recent valuation carried out as at

Pension increases in deferment     3.10 3.20 
Discount rate      4.30 4.60 
Inflation assumption      3.25 3.35
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The 
assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 20.0 years (2013: 19.9 years) if they are male 
and for a further 22.6 years (2013: 22.5 years) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2034 at age 65, the assumptions 
are that they will live on average for a further 21.9 years (2013: 21.8 years) after retirement if they are male and for a further  
24.4 years (2013: 24.4 years) after retirement if they are female.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the defined benefit scheme are as follows:

Liability recognised in the balance sheet      (534.3) (541.7)
During the year, the accounting deficit decreased from ¬£541.7m at 28 February 2013 to ¬£534.3m at 27 February 2014. The 
principal reason for this gain was due to improved asset performance and the fact that employer contributions exceeded the 
pension expense for the year. These two positive factors were offset by an increase in the defined benefit obligation as a result 
of the reduction in the discount rate.

The fair values of the assets have not materially changed due to the adoption of IFRS 13.
The assumptions in relation to discount rate, inflation and mortality have a significant effect on the measurement of scheme 
liabilities. The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions:
  (Increase)/decrease 
  in liability
  
 
   2014 2013 
   ¬£m ¬£m
Discount rate 
0.25% increase to discount rate     88.0 83.0 
0.25% decrease to discount rate     (88.0) (83.0) 
Inflation 
0.25% increase to inflation rate     (84.0) (80.0) 
0.25% decrease to inflation rate     84.0 80.0 
Life expectancy 
Additional one year increase to life expectancy     (75.0) (70.0)
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant.  
In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the  
sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method (projected unit credit 
method) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet. The methods and 
types of assumption did not change.
1  IAS 19 (revised 2011) has been adopted for the year ended 27 February 2014 and the comparatives for the year ended 28 February 2013 have  
been restated accordingly. Refer to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. 
2 Other relates to assets held in respect of cash and net current assets. 
3  The total of these three items equals the cash paid by the Group as per the consolidated cash flow statement.

Directors‚Äô responsibility for  
the Company financial statements
Statement of directors‚Äô responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the 
directors to prepare Company financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law, the directors have elected to 
prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom accounting standards and applicable law). 
Under company law, the directors must not approve the 
Company financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that 
period. In preparing those Company financial statements,  
the directors are required to:
‚Ä¢	
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
‚Ä¢	
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
‚Ä¢	
state whether applicable UK accounting standards  
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Company financial 
statements; and
‚Ä¢	
prepare the Company financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that  
the Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain  
the Company‚Äôs transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the Company financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They  
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Independent auditor‚Äôs report to the members  
of Whitbread PLC
We have audited the Company financial statements of 
Whitbread PLC for the year ended 27 February 2014 which 
comprise the Balance Sheet and related Notes 1 to 11.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied  
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This Report is made solely to the Company‚Äôs members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken  
so that we might state to the Company‚Äôs members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor‚Äôs  
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility  
to anyone other than the Company and the Company‚Äôs 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this Report,  
or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and of auditor 
As explained more fully in the statement of directors‚Äô 
responsibilities set out on page 136, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the Company financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true  
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on  
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us  
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board‚Äôs Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Company financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the Company financial statements  
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the Company 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment  
of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Company‚Äôs circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the Company financial statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non‚Äìfinancial information in  
the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with  
the audited Company financial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on the Company financial statements
In our opinion the Company financial statements:
‚Ä¢	
give a true and fair view of the state of the Company‚Äôs 
affairs as at 27 February 2014;
‚Ä¢	
have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
‚Ä¢	
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
‚Ä¢	
the part of the directors‚Äô remuneration report to  
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance  
with the Companies Act 2006; and
‚Ä¢	
the information given in the strategic report for the  
financial year for which the consolidated financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Company 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following  
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to  
report to you if, in our opinion:
‚Ä¢	
adequate accounting records have not been kept by  
the parent Company or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
‚Ä¢	
the Company financial statements and part of the directors‚Äô 
remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
‚Ä¢	
certain disclosures of directors‚Äô remuneration specified  
by law are not made; or
‚Ä¢	
we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the consolidated  
financial statements of Whitbread PLC for the year ended  
27 February 2014.

1‚ÄÇBasis of accounting
The financial statements of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 27 February 2014 were authorised for issue by the Board  
of Directors on 28 April 2014.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK  
Accounting Standards.
The Company has taken advantage of the provisions of FRS 1 (revised) which exempts companies which are part of a group  
for which a consolidated cash flow statement is prepared, from preparing a cash flow statement. The required consolidated 
cash flow statement has been included within the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
2‚ÄÇSummary of significant accounting policies
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment. The carrying value of investments are 
reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
3‚ÄÇProfit earned for ordinary shareholders
The profit and loss account of the parent Company is omitted from the Company‚Äôs accounts by virtue of the exemption 
granted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit earned for ordinary shareholders and included in the financial 
statements of the parent Company amounted to ¬£3.2m (2012/13: ¬£5.9m).

Shareholder FAQs
 
Where can I find information about B and C shares?
As outlined in the original Circulars, the Company made  
two separate purchase offers for the B and C shares. There  
will be no further purchase offers. The Company does have 
the right to convert the B and C shares to ordinary shares  
but there is no current intention to do so. The B and C shares 
will continue to attract an annual dividend payment.
How can I find the current share price?
It is easy to keep up to date with the current share price  
at the Company‚Äôs website www.whitbread.co.uk
I have lost my share certificate, how can I get  
a replacement?
If you have lost your certificate please contact the Company 
registrars, Capita Asset Services, on the shareholder helpline 
(0844 855 2327). They will be able to assist you in arranging  
a replacement.
Warning to shareholders ‚Äî boiler room scams
In recent years, many companies have become aware that 
their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls  
or correspondence concerning investment matters. These  
are typically from overseas based ‚Äòbrokers‚Äô who target UK 
shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out to  
be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. 
These operations are commonly known as ‚Äòboiler rooms‚Äô. 
These ‚Äòbrokers‚Äô can be very persistent and extremely 
persuasive, and a 2006 survey by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) reported that the average amount lost  
by investors is around ¬£20,000, with around ¬£200m lost  
in the UK each year.
It is not just the novice investor that has been duped  
in this way; many of the victims had been successfully 
investing for several years. Shareholders are advised  
to be wary of unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares  
at a discount or offers of free company reports. If you  
receive any unsolicited investment advice:
‚Ä¢	
make sure you get the correct name of the person  
or organisation;
‚Ä¢	
check that they are properly authorised by the  
FCA before getting involved by visiting www.fca.org.uk  
and contact the firm using the details on the register;
‚Ä¢	
report the matter to the FCA either by calling  
0800 111 6768 or visiting www.fca.org.uk/scams;
‚Ä¢	
if the calls persist, hang up; and
‚Ä¢	
REMEMBER if it sounds too good to be true,  
it probably is!
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be  
eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong.  
The FCA can be contacted by completing an online form  
at www.fca.org.uk/scams or you can call the FCA Consumer 
Helpline on 0800 111 6768 or Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company 
endorses will be included in Company mailings.
More detailed information on this or similar activity can  
be found on the FCA website, www.fca.org.uk/consumer

 The Costa Foundation 
We don‚Äôt just make coffee; we make a difference 
We‚Äôre committed to looking after coffee‚Äìgrowers and 
that‚Äôs why we established the Costa Foundation in 2007. 
Originally it worked under the registration of Charities  
Trust, an independently registered charity with the  
UK Charity Commission. In 2012 the Costa Foundation 
registered as a stand‚Äìalone charity.
The Costa Foundation was set up to give something  
back to coffee‚Äìgrowing communities and since 2008,  
40 schools or school projects have been completed in 
Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Peru, Uganda 
and Vietnam. At the date of this Report, six projects are  
still under construction and a further six projects have  
been approved and are at the planning stage with 
committed funding in place. This brings the support from 
the Costa Foundation to 52 communities in eight countries.
The Costa Foundation‚Äôs objectives are the relief of  
poverty and the advancement of education, health and 
environmental protection within coffee‚Äìgrowing 
communities and surrounding areas.
The money raised through the Costa Foundation has given 
thousands of children access to education and ensured that 
the people who grow coffee receive the long‚Äìterm support 
needed to ensure sustainable and improved futures.
In 2013/14 alone we raised over ¬£1.5 million as a result  
of dedicated fundraising and generous donations.  
We have an aspiration to provide educational facilities  
to 50,000 children.

 Great Ormond Street Hospital  
 Childr en‚Äô s Charity
Raise a smile and help a child
In May 2012, Whitbread Hotels & Restaurants chose  
Great Ormond Street Hospital Children‚Äôs Charity  
as its long‚Äìterm charity partner.
Each year, Great Ormond Street Hospital responds  
to over 220,000 patient visits from children all over  
the UK who are often suffering from rare, complex  
and life‚Äìthreatening conditions.
The charity needs to raise at least ¬£50 million a year  
to help support the hospital‚Äôs work and the very special 
children it cares for. The hospital is in the process of 
redeveloping and replacing some of its oldest clinical 
buildings so that families can benefit from world class  
care in 21st century facilities and have more space  
to be together at the bedside. 
In June 2013, we announced that Whitbread Hotels  
& Restaurants had pledged ¬£7.5 million towards the 
construction of a new clinical building at Great Ormond 
Street Hospital which is to be called The Premier Inn  
Clinical Building. The building will provide much needed  
new in‚Äìpatient wards, more operating theatres and  
a recovery unit. It will contain a new surgery centre, 
respiratory ward and a specialist ward for children  
with severe forms of arthritis, skin conditions or  
infectious diseases.
At the date of this Report we have raised over  
¬£2.2 million towards the ¬£7.5 million target.

Spirent’s service assurance solutions allow service providers to diagnose, 
troubleshoot and determine how to resolve issues with networks and systems 
within the live network. Service providers rely on Spirent to provide 
centralised and field test tools to improve the quality of service and allow 
technicians to efficiently prevent or resolve issues from the core of the 
network to inside the consumer’s home.

OVERVIEW
chairman’s 
statement
I am pleased to report that Spirent’s adjusted earnings per share increased by 11 per 
cent in 2009 to 6.91 pence, which excludes a non-recurring net tax benefit of 1.80 
pence per share and is after charging 0.20 pence in respect of share-based payment 
and acquired intangible amortisation. Earnings benefited from an increase in operating 
profit of £6.6 million, an improvement of 14 per cent, but this was partially offset by  
an increase in the rate of tax charged for the year.
These results reflect the trend of improvement seen in the past several years as  
the Company’s management team implements its strategic plan and effectively  
deploys resources. An increase in gross profit margin and careful cost control improved 
the operating profit margin to 20 per cent for the Group as a whole. In our largest 
business, Performance Analysis, the operating profit margin increased to 25 per cent, 
market share increased, and our new product portfolio is well aligned with the 
segments of the market that we expect will exhibit the fastest growth.
In the fourth quarter of 2009 market conditions improved noticeably, resulting in 
bookings exceeding sales by 29 per cent for the period, whereas bookings were 
somewhat lower than sales for the first three quarters of the year. Accordingly, we 
expect a positive start to 2010.
The Group’s financial position remains strong with cash generation for 2009 that 
exceeded earnings excluding the effect of the non-recurring tax benefit. In these 
circumstances the Board is recommending a final dividend of 0.66 pence per share 
compared with 0.60 pence per share in 2008.
Gerard Eastman who joined the Board in 2006 is retiring at the Annual General 
Meeting and the Board would like to express its thanks for his many thoughtful 
contributions. I will also retire from the Board at the Annual General Meeting and  
I am resigning as Chairman with effect from 4 March 2010.
The Board has appointed Alex Walker, who has been a director since 2006, to be 
Chairman. With the continuing participation of Alex, the other non-executive board 
members, and the management team led by Bill Burns I have every confidence that the 
Company is in the best possible hands. I would like to express my sincere thanks to all 
of my colleagues at Spirent, with whom it is a great privilege to have been associated.
“In the fourth quarter of 
2009 market conditions 
improved noticeably.”

chief e xecutive 
officer’s review
Over the last several years, we have seen significant change across the communications 
industry. Large and small enterprises, as well as consumers, are now demanding 
anytime, anywhere, always-on internet access with increased levels of quality of 
experience from the numerous applications they use everyday. New mobile devices 
are driving the need for faster wireless networks such as LTE, while downloadable 
applications are increasing both revenue and customer loyalty. Examples include the 
extraordinary growth in smartphone usage, the introduction of affordable netbook and 
tablet devices and the download of billions of applications from online stores. 
Service providers have shifted their focus to address the ever increasing demand  
for wireless access, applications delivery and new enterprise offerings such as cloud 
computing. To meet these growing demands, service providers must manage an 
increased level of complexity driven by the integration of legacy wireline, next-
generation wireless and outsourced Content Delivery Networks. Equipment 
manufacturers have responded by moving resources to growth markets such as 
smartphones, higher speed wireless networks and the evolution of enterprise data 
centers with Ethernet as the transport technology of choice. As a market leader in 
communications test and measurement, all of these areas represent significant 
opportunities for Spirent. 
We have transformed the business in a number of key areas to capitalise on  
these changing market conditions. We have rationalised the organisational structure, 
consolidated the supply chain and concentrated on driving cost out of all aspects of  
the business. We closely monitor the trends in our industry, strategically reallocating 
our resources to address growing and emerging markets. Currently, Spirent is delivering 
the industry’s most innovative solutions in Ethernet, wireless, applications and  
security testing — the areas that matter most to service providers and equipment 
manufacturers. The breadth and depth of our solutions portfolio, combined with our 
global reach, make Spirent uniquely positioned to address the changing needs of the 
communications test and measurement market. 
Through this transformation, we have revitalised Spirent’s strategy prioritising 
innovation, time to market and, most importantly, profitable growth. In 2009, we 
released more new and innovative solutions to the market than at any time in our 
history. Examples include the introduction of test solutions for 10/40/100 Gigabit 
Ethernet, virtualization inside the data center, and LTE devices and infrastructure,  
that have expanded our market leadership within test and measurement. 
Our customers along with several of the industry’s largest publications, conferences 
and research firms, Frost & Sullivan, Interop and Fortune among others, have 
recognised our accomplishments with a variety of awards. Our market leadership, new 
product innovation, commitment to excellence and service to customers has resulted in 
a strong 2009 financial performance. Throughout the year, we gained market share and 
outperformed our competitors in revenue and profitability. 
Despite the challenging macro economic environment in 2009, as the year 
progressed operating conditions improved noticeably, and customers began to move 
from cost saving to investing for the future. The alignment of our solutions portfolio 
with customers’ areas of investment drove increased order activity in the second half 
of the year. These improved conditions meant that the fourth quarter saw bookings 
exceeding sales by 29 per cent.
This recovery makes us optimistic for the coming year. We will continue to manage 
costs thoughtfully as the economy recovers. Our goal is to outpace the market recovery 
and grow market share with the key objective of top-line growth that will drive 
increased profitability. We have seen a solid start to 2010 and we aim to continue this 
positive momentum as the year progresses.
“The breadth and depth of 
our solutions portfolio, 
combined with our global 
reach, make Spirent uniquely 
positioned to address the 
changing needs of the 
communications test and 
measurement market.”

description of 
our business
The Spirent Group is organised into two business areas: 
Communications and Systems. The Communications business 
comprises two divisions: Performance Analysis, providing test 
solutions for wireline and wireless technologies in the lab, and 
Service Assurance, providing network monitoring and field test 
solutions for live networks.
Spirent Communications provides solutions to enable the world to communicate 
faster, better, and more reliably. We develop innovative test solutions for the 
engineers working within the communications industry allowing them to evaluate 
the performance of the latest technologies to be deployed across the worldwide 
telecommunications infrastructure. We also provide tools for service technicians and 
field test engineers to improve network quality and make troubleshooting of live 
networks efficient and effective.
Network equipment manufacturers and service providers face numerous challenges 
associated with bringing products and services from the lab to the commercial 
marketplace. Spirent’s Performance Analysis division allows equipment and mobile 
device manufacturers, service providers, enterprises and government entities to 
holistically test and benchmark the performance of networks, elements and services 
accelerating the deployment of these innovations into the market. 
Spirent provides the ability to conduct functional, conformance, interoperability, 
scalability and quality of experience testing under real-world conditions inside and 
outside the lab. This capability, across the entire product lifecycle from concept 
inception to use in commercially available scenarios, helps shorten the product 
development cycle, improve the quality of new services, and reduce the cost and  
risk associated with such efforts. 
Spirent delivers wireline and wireless solutions which address high speed Ethernet, 
data center, IMS, IPTV, location based services, LTE, Multi-GNSS satellites, 3G wireless 
and other emerging technologies.
Spirent’s service assurance solutions allow service providers to diagnose, 
troubleshoot and determine how to resolve issues with networks and systems within 
the live network all the way to the home. By leveraging the expertise gained by testing 
technologies and systems in the lab, Spirent enables service providers to deploy and 
maintain efficient, cost effective and high performing networks. As a result, network 
operators enjoy reduced churn by providing a higher quality of experience which 
ultimately increases subscriber retention. Additionally, our test solutions allow  
service providers to reduce operational costs through better identification of potential 
network problems and the use of the appropriate resources to address and correct 
those challenges.
Systems is a leading supplier of sophisticated electronic control systems for 
electrically powered vehicles in the mobility and industrial markets. These include 
medical vehicles such as powered wheelchairs and mobility scooters as well as 
industrial vehicles such as floor cleaning equipment, fork-lift trucks, aerial access 
platforms and golf carts.

…in action
Verizon Wireless selects Spirent for LTE 
device testing solutions
Verizon Wireless has chosen Spirent as 
the first provider of testing solutions for 
the certification of devices for use on 
Verizon’s 4G/LTE network. Spirent test 
equipment will help Verizon assure that 
LTE devices live up to their performance 
expectations with the industry’s first LTE 
and multi-mode (LTE with CDMA or UMTS) 
device performance platform. Spirent 
helps Verizon control operational expenses 
and maximise revenues from new 
LTE services.
Spirent ranked global market leader for 
Ethernet testing
During 2009 Spirent was recognised as 
the market leader for Ethernet testing by 
research firm Frost & Sullivan. This top 
ranking, according to the firm’s World 
Gigabit Ethernet Test Equipment Market 
report, reflects the sale by Spirent of 
more Ethernet test ports than any 
other vendor.
Spirent’s portfolio of test solutions is 
the most comprehensive on the market 
extending from the lab to the live network 
and into the subscriber’s home. Service 
providers and equipment manufacturers 
across the globe continue to depend on 
Spirent to test the complexities of  
today’s high speed Ethernet equipment 
and networks.
Spirent preparing enterprises for 
dynamic, terabit-capacity data centers
Spirent introduced the first holistic 
approach to validating the performance  
of data centers designed to support 
virtualized services and converged 
networks. The network performance and 
scale, service availability, system security, 
application quality of experience and 
power efficiency of these new data 
centers can only be validated through a 
holistic test architecture. 
Holistic testing provides a unified Layer 
2—7 test architecture specifically designed 
to test the end-to-end performance of  
10/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet fabrics, Fibre 
Channel over Ethernet convergence, 
virtualized server networking, cloud 
computing-based applications and security.
China Telecom to use Spirent equipment 
for sophisticated mobile device testing 
China Telecom selected Spirent’s mobile 
device test system as the most complete 
and best suited to help the service 
provider continue to offer its subscribers 
the highest quality of experience. By 
ensuring the mobile devices it sells to 
subscribers comply with industry 
standards as well as offer the highest 
application service quality, China Telecom 
gains a competitive edge in the fiercely 
contested Chinese wireless market. 09 08 07

Ratio of orders booked to revenue billed, 
which is a measure of the strength of our 
future revenues. 
Growth in revenue is a measure of how we 
are growing our business organically. Our 
goal is to achieve year-on-year growth, 
although this aim has been particularly 
challenging in 2009. Nonetheless our focus 
has been on increasing our market share 
and growing our new product revenues, 
which are some of the key components of 
our strategy.
Gross profit as a percentage of revenue is 
a measure of our profitability. We seek to 
maximise our gross margin through 
operational excellence in all aspects of 
our business.
Operating profit before share-based 
payment and acquired intangible 
amortisation is the measure used to 
evaluate the overall performance of the 
Group as well as each of our operating 
segments. Our goal is to achieve year-on-
year organic growth.
The ratio has increased to 102 during the 
year and this reflects the innovation in 
product solutions offered by the Company 
and improving demand levels seen in the 
fourth quarter of 2009.
Revenue for the Group for 2009 increased 
by 6 per cent in sterling terms and was 
down 10 per cent in constant currencies. 
This result was in line with our 
expectations. During 2009 we have 
increased our market share in our key 
Performance Analysis division and have 
seen increased demand for our products 
in growing and emerging markets.
Gross profit margin improved in 2009 to 
66.3 per cent from 64.6 per cent in 2008. 
There has been an improving trend over a 
number of years achieved through 
increased efficiency, redesign and 
outsourcing activities. Gross margin has 
also been positively affected by an 
increasing proportion of software revenue.
In 2009 Spirent reported an increase in 
operating profit of 11 per cent in sterling 
terms; at constant currencies Group 
operating profit was down by 8 per cent. 
Having the ability to adapt to the changing 
market dynamics has been key in 2009 in 
order for Spirent to maintain profitability 
whilst enabling our commitment to 
innovation to be preserved.
Spirent has identified the following key performance indicators (“KPIs”) that it believes 
are useful in assessing how the Group is performing against its strategic aims. Our 
strategy focuses on medium to long term growth and therefore its achievement cannot 
just be measured by looking at our performance in 2009 compared to the prior year, 
trends over a number of years must also be considered. The Group does not currently 
utilise any non-financial KPIs. 09 08 07

(%)
Adjusted basic earnings per share
(pence)
Free cash flow 
(£ million)
Operating profit before share-based 
payment and acquired intangible 
amortisation as a percentage of revenue  
is a measure of our profitability. We strive 
to achieve best in class operating returns 
for our industry.
Earnings per share (“EPS”) is the amount 
of earnings attributable to each share in 
issue. Adjusted EPS excludes exceptional 
items, net of any related tax, and prior 
year tax which enables period-on-period 
comparisons to be made of our 
performance. We aim to achieve growth 
in adjusted EPS year-on-year.
Free cash flow is operating cash flow 
after tax, net interest and net capital 
expenditure. We focus on cash generation 
as a measure of the quality of our 
earnings and our aim is to achieve a high 
conversion of profit into cash each year. 
We have improved return on sales from 
19.7 per cent in 2008 to 20.8 per cent in 
2009. This has been achieved through 
efficiency gains, improved gross margins 
and control of overhead expenses. These 
operating returns are some of the best in 
our industry.
Adjusted EPS was 6.91 pence for 2009 
an improvement of 11 per cent on the 
prior year. In 2009 EPS has also been 
adjusted for a deferred tax credit arising 
on a change in estimate of deferred tax 
recovery of £13.8 million.

our principal 
risks and 
uncertainties
risk and potential impact mitigation actions
Macro economic and industry sector
In common with most businesses Spirent is exposed to the current 
economic conditions. We are particularly exposed to conditions in 
the telecommunications sector into which we sell many of our 
products and services.
Having the ability to adapt to changing market dynamics is key 
in order to minimise the effects of adverse economic or 
sector conditions. 
Our businesses closely monitor both market and geographic 
trends so that we are in a position to take timely actions to 
protect profitability where possible.
Technological change 
As Spirent sell solutions in industries that are characterised by 
rapid technological changes, keeping at the forefront of these 
technologies is critical to our success and in ensuring that we 
remain competitive in our markets. Bringing these new 
solutions to market at the right time for our customers is also 
key to our success as well as ensuring that our solutions 
portfolio is aligned with their needs.
We continue to make significant investment in product 
development and in 2009 £47.5 million, being 17.5 per cent 
of revenue, was invested. 
We work closely with customers and remain focused on their 
requirements and believe we are investing in areas that 
represent their future. 
Our value proposition is based on our service, expertise and 
product breadth.
Reliance on contract manufacturers
We use contract manufacturers for the manufacture of a 
substantial amount of our products. Disruption or financial 
problems of contract manufacturers or limitations in the 
manufacturing capacity at contract manufacturers could either 
limit supply or increase our costs.
We work closely with our contract manufacturers and 
maintain a regular on-site presence. To minimise the effect 
on supply that could be caused by disruption at contract 
manufacturers there are contingency plans in place to 
transfer manufacturing to other locations.
Business continuity risks 
Operational risks are present in the Group’s businesses. These 
risks include the risk of failed internal and external processes 
and systems, human error and external events, such as a 
natural disaster. For example a significant portion of our 
communications operations are located in California which has 
in the past experienced natural disasters, including 
earthquakes and wildfires.
An important component of Spirent’s corporate governance is 
its integrated risk management strategy and its regular self 
assessment of risks encompassing all business units. Part of 
this process is to ensure that the risks of disruption to the 
business are identified, monitored and controlled wherever 
possible as well as arranging appropriate insurance cover.
We conduct regular risk reviews to identify the major risks in the business which may 
affect our operating and financial performance and where possible put in place 
mechanisms to mitigate them. Significant risks are reviewed by the Board and the Audit 
Committee. It is not possible to identify every risk that could affect the business, and 
the actions described below to mitigate those risks cannot provide absolute assurance 
that the risk will not occur and/or adversely affect the operating or financial 
performance of the Group. These processes are more fully described in the Directors’ 
statement on corporate governance. 
The principal risks and uncertainties which the directors believe are currently faced by 
Spirent Communications plc are discussed below. BUSINESS REVIEW

Retention and recruitment of key staff
Spirent is its employees. So attracting and retaining highly 
qualified and skilled employees is essential in enabling us to 
deliver on our strategy and to the success of our business.
We aim to find, keep and engage the highest calibre of 
employees and encourage their contribution and 
development. An environment that fosters innovation and 
collaboration is critical to Spirent’s success. Appropriate 
career paths and internal recognition programmes are 
developed for both technical and non-technical staff.
Intellectual property
Spirent’s success is dependent in part on proprietary 
technology which may be infringed by others inadvertently  
or otherwise. 
We may inadvertently infringe the intellectual property rights 
of third parties.
We have active intellectual property protection programmes 
in place to obtain appropriate intellectual property 
protection in a cost effective manner. 
There are procedures in the development of new products 
that include consideration of intellectual property rights of 
third parties. We also consult internal and external legal 
counsel experienced in intellectual property matters.
Exchange rate
Spirent conducts operations globally and accordingly the value 
of revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities will be affected 
by fluctuations of the pound sterling, the reporting currency, 
against the currency in which these are denominated. The 
principal currency to which we are exposed is the US dollar.
Currency exposures also arise from trading transactions 
undertaken by the Group’s operations in foreign currencies.
The Group does not enter into instruments to hedge the 
translation exposure of the operating results or net assets of 
its overseas subsidiaries as these are considered accounting 
and not cash exposures. 
Where currency exposures on trading do not naturally offset, 
forward foreign currency exchange contracts are put in place 
by Group treasury to hedge the transactions. Spirent Communications plc

Performance Analysis
Market conditions
The year ended with a welcome positive change in customer confidence. This followed 
the return to stability during the third quarter of the year, after the difficult conditions 
in the first two quarters. Customer sentiment has now changed from cost management 
to investing for the future, a positive trend which has continued into the first quarter 
of 2010.
Service providers have increased their investments in higher speed Ethernet to 
support an increase in broadband and wireless traffic as well as advanced applications 
such as cloud computing. Network equipment manufacturers have shifted their 
investments accordingly to developing platforms that support higher speed Ethernet 
and backhaul of mobile generated data traffic in greater scale than ever before. In 
addition, we have seen an increase in development spending on next-generation 
enterprise solutions. These investments promise more application aware networks and 
the support of multiple technologies in the data center such as virtualization and cloud 
computing. Spirent is benefiting from all of these trends through its diverse solutions 
portfolio of test and measurement products and services.
Customers are continually seeking ways to optimise their investments in product 
development, and in turn are looking for increased value from test and measurement 
tools. This has led to a shift in demand from single technology test products to 
solutions that can handle multiple technology scenarios leveraging a single hardware 
and software architecture. As a result Spirent TestCenter™ has emerged as the Layer 
2—7 test solution of choice for the market. We have seen a strong increase in demand 
for 10 Gigabit Ethernet (“GbE”) interface modules in 2009 with customers requesting 
price reductions due to the increase in volume purchases. We have proactively met this 
challenge by adopting new technologies which increase port density and lower the 
overall cost per port. Automation is also playing a key role in driving improvement in 
time to market and efficiency for our customers. Spirent is leading the way with its 
automation solutions through its participation in industry wide automation initiatives.
Growth in wireless communication driven by the needs of consumers and businesses 
for anytime, anywhere internet access is accelerating the adoption of new technologies 
and the development of complex scenarios such as converged wireless and wireline 
networks. As a result we are experiencing strong demand for our UMTS and LTE 
wireless communication test solutions. At the same time, CDMA wireless technology 
began to show signs of expected weakness, although the effect of this was masked by  
a few large contract wins during the year. As a leader in testing wireless devices and 
infrastructure, Spirent continues to apply its innovations to meet the ever evolving 
needs of wireless customers. 
The market for test equipment in the positioning sector experienced a sharp decline 
in 2009. This was the result of many factors including reduced US government spending 
“Customer sentiment has 
now changed from cost 
management to investing 
for the future, a positive 
trend which has continued 
into the first quarter of

and a significant reduction in manufacturing production volumes as sales of consumer 
end products fell as the market paused, waiting for the development of devices that 
can leverage multiple global navigation satellite systems. We expect a recovery in the 
positioning test market in 2010.
Revenue
Performance Analysis revenues grew by a reported 6 per cent in sterling, masking a 
9 per cent decrease in constant currency for the full year 2009. However, the rate of 
decrease moderated in the fourth quarter. More importantly order intake for the fourth 
quarter grew by 17 per cent over the same period in 2008 in constant currency. 
Regionally we saw continued growth in Asia, particularly in China, with recovery 
coming in North America at the end of the year.
As customers assessed their investment priorities, they cut back on legacy product 
enhancements and shifted to new technology development. Almost all of the decrease 
in revenue in 2009 can be attributed to the decline in legacy test solution spending. 
Looking forward this is expected to have less of an impact, as legacy products now only 
account for 11 per cent of Performance Analysis revenue.
Spirent secured significant wins in the year as a result of new product introductions 
and selling initiatives. We enabled service providers and network equipment 
manufacturers to test the interoperability and scalability of the emerging LTE enhanced 
packet core. In addition, sales of our high density 10GbE ports were up nearly two fold. 
Meanwhile in Asia and North America we won orders for our 40/100GbE test solutions. 
Important sales were made throughout the year to service providers and network 
equipment manufacturers who are focused on virtualization, cloud computing inside 
the data center and delivery of applications to enterprise and consumers.
Revenue growth in our wireless business was exceptionally strong in 2009. Overall 
3G/UMTS test solutions saw solid growth during the year. The continued build out of 
enhanced wireless data networks by CDMA carriers such as China Telecom and Verizon 
Wireless drove demand for test solutions. The rapid increase in sales and deployment of 
3G smartphones has increased the complexity of testing these devices for both the 
wireless network operators as well as the device manufacturers. Furthermore, we 
became the supplier of choice for the mobile LTE device test for Verizon, a major US 
service provider, and their ecosystem of device suppliers. The emphasis on creating 
“real-world” conditions while testing in a controlled environment in the laboratory 
increased demand for fader products. Positioning products saw reduced revenues as  
a result of lower demand due to macro economic conditions in 2009, but fundamental 
long term positive trends continue to exist.
Profitability
Performance Analysis profits increased by a reported 11 per cent; excluding currency 
effects profits decreased by 5 per cent. Control of overheads led to a reduction of 
£12.7 million in constant currency terms, offsetting the 9 per cent decrease in revenue. 
Return on sales for the year was 24.7 per cent compared to 23.5 per cent for 2008, with 
the second half year seeing return on sales increase to 28.2 per cent. The benefits of 
improved design for manufacture, supply chain efficiencies and proactive product cost 
reduction measures through advancement in technology and density, offset price 
pressures to give an increase in gross margin of 0.6 percentage points over 2008. 
Product development
New product innovation, technical leadership and working closely with our customers 
to bring test solutions to market at the right time to meet demand are key contributors 
to Spirent’s success. Spirent has transformed itself into an organisation that can rapidly 
address the ever changing conditions in our target markets. Spirent today is more 
efficient and at the same time more agile than it has ever been. Industry recognition 
for innovation in our test solutions continues to demonstrate the Company’s leadership 
position.
We delivered a series of new products in 2009 to serve our customers. Spirent 
TestCenter remained the leader in high speed Ethernet testing through the addition of 
our high density 10GbE module as well as the industry’s highest performing 40/100GbE 
solution. In addition, we delivered the industry’s first solution to holistically test the 
enterprise data center and enhanced the performance of our integrated application

performance test platform. We also released new protocols to support mobile backhaul 
and introduced our LTE enhanced packet core performance test capability. 
For 2010, we will continue to enhance our high speed Ethernet offerings on Spirent 
TestCenter while we further incorporate additional data center, applications and mobile 
backhaul capabilities into the platform. In addition, we will dramatically increase the 
performance and usability of application test solutions and support increased scalability 
and standards in our LTE packet core testing platform. 
Wireless test solutions delivered in 2009 addressed the requirements of 3G and  
4G/LTE testing needs. For our 3G customers we enhanced our testing capabilities to 
better simulate real-world conditions inside a controlled lab environment. Recreation 
and playback in the lab of data captured in the live wireless network using the virtual 
drive test functionality of our faders allowed customers to do more real-world testing in 
the lab at a lower cost than ever before. For the wireless network operators who are 
deploying higher speed data on CDMA our upgrades have enabled them to more 
effectively test the roll out of new devices. For UMTS customers we have expanded 
test coverage with our device library test solution that provides developers with a user 
controllable bench-top UMTS wireless network to test their hardware or software. In 
2009 Spirent also delivered its first LTE device test solutions focused on radio frequency 
and data performance testing requirements.
In 2010, our wireless test solutions will expand to address the ever increasing market 
requirements of wireless testing. In particular, new Global Navigation Satellite Systems 
such as GLONASS will drive the need for wireless device test solutions that combine 
this technology with existing GPS capabilities. The further growth of smartphones and 
other “data-hungry” devices on the 3G/CDMA and UMTS networks will drive the need 
for testing high speed data solutions. LTE will require improved and expanded antenna 
testing by deploying techniques such as Multiple Input Multiple Output Over-the-Air 
testing, and increase the testing needs to include mobility and location based services. 
The ubiquity of positioning technology is also expected to expand in 2010, as consumer 
applications utilising global satellite navigation continue to grow.
We deliver testing solutions that address emerging and growing communication 
technologies. The desire for anytime, anywhere internet access coupled with the 
growing demand for increased bandwidth is driving the convergence of wireline and 
wireless technologies across the communications industry creating new opportunities 
for test and measurement products, solutions and services.
Service Assurance
Market conditions
As expected, market conditions remained challenging throughout 2009 for both the 
service assurance and field test markets. In the first half of the year we saw caution 
around operational and capital spending by service providers across all segments of our 
business. However, in the second half year we began to see indications of increased 
demand for carrier Ethernet service assurance and triple play field test solutions. 
Several factors are driving carrier investment in these areas which include increased 
competition, the complexity in the access network and a move towards the improved 
efficiency of their field engineers. 
Specifically, we have added new customers throughout North America and Europe 
for 1G and 10G centralised test and performance solutions for the enterprise business 
services and wireless backhaul markets. Spirent’s next-generation field test unit, 
Tech-X Flex, has sold into major North American service providers and cable multiple 
system operators for in-home testing as service providers have begun to launch new 
advanced services such as multi-room digital video recording. 
For 2010, we expect to see moderate growth in carrier Ethernet service assurance 
and triple play field test solutions. This growth is being driven by increased demand for 
more efficient and lower cost carrier Ethernet services for business and advanced 
residential triple play offerings. Spirent is well positioned to take advantage of these 
new areas of spend within cable multiple system operators, wireline, and wireless 
service providers. BUSINESS REVIEW

Revenue
Service Assurance revenues declined by 14 per cent in constant currency year-on-year, 
as expected, as service providers continued to reduce spend on legacy and DSL 
solutions. Growth in 10GbE monitoring devices was strong and demand for monitoring 
for cable multiple system operators was robust, but this did not offset legacy decline. 
The second half year saw much more robust order intake, which gives confidence that 
revenues will stabilise in 2010.
Profitability
While the Service Assurance business saw a decline in revenue in 2009 in constant 
currency, the business was able to maintain profitability through increased efficiency 
and continued cost management.
Product development
The division continues to focus on the development of service assurance and field test 
solutions for next-generation networks. In 2009, new 1GbE and 10GbE service assurance 
solutions were launched for Ethernet business services and 3G/4G wireless backhaul. 
In addition, we completed the development on several new modules for the Tech-X 
Flex field test product line providing us with a complete suite of “in-home” and 
“outside the home” test capabilities for the service provider and cable multiple system 
operator markets.

The Systems group comprises PG Drives Technology, a leading supplier of control 
systems for electrically powered medical and small industrial vehicles. The business 
was affected by the global recession, particularly on industrial sales, but less so 
on medical mobility despite changes in US government healthcare funding for 
powered wheelchairs. 
At constant currency revenue was down 5 per cent and operating profit by 23 per 
cent. Nevertheless, the exchange rate benefit was more than enough to offset the 
effects of the recession on sales and profit, but as we were hedged for much of the 
year at $1.83:£1 we were unable to take full advantage of this effect.
During 2009 we introduced new products for scooters and wheelchairs and in  
spite of the recession made good progress in growing market share in the industrial 
market segment. 
In 2010, we plan to introduce several significant new products which will include 
new systems for powered wheelchairs and also industrial vehicles. In addition, we will 
continue to take advantage of operational cost improvements through design and by 
placing more production into China, which also supports our activities in the Asia 
Pacific region. The US dollar to sterling exchange rate has moved significantly in our 
favour and this should benefit our results in 2010.

Revenue
Revenue in sterling terms was up 6 per cent compared with 2008. Excluding the 
benefits of exchange rates, the change was a decrease of 10 per cent which was a solid 
performance in a challenging economic environment. During 2009 we have increased 
our market share in our key Performance Analysis division and have seen increased 
demand for our products in growing and emerging markets.
Spirent’s revenues are predominantly denominated in US dollars and therefore the 
lower average US dollar:sterling exchange rate this year has had a marked positive 
effect on these results, increasing reported revenue by £38.9 million compared with 
2008. There was sequential growth of 3 per cent in revenue in constant currency for 
the second half of 2009 compared with the first half as we started to see some 
recovery in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
The geographic profile of revenue did not change significantly with revenue in  
US dollars down in most markets with the exception of China where revenue grew  
8 per cent.

The book to bill ratio, which is a measure of the strength of our future revenues, grew 
to 102 for the year compared with 98 for 2008 and in the second half it was at 112, 
reflecting the stronger order intake in the fourth quarter. Order intake for the year 
at constant currencies was down 6 per cent compared with the prior year. For 
the fourth quarter there was growth of 18 per cent compared with the fourth 
quarter of 2008.
Operating profit
Reported operating profit was £55.3 million compared with £48.7 million in 2008, an 
increase of 14 per cent in sterling terms. Operating profit before share-based payment 
and acquired intangible amortisation, which is the measure of profit used by the Group 
to evaluate performance, improved by 11 per cent to £56.6 million compared with

£50.9 million in 2008. Exchange benefited this result by £9.7 million, compared to 2008; 
at constant currencies operating profit is down 8 per cent. 
Spirent’s ability to adapt to changing market dynamics has been key in 2009 in 
enabling profitability to be maintained and allowing the funding of innovation in 
products and solutions to be preserved. In 2009 we realised annualised cost reductions 
of £11.3 million, announced at the interim stage, at a cost of £1.0 million which was 
expensed in the year. 
We have improved our return on sales from 19.7 per cent in 2008 to 20.8 per cent in 
2009. The Group’s returns are some of the best in our industry. 
Currency impact
As previously mentioned the weakening of sterling in the latter part of 2008 against all 
the major currencies resulted in a significant change to the average US dollar:sterling 
exchange rate used to translate Spirent’s results in 2009 compared with that for 2008. 
The average exchange rate decreased from 1.85 for 2008 to 1.57 for 2009. This 
increased reported revenue by £32.9 million and operating profit by £7.5 million on 
translation. The Group has reduced its exposure to transactional currency risk in some 
of its businesses as it had hedged its full year expected US dollar exposures at the end 
of 2008 at an average rate of $1.76:£1. Transactional currency exposures resulted in an 
increase in reported revenue of £6.0 million and in operating profit of £2.2 million. For 
2010 approximately half of the forecast transactional exposures have been hedged at 
an average rate of $1.57:£1. 
At an exchange rate of $1.60:£1, and based on 2009 results, revenue would be lower 
by approximately £4 million and operating profit by £1 million. For each $0.01 change in 
the $:£ rate earnings per share changes by approximately 0.03 pence.
Cost of sales and operating expenses
We have seen a further improvement in gross margin during 2009, an increase of 1.7 
percentage points, to 66.3 per cent, and in the second half of 2009 we achieved 
67.5 per cent. There has been an improving trend over a number of years achieved 
through cost reduction and outsourcing activities. Gross margin has also been positively 
affected by an increasing proportion of software revenue. 
The development of new innovative test solutions is critical to the success of our 
business and product development forms a substantial amount of our overall costs. We 
work closely with our customers and remain focused on their requirements and are 
investing in areas that represent their future. Product development expense in 2009 
increased from £45.3 million in 2008 to £47.5 million, but was lower in US dollar terms 
and marginally lower as a percentage of revenue, dropping to 17.5 per cent from 17.6 
per cent of sales in 2008. The majority of this spend, £38.7 million (2008 £37.8 million), 
is for our Performance Analysis division. 
Other operating expenses, which includes share-based payment and acquired 
intangible amortisation, were higher at £77.7 million in 2009 compared with £72.6 
million in 2008, being 28.6 per cent and 28.2 per cent of sales, respectively. The 
absolute increase is principally a result of exchange rate translation effect on US dollar 
operating expenses of £8.4 million, plus the losses on exchange rate hedging of £3.2 
million. This increase has been offset by a lower expense for share-based payment in 
2009 and by cost control.
Exceptional items
There were no exceptional items in 2009. In 2008 £0.8 million of exceptional finance 
income was reported in relation to interest received on tax refunds for prior periods. 
An exceptional interest expense of £2.6 million was charged for interest paid on the 
agreement of prior year tax positions with the relevant tax authorities, and a related 
exceptional tax credit of £25.6 million was also recorded.
Intangible amortisation
Operating expense includes a charge of £0.9 million for the amortisation of acquired 
intangibles in 2009, compared to £0.7 million in 2008. There will be a comparable 
charge in 2010.

Share-based payment
The charge for share-based payment for 2009 was just £0.4 
million compared to £1.5 million for 2008. Minimal share-based 
incentives have again been awarded in 2009 and it is expected 
that this charge will remain at a similar level in 2010.
Finance income and costs
The strong cash generation of the Group has boosted the funds 
available for investment but with continuing low interest rates 
finance income was just £0.4 million for 2009 compared with 
£3.2 million for 2008, excluding exceptional interest referred to 
above. Surplus funds are held in short term bank deposits in the 
UK and US and earn market rates of interest. 
Finance cost of £1.6 million includes £1.1 million in respect of 
the defined benefit pension plan, being the expected return on 
pension plan assets less the interest charge on the unwinding of 
the liabilities. This item has reduced from £0.1 million of income 
in 2008, a result of reduced returns and asset values compared 
with the prior year. It is expected that the charge for the 
pension plan will be approximately the same for 2010. The 
remainder of the interest charge relates to the unwind of the 
discount on leasehold provisions of £0.2 million (2008 £0.3 million) 
and bank fees of £0.3 million (2008 £0.2 million).
Profit before tax 
Reported profit before tax was £54.1 million compared with 
£49.6 million for 2008. There were no adjustments to the 
reported numbers in 2009. In 2008 there was an adjustment for 
the net exceptional interest charge of £1.8 million, giving an 
adjusted profit before tax of £51.4 million.
T ax
The Group has reported a tax credit for 2009 of £4.0 million 
(2008 £25.2 million credit). This includes the benefit of £13.8 
million for a change in estimate in respect of the recovery of 
deferred tax assets. An exceptional tax credit arising on the 
agreement of prior year tax positions benefited 2008. Excluding 
the deferred tax credit and prior year tax charged of £1.8 million 
(2008 £30.5 million credit including exceptional items), the 
current year tax charge for the Group was £8.0 million in 2009 
(2008 £5.3 million). This gives an effective rate of 14.8 per cent 
for 2009 (2008 10.3 per cent).
There is now sufficient evidence under accounting standards 
to require further recognition of deferred tax assets in 2009 in 
relation to unutilised tax losses and temporary differences. At  
31 December 2009 deferred tax assets amounting to £26.4 
million have been recognised on the balance sheet (31 December 
2008 £12.2 million). At 31 December 2009 there are deferred  
financial 
review continued
tax assets amounting to a tax value of £19.1 million which  
remain unrecognised in respect of unutilised non-trading loan 
relationship losses (£17.5 million) and temporary differences  
(£1.6 million) (31 December 2008 £37.2 million). 
Having recognised the benefit of tax losses brought forward 
the future tax charge is expected to result in an increase in the 
effective rate. For 2010 it is expected that the effective tax rate 
will be in the region of 34 per cent.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share for the Group was 8.71 pence for 2009 
compared with 10.13 pence for 2008. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share, before exceptional items, 
net of any related tax and prior year tax, and also excluding in 
2009 the benefit of the deferred tax credit of £13.8 million 
referred to above, was 6.91 pence compared with 6.24 pence for 
2008. This was an improvement of 11 per cent year-on-year. 
Weighted average Ordinary Share capital was 667.0 million 
shares compared with 738.5 million for 2008, reduced by the 
substantial share repurchases in 2008. At the year end the shares 
in issue ranking for dividend were 672.2 million.
Financial risk management
The key objective of the Group treasury department is to 
manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that 
sufficient liquidity is available to the Group. All treasury activity 
operates within a formal control framework. The Board has 
approved treasury policies and guidelines and periodically 
reviews treasury activities. Additionally, it is the Group’s policy 
that speculative treasury transactions are expressly forbidden.
Spirent’s financial risk management objectives and policies 
and its exposure to risks are discussed in note 26 of Notes to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Financing and cash flow
Cash and cash equivalents increased to £108.0 million at 
31 December 2009 compared with £59.7 million at 31 December 
2008. The Group continues to be debt free, and the undrawn 
£25 million three-year working capital facility which was put in 
place in 2008, was cancelled by the Company in 2009. The 
majority of the cash is held in bank deposits in the UK and US. 
Currency translation has decreased cash and cash equivalents 
by £2.2 million.
Operating activities generated £61.2 million in the year 
compared with £47.7 million in 2008. Free cash flow is set  
out below:
£ million   2009 2008
Cash flow from operations    67.7 53.4

Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2009
21
Free cash flow was £55.1 million for 2009, which represents 
95 per cent of reported earnings. Adjusting for the one-time 
deferred tax credit of £13.8 million, which was a non-cash  
item in 2009, the conversion ratio is 124 per cent. For 2008  
the conversion percentage was 86 per cent, adjusting for 
exceptional items.
Tax payments increased in 2009 to £6.5 million compared 
with £5.7 million in 2008. The Group is returning to more normal 
levels of tax payment as brought forward tax losses which had 
been available for set off against taxable profits are now 
substantially utilised.
Net interest received was lower at £0.4 million compared 
with £1.4 million in 2008 affected by the reduction in returns on 
bank deposits and in 2008 includes £1.8 million of net interest 
due on the prior year tax settlements.
Net capital expenditure for the Group was lower at £6.5 
million in 2009 (2008 £6.9 million). This was well below the 
depreciation charge of £8.6 million (2008 £8.8 million). With 
most manufacturing now outsourced, the Group’s capital 
investment requirements continue to be low.
Cash outflow for on-market share repurchases amounted to 
£0.7 million in 2009 (2008 £67.2 million). An inflow of £2.4 million 
was received from the exercise of employee share incentives 
(2008 £2.4 million).
In 2009 the Group settled the final dividend of 0.60 pence for 
the year ended 31 December 2008 and paid an interim dividend 
of 0.55 pence per share giving a net dividend outflow of £7.7 
million (2008 £3.7 million).
Finally £1.4 million (2008 £1.2 million) was transferred from 
the long term cash deposit, set up as a consequence of a capital 
reorganisation in 2004, as we settled lease obligations to allow 
release of funds.
Cash inflow for 2009 was £50.5 million compared with an 
outflow of £25.1 million for 2008.
 
Defined benefit pension plans
The accounting valuation of the UK defined benefit pension 
plans at the end of 2009 was based on the data from the 
triennial valuation of the plans at 1 April 2009. At 31 December 
2009 there was a surplus of £0.6 million in one of the plans and a 
deficit in the other of £0.3 million. This compares with a total 
surplus for both plans of £2.6 million at 31 December 2008. The 
market value of the pension plans’ assets has increased in 2009, 
largely due to a recovery in global markets, but this was offset 
by increases in the liabilities resulting from changes to the 
assumptions used to value the liabilities. 
The actuarial valuation at 1 April 2009 has not yet been fully 
finalised; such a valuation involves a complete review of all the 
assumptions including longevity and funding. Once complete it is 
likely that there will be increases to future Company 
contributions, although these are unlikely to be material.
The Group has also reported a liability of £0.4 million (2008 
£0.6 million) in respect of UK unfunded plan liabilities.
Essential contractual arrangements
Spirent uses contract manufacturers for the manufacture of a 
substantial amount of its products. The principal contract 
manufacturer is Celestica Corporation with which an agreement 
is in place until September 2010. The Company considers that 
this arrangement is essential to its business.
We will negotiate renewal of this contract in advance of 
September 2010.
Capital structure 
On-market share repurchases were recommenced towards the 
end of 2009 with 0.6 million shares being repurchased at a cost 
of £0.6 million. In 2008 £67.0 million of cash was returned to 
shareholders via on-market share repurchases and a tender offer. 
This represented 125.8 million Ordinary Shares. 
Dividend
The Board are recommending the payment of a final dividend for 
2009 of 0.66 pence per share which, with the interim dividend of 
0.55 pence per share paid in September 2009, brings the full 
year dividend to 1.21 pence per share and is covered 5.7 times 
by adjusted earnings. Subject to approval by the shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting, the final dividend will be paid on 6 
May 2010 to Ordinary shareholders on the register at 12 March 
2010. Payment to ADR holders will be made on 13 May 2010. Spirent Communications plc

corpor ate social 
responsibilit y 
statement
Corporate responsibility is integral to the way Spirent conducts 
its business and we are committed to advancing our policies and 
systems across the Group to ensure that we address all aspects 
of corporate social responsibility (“CSR”). These include in 
particular our corporate practices in terms of ethical behaviour, 
our employees, care for the environment and community 
involvement.
The Board takes ultimate responsibility for CSR and is 
committed to developing and implementing appropriate policies 
while adhering to a fundamental commitment to create and 
sustain long term value for shareholders. 
Ethics
Spirent expects that all of its business is conducted in 
compliance with high ethical standards of business practice. We 
apply these standards to all dealings with employees, customers, 
suppliers and other stakeholders. During 2009, Spirent’s 
employees were again clearly reminded of the standards 
expected of them when it refreshed its Vision, Mission and 
Values statements. 
The Group’s Ethics Policy, which has been approved by the 
Board, is available on our website at www.spirent.com. Our 
Ethics Policy has been developed to ensure that the Group’s 
business is conducted in adherence with high ethical and legal 
principles and sets standards of professionalism and integrity for 
all employees and operations worldwide. 
The following is a summary of the Ethics Policy:
all employees have the right and responsibility to ensure that •	
Spirent’s business is conducted with high ethical and legal 
principles;
our policy is to operate within applicable laws; •	
discrimination or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated; •	
as a matter of policy, we do not make political donations; •	
no bribes shall be given or received; •	
conflicts of interest must be avoided; •	
we aim to be a responsible partner within our local •	
communities; and
employees are encouraged and supported to report, in •	
confidence, any suspected wrongdoings (“whistleblowing”).
Appropriate ethical behaviour is reviewed as part of the Group’s 
internal control process.
Employees
Spirent is its employees. The Group aims to find, engage and  
keep the highest calibre of employees and encourages their 
contribution and development. 
An environment that fosters innovation and collaboration is 
critical to the Company’s success. Appropriate career paths and 
internal recognition programmes are developed for both technical 
and non-technical staff. Such a commitment was recognised in 
2009 by Fortune China magazine, where Spirent was found to be 
one of the 20 best companies to work for in China. 
Employees are provided with numerous learning and 
development opportunities to fulfill their potential. For example, 
our US employees enjoy a tax free tuition reimbursement 
benefit for classes taken towards college-level degrees such  
as a master of business administration or master of science in 
electrical engineering. A wide variety of courses and training 
opportunities are also available to employees globally to enhance 
their skills. As another example, Spirent’s North America sales 
team participated in quarterly manager development training as 
well as negotiation skills training.  
These development opportunities are structured to align with 
our organisational objectives and to help employees in  
furthering their career aspirations.
Spirent demonstrates that it values its employees through 
several reward and recognition programmes. One example is our 
President’s Club, which recognises our most exceptional sales 
employees on an annual basis in every geographic region. 
Another way we reward and recognise excellence is through our 
Global Recognition Programme. It is the intention of Spirent to 
recognise and reward both the efforts and results of individual 
accomplishments by employees or managers that provide 
positive results for the organisation. The programme is broken 
down into three types of recognition:
Spot Recognition Award — to provide special recognition of •	
extraordinary achievement;
Excellence Award — to recognise performance or ideas which •	
are tied to the Spirent values and result in significant savings 
or benefit;
Executive Award — to recognise remarkable individual effort •	
at the highest level which contributes to a significant positive 
result.
Similarly, the importance of two-way communication is 
recognised particularly as it relates to the business and its 
performance. The leadership team is responsible for providing 
forums for employees to understand the business objectives and 
to ask questions. A variety of tools are utilised to foster two-way 
communications, including management meetings, “all-hands” 
employee meetings, and the Company’s intranet. BUSINESS REVIEW
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2009
23
Leadership and management development programmes are 
regularly reviewed and updated as the competition for talented 
employees increases and the leadership needs of our business 
grow. Formal performance reviews are conducted annually and 
are linked to the goals of the organisation. 
The Group is committed to providing equality of opportunity 
to all existing and prospective employees without unlawful 
discrimination on the basis of religion, disability, gender, age, 
marital status, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity or any other 
protected status. With regard to employees who become 
disabled, the policy is to take all reasonable steps, including 
retraining, to ensure that they can remain in employment 
wherever practicable. We encourage diversity and opportunity, 
which is reinforced through the Group’s Ethics Policy.
Health and safety
The Chief Financial Officer is the director appointed by the 
Board to have responsibility for the health and safety 
performance of the Group. No major health and safety issues 
were reported by the Chief Financial Officer to the Audit 
Committee and Board during the year.
The health and safety risk profile of the Group improved 
again in 2009 as further Group manufacturing moved to an 
outsourcing model. The main risks of the Group continue to be 
based around final test and assembly of products and working 
environment issues such as ergonomics and Repetitive Strain 
Injury. The Group continued to have very low accident rates in 
2009 and no incidents required any hospitalisation. 
The Group Health and Safety Policy places responsibility for 
the management of health and safety on local management who 
are supported by local external advisers where necessary. It is 
the Group’s intention that each business unit should have a 
senior individual designated as being responsible for ensuring the 
business unit conforms to local statutory health and safety 
regulations as well as the Group Policy. An annual questionnaire 
on health and safety performance is completed by all our 
business units and any issues are addressed and resolved. 
Independent external reviews of the Company’s health and 
safety performance are conducted annually at selected business 
units. Regular designated health and safety awareness training 
programmes are also carried out.
Spirent recognises the importance that health and safety, as 
with other corporate responsibilities, is managed successfully 
throughout all levels of the organisation. Successful health and 
safety management contributes to Spirent’s overall success by 
preserving and developing staff and physical resources, thereby 
reducing costs and liabilities and is an expression of its corporate 
responsibility. All Spirent staff are provided with a written health 
and safety policy and each staff member can make a valuable 
contribution by taking reasonable care of themselves and those 
affected by their actions or omissions. 
Spirent is committed to continually improving its health and 
safety performance and is also committed to employee wellbeing 
by encouraging the adoption of healthier lifestyles by its staff 
members. Regulatory requirements and the outline of care form 
the basis upon which Spirent’s commitment is achieved. By 
realistic planning, review and development, Spirent continues to 
achieve a successful health and safety management programme 
and appropriate resources are made available for this purpose. 
Environmental
Good environmental practice and the impact that our operations 
have on the environment are of great importance to Spirent. The 
main aim of Spirent’s Environmental Policy is to comply with all 
applicable environmental legislation in all jurisdictions in which 
we operate and to adopt responsible environmental practices. 
The full text of our Environmental Policy is available on our 
website at www.spirent.com.
Business units are required to comply with the Group Policy 
and local statutory regulations and are encouraged to set their 
own environmental targets. An annual environmental 
questionnaire is completed by each business unit which highlights 
their environmental performance. The Group’s main 
environmental impact now largely involves the effects produced 
from offices housing employees. Where possible, business units 
monitor energy consumption, water consumption and waste 
production. All business units continue to take positive steps to 
reduce energy consumption, such as better space utilisation, 
more efficient running of equipment and machinery, and sensor 
controlled equipment. Environmental waste management in  
the Group continues to improve with most business units 
operating waste minimisation schemes mainly focusing on 
increased recycling.
The vast majority of our products continue to be 
manufactured by outside contract manufacturers and we check 
the environmental policies of these suppliers through audits and 
surveys. Wherever possible our products are designed and 
manufactured to take account of the recycling and disposal of 
the product at the end of its lifecycle. Our business units comply 
with both The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment 
Regulations and The Batteries Directive. New products are 
designed to meet the Restriction of Hazardous Substances 
Directive (“RoHS”), also known as Directive 2002/95/EC, even 
though Spirent Communications’ hardware products are 
classified as Category Nine, (Monitor and Control Equipment) and 
are therefore currently out of scope with the RoHS Directive. All 
Spirent Communications’ hardware products will be in 
compliance with the RoHS Directive at such time they are 
brought in to scope.        Spirent Communications plc

corpor ate social 
responsibilit y 
statement continued
The vacant site reported on last year where historical activity 
had led to minor land and groundwater contamination is 
continuing to be monitored to confirm that remedial work 
carried out has been successful. We have also been contacted by 
authorities regarding another previously owned property which 
appears to have historical land and groundwater contamination 
and discussions are ongoing.
Community
Spirent aims to build stronger and healthier global communities 
through education, charitable donations and support of non-
profit agencies in the communities in which we operate. Working 
with established non-profit organisations maximises the impact 
of our community building initiatives.
Education
The Group has established links with certain public-private 
non-profit educational organisations to help students develop the 
skills needed to succeed in the global economy. Throughout 2009 
we continued to support education by offering internships and 
work experience programmes. As part of Junior Achievement 
(www.ja.org), 30 Spirent employee volunteers from our 
Germantown, Maryland office spent a day at Patterson 
Elementary School in the inner city of Washington D.C. teaching 
students aged 6 to 12. The programme enabled volunteers to 
teach students financial literacy, work readiness, and 
entrepreneurship. Volunteers served as role models, providing 
both education and inspiration.  
Spirent also periodically provides work experience 
opportunities for local students in our Paignton office,  
where 15 year olds spend a week with our team, visiting each 
department that is of interest to them. In our Beijing office, we  
offered on-site internship opportunities to 13 students from top 
universities in China, including University of Science and 
Technology Beijing. These internships help students develop 
professional knowledge as well as enhance their competitiveness 
in society.
Local community support of non-profit agencies
We recognise the significance of our communities through our 
relationship with local non-profit agencies. Our employees 
help their communities by volunteering their time to various 
programmes and donating materials and equipment to 
local causes.
The Group has formed lasting partnerships with several local 
non-profit organisations to provide essential resources and 
services to those in need. During the winter holiday season in 
2009, our employees in the US participated in a food drive for 
the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank (www.lafightshunger.org).
Charitable Donation Policy
Our businesses are encouraged to support the particular needs 
of their local community by contributing to local charities and 
participating in community initiatives. Support takes the form of 
employee time and skills, gifts in kind and cash donations.
Our Charitable Donation Policy matches employee 
contributions on a regular basis, including employee donations  
to the American Cancer Society’s Relay for Life programme.  
In 2009, Spirent made charitable donations of £91,000  
(2008 £52,000).
Spirent continues to support all of our employees and 
businesses in finding new ways of becoming involved in and 
giving back to their communities. Spirent Communications plc

Annual Report 2009
26
report of the 
directors
The directors present their Annual Report to the shareholders 
together with the audited consolidated financial statements of the 
Group and the parent Company financial statements for the year 
to 31 December 2009.  
Business review
The purpose of the Annual Report is to provide information to 
the shareholders of the Company. 
Reviews of the Group’s activities during the year, the position 
at the year-end and developments since that date are set out  
in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive Officer’s review, 
the Directors’ statement on corporate governance and the 
Business Review.
The Business Review explains financial performance, key 
performance indicators, the position at the year-end, any post 
balance sheet events, any likely future developments and a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
Group and how these are managed.
The Annual Report contains certain forward-looking 
statements with respect to the operations, performance and 
financial condition of the Group. By their nature, these 
statements involve uncertainty since future events and 
circumstances can cause results to differ from those anticipated. 
The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and 
information available at the date of preparation of this Annual 
Report and the Company undertakes no obligation to update 
those forward-looking statements.
Principal activities
The principal activities of the Group are set out on page 7 of this 
Annual Report.
Results and dividends
The consolidated income statement is on page 42. Profit for the 
financial year attributable to equity shareholders amounted to 
£58.1 million (2008 £74.8 million).
A final dividend of 0.66 pence per Ordinary Share is 
recommended by the Board for the year to 31 December 2009 
(2008 0.60 pence) for which approval will be sought from 
shareholders at the Company’s 2010 Annual General Meeting 
(“2010 AGM”) on 5 May 2010, to be paid on 6 May 2010 (ADR 
holders on 13 May 2010) to those shareholders whose names are 
on the Register of Members on 12 March 2010.
Together with the interim dividend of 0.55 pence per 
Ordinary Share (2008 0.50 pence) which was paid to shareholders 
on 17 September 2009, this amounts to a total dividend for 2009 
of 1.21 pence per Ordinary Share (2008 1.10 pence).
Share capital and control
The Company has a single class of share which is divided into 
Ordinary Shares of 3
1
/ 3 pence each. Each Ordinary Share carries 
one vote and all of the Ordinary Shares rank pari passu. There 
are no special control rights relating to the Ordinary Shares.
At the date of this Report, 678.8 million Ordinary Shares of  
3
1
/ 3 pence each had been issued which are fully paid up and are 
listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Company also 
operates a Level 1 American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) 
programme with each ADR representing four Ordinary Shares. 
The ADRs trade on the US over-the-counter market and The Bank 
of New York Mellon is the authorised depositary bank for the 
programme. Further details on share capital are set out in note 
28 to the consolidated financial statements and note 16 to the 
parent Company financial statements.
The rights, including those relating to voting, obligations and 
any restrictions on transfer relating to the Company’s Ordinary 
Shares, as well as the powers of the Company’s directors, are set 
out in the Company’s Articles of Association, a copy of which can 
be found on our website at www.spirent.com or can be obtained 
from Companies House or by writing to the Company Secretary. 
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended by 
a special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. The 
changes to the Articles of Association approved at the 2009 AGM 
became effective on 1 October 2009. The Notice of 2010 AGM 
includes a resolution to make minor changes to the Company's 
Articles of Association to take account of recent amendments to 
company law.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer  
of securities or on voting rights.
During the year to 31 December 2009, options and rights 
exercised pursuant to the Company’s share incentive plans 
resulted in the allotment of 6.9 million new Ordinary Shares. 
A further 0.7 million new Ordinary Shares have been allotted 
under the share incentive plans between the end of the  
financial year and the date of this Report. 
The Company has established two employee benefit trusts

Significant agreements
A Group company has a significant agreement with a  
contract manufacturer which contains a clause requiring the 
manufacturer’s consent to any proposed transaction which will 
or may result in a change of control of the Group company.  
The Company considers that the agreement is essential to its 
business and intends it to remain in place until at least 
September 2010.
The Company is not aware of any other significant 
agreements to which it is party that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company following  
a takeover.
Return of capital
The Company was authorised at the 2006 AGM to repurchase up 
to 14.99 per cent of its own issued Ordinary Shares, within 
certain limits and as permitted by the Company’s Articles of 
Association. This authority has been renewed at each AGM since 
2006. Since the Company began returning capital to shareholders 
in May 2006, a total of £176.3 million has been returned, through 
the repurchase of 320.1 million Ordinary Shares.
During 2009 a total of 0.6 million Ordinary Shares, each with a 
nominal value of 3
1
/ 3 pence were repurchased for an aggregate 
consideration of £0.6 million and cancelled immediately following 
repurchase. This represents 0.09 per cent of the Company’s issued 
Ordinary Share capital at the beginning of 2009. The Company has 
not repurchased any further Ordinary Shares between the end of 
the financial year and the date of this Report.
The Company will seek authority to repurchase up to 9.99 per 
cent of its own Ordinary Shares at the 2010 AGM to facilitate any 
further return of capital if the Board concludes that it is in the 
best interests of shareholders.

Board of directors
The names and brief biographical details of the directors who 
served during the year under review are shown on page 25.
Election and re-election of directors
The Company’s Articles of Association contain provisions relating to 
the appointment and replacement of directors. Other than Edward 
Bramson and Gerard Eastman, who will be retiring from the Board 
at the 2010 AGM, no director has a letter of appointment which is 
due to expire before the 2011 AGM. No directors are therefore 
required to seek re-election at the 2010 AGM.
Directors’ interests
The directors’ interests (including any connected persons) in the 
issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company are set out in the 
Report on directors’ remuneration on pages 33 to 40. 
Directors’ indemnity arrangements
The Company has purchased and maintained throughout the year 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect of itself and 
its directors.
In addition to the indemnity provision contained in the 
Company’s Articles of Association, the Company has provided a 
deed of indemnity for the benefit of each of the directors of the 
Company in respect of costs of defending claims against them 
and third party liabilities. 
Other than this, at no time during the year did any director 
hold a material interest in any contract of significance with the 
Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings except for the 
service contracts between executive directors and the Company.
Corporate social responsibility
The Group’s Corporate social responsibility statement appears on 
pages 22 to 24. This statement gives details of the Group’s 
policies on ethics, the environment, health and safety, charitable 
donations and involvement in the community. Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2009
28
Charitable donations of £91,000 were made in the year  
(2008 £52,000). This amount excludes operating units’ support 
and participation in local community activities. In accordance 
with the Group's Ethics Policy, no political donations were made 
in the year (2008 nil).
The Group employs approximately 1,450 people (2008 1,500) 
around the world and is proud of its history of being regarded as 
a responsible and respected employer. The Corporate social 
responsibility statement gives details of the Group’s policies on 
employment, training and development.
Research and development
Product development and innovation are considered key 
strategies to maintain and improve the Group’s competitive 
position and therefore continue to receive high priority. This 
commitment is highlighted by the £47.5 million research and 
development spend during the year, equivalent to 17.5 per cent 
of revenue (2008 £45.3 million and 17.6 per cent). The Group 
will continue to commit resources as appropriate to research 
and development.
Policy on payment of suppliers
Group operating companies are responsible for agreeing the 
terms and conditions under which business transactions with 
their suppliers are conducted and it is Group policy to comply 
with those terms and to make suppliers aware of them.
At 31 December 2009, the Company had an average of 59 days 
purchases outstanding in trade creditors (2008 51 days).
Corporate governance
The Directors’ statement on corporate governance is set out on 
pages 30 to 32. The Statement of directors’ responsibilities in 
respect of the financial statements appears on page 29.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Business Review on pages 6 to 24. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Financial review on 
pages 18 to 21. In addition, note 26 to the consolidated financial 
statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with 
long term contracts with a number of customers and suppliers 
across different geographic areas and industries. As a 
consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed 
to manage its business risks successfully despite the current 
uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the  
going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the directors of the Company at the date of this report 
confirms that:
so far as the director is aware, there is no information  •	
needed by the Company’s auditors in connection with 
preparing their report of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and
he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a •	
director in order to make himself aware of any information 
needed by the Company’s auditors in connection with 
preparing their report and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
Resolutions to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditors and to 
authorise the directors to determine their remuneration will be 
proposed at the 2010 AGM.
Annual General Meeting
The 2010 AGM will be held at 10.30am on Wednesday 5 May 2010 
at Holborn Gate, 26 Southampton Buildings, London WC2A 1PB,

statement of directors’ 
responsibilities in 
respect of the annual 
report and the 
financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the consolidated financial statements of the Group and financial 
statements of the parent Company.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law they are 
required to prepare the consolidated financial statements of the 
Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and 
have elected to prepare the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles and applicable law.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group are 
required by law and IFRS to present fairly for each financial 
period the financial position and performance of the Group; the 
Companies Act 2006 provides, in relation to such financial 
statements, that references in the relevant part of that Act to 
financial statements giving a true and fair view, are references 
to their achieving a fair presentation.
The parent Company financial statements are required by law 
to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the parent 
Company.
In preparing each of the consolidated financial statements of 
the Group and parent Company financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them •	
consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and •	
prudent;
state for the audited consolidated financial statements of the •	
Group whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU;
state for the parent Company financial statements whether •	
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the parent Company financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis •	
unless it is inappropriate to presume the Group and the 
parent Company will continue in operational business for the 
foreseeable future.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and the parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and, for the Group, Article 4 of the 
International Accounting Standards Regulation. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a directors’ report, a directors’ 
remuneration report and a statement on corporate governance 
that comply with the law and those regulations. They are also 
responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
This Annual Report complies with the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules (“DTR”) of the Financial Services Authority 
in respect of the requirement to produce an annual financial 
report.
The Annual Report and consolidated financial statements 
are the responsibility of, and have been approved by, the 
directors.
Each of the directors confirms that, to the best of his 
knowledge:
the consolidated financial statements of the Group and •	
parent Company financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and the profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
and
the Annual Report includes a fair review of the development •	
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

directors’ statement 
on corporate 
governance
Compliance
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance set out in the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance published by the Financial Reporting Council in June 
2008 (the “Code”). The Board is accountable to the Company’s 
shareholders for good governance and this Statement, together 
with the Report on directors’ remuneration on pages 33 to 40, 
describes how the Board has applied the main principles of 
good governance contained within the Code during the year 
under review. It is the Board’s view that the Company is 
fully compliant.
The Board
As at 31 December 2009, the Board comprised a chairman, four 
independent non-executive directors, one non-executive director 
not classified as independent for the purposes of the Code when 
determining the composition of the Board or its Committees, and 
two executive directors, details of whom are provided on page 25. 
The Board operates within a framework of controls including a 
formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for its decision. 
There is a clear division of responsibility at the head of the 
Company: the Chairman (Edward Bramson) being responsible for 
running the Board and the Chief Executive Officer (Bill Burns) 
being responsible for implementing strategy.
It was announced on 4 March 2010 that Mr Bramson would 
resign as Chairman of the Company on that day and that Alex 
Walker would be appointed Non-Executive Chairman of the 
Company. It was also announced that Edward Bramson and Gerard 
Eastman would retire from the Board at the 2010 AGM.
The Board discharges its responsibilities by providing leadership 
of the Company within a framework of prudent and effective 
controls, which enables risk to be assessed and managed. It sets 
the Company’s strategic aims, ensures that the necessary financial 
and human resources are in place for the Company to meet its 
objectives, and reviews management performance. It also defines 
the Company’s values and standards and ensures that its 
obligations to shareholders are understood and met.
The independence of each director is reviewed on appointment 
and at least annually. The Board determined that, within the 
terms of the Code, Ian Brindle, Duncan Lewis, Tom Maxwell and 
Alex Walker are each independent non-executive directors. As 
Edward Bramson and Gerard Eastman have, until September 2009, 
had a connected material notifiable interest in the issued Ordinary 
Share capital of the Company, the Board has concluded that they 
should not be considered independent of the Company for the 
period under review. Details of other professional commitments of 
the Chairman and non-executive directors are provided in their 
biographies on page 25.
In October 2008, the Company adopted new Articles of 
Association permitting the Board to consider and, if it sees fit, to 
authorise situations where a director has an interest that conflicts, 
or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the Company 
(“Situational Conflicts”). The Board has a formal system in place 
for directors to declare Situational Conflicts and for these to be 
considered for authorisation by those directors who have no 
connection with the matter being considered. In deciding whether 
to authorise a Situational Conflict, the non-conflicted directors are 
required to act in the way they consider most likely to promote 
the success of the Company and they may impose limits or 
conditions when giving authorisation, or subsequently, if they 
think this is appropriate. The Board considers the procedure to 
have operated effectively during the year.
Alex Walker served as the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director during the period under review. The Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director is available to meet shareholders upon 
request if they have concerns which contact through the normal 
channels of the Chairman or an executive director has failed to 
resolve, or for which such contact would be inappropriate. Ian 
Brindle will become Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
following Mr Walker's appointment as Non-Executive Chairman  
of the Company on 4 March 2010.
It is Company policy to hold at least four Board meetings a 
year. There were seven Board meetings during 2009. The agenda 
is settled by the Chairman in advance of the meeting and papers 
are circulated to Board members several days ahead of the 
meeting. Minutes of previous meetings are circulated to all Board 
members and, subject to their agreement, approved at the 
following Board meeting.
Full attendance by the Board is expected at meetings and in 
2009 all directors attended all seven meetings except Duncan 
Lewis, who missed two meetings and Ian Brindle, Gerard Eastman 
and Alex Walker, who each missed one meeting due to 
unavoidable diary conflicts. Where the director was absent, full 
documentation for the meeting was issued and briefings were 
provided as appropriate. It was ensured that any comments on the 
documentation or subject matter to be considered were passed to 
the Board for consideration.
Certain of the matters specifically reserved for the Board’s 
decision have been delegated to three Committees with clearly 
defined terms of reference which, together with the composition 
of each Committee, are reviewed annually. The terms of 
reference for the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees can be found on the Company’s website at  
www.spirent.com.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that the directors 
receive accurate, timely and clear information. They receive 
regular updates on business performance and receive 
presentations from the executive directors and other senior 
managers at Board meetings. Under the direction of the 
Chairman, the Company Secretary ensures good and timely 
information flows between the Board and its Committees and 
makes sure that Board procedures are complied with. The 
Company Secretary also updates and advises the Board on all 
regulatory and governance matters.
There is a policy whereby the non-executive directors and the 
Board Committees may take independent professional advice at 
the Company’s expense in order to fulfill their duties. All directors 
also have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, whose removal may only be effected with the approval 
of the Board.
Board appointments and induction
The Board has in place a procedure for the appointment of new 
directors to the Board which complies with the Code.
On appointment to the Board and its Committees all directors 
receive an induction tailored to their individual requirements.  GOVERNANCE
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2009
31
New directors are briefed on their legal and other duties and 
obligations as directors of a UK listed company. Visits to different 
facilities and meetings with senior management are organised, 
as appropriate, to assist the new director in developing an 
understanding of how the Group operates and the key issues that 
it faces.
The Company’s Articles of Association require that all directors 
seek election by shareholders at the first annual general meeting 
following their appointment and that all directors seek re-election 
at least every three years. It was announced on 4 March 2010 that 
Edward Bramson and Gerard Eastman will retire at the 2010 AGM. 
As no other director has a letter of appointment which is due to 
expire before the 2011 AGM, no director is required to seek 
re-election at the 2010 AGM.
Performance evaluation
Performance evaluation of the Board and its Committees was 
carried out during the year by directors completing 
questionnaires and the results being collated and analysed by 
the Company Secretary who prepared a report for Board 
discussion. The Board discussion concluded that the Board and 
Committees operated well and were effective.
The Chairman communicates regularly with the non-executive 
directors and this contact provides an ongoing opportunity to 
assess performance and to discuss the performance of the 
executive directors or any other matters. The Chairman has 
concluded that during the year under review the commitment and 
application of the non-executive directors was of a high standard 
including each having time to attend all Board and appropriate 
Committee meetings and to carry out other appropriate duties.
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director met with the 
independent non-executive directors on 11 November 2009, in 
the absence of the Chairman, to assess the Chairman’s 
effectiveness. Notwithstanding Mr Bramson’s role as chairman 
and chief executive officer of Nautilus, Inc, the independent 
non-executive directors were of the opinion that Mr Bramson 
gave sufficient time to his role as Chairman of the Company and 
was effective in that role during the year under review.
Board Committees
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Ian Brindle (Chairman), Tom 
Maxwell and Alex Walker, all of whom are independent non-
executive directors, making the composition of the Committee 
compliant with the Code. The Code also requires that the Audit 
Committee includes at least one member who has recent, 
significant and relevant financial experience. The Board 
considers that both Ian Brindle and Tom Maxwell provide such 
experience. Duncan Lewis will be appointed to the Audit 
Committee following Mr Walker's appointment as Non- Executive 
Chairman of the Company.
During 2009, the Audit Committee held three meetings at 
which there was full attendance by Committee members. At 
each meeting the Company’s external auditors, the Chief 
Financial Officer, the Group Vice President Finance, the Head  
of Financial Reporting and the Company Secretary were in 
attendance. The Chairman and the other directors may also 
attend the meetings. In addition, the Committee meets with  
the Company's external auditors without management being 
present. The minutes of Committee meetings are available to  
all directors. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the system of internal 
controls, including risk management, and has delegated certain of 
these responsibilities to the Audit Committee. During the year the 
Committee has monitored and reviewed risk management and 
internal control, reviewed the interim and full year financial 
statements, key accounting policies, the auditors’ report on the 
interim review and year-end audit and management’s responses to 
the issues raised. The internal audit programme and the external 
audit strategy and scope for 2009 were also agreed and approved. 
Further details of internal control and process are set out below. 
Regular reports on tax, treasury, legal and health and safety are 
presented. Further details of the Group's Ethics Policy and health 
and safety performance are contained in the Corporate Social 
Responsibility Statement on pages 22 to 24. The Chairman of the 
Committee reports any significant findings or identified 
weaknesses to the Board.
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy in relation to the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditor to ensure 
that the provision of such services does not impair the external 
auditors’ independence or objectivity. Under this policy, certain 
non-audit services are precluded. The policy is reviewed and 
financial limits for non-audit services are set on an annual basis. 
The Committee considers that notwithstanding the non-audit 
services provided during the year, Ernst & Young’s objectivity as 
external auditors was not impaired. In recommending their 
re-appointment as external auditors, the Committee considered 
Ernst & Young’s performance, resource, quality control 
procedures, policy on rotating its audit partners (audit partners 
rotate every five years), independence and objectivity. The 
Committee also considered the risk of Ernst & Young withdrawing 
from the audit market. There are no contractual obligations that 
restrict the Company's current choice of external auditor. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Alex Walker 
(Chairman), Ian Brindle and Duncan Lewis, all of whom are 
independent non-executive directors, making the composition of 
the Committee compliant with the Code. Tom Maxwell will be 
appointed to and become Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee following Mr Walker's appointment as Non-Executive 
Chairman of the Company.
Further details about the Remuneration Committee are 
included in the Report on directors’ remuneration on pages 33  
to 40.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises Edward Bramson 
(Chairman), Ian Brindle, Gerard Eastman, Duncan Lewis, Tom 
Maxwell and Alex Walker and meets at least once each year. 
During 2009 the Nomination Committee held one meeting which 
all Committee members attended, except Duncan Lewis, who 
had an unavoidable diary conflict. The Nomination Committee is 
responsible for reviewing the composition and structure of the 
Board and for identifying and recommending candidates for 
executive and non-executive positions, based on the required 
role and capabilities which have been specified for the 
appointment. Executive search consultants are used by the 
Nomination Committee to assist this process as appropriate. As 
the majority of members are independent non-executive 
directors, the composition of the Committee is compliant with 
the terms of the Code. Alex Walker will become Chairman of the  Spirent Communications plc

Nomination Committee following Mr Bramson's resignation as

Relations with shareholders  
Communication with all shareholders is given a high priority 
and a number of methods are used to promote greater 
understanding and dialogue with investment audiences. 
Dialogue with institutional investors is conducted on a regular 
basis by the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer. 
The Company has an established cycle of communication 
based on its financial reporting calendar. This includes the 
Preliminary Results in February/March, Annual Report in March, 
Annual General Meeting and Interim Management Statement in 
May, Half-year Results in August and the Interim Management 
Statement in November. 
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer ensure that the views expressed at meetings with 
institutional shareholders are communicated effectively to  
the Board as a whole so that any issues or concerns are  
fully understood.
Electronic communications
The Company promotes the use of electronic communication.  
All stock exchange announcements and presentations to 
shareholders are made available on our website, together with 
webcasts of our annual and half-year financial results. Our 
website also contains up to date corporate governance 
information including terms of reference for the three Board 
Committees, the terms and conditions of appointment of 
non-executive directors, the Company’s Ethics Policy and 
Articles of Association.
At its 2008 AGM the Company passed a resolution allowing it 
to communicate with shareholders by means of the Company’s 
website and an invitation to opt out of receiving mailings solely 
by electronic communication was sent to shareholders with the 
2009 AGM documentation. Shareholders who have purchased 
their shares since that invitation was distributed in March 2009 
but who wish to receive company mailings electronically should 
notify the Company’s registrar, Equiniti, on 0871 384 2126 or via 
www.shareview.co.uk. In line with this policy, the Company's 
Half-year Results will in future only be available on the 
Company's website at www.spirent.com.
Electronic communications provide significant benefits for 
shareholders and the Company in terms of timeliness of 
information, reduced environmental impact and cost and the 
Board would encourage investors to participate in the programme. 
Pensions governance
The Group’s principal pension and retirement schemes are in the 
UK and the US. Scheme funds are held separately from those of 
the Group and are administered by trustees (which include 
employees and independent bodies). The schemes do not lend 
money or lease any assets to the Group.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control. The Board, assisted by the Audit Committee, has 
reviewed the effectiveness of this system and this review did not 
reveal any significant issues or weaknesses. The Board confirms 
that this process was in place throughout the year under review 
and up to the date of approval of these financial statements. The 
primary aim is to operate a system which is appropriate to the 
business and which can, over time, increase shareholder value 
whilst safeguarding the Group’s assets. The system is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Process
Day to day responsibility for effective internal control and risk 
monitoring rests with senior management at business unit level.
The Board and the Audit Committee continue to agree that 
currently there is no need for a dedicated internal control 
department. Responsibility for internal control rests with the 
Group Vice President Finance and North America Vice President 
Finance. Both of these senior finance managers are independent 
of any business unit and play a key role in providing an objective 
view and continuing assessment of the effectiveness of the 
internal control systems throughout the Group. The Group consists 
of a limited number of entities which can comfortably be covered 
by the two senior finance managers. As stated above, the Group 
Vice President Finance attends all Audit Committee meetings to 
give an update on any internal control issues arising and any 
outstanding remedial actions.
The Group’s system of risk management comprises an 
integrated risk management strategy of regular self-assessment of 
all business units. Significant risks are regularly reviewed by the 
Audit Committee and by the Board.
Management and specialists within the finance department are 
responsible for ensuring the appropriate maintenance of financial 
records and processes that ensure all financial information is 
relevant, reliable, in accordance with the applicable laws and 
regulations, and distributed both internally and externally in a 
timely manner. A review of the consolidation and financial 
statements is completed by management to ensure that the 
financial position and results of the Group are appropriately 
reflected. All financial information published by the Group is 
subject to the approval of the Audit Committee.
In addition to this process, the following key elements are 
critical to the overall internal control environment:
an organisational structure with clear operating procedures, •	
defined lines of responsibility and delegated levels of 
authority;
an ethics policy (which has been approved by the Board), which •	
sets standards of professionalism and integrity for all 
employees and operations. The Ethics Policy also includes 
“whistleblowing” procedures whereby employees may report, 
in confidence, suspected wrongdoings;
a comprehensive strategic planning, financial control and •	
budgeting system which is properly documented and regularly 
reviewed; and
a disciplined acquisitions and divestments due diligence •	
process and post acquisition integration programme.

report on directors’ 
remuneration
This Report on directors’ remuneration has been prepared by 
the Remuneration Committee on behalf of the Board for 
approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be 
held on 5 May 2010 ("2010 AGM"). The Report complies with the 
provisions of Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. The 
Remuneration Committee has adopted the principles of good 
governance relating to directors’ remuneration as set out in the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in June 
2008 (the “Code”). Part A of the Report, which is not subject to 
audit, sets out the Company’s remuneration policy. Part B, which 
has been audited, provides details of the remuneration, pensions 
and share incentives of the directors for the period under review.
Part A Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the "Committee") comprises Alex 
Walker (Chairman), Ian Brindle and Duncan Lewis. There were no 
changes to the members of the Committee during the year and 
its composition is compliant with the Code in terms of 
independent non-executive directors. Tom Maxwell will be 
appointed to and become Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee following Mr Walker's appointment as Non-Executive 
Chairman of the Company on 4 March 2010.
The Committee met four times during the year. Full 
attendance of the Committee is expected at meetings and all 
members attended all meetings except Duncan Lewis, who 
missed one meeting due to an unavoidable diary conflict. The 
Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee is responsible for determining, on behalf of 
the Board, all elements of the remuneration of the chairman, 
executive directors and senior managers, reviewing 
remuneration policy and overseeing the operation of the 
Company’s share incentive plans. The Committee’s terms of 
reference can be found on the Company’s website at  
www.spirent.com.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy set by the Committee aims to 
encourage a performance-based culture which reinforces 
behaviour which will lead to the continued long term 
development of the business, attract and retain high calibre 
executive directors and senior managers and align their interests 
with shareholders. The aims of the policy are achieved by 
ensuring their remuneration is competitive when compared with 
companies of similar size, type and complexity within the 
countries in which they are based. It is structured so that a 
substantial element of their total remuneration package is 
weighted towards performance-based pay.
Advisers to the Committee
When the Committee considers it appropriate, it takes advice on 
remuneration matters from:
Aon Consulting Inc — Radford executive remuneration data; •	
Ernst & Young LLP — independent verification of earnings per •	
share (“EPS”) to determine the vesting of share incentives 
(they are also the Company’s auditors);
Kepler Associates Limited — measurement of total •	
shareholder return (“TSR”) to determine the vesting of share 
incentives;
Linklaters LLP — advice on share incentive plans (they are •	
also one of the Company’s general legal advisers); and
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP — Monks’ executive •	
remuneration data and policy review.
During the year the Committee also consulted with the Company’s 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice 
President, Human Resources and the Company Secretary but not 
on matters relating directly to their own remuneration.
Executive directors’ remuneration
The remuneration of executive directors comprises the following 
elements:
base salary, benefits and pension contributions or cash •	
allowance in lieu of pension;
quarterly and annual performance cash incentive; and •	
long term share incentive awards. •	
Edward Bramson acted as Executive Chairman from March 2007 
until the appointment of Bill Burns as Chief Executive Officer on 
6 November 2008. Mr Bramson, a partner in Sherborne Investors 
GP, LLC, who until September 2009 were the Company’s largest 
shareholder, chose to waive his right to any remuneration for his 
role as Executive Chairman whilst he managed the operational 
turnaround of the Group. As a consequence he received no 
director’s fee, salary, pension contributions, cash incentive or 
share incentive awards from his appointment to the Board on 
22 December 2006 until 31 December 2008. Following the 
separation of the chairman and chief executive roles, the 
Committee determined that Mr Bramson should receive a fee of 
£150,000 per annum from 1 January 2009 for his services as 
Non-Executive Chairman.
Base salary, fees and benefits
Base salaries and benefits of executive directors are determined 
by the Committee and are normally reviewed annually. Bill 
Burns’ base salary and benefits were set on his appointment on  
6 November 2008 and reviewed on 1 January 2010 when the 
Committee determined that there should be no change. Eric 
Hutchinson’s base salary and benefits were last reviewed on 1 
January 2010 and the Committee determined that there should 
be no change. The base salary and benefits of the executive 
directors will next be reviewed on 1 January 2011.
When conducting such reviews, the Committee takes into 
account a range of factors including the Company’s performance, 
economic conditions, the prevailing market rates for similar 
positions in a comparable group of companies, the responsibilities,  
individual performance and experience of each executive 
director and the level of salary increases awarded to employees 
throughout the Group. Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2009
34
Bill Burns has a service agreement with Spirent 
Communications Inc. (“SCI”), and, being a US resident, receives 
a remuneration package which is in line with US employment 
practice. In addition to his base salary, he participates in SCI’s 
medical, dental and vision plans, 401(k) Pension Plan, a non-
qualified deferred compensation plan and receives disability 
coverage benefit, life insurance cover of four times base salary 
and a car allowance.
The SCI 401(k) Pension Plan is a defined contribution plan 
approved under Section 401(k) of the US Internal Revenue Code 
(“US IR Code”). SCI make matching contributions of up to 4 per 
cent of the maximum compensation permitted for these 
purposes under the US IR Code, which for 2009 was $245,000.
The SCI Deferred Compensation Plan is a non-qualified plan 
offered as a benefit to senior management in the US. This plan 
allows participants to defer up to 50 per cent of their base salary 
and up to 100 per cent of any cash incentive until they reach 
retirement age or leave the Group’s employment. Under this 
plan, contributions are met solely by Mr Burns and SCI makes no 
matching contributions.
Eric Hutchinson has a service agreement with Spirent 
Communications plc, and, being a UK resident, receives a 
remuneration package which is in line with UK employment 
practice. In addition to base salary he receives private medical 
insurance, life insurance cover of four times base salary and a 
car allowance. During the year under review, Eric Hutchinson 
received an annual cash allowance in lieu of pension of 20 per 
cent of base salary, totalling £58,970.
Quarterly and annual performance cash incentives
The Committee regularly reviews performance incentive targets 
and performance conditions to incentivise executive directors 
to meet the short term strategic objectives of the Company and 
its divisions. 
During 2009, the executive directors participated in a 
performance cash incentive arrangement with two thirds of the 
incentive target being earned quarterly and one third annually. 
This cash incentive arrangement was structured so that 
performance was measured against a combination of growth 
targets in the Company’s EPS, other financial targets and 
personal objectives. For 2009, the maximum cash incentive 
available for Bill Burns was 150 per cent of base salary and for 
Eric Hutchinson was 60 per cent of base salary. These limits will 
also apply for 2010. The Committee reviewed Mr Burns’ and Mr 
Hutchinson’s performance against the targets set and, having 
exceeded the EPS target and met all personal objectives, the 
Committee approved a total cash incentive payment for the year 
of $845,000 for Mr Burns (£538,200 at an average exchange rate  
of $1.57:£1), equivalent to 141 per cent of his base salary  
and £171,500 for Mr Hutchinson, equivalent to 58 per cent  
of base salary.
Long term share incentive awards
The Company operates a number of share incentive plans. 
Currently, the principal share incentive plan utilised for 
executive directors is the 2005 Employee Incentive Plan (“EIP”) 
which is a discretionary share plan. 
Executive directors are also able to participate in all 
employee share plans if offered in the country within which they 
are resident. The applicable all employee plans in the UK are the 
2005 Sharesave Scheme and the UK Employee Share Purchase 
Plan and in the US is the US Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The 
Board did not make any invitations to executive directors or any 
other employees to participate in an all employee plan during 
the year under review.
During 2009, historical awards of share incentives held by 
executive directors under the Spirent Stock Incentive Plan 
(“SSIP”), 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”) and the 
UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme (“SRSOS”) remained 
outstanding. The SSIP was the principal share incentive plan 
used to deliver awards to Communications group employees and 
Bill Burns participated in this plan in his former positions within 
the Communications group. The grants made to Mr Burns in 2005 
and 2006 under the SSIP have performance conditions attached 
and further details are given below. The ESOS and SRSOS were 
closed in 2005 and no grants have been made under either 
scheme since then. 
Further details of the Company’s share incentive plans are 
provided in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements and 
note 16 to the parent Company financial statements.
2005 Employee Incentive Plan
Under the EIP, the Company is able to grant options and 
share-settled stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), the vesting of 
which is subject to meeting an EPS growth target. Performance 
shares may also be granted, the vesting of which is subject to 
meeting a TSR performance target.
Any awards made to executive directors are subject to prior 
satisfactory performance of the individual and award levels vary 
in accordance with the individual’s potential to add value to the 
business over the medium to long term.
In normal circumstances, the maximum value of an award of 
Performance shares under the EIP is limited to 125 per cent of 
base salary with awards of Options or SARs limited to a 
maximum value of 250 per cent of base salary. For combined 
awards, the maximum value is limited to 250 per cent of base 
salary with one Performance share being equivalent to two 
options/SARs. Awards are valued at the closing price for a 
Spirent Ordinary Share on the business day immediately 
preceding the date of award.
All awards are tested once on or shortly following the third 
anniversary of grant. Any part of an award which does not vest 
will lapse and there is no retesting. 
The Committee considers that real EPS growth is the most 
appropriate measure of the Company’s performance in 
determining the vesting of SARs and options granted under the 
EIP. The performance condition for SARs and options is therefore 
based on the rate of growth in the Company’s EPS over a three 
year performance period excluding any increase in the Retail 
Prices Index (“RPI”). Details of vesting are set out in the 
following table.

Following testing of the EPS performance condition attached to 
the SARs and options granted under the EIP on 5 May 2006, 100 
per cent vesting occurred on 5 May 2009.
The Committee considers that a relative TSR growth target is 
the most appropriate measure of the Company’s performance in 
determining the vesting of Performance shares granted under 
the EIP and the performance condition for Performance shares is 
therefore based on the Company’s relative TSR rating against a 
comparator group of companies over a three year performance 
period as set out in the table below.

For awards made prior to 2009, the comparator group  
consisted of the 30 largest companies by market capitalisation 
in the FTSE TechMARK 100 Index, excluding those companies 
who were also constituents of the FTSE 100 Index at the 
commencement of the performance period. For the award made 
on 30 November 2009, three non UK listed direct competitors 
were added to the comparator group. The Committee considers 
the selected comparator group provides a suitable benchmark 
for the Company’s TSR rating. In determining the TSR for the 
Company and its comparator group in respect of the award made 
on 30 November 2009, share prices are averaged over the 90 day 
period immediately prior to, and at the end of, the performance 
period. For previous awards, there was no averaging period.
Following testing of the relative TSR performance condition 
attached to the Performance shares granted under the EIP on 
5 May 2006, 100 per cent vesting occurred on 5 May 2009.
On 30 November 2009, the Committee approved awards of 
377,953 Performance shares to Bill Burns and 151,829 
Performance shares to Eric Hutchinson. 
Spirent Stock Incentive Plan
Grants made to Bill Burns in 2005 and 2006 under the SSIP 
remain outstanding and are subject to a performance condition 
as set out below which was approved by shareholders in 2004. A 
25 per cent tranche of each grant of SARs vests and becomes 
exercisable, subject to the attainment of a performance 
condition, on each of the first, second, third and fourth 
anniversaries of the date of grant. The performance condition is 
measured against a fixed base year determined at the date of 
grant. Any tranche which does not meet the performance 
condition before the fourth anniversary of the date of grant is 
subject to a final testing on that fourth anniversary. The 
performance condition for this final testing is measured from the 
base year and the performance condition is increased in 
proportion to the four year performance period. Any tranche 
which has not vested after the fourth anniversary of the date of 
grant lapses.

Shareholder dilution 
The Committee is mindful of the need to manage shareholder 
dilution in a responsible manner. At the 2009 Annual General 
Meeting (“2009 AGM”), shareholders granted the Company 
authority to award share incentives over new issue shares of no 
more than half of one per cent of the then issued Ordinary Share 
capital under the EIP and SSIP. This authority is due to expire at 
the 2010 AGM. It was also stated in the Notice of 2009 AGM that 
the Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) held 0.8 million 
unallocated shares as a result of share incentives lapsing on 
termination of employees and that the Company would utilise 
these unallocated shares before making any significant awards 
over new issue shares.
Between the 2009 AGM and the date of this Report, the 
Committee approved awards of share incentives over 1.8 million 
Ordinary Shares and intends to satisfy these awards by the on 
market purchase of Ordinary Shares by the Company’s ESOT. 
Overall shareholder dilution resulting from the Company’s 
share incentive plans (on a rolling 10 year basis) has fallen by  
2.4 per cent when comparing the positions at 31 December 2009 
(11.4 per cent) and 31 December 2008 (13.8 per cent). The 
overall number of share incentives outstanding has fallen by  
21.8 million during the year to 28.3 million at 31 December 2009 
(2008 50.1 million).
At the 2009 AGM, the Company was also given authority by 
shareholders to continue to operate the SSIP until the 2010 AGM 
when the plan will expire. During 2009 a minimal number of 
share incentives were granted under the SSIP. 
Shareholder approval was given in 2005 to operate the EIP 
until 2015, subject to further shareholder approval being 
required on the use of new issue shares and any material 
changes to the plan. No material changes to the EIP are 
proposed and therefore no specific shareholder approval is 
required at the 2010 AGM to continue to operate this plan. 
Service contracts
It is the Company’s policy that service contracts for the 
executive directors have no fixed term and are capable of 
termination on no more than 12 months’ notice from either the 
Company or the executive director.
The contract dates and notice periods for each executive 
director are as follows:
   Notice period Notice period 
  Date of  by company by director 
  contract month(s) month(s)
Bill Burns 6 November 2008 1 1
Eric Hutchinson 13 December 1999 12 12
Both contracts contain provisions for the employer to make 
payment in lieu of notice and for removal of the director for 
poor performance or material misconduct without compensation. 
In the case of Eric Hutchinson, the Company will seek to apply 
practical mitigation measures to any payment of compensation 
on termination, taking into account all relevant circumstances. 
In the case of Bill Burns, mitigation provisions are contained in 
his service contract. As noted above, Mr Burns' service contract is 
with SCI and governed by the laws of the State of California, its 
termination provisions therefore reflect US practice. Either the 
employer or Mr Burns may terminate employment upon 30 days’ 
notice and, in addition to one month’s base salary (or payment in 
lieu) he would be entitled to accrued base salary, cash incentives, 
and vacation pay. Mr Burns would also be entitled to 11 months’ 
base salary subject to a set-off for any base salary earned from 
alternative employment during the 12 month period following 
termination (“severance period”) and monthly COBRA premium 
payments for the duration of the severance period subject to a 
set-off for health insurance provided by an alternative employer 
during the severance period.
Both service contracts contain appropriate provisions to 
protect the legitimate interests of the Company with respect to 
preventing any terminated director from working in a business 
which competes against the Company. Service contracts do not 
contain any compensation rights which could be increased on a 
change of control in the Company.
External appointments
The Company recognises that its executive directors may be 
invited to become non-executive directors of other companies 
and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and 
experience, to the benefit of the Company. The director would 
then retain any related fees. At the date of this Report, neither 
Bill Burns nor Eric Hutchinson hold any such external positions.
Non-executive directors’ fees and letters of 
appointment
The Company’s remuneration policy with regard to non-
executive directors is to pay fees which are in line with market 
practice. Fees are normally reviewed once every three years and 
having last been reviewed on 1 January 2008 will not formally be 
reviewed until 1 January 2011. It is considered that non-
executive director fees are at the median level for comparable 
companies. The basic annual fee for non-executive directors 
with effect from 1 January 2008 is £36,000. The Chairmen of the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees each receive additional 
fees of £11,000 and £9,000 respectively.
All non-executive directors have a letter of appointment with 
the Company for a period of not more than three years, subject 
to the Company’s Articles of Association. Each letter provides for 
retirement every three years, except Edward Bramson and 
Gerard Eastman who stated on appointment that they would 
seek re-election by shareholders on an annual basis. It was 
announced on 4 March 2010 that Mr Bramson and Mr Eastman 
will retire from the Board at the 2010 AGM. Non-executive 
directors are not eligible to participate in cash incentive or share 
incentive arrangements and their service does not qualify for a 
pension or other benefits. No element of their fee is 
performance related.

non-executive director is available on the Company's website at 
www.spirent.com.
As outlined above, Edward Bramson acted as Executive 
Chairman from March 2007 until the appointment of Bill Burns  
as Chief Executive Officer on 6 November 2008. Mr Bramson, a 
partner in Sherborne Investors GP, LLC, who until September 
2009 were the Company’s largest shareholder, chose to waive  
his right to any remuneration for his role as Executive Chairman 
whilst he managed the operational turnaround of the Group.  
As a consequence, he received no remuneration from his 
appointment to the Board on 22 December 2006 until 31 
December 2008. Following the separation of the chairman and 
chief executive roles, the Committee determined that  
Mr Bramson should receive a fee of £150,000 per annum from  
1 January 2009 for his role as Non-Executive Chairman.
Gerard Eastman, who was also a partner in Sherborne 
Investors, waived his right to any fees from his appointment to 
the Board on 22 December 2006 whilst the operational 
turnaround of the Group was managed. Following the 
appointment of Bill Burns as Chief Executive Officer, the Board 
determined that Mr Eastman should receive the basic fee of 
£36,000 per annum from 1 January 2009 for his services as a 
non-executive director. 
During 2009, Messrs Bramson and Eastman elected to have 
their fees paid to Sherborne Investors. 
 
Total Shareholder Return performance
The graph below shows TSR performance (ie growth in the value 
of a share or index, assuming dividends and other distributions 
are reinvested) for the last five financial years of Spirent 
Communications plc as shown against the FTSE 250 Index (“FTSE 
250”) and the FTSE TechMARK 100 Index, excluding those 
companies who were also constituents of the FTSE 100 Index at 
the commencement of the period. The Committee believes that 
these provide broad equity market indices against which the 
performance of the Company can be fairly compared, and that 
the FTSE TechMARK 100 Index provides a particularly 
representative collection of comparator companies.

comprise the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated balance 
sheet, the Consolidated cash flow statement and the 
Consolidated statement of changes in equity and the related 
notes 1 to 32. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 29, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Group financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall presentation of 
the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs  •	
as at 31 December 2009 and of its profit for the year  
then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as •	
adopted by the European Union; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of •	
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
the information given in the Report of the directors for the •	
financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Group financial statements; and
the information given in the Directors’ statement on •	
corporate governance set out on pages 30 to 32 with respect 
to internal control and risk management systems in relation 
to financial reporting processes and in the Report of the 
directors about share capital structures is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by •	
law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we •	
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
the Report of the directors, set out on page 28, in relation to •	
going concern; and
the part of the Directors’ statement on corporate governance •	
on pages 30 to 32 relating to the Company’s compliance with 
the nine provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code specified 
for our review.
Other matters
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial 
statements of Spirent Communications plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2009 and on the information in the 
Report on directors’ remuneration that is described as having 
been audited.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Corporate information 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
directors on 4 March 2010. Spirent Communications plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and 
Wales. The Company’s Ordinary Shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. 
As required by the European Union’s (“EU”) IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006, the Group has prepared its consolidated 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the EU and issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board. 
The Company has elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards. These are 
presented on pages 84 to 101 and the accounting policies in respect of the Company are set out on pages 85 to 88.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except unless otherwise indicated. 
The Group has prepared its financial statements under IFRS. The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements are set out below and the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those applied in the 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008.
 
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time in the current financial 
year and have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position. IAS 1 (revised) 
“Presentation of Financial Statements” has introduced a number of terminology changes and changes to presentation and disclosure.  
IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the 
Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments and assess their 
performance. The Standard has not required a change to the reported segments, however segment profit is measured before 
share-based payment and acquired intangible amortisation and this has required a change to the way the results have been 
presented. Comparative information has been restated on the same basis.

Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 
31 December each year. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, 
using consistent accounting policies. 
Results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. All intra Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an intangible asset. Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. 
Goodwill is subject to an annual review for impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related 
cash-generating units monitored by management. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying 
amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. 
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit, an operation within a cash-generating unit, an associate or 
jointly controlled entity is included in the profit or loss on its disposal. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Separately identifiable 
intangible assets such as patent fees, licence fees, trademarks and customer lists and relationships are capitalised on the balance 
sheet only when the value can be measured reliably, or the intangible asset is purchased as part of the acquisition of a business. 
Such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis. The carrying value of intangible assets 
is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
 
Product development
Research expenditure is recognised in the year in which it is incurred. Intangible assets arising on the Group’s various product 
development projects are recognised only if the recognition criteria of IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” are met. 
Product development costs are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product under development has
been established. Technological feasibility in Spirent’s circumstances occurs when a working model is completed. For software 
development technological feasibility is not established until the process of developing the software is complete. After technological 
feasibility is established, additional costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life.
At 31 December 2009 no amounts have met the recognition criteria.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. Depreciation is not 
provided on freehold land. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of all other assets over their 
estimated useful lives on a straight line basis at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location. Usual asset 
lives are as follows: 
 
Freehold buildings  50 years
Plant and machinery  3 to 8 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment  
Building installations  20 years or lease period if less
Fittings and equipment  3 to 8 years
Motor vehicles  3 to 5 years
Business systems software  4 years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Impairment of assets 
Intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment at each reporting date where 
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are assessed at least 
annually. When an impairment test is performed, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the net present 
value of the expected cash flows (value in use) of the relevant cash-generating unit or asset and the fair value less cost to sell. In

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Where the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Where an impairment loss has been recognised against an asset, it may be reversed in future periods where there has been a change 
in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised, but only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation 
or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. This does not apply for goodwill, for which an impairment 
loss must not be reversed in any circumstances. Such a reversal is recognised in the income statement. 
 
Leases 
Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and are not 
finance leases. Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after provisions for obsolescence. Cost includes all 
costs in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, 
including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recorded when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is 
probable that the Group will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the 
obligation can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. 
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation. 
Foreign currencies 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. All exchange differences 
are taken to the consolidated income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
measured in terms of historical costs using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transaction.
The functional currencies of the Group’s operations are principally US dollar, sterling or euro. On consolidation the assets and 
liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated into the Group’s presentation currency at exchange rates ruling at the 
balance sheet date. The results of foreign operations are translated into sterling using average rates. The exchange differences 
arising on retranslation are classified as a separate component of equity, the translation reserve. Such translation differences are 
recognised as part of the profit or loss on disposal should an operation be disposed of. The Group has elected to apply the exemption 
in IFRS 1 “First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” which allows the cumulative translation differences for 
all foreign operations to be deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRS, being 1 January 2003. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are stated at original invoiced amount less an appropriate allowance for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts. Such allowances are based on an assessment of debtor ageing, past experience or known 
customer exposures.

Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less. For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and 
cash equivalents as defined above. There are no bank overdrafts.
Trade payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at the original invoiced amount. 
 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares 
held by the Group are classified in shareholders’ equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and shown as a deduction from 
retained earnings. Consideration received for the sale of such treasury shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference 
between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings. 
 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in 
foreign currencies relating to firm commitments or highly probable forecast transactions. Such derivative financial instruments are 
initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at 
each reported balance sheet date. The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is calculated by reference to 
current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. 
The Group has designated its forward foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of 
contracts which are designated as effective are recognised directly in equity and the gain or loss on the ineffective portion of the 
hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement. For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or 
losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the income statement. For effective hedges that are in relation to a financial 
asset or liability, amounts originally deferred are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item 
affects profit or loss, for example when a highly probable forecast sale occurs. For non-financial assets or liabilities, the gains or 
losses that have been included in equity are included in the initial measurement of the non-financial asset or liability at the time the 
asset or liability is recognised on the balance sheet.
The Group discontinues hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation. Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments, which 
are cancelled due to termination of the underlying exposure, are taken to the income statement immediately. 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts. 
Retirement benefits
The Group operates two defined benefit pension plans which are in the United Kingdom, all other pension plans are defined 
contribution in nature. For the defined contribution plans the amount charged to the income statement is the contributions paid or 
payable during the year.
For defined benefit pension plans full actuarial valuations are carried out every three years using the projected unit credit method, 
and updates are performed at each balance sheet date. The cost of providing benefits under these plans is determined separately 
for each plan, and attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine current service cost), and to the current 
and prior periods (to determine the present value of defined benefit obligations). Past service costs are recognised in the income 
statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested. When a settlement (eliminating 
all obligations for benefits already accrued), or a curtailment (reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the 
plan membership or a reduction in future entitlement) occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured using current 
actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement during the period in which the settlement or 
curtailment occurs.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
The interest element of the defined benefit pension plan cost represents the change in present value of plan obligations resulting 
from the passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, 
taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year. The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment 
made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on plan assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets 
of contributions received, and benefits paid during the year. The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the 
interest cost is recognised in the income statement as finance costs or finance income.
 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets, experience adjustments on 
liabilities and changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
 
The defined benefit pension plan asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds denominated in the same currency and 
whose term is consistent with the estimated term of the obligation), less any past service cost not yet recognised and less the fair 
value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and, in 
the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any 
unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount the Group expects to recover, by way of refunds from the plan 
or reductions in the future contributions. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group, the revenue can be reliably measured and 
when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership. In addition, revenue is only recognised 
when collectability is probable. 
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered. Revenue from maintenance 
contracts is recognised over the period of performance on a straight line basis.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance and when there are no 
significant vendor obligations remaining. It is not until acceptance has occurred that the risks and rewards of ownership are 
transferred to the buyer. Terms of acceptance are dependent upon the specific contractual arrangement agreed with the customer.
Contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that the 
individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being provided separately from one 
another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component. To the extent that a separate component comprises a 
product sale of hardware or software, revenue is recognised as described above. Revenue is recognised on other components as the 
Group fulfils its contractual obligations and to the extent that it has earned the right to consideration. 
Employee benefits 
When an employee has rendered services to the Group during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to be paid in 
exchange for those services are recognised in the same accounting period. 
Share-based payment
The Group operates various equity-settled share-based compensation plans and accounts for these awards in accordance with IFRS 2 
“Share-based Payment”. In accordance with the transitional provisions available on first-time adoption of IFRS, the Standard has 
been applied to awards granted after 7 November 2002 which were unvested at 1 January 2005.
The fair value of these awards is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period together with a 
corresponding change in equity. The fair value is measured using a binomial model by reference to the fair value at the date the 
awards were granted and taking into account the best estimate of the number of awards expected to vest. The charge is reassessed 
at each balance sheet date to reflect the expected and actual levels of vesting, except where the failure to vest is a result of not 
meeting a market condition. Awards where vesting is conditional upon satisfying a market condition are treated as vesting 
irrespective of whether the market condition has been satisfied.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees. Shares in the Group held by the 
employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.  Spirent Communications plc

T ax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable for previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not •	
a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. 
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the •	
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the 
related asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance  
sheet date.
Dividends paid
The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period it is approved by the directors, and the final dividend in 
the period it is approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Critical accounting assumptions and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported. Such 
estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best knowledge of current facts, circumstances and future events, actual 
results may differ, possibly significantly, from those estimates. The areas requiring a high degree of judgement or where assumptions 
and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are discussed below.
Goodwill impairment
The Group tests annually by cash-generating unit whether goodwill has suffered impairment and more frequently when events or 
circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units 
have been determined based on value in use calculations which require the use of estimates and assumptions. These are described 
in note 14.
Defined benefit pension plans
The pension cost and the defined benefit obligation of the Group’s defined benefit pension plans are based on a number of selected 
assumptions, these include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth, longevity and expected return on the plans’ assets. 
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in future periods. The effect of 
changing these assumptions is described in note 10.
Revenue recognition
For revenue recognition purposes contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the 
commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being 
provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component. To the extent that a 
separate component comprises a product sale of hardware or software, revenue is recognised as described above. Revenue is 
recognised on other components as the Group fulfils its contractual obligations and to the extent that it has earned the right to 
consideration. Management exercises a degree of judgement in setting the criteria used for determining when revenue which 
involves several elements should be recognised.

Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of tax jurisdictions and judgement is applied in determining the worldwide 
provision for income taxes. There are many transactions for which the final tax determinability is uncertain. For example liabilities 
are recognised for anticipated tax audit issues based on whether additional taxes are likely to be due based on the facts and 
circumstances known at the time the financial statements are prepared. Where the final outcome differs from the amounts that 
were initially recorded the differences will be recorded in the future period in which the determination is made.
Deferred taxes
The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on current forecasts and estimates prepared by management. 
A change to these forecasts and estimates could result in a different recognition outcome.
Provisions
The Group records a provision for vacant property based on future rentals and reduced by its expected ability to sublease the vacant 
space to a third party. Provisions are discounted where the effect is significant. Changes in the actual outcome compared with the 
expected outcome on subleasing or changes to other assumptions will be recorded in future periods.
New standards and interpretations not applied
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for the Group after the date of

The Group’s organisational structure is based on differences in the products and services offered by each segment and information 
regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Executive Officer, its chief operating decision maker, is presented on this basis. The Group’s 
operating segments follow this structure, however where operating segments exhibit similar economic characteristics and are similar 
in nature they are aggregated into a single reportable segment. 
The Group’s reportable operating segments are Performance Analysis, Service Assurance and Systems. For presentational purposes 
the Group combines Performance Analysis and Service Assurance into the Communications operating group, its core activity. The 
Group evaluates segment operating profit before share-based payment, acquired intangible amortisation and exceptional items,  Spirent Communications plc

although there were no exceptional operating items in 2008 or 2009. Finance income and finance costs are not allocated to  
the reportable segments. Corporate is not an operating segment and costs are separately reported and not allocated to the 
reportable segments. 
Corporate assets comprise cash and cash equivalents held for central treasury purposes, acquired intangible assets and other 
corporate assets. Information on segment liabilities is not regularly provided to the Group’s Chief Executive Officer and is therefore 
not disclosed below.
The principal activities of each reportable operating segment are as follows:
Performance Analysis division of the Communications group develops testing solutions for a broad range of communications •	
technologies critical to the development of next-generation network equipment and devices.
Service Assurance division of the Communications group provides solutions to allow service providers to diagnose, troubleshoot •	
and determine how to resolve issues with networks and systems within the live network.
Systems group comprises PG Drives Technology, which develops power control systems for electrical vehicles in the mobility and •

The most recent actuarial valuations, at 1 April 2009, of the plans’ assets and the present value of the defined benefit plans’ 
obligations, using the projected unit credit method, have been used and updated by our independent actuaries.   
      
i) The key financial assumptions         
The assumptions used for both plans were as follows:        
        2009 2008 
        % %
Inflation        3.4 3.0
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries       3.9 3.5
Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service     3.7 3.6
Rate of increase for pensions in payment post 2001 pre April 2005 service    3.2 2.9
Rate of increase for pensions post April 2005 service      2.2 2.1
Rate of increase in deferred pensions       3.4 3.0
Rate used to discount plan liabilities       5.7 6.0
Expected rate of return on plan assets (weighted for both plans)     5.6 5.2
         
Spirent Communications plc employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return on plans’ assets. 
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely 
accepted capital market principles. The assumed long term rate of return on each class of asset is set out within this note.

The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return of each asset class over the actual 
asset allocation for the plans. 
 
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The assumptions 
are such that a member currently aged 68 (2008 aged 65) will live on average for a further 19.1 years (2008 21.7 years) if they are 
male and for a further 20.9 years (2008 24.0 years) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2019 (2008 in 2028) at age 64 
(2008 age 65) the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 23.6 years (2008 22.9 years) after retirement if they 
are male and for a further 25.5 years (2008 25.0 years) after retirement if they are female. 
 
The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows: 
 
Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum. This would increase past service liabilities by £2.0 million. •	
Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year (by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling •	
factor). This would increase past service liabilities by £4.3 million.     
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to  
be insignificant.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 1 January 2003 in the statement of comprehensive income is 
£13.1 million loss (2008 £11.7 million loss). The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension plan deficit recognised on 
1 January 2003 and taken directly to equity of £41.9 million in the Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception 
of those pension plans. Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would 
have been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income before 1 January 2003.

The above plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) tax-exempt approval. Certain members, whose 
salaries were in excess of the HMRC statutory earnings cap, had their benefits increased through unapproved unfunded arrangements, 
to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of basic salary only. The Group has contractually agreed to pay the 
additional retirement benefits itself and a provision is made in respect of this obligation in the balance sheet at 31 December 2009 
of £0.4 million (2008 £0.6 million). This represents the actuarial value as confirmed by the Group’s pension advisers, of the 
unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date. The value is assessed and reviewed on a market value basis in line with the 
main plan valuation and adjusted each year. There are no experience gains or losses in the period from 2005 to 2009 on the 
unfunded plan. 
 
Expected contributions for these plans for 2010 are £0.3 million. 
 
Defined contribution plans 
United Kingdom 
The Group maintains defined contribution pension plans for employees in the United Kingdom. Employer contributions into these 
plans for 2009 were £0.8 million (2008 £0.7 million).         
United States 
The Group maintains a defined contribution pension plan for employees of its United States subsidiaries. This plan, also known as a 
401(k) Plan, allows employees to defer a percentage of their salary for retirement. The investment choices offered by the plan are a 
selection of diversified mutual funds offering a broad mix of investment return potential with varying levels of risk. In aggregate, the 
Group contributions to the US plan totalled £2.0 million for 2009 (2008 £1.7 million). Total assets in the defined contribution plan at 
the end of 2009 were £76.8 million (2008 £62.1 million). There were no defined benefit plans in the United States in 2009 or 2008.

Other jurisdictions 
Outside the United Kingdom and the United States employees are provided with pension arrangements determined in accordance 
with approved local practice and regulations. These arrangements are defined contribution plans. Total contributions for 2009 in 
respect of these plans amounted to £0.3 million (2008 £0.2 million). 
 
Total contributions to defined contribution plans were £3.1 million (2008 £2.6 million).

Amortisation and impairment charges 
Goodwill at 31 December 2009 acquired through business combinations is all in the cash-generating unit Performance Analysis which 
is a reportable segment. There has been no goodwill impairment charged in 2009 or 2008. 
 
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives which are on average five years and the 
charge is included within administration expenses in the income statement. 
 
The remaining amortisation periods of the intangible asset balances arising in relation to customer list and current technology are 
1.2 years and 1.4 years, respectively. 
Annual impairment test 
The recoverable amount of the Performance Analysis cash-generating unit at 30 November 2009, the annual impairment testing 
date, has been determined based on a value in use calculation using management’s cash flow projections over a five year period. 
Cash flows in subsequent years have been extrapolated using a 2.75 per cent growth rate (2008 over a three year period and 
2.50 per cent) which management estimates to be the approximate average long term growth rate for the industries in which this 
unit operates. The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 17.6 per cent (2008 21.0 per cent). The 
recoverable amount of this unit, calculated on a value in use basis, was in excess of its carrying value and consequently no 
impairment has been recognised.

Key assumptions for the annual impairment test 
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation were: 
 
 Revenue growth rates •	
 Gross margin •	
 Operating expenses •	
 Discount rate •	
 Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the five year period covered by management’s projections •	
 
Projections are denominated in the same currency as the denomination of the goodwill balance to eliminate the effect of fluctuating 
exchange rates. 
 
Revenue growth rates used in management’s projections are based on management’s estimate of growth in the markets served. 
The cash flows used in the impairment review have been approved by the Board. 
Gross margins and operating expenses are based on historical values adjusted for the effect of revenue growth. 
 
The discount rate applied to the cash flows is based on the risk free rate for ten year government bonds adjusted for a risk premium 
to reflect both the increased risk associated with investing in equities and the systematic risk of the specific cash-generating unit. 
Long term growth rates are based upon management’s estimate. 
 
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions 
The directors believe that no reasonable possible change in any of the key assumptions used in isolation would cause the carrying 
value of Performance Analysis to exceed its recoverable amount.

A deferred tax asset of £26.4 million has been recognised at 31 December 2009 (2008 £12.2 million). £12.7 million is in the United 
Kingdom (2008 £6.1 million) and £13.7 million is in the United States (2008 £6.1 million). 
The deferred tax asset includes £3.3 million in respect of the tax deduction which may be available on the future exercise of 
share incentives (2008 nil) of which £1.1 million has been recognised in equity.    
     
The deferred tax liability arising on the United Kingdom pension plan surplus in 2008 has been offset as permitted by IAS 12 “Income 
Taxes”. Movements in deferred tax in relation to the pension plan have been charged to the statement of comprehensive income in 
2009 and 2008.     
All deferred tax assets on temporary differences, arising principally in the United Kingdom and United States, have been recognised 
at 31 December 2009 apart from £1.6 million in Canada. In 2008 £29.1 million of temporary differences were not recognised as there 
was insufficient evidence under IAS 12 to recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of these temporary differences. 
 
The Group has tax losses arising in the United Kingdom of £62.2 million (2008 £91.8 million) that are available for offset against 
suitable future taxable profits. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as their future recovery is 
uncertain. United Kingdom tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely. In total deferred tax assets amounting to £19.1 million 
(2008 £37.2 million) have not been recognised. Spirent Communications plc

25. Derivative financial instruments         
The derivative financial instruments are forward foreign currency exchange contracts.      
   
The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts in the management of transactional exchange rate exposures. These 
contracts are designated where possible as hedging instruments. 
 
At 31 December 2009 and 2008 the Group held various forward foreign currency exchange contracts in respect of the forward sale

The main purpose of the Group’s financial instruments, other than trade receivables, trade payables and provisions is to fund the 
Group’s liquidity requirements. 
 
All the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are categorised as loans and receivables with the exception of the derivative financial 
instruments which are measured at fair value. These are shown in the following table:

The Group enters into derivative transactions, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, for the management of the Group’s 
foreign currency exposures when deemed appropriate. 
 
The key objective of the Group treasury department is to manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that sufficient 
liquidity is available to the Group. All treasury activity operates within a formal control framework. The Board has approved treasury 
policies and guidelines and periodically reviews treasury activities. Additionally, it is the Group’s policy that speculative treasury 
transactions are expressly forbidden.

26. Financial instruments and financial risk management continued
a) Market risk 
The main types of market risk that affect the Group are interest rate risk and exchange rate risk. 
 
Interest rate risk 
The Group has no external debt and has limited exposure to interest rate risk. 
The Group’s excess funds are principally held in the United Kingdom and the United States and invested in short term bank deposits. 
It therefore has some exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in sterling and US dollar interest rates.  
 
Cash and cash equivalents, long term cash on deposit and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are the Group’s 
financial instruments which are exposed to interest rate risk. 
 
Short term bank deposits all mature within three months. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts all mature within one 
year. The financial instruments bear the following interest rates: 
      Effective  Effective  
      interest  interest  
      rate 2009 rate 2008 
      % £ million % £ million
Fixed rate 
Fixed deposits      0.42 66.7 1.26 32.3
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts (net)     0.5  (5.6)
       67.2  26.7
Floating rate 
Cash at bank and in hand       41.3  27.4
 
Interest rates on financial instruments classified as fixed rate are fixed until the maturity of the instrument. All fixed rate deposits 
mature within three months (2008 one week) after which date they will be exposed to floating rates of interest. 
 
In addition, £1.1 million (2008 £2.5 million) was held in a blocked trust account and was earning interest of 0.61 per cent at 
31 December 2009 (2008 1.75 per cent). The maturity of the deposit is three months (2008 less than one month), at maturity the 
interest rate will be reset. This cash must be retained in the blocked trust account in accordance with the terms of the undertakings 
made at the time of the cancellation of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve (the “Cancellation”) in 2004. 
The funds must remain in this account until creditors which existed at the date of the Cancellation have been repaid and therefore 
the maturity of this account is uncertain. 
 
Interest receivable for the year was £0.4 million (note 7) (2008 £3.1 million) and is under the effective interest method. 
 
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above table are non-interest bearing and are therefore not 
subject to interest rate risk. 
 
A movement of 50 basis points in interest rates based on levels of investment at 31 December 2009 would increase or reduce 
interest income and equity by £0.5 million. 
 
Exchange rate risk 
Currency exposures arise from trading transactions undertaken by the Group in foreign currencies and on the translation of the 
operating results and net assets of overseas subsidiaries. 
 
The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling but has significant operations in the United States, and its results 
can therefore be substantially affected on translation by movements in the US dollar to sterling exchange rate. The Group does not 
enter into instruments to hedge the translation exposure of the operating results or net assets of its overseas subsidiaries since these 
are accounting and not cash exposures. During the year, sterling has strengthened against the US dollar. The Group does not have 
any net investment hedges in place.

financial statements c on t in u e d Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2009

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
26. Financial instruments and financial risk management continued
The Group is not exposed to significant transactional foreign currency risk at 31 December 2009, nor at 31 December 2008, because 
the majority of its businesses do not enter into non-functional currency transactions. Where such  transactions do occur the Group 
enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts as appropriate. 
 
Group treasury, by means of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, carries out the transaction hedging activity in relation to 
normal trading activity. At 31 December 2009 the Group has hedged some of its 2010 US dollar forecast trading exposures at an 
average exchange rate of 1.57 US dollars to sterling (31 December 2008 at an average exchange rate of 1.76). At 31 December 2009 
the Group has also hedged some of its euro purchases at an average rate of 1.11. 
 
b) Credit risk 
Investment counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Board and as such short term deposits are limited to banks with 
a rating of Standard & Poor’s A or Moody’s A. There are pre-approved limits set for each bank to avoid any concentrations of 
credit risk. 
 
The maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date under financial instruments in relation to cash and bank deposits is equal 
to the carrying value of £109.1 million (2008 £62.2 million). 
 
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for 
uncollectable amounts where appropriate. Trade receivable exposures are managed in the business units where they arise. 
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on management’s assessment of the risk taking into account ageing profile, 
experience and circumstance. 
 
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk attributable to its trade receivables as the exposure is spread over a 
large number of customers with no one customer accounting for more than 10 per cent of total Group revenue. The maximum 
credit exposure at the balance sheet date in relation to trade receivables is equal to the carrying value of £41.9 million 
(2008 £52.2 million). 
 
The composition of trade receivables at 31 December is as follows: 
        2009 2008 
        £ million £ million
Neither impaired nor past due       27.3 29.5
Past due but not impaired: 
Less than 30 days overdue       9.7 14.7
30 to 60 days        2.0 3.8
Over 60 days        2.9 4.2
Trade receivables        41.9 52.2
 
The Group closely monitors amounts due from customers and performs activities such as credit checks and review of payment 
history and has put in place appropriate credit approval limits. Based on these procedures management assessed the quality of those 
receivables that are past due but not impaired as low risk. 
 
The movement on the receivables provision during the year is given in note 19. The value of impaired trade receivables is £1.3 million 
(2008 £1.9 million).

26. Financial instruments and financial risk management continued
c) Liquidity risk 
The Group’s objective is to ensure that there are sufficient sources of funding to meet projected requirements. Its operations are 
financed through cash and cash equivalents held centrally and cash generated from operations. 
 
At 31 December 2009 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of £108.0 million (2008 £59.7 million) all of which matures within 
three months (2008 one week). 
 
During 2009 the Group generated £61.2 million of cash from operating activities (2008 £47.7 million) and considers that with current 
cash resources, no debt and positive cash flow from its operating activities it has adequate resources available to it to remain in 
operational existence for the forseeable future. 
 
The Group has entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts all of which mature within one year. The gross settlement 
amounts of these contracts are as follows: 
        2009 2008 
        £ million £ million
Sale of US dollars against sterling       17.3 26.5
Purchase of euro against sterling       1.4 —
Gross settlement amounts        18.7 26.5
 
The Group is debt free and does not have loans payable. Financial liabilities, other than derivative financial liabilities, are trade and 
other payables, the majority of which are all due to be settled within one year, and provisions (note 24). 
 
The Group does not have any other material financial contractual commitments. 
 
d) Fair value of financial instruments 
The carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of fair value. 
 
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value. 
The fair value of currency derivatives is determined by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar 
maturity profiles, and is therefore determined to be a level 2 financial instrument as its value is based on observable market inputs. 
 
e) Capital management 
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to support its business and maximise shareholder value. The Group’s 
capital is its total shareholders’ funds. 
 
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions. During 2008 and 
2009 the Company has been operating an on-market share repurchase programme. In 2009 the Company repurchased 0.6 million of 
its Ordinary Shares at a cost of £0.6 million. In 2008 the Company repurchased 72.9 million of its Ordinary Shares at a cost of 
£42.2 million. In 2008 the Company also undertook a tender offer for the purchase of Ordinary Shares in the Company which resulted 
in a further 52.9 million Ordinary Shares being repurchased at a cost of £24.8 million.

During the year 0.3 million Ordinary Shares were transferred from the SST to satisfy options exercised under the UK all employee 
share schemes (2008 0.3 million) and 1.7 million Ordinary Shares were transferred from the ESOT to satisfy options exercised under 
the Spirent Stock Incentive Plan (2008 0.7 million).
There has been no material increase in the issued Ordinary Share capital, whether by exercise of share incentives or
otherwise, between 31 December 2009 and 4 March 2010, the date on which these financial statements have been signed.
b) Equity and reserves
The nature and purpose of each reserve within equity is as follows:
i) Share premium account: this reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal 
value;
ii) Capital redemption reserve: this reserve arises in relation to share capital cancellation;
iii) Capital reserve: this reserve arises in relation to share option plans in acquired companies;
iv)  Translation reserve: this reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of 
foreign subsidiaries; and
v)  Cash flow hedges: this reserve records movements in the fair value of effective forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
designated as hedging instruments.
Investment in own Ordinary Shares
At 31 December 2009, an amount of £175.5 million (2008 £176.0 million) has cumulatively been deducted from retained earnings in 
relation to the cost of investment in own Ordinary Shares.
At 31 December 2009, the ESOT held 5.4 million Ordinary Shares (2008 7.1 million Ordinary Shares) to satisfy awards under various 
share incentive plans. Of this number, 0.1 million Ordinary Shares were unconditionally vested at 31 December 2009 (2008 0.2 million 
Ordinary Shares). At 31 December 2009, the SST held 0.6 million Ordinary Shares (2008 0.9 million Ordinary Shares) to satisfy awards 
made to UK based employees under an all employee share scheme. The market value of own Ordinary Shares held in trust, being in 
total 6.0 million Ordinary Shares (2008 8.0 million Ordinary Shares) at 31 December 2009 was £6.1 million (2008 £2.9 million).
Cancellation of share premium and capital redemption reserves
On 24 November 2004, Spirent Communications plc was granted an order of the High Court for the approval of the cancellation of 
the share premium account and capital redemption reserve (the “Cancellation”) which stood at that date at £702.7 million and 
£0.7 million, respectively.
The Cancellation created a reserve in the financial statements of the Company which was applied to eliminate the deficit in 
distributable reserves. The balance of this reserve, created after the deficit in distributable reserves had been eliminated, was 
transferred to a special non-distributable reserve. During 2006 the Company transferred funds equal to the aggregate amount due to 
any creditors of Spirent Communications plc, who were creditors on 24 November 2004, and who still remained creditors, to a 
blocked trust account. Placing these funds in a blocked trust account in accordance with the undertakings made at the time of the 
Cancellation allowed the special reserve to be released to distributable reserves.
Capital redemption reserve
During 2009 the Company cancelled 0.6 million Ordinary Shares (2008 174.2 million Ordinary Shares) that had been the subject of the 
on-market share repurchase programme and, in 2008 the tender offer, and transferred £20,333 (2008 £5.8 million) to the capital 
redemption reserve.
Capital reserve
In 2009 the reserve has been reduced by £0.4 million (2008 £2.2 million) in relation to share incentives which have been
cancelled or have lapsed.
Share repurchase
During 2009 the Company repurchased 0.6 million Ordinary Shares on-market at a cost of £0.6 million (2008 72.9 million at a cost of 
£42.2 million). In addition, in 2008 the Company undertook a tender offer whereby it repurchased 52.9 million Ordinary Shares at a 
cost of £24.8 million. All Ordinary Shares repurchased have been subsequently cancelled.

Description of employee share plans         
2005 Employee Incentive Plan (“EIP”)
The EIP, which was introduced in 2005 and replaced the now closed ESOS (see below), is currently available for selected employees, 
including executive directors, on a discretionary basis.
Under the EIP, the Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC approved options, share-settled stock appreciation rights 
(“SARs”) and Performance shares. No price is payable on the grant of an award.
In normal circumstances, EIP awards vest three years following the date of grant provided the relevant performance conditions have 
been met. For share options and SARs, the performance conditions relate to the Company’s earnings per share (“EPS”) and for 
Performance shares, relate to total shareholder return (“TSR”).
Further information on the performance conditions for EIP share incentives is set out in the Report on directors’ remuneration on 
pages 34 and 35.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed or 
been exercised.
Spirent Stock Incentive Plan (“SSIP”)
The SSIP was introduced in 2000. This discretionary plan is primarily targeted at US employees with grants normally determined by 
reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing 
local market practice. Grants are also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis. Under the 
SSIP , the Company is able to grant share options and share-settled SARs. No price is payable on the grant of an award.
At the Annual General Meeting held in May 2009, shareholders approved the extension of the SSIP until the Company’s 2010 Annual 
General Meeting after which the plan will expire. The current shareholder approved mandate regarding the annual dilution rate is 
0.5 per cent of the issued Ordinary Share capital for both the SSIP and EIP in aggregate.

Annual Report 2009

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
29. Employee share plans continued
Most awards made pursuant to the SSIP vest over four years, provided that the participant remains in employment. Vesting is not 
normally subject to a performance condition and awards become 25 per cent exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant 
and thereafter in equal tranches on a monthly basis over a further 36 months. Any award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of 
the date of grant will lapse.
The vesting of the SSIP awards made to Bill Burns, prior to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, and to certain other key 
senior managers within the Communications group, are subject to the Company meeting EPS growth targets over the vesting 
periods. Further details of these performance conditions are set out in the Report on directors’ remuneration on page 35.
SARs granted under the EIP and SSIP will deliver the appreciation value (ie the increase in market value of an Ordinary Share over 
the base price of the SAR) in the form of Ordinary Shares. This “SARs approach” helps the Company manage its dilution headroom 
more efficiently as only the SAR gain needs to be funded. Using a SARs approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level of 
dilution until the SARs are exercised. At 31 December 2009, 1.9 million EIP SARs and 17.6 million SSIP SARs with an average base price 
of 50 pence and 56 pence respectively were outstanding (2008 2.2 million EIP SARs and 27.5 million SSIP SARs with an average base 
price of 50 pence and 56 pence respectively). During 2009, 9.4 million EIP and SSIP SARs were exercised resulting in the issue of 
3.1 million Ordinary Shares (2008 1.6 million Ordinary Shares were issued on the exercise of 5.4 million EIP and SSIP SARs).
1995 Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”)
The ESOS is now closed for new grants and has been replaced by the EIP referred to above.
Under the ESOS awards of share options, including HMRC approved options, were on a discretionary basis. No price was payable on 
the grant of an option and no options were granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant. 
Options awarded under the ESOS were subject to the achievement of an EPS performance condition before they could be exercised. 
All outstanding options have now passed their EPS performance conditions and remain exercisable until they expire on the tenth 
anniversary of their respective grant dates.
Acquisition plans
Netcom Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan (“NARSOP”)
Spirent completed the acquisition of Netcom Systems, Inc. (“Netcom”) in 1999. $44.5 million of the total consideration was satisfied 
through the roll-over of outstanding options over Netcom shares into options over approximately 23.8 million Ordinary Shares (as 
adjusted) on substantially similar terms as previously existed. At 31 December 2009 there were no remaining exercisable options 
under this plan and it will be formally closed during 2010.
Zarak Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan (“ZARSOP”)
Out of a total consideration of approximately 44.9 million Ordinary Shares issued for the acquisition of Zarak Systems Corporation 
(“Zarak”) in 2000, approximately 3.8 million Ordinary Shares arose in connection with the roll-over of outstanding options over Zarak 
shares into options over Spirent Ordinary Shares on substantially similar terms as previously existed. Any remaining outstanding 
ZARSOP options have a ten year life from the original date of grant and will therefore expire if not exercised during 2010 and the 
plan will be formally closed.
Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan (“CARSP”)
Out of a total initial consideration for the acquisition of Caw Networks, Inc. (“Caw”) in 2002 of $49 million, approximately $4 million 
was in respect of Spirent Ordinary Shares and options which arose on the roll-over of outstanding options and shares under the 
previous Caw employee stock plan. The options and shares vested over a period ending in 2006 on substantially similar terms as 
previously existed. The options have a ten year life from the original date of grant. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement 
for Caw, an additional cash payment of 78.8 US cents was payable as each share vested or upon the exercise of a vested option. No 
further award can be made under this plan.
The Ordinary Shares subject to rolled-over options from the acquisition of Netcom, Zarak and Caw, or granted under the SSIP, do not 
count towards ABI scheme limits.  Spirent Communications plc

29. Employee share plans continued
UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme (“SRSOS”) and the 2005 Sharesave Scheme 
The SRSOS closed in 2005 and was replaced by the 2005 Sharesave Scheme. SRSOS options which remain outstanding may still be 
exercised prior to expiry, however no further grants can be made. Both schemes operate as HMRC approved Save-As-You-Earn 
schemes and are open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period. Any future sharesave invitations will be made 
under the 2005 Sharesave Scheme, which is broadly similar to the SRSOS.
No price is payable on the grant of an option. The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market closing price 
of an Ordinary Share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up to 20 per cent at the 
Board’s discretion. Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the contract 
commencement date as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
The Company operates the SST to honour the commitment to deliver Ordinary Shares against the exercise of outstanding options 
under the SRSOS. Spirent Sharesave Trust Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirent Communications plc, acts as sole trustee of 
the SST. During the year, 0.3 million Ordinary Shares were transferred to participants (2008 0.3 million Ordinary Shares).
No invitations have been made under either of these schemes since 2003.
US Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
The ESPP enables the Company to grant eligible US employees the right to acquire Spirent American Depositary Shares using the 
proceeds of a savings contract. When joining the ESPP, participants enter into a 12 month contract to save up to 15 per cent of basic 
salary subject to an individual limit of $1,000 per month.
No offer has been made under this plan since 2003.
Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan (“GAESPP”)
The GAESPP was approved by shareholders in 2001 and offers employees in countries other than the UK or US an opportunity to 
share in the Company’s performance through share ownership. The GAESPP was implemented in Canada in January 2002 and 
operates on similar terms to the ESPP above, with participants entering into a 12 month contract to save up to 15 per cent of basic 
salary subject to an individual maximum of Cdn $1,000 per month.
No offer has been made under this plan since 2003.
UK Employee Share Purchase Plan (“UK ESPP”)
The UK ESPP, which is based on an HMRC approved share incentive plan, was approved by shareholders in 2005 and is available to all 
UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period. The UK ESPP offers three ways to provide Ordinary Shares to employees: free 
shares, partnership shares and matching shares. The UK ESPP will operate in conjunction with a trust, which will hold the shares on 
behalf of participants.
To date, no awards have been made under this plan.
Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (“SARP”)
The SARP was introduced in September 1999 as an interim incentive arrangement for the employees of Netcom following the closure 
of the NARSOP described above and subsequently for certain other employees in the Communications group. Rights under the SARP 
vested over four years, 25 per cent vesting one year after the date of grant and the remainder vesting on a monthly basis over a 
further 36 months. Rights granted were not subject to the fulfilment of any performance conditions.
The SARP will deliver the appreciation value (ie the aggregated increase in the market value of an Ordinary Share over the rights 
price) in the form of existing Ordinary Shares which have been purchased in the market by the Company’s ESOT. The SARP is closed 
and no further grants can be made under it.
At 31 December 2009, 1.0 million (2008 1.5 million) rights were outstanding at rights prices of 335p to 416p. The plan will expire 
in 2010.

All schemes are equity-settled. 
 
The fair value of share incentives is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model. The following table gives the 
assumptions made in arriving at the share-based payment charge and the fair value: 
 
        2009 2008
Weighted average share price (pence)       96.3 55.9
Weighted average exercise price (pence)       3.9 40.5
Weighted average fair value (pence)       29.4 19.3
Expected volatility (%)        53—55 40—45
Expected life (years)        4.5 4.5
Risk free rate (%)        2.4—2.5 3.7—4.9
Dividend yield (%)        2.0 2.0
 
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous two 
years which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility. The expected life 
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations. For Performance shares granted under the 2005 Employee Incentive Plan, which have a 
market based performance condition, it has been assumed that there will be 30 per cent vesting for valuation purposes.

2009 which comprise the Parent Company balance sheet and the 
related notes 1 to 21. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 29, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the parent Company financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements

give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs •	
as at 31 December 2009;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United •

the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the

audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
the information given in the Report of the directors’ for the •	
financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the parent Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the •	
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
the parent Company financial statements and the part of the •	
Report on directors’ remuneration to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by •	
law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we •	
require for our audit.

As the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements, made up to 31 December each year, it is not required to 
present a separate profit and loss account as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
New Accounting Standards
The Company has adopted the amendments to FRS 2, FRS 6 and FRS 28 “Amendments for Companies Act Changes”, the Amendment 
to FRS 20 “Vesting Conditions and Cancellations” and the Amendments to UITF 42 and FRS 26 “Embedded Derivatives and 
Reclassification”. The adoption of these amendments had no impact on the net results or net assets of the Company.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The carrying value of 
intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be 
recoverable.
Purchased goodwill, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of assets acquired, is written off on a straight line basis from 
the date of acquisition over 20 years, being its anticipated useful life.
Tangible assets
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of all other assets, less residual value, 
on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location. 
Usual asset lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings    50 years  
Plant and machinery    3 to 8 years  
Fixtures, fittings and equipment
Building installations    20 years or lease period if less 
Fittings and equipment    3 to 8 years  
Motor vehicles    3 to 5 years  
Business systems software    4 years 
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments
Fixed asset investments, including investment in subsidiaries, are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indications 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease on a straight line basis.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to its 
present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including all attributable overheads 
based on a normal level of activity. Net realisable value represents the selling price less further costs to be incurred to completion 
and on sale.
Trade and other debtors
Trade debtors, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for 
any uncollectable amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad 
debts are written off when identified. Spirent Communications plc

Provisions
Provisions are recorded when the Company has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event for which it is 
probable that it will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the 
obligation can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the 
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company, the revenue can be reliably 
measured and when the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership. In addition, revenue is 
only recognised when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. All 
exchange profits and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
Product development
Expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in 
foreign currencies relating to firm commitments or highly probable forecast transactions. Such derivative financial instruments are 
initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at 
each reported balance sheet date. The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is calculated by reference to 
current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. 
 
The Company has designated its forward foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of 
contracts which are designated as effective are recognised directly in equity and the gain or loss on the ineffective portion of the 
hedge is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account. For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting any gains or 
losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the profit and loss account. For effective hedges that are in relation to a 
financial asset or liability, amounts originally deferred are recognised in the profit and loss account in the same period in which the 
hedged item affects profit or loss, for example when a highly probable sale occurs. For non-financial assets or liabilities, the gains or 
losses that have been included in equity are included in the initial measurement of the non-financial asset or liability at the time the 
asset or liability is recognised on the balance sheet. 
 
The Company discontinues hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no 
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Company revokes designation. 
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments, which are cancelled due to termination of the underlying exposure, are taken to the 
profit and loss account immediately.

1. Significant accounting policies continued
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts. 
Pensions
The Company operates two defined benefit pension plans. All other plans are defined contribution in nature where the amount 
charged to the profit and loss account is the contributions paid or payable during the year.
For defined benefit pension plans full actuarial valuations are carried out every three years using the projected unit credit method, 
and updates are performed at each balance sheet date. The cost of providing benefits under these plans is determined separately 
for each plan, and attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine current service cost), and to the current 
and prior periods (to determine the present value of defined benefit obligations).
Past services are recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis or immediately if the benefits have vested. When 
a settlement (eliminating all obligations for benefits already accrued), or a curtailment (reducing future obligations as a result of a 
material reduction in the plan membership or a reduction in future entitlement) occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are 
remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in the profit and loss account during the 
period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
The interest element of the defined benefit pension plan cost represents the change in present value of plan obligations resulting 
from the passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, 
taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year. 
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on 
plan assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received, and benefits paid during the year. The 
difference between the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the profit and loss account as finance 
costs or finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets, experience adjustments on 
liabilities and changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The defined benefit pension plan asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds denominated in the same currency and 
whose term is consistent with the estimated term of the obligation). Fair value is based on market price information and, in the 
case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any 
unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount the Company expects to recover, by way of reductions in the 
future contributions or refunds from the plan that have been agreed by the trustees. 
Treasury shares
Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders’ equity as treasury shares and 
are recognised at cost and shown as a deduction from retained earnings. Consideration received for the sale of such Ordinary 
Shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to 
retained earnings.
Employee benefits
When an employee has rendered service to the Company during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to be paid in 
exchange for that service are recognised in the same accounting period.
Dividends paid
The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period it is approved by the directors, and the final dividend in 
the period it is approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting. Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2009

Share-based payment
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are 
granted. The fair value is determined using a binomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised as a cost to the Company or as an addition to the cost of investment in the 
subsidiary in which the relevant employees work, over the vesting period of the equity-settled transactions with a corresponding 
adjustment to reserves. Any payments received from the Company’s subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments result 
in a reduction in the cost of investment.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
vesting conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been 
modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as 
measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and designated 
as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of 
the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The Company has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees. Shares are held by the 
employee share trust, treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity. 
T ax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable represents the amount expected to be paid or recovered in respect of taxable profit for the year and is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on an undiscounted basis on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date except as referred to below. Amounts provided are calculated with reference to tax rates that are expected to apply 
in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable 
profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not provided on gains on the disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, unless there 
is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned. Provision will not be made where it is considered more likely than not 
that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only when the replacement assets are sold.

Defined benefit plans 
The defined benefit pension plans are in the United Kingdom and comprise the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension & Life 
Assurance Plan (“Staff Plan”) and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan (“Cash Plan”). The Staff 
Plan is the Company’s most significant plan. There is in addition an unfunded plan.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
3. Pensions continued
The most recent actuarial valuations, at 1 April 2009, of the plans’ assets and the present value of the defined benefit plans’ 
obligations, using the projected unit credit method, have been used and updated by our independent actuaries. 
 
i) The key financial assumptions
The assumptions used for both plans were as follows: 
        2009  2008 
        %  %
Inflation        3.4  3.0
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries       3.9  3.5
Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service     3.7  3.6
Rate of increase for pensions in payment post 2001 pre April 2005 service    3.2  2.9
Rate of increase for pensions post April 2005 service      2.2  2.1
Rate of increase in deferred pensions       3.4  3.0
Rate used to discount plan liabilities       5.7  6.0
Expected rate of return on plan assets (weighted for both plans)     5.6  5.2
Spirent Communications plc employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return on the plans’ assets. 
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted 
capital market principles. The assumed long term rate of return on each class of asset is set out within this note. The overall expected 
rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return of each asset class over the actual asset allocation for 
the plans. 
 
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The assumptions 
are such that a member currently aged 68 (2008 aged 65) will live on average for a further 19.1 years (2008 21.7 years) if they are 
male and for a further 20.9 years (2008 24.0 years) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2019 (2008 in 2028) at age 64 
(2008 aged 65) the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 23.6 years (2008 22.9 years) after retirement if they 
are male and for a further 25.5 years (2008 25.0 years) after retirement if they are female. 
 
The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows: 
 
Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum. This would increase past service liabilities by £2.0 million. •	
Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year (by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling •	
factor). This would increase past service liabilities by £4.3 million. 
 
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to 
be insignificant.

The recognition of the surplus in the Staff Plan was restricted in 2008 to the present value of economic benefits available in the 
form of refunds from the Plan or reductions in future contributions to the Plan. As a result only £1.6 million of the £2.3 million 
surplus has been recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2008.  
 
The recognition of the surplus in the Cash Plan is restricted in 2009 to the present value of economic benefits available in the form 
of refunds from the Plan or reductions in future contributions to the Plan. As a result only £0.3 million of  the £0.8 million surplus has 
been recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2009.  
 
The plans are prohibited from investing in Spirent’s own financial instruments. 
 
For the purposes of the following disclosures the two plans have been combined as the Cash Plan is immaterial to these

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 1 January 2003 in the Company’s statement of total recognised 
gains and losses is £13.6 million loss (2008 £12.4 million loss). The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension plan 
deficit recognised on 1 January 2003 and taken directly to equity of £41.9 million in the Company is attributable to actuarial gains 
and losses since inception of those pension plans. Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains 
and losses that would have been recognised in the Company’s statement of recognised gains and losses before 1 January 2003.

Expected cash contributions for 2010 for these plans are £0.3 million. 
 
The above plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) tax-exempt approval. Certain members, whose 
salaries were in excess of the HMRC statutory earnings cap, had their benefits increased through unapproved unfunded 
arrangements, to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of basic salary only. The Company has contractually  
agreed to pay the additional retirement benefits itself and a provision is made in respect of this obligation in the balance sheet at 
31 December 2009 of £0.4 million (2008 £0.6 million). This represents the actuarial value, as confirmed by the Company’s pension 
advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date. The value is assessed and reviewed on a market value basis 
in line with the main plan valuation. There are no experience gains or losses on the unfunded plan in the period from 2005 to 2009.

The Company also maintains defined contribution pension plans for employees. Employer contributions into these plans for 2009

16. Capital and reserves continued
During the year 0.3 million Ordinary Shares were transferred from the SST to satisfy options exercised under the UK all employee 
share schemes (2008 0.3 million) and 1.7 million Ordinary Shares were transferred from the ESOT to satisfy options exercised under 
the Spirent Stock Incentive Plan (2008 0.7 million).
There has been no material increase in the issued Ordinary Share capital, whether by exercise of share incentives or otherwise, 
between 31 December 2009 and 4 March 2010, the date on which these financial statements have been signed.
Investment in own Ordinary Shares
At 31 December 2009, the ESOT held 5.4 million Ordinary Shares (2008 7.1 million Ordinary Shares) to satisfy awards under various 
share incentive plans. Of this number, 0.1 million Ordinary Shares were unconditionally vested at 31 December 2009 (2008 0.2 million 
Ordinary Shares). At 31 December 2009, the SST held 0.6 million Ordinary Shares (2008 0.9 million Ordinary Shares) to satisfy awards 
made to UK based employees under an all employee share scheme. The market value of own Ordinary Shares held in trust, being in 
total 6.0 million Ordinary Shares (2008 8.0 million Ordinary Shares), at 31 December 2009 was £6.1 million (2008 £2.9 million).
Capital redemption reserve
During 2009 the Company cancelled 0.6 million Ordinary Shares that had been the subject of the on-market share repurchase 
programme (2008 174.2 million Ordinary Shares, on-market share repurchase and tender offer) and transferred £20,333  
(2008 £5.8 million) to the capital redemption reserve.
Capital reserve
In 2009 the reserve has been reduced by £0.4 million (2008 £2.2 million) in relation to share incentives which have been cancelled or 
have lapsed.
Share repurchase
During 2009 the Company repurchased 0.6 million Ordinary Shares on-market at a cost of £0.6 million (2008 72.9 million Ordinary 
Shares at a cost of £42.2 million). In addition, in 2008 the Company undertook a tender offer whereby it repurchased 52.9 million 
Ordinary Shares at a cost £24.8 million. All Ordinary Shares repurchased have been subsequently cancelled.

vesting of a performance share. 
Description of employee share plans 
2005 Employee Incentive Plan (“EIP”) 
The EIP, which was introduced in 2005 and replaced the now closed ESOS (see below), is currently available for selected employees, 
including executive directors, on a discretionary basis.
Under the EIP, the Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC approved options, share-settled stock appreciation rights 
(“SARs”) and Performance shares. No price is payable on the grant of an award.
In normal circumstances, EIP awards vest three years following the date of grant provided the relevant performance conditions have 
been met. For share options and SARs, the performance conditions relate to the Company’s earnings per share (“EPS”) and for 
Performance shares, relate to total shareholder return (“TSR”).
Further information on the performance conditions for EIP share incentives is set out in the Report on directors’ remuneration on 
pages 34 and 35.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed or  
been exercised.
Spirent Stock Incentive Plan (“SSIP”)
The SSIP was introduced in 2000. This discretionary plan is primarily targeted at US employees with grants normally determined by 
reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing 
local market practice. Grants are also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis. Under the 
SSIP, the Company is able to grant share options and share-settled SARs. No price is payable on the grant of an award.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
16. Capital and reserves continued
At the Annual General Meeting held in May 2009, shareholders approved the extension of the SSIP until the Company’s 2010 Annual 
General Meeting after which the plan will expire. The current shareholder approved mandate regarding the annual dilution rate is 
0.5 per cent of the issued Ordinary Share capital for both the SSIP and EIP in aggregate. 
 
Most awards made pursuant to the SSIP vest over four years, provided that the participant remains in employment. Vesting is not 
normally subject to a performance condition and awards become 25 per cent exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant 
and thereafter in equal tranches on a monthly basis over a further 36 months. Any award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of 
the date of grant will lapse.  
The vesting of the SSIP awards made to Bill Burns, prior to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, and to certain other key 
senior managers within the Communications group, are subject to the Company meeting EPS growth targets over the vesting 
periods. Further details of these performance conditions are set out in the Report on directors’ remuneration on page 35. 
 
SARs granted under the EIP and SSIP will deliver the appreciation value (ie the increase in market value of an Ordinary Share over 
the base price of the SAR) in the form of Ordinary Shares. This “SARs approach” helps the Company manage its dilution headroom 
more efficiently as only the SAR gain needs to be funded. Using a SARs approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level of 
dilution until the SARs are exercised. 
 
1995 Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”) 
The ESOS is now closed for new grants and has been replaced by the EIP referred to above. 
 
Under the ESOS awards of share options, including HMRC approved options, were on a discretionary basis. No price was payable on 
the grant of an option and no options were granted at a discount to the market price. 
 
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant. 
Options awarded under the ESOS were subject to the achievement of an EPS performance condition before they could be exercised. 
All outstanding options have now passed their EPS performance conditions and remain exercisable until they expire on the tenth 
anniversary of their respective grant dates. 
 
UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme (“SRSOS”) and the 2005 Sharesave Scheme 
The SRSOS closed in 2005 and was replaced by the 2005 Sharesave Scheme. SRSOS options which remain outstanding may still be 
exercised prior to expiry, however no further grants can be made. Both schemes operate as HMRC approved Save-As-You-Earn 
schemes and are open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period. Any future sharesave invitations will be made 
under the 2005 Sharesave Scheme, which is broadly similar to the SRSOS. 
 
No price is payable on the grant of an option. The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market closing price 
of an Ordinary Share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up to 20 per cent at the 
Board’s discretion. Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the contract 
commencement date as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract. 
 
The Company operates the SST to honour the commitment to deliver Ordinary Shares against the exercise of outstanding options 
under the SRSOS. Spirent Sharesave Trust Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirent Communications plc, acts as sole trustee of 
the SST. During the year, 0.3 million Ordinary Shares were transferred to participants (2008 0.3 million Ordinary Shares). 
 
No invitations have been made under either of these schemes since 2003. 
 
UK Employee Share Purchase Plan (“UK ESPP”) 
The UK ESPP, which is based on an HMRC approved share incentive plan, was approved by shareholders in 2005 and is available to all 
UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period. The UK ESPP offers three ways to provide Ordinary Shares to employees: free 
shares, partnership shares and matching shares. The UK ESPP will operate in conjunction with a trust, which will hold the shares on 
behalf of participants.
To date, no awards have been made under this plan.       Spirent Communications plc

17. Share-based payment
The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payment plans is as follows:
        2009 2008 
        £ million £ million
1995 Executive Share Option Scheme       — 0.1
2005 Employee Incentive Plan       0.1 0.2
All employee share plans        — 0.1
        0.1 0.4
All schemes are equity-settled.
The fair value of share incentives is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model. The following table gives the 
assumptions made in arriving at the share-based payment charge and the fair value:
        2009 2008
Weighted average share price (pence)       97.8 50.5
Weighted average exercise price (pence)       — 25.3
Weighted average fair value (pence)       29.3 16.7
Expected volatility (%)        53.0 45.0
Expected life (years)        4.5 4.5
Risk free rate (%)        2.4 3.7
Dividend yield (%)        2.0 2.0
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous two 
years which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility. The expected life 
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations. For Performance shares granted under the 2005 Employee Incentive Plan, which have a 
market based performance condition, it has been assumed that there will be 30 per cent vesting for valuation purposes.
18. Related party transactions 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 8 “Related Party Disclosures” in relation to disclosing transactions 
with its subsidiaries. 
19. Subsidiaries 
A list of the significant investments in subsidiaries, including the name, country of incorporation and proportion of ownership 
interest is given on page 101 of this Annual Report. 
20. Capital commitments and contingent liabilities 
There were no capital commitments at 31 December 2009 or 31 December 2008. 
 
Spirent Communications plc has provided indemnities of £0.4 million (2008 £0.5 million) for certain ongoing business obligations 
under letters of credit for subsidiary companies. 
21. Directors’ emoluments and transactions with directors 
Please refer to the Report on directors’ remuneration on pages 33 to 40 for disclosures relating to the remuneration, share 
incentives and pensions of the directors.

Dividends
Shareholders are able to choose how they receive their dividends:
direct to their bank account; •	
reinvested in Ordinary Shares through the Company’s Dividend Reinvestment Plan (see below); •	
paid by cheque; or •	
paid in foreign currencies. •	
The quickest and most efficient way to receive your dividends is to have them paid direct to your bank account. It saves waiting for 
funds to clear and reduces the paper and postage we use. To change how you receive your dividends please contact the Company’s 
registrar, Equiniti, on 0871 384 2623 or log on to www.shareview.co.uk
Dividend reinvestment plan
The Company has a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”) delivered by Equiniti Financial Services Limited. The DRIP allows eligible 
shareholders to use their cash dividend to buy additional shares in the Company, so increasing their shareholding. If you would like 
additional information, please contact the Company’s registrar, Equiniti, on 0871 384 2623 or log on to www.shareview.co.uk.
Electronic communications
At its 2008 AGM the Company passed a resolution allowing it to communicate with shareholders by means of the Company’s website 
and an invitation to opt out of receiving mailings solely by electronic communication was sent to shareholders with the 2009 AGM 
documentation. Shareholders who have purchased their shares since that invitation was distributed in March 2009 but who wish to 
receive company mailings electronically should notify the Company’s registrar, Equiniti, on 0871 384 2126 or via www.shareview.co.uk. 
In line with this policy, the Company’s Half-year Results will in future only be available on the Company’s website at www.spirent.com.
Electronic communications provide significant benefits for shareholders and the Company in terms of timeliness of information, 
reduced environmental impact and cost and the Board would encourage investors to participate in the programme.  Spirent Communications plc

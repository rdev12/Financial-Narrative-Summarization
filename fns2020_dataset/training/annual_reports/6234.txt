CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2010 
3 
 
This annual report is published as Freshwater is beginning a new phase of its development as an unlisted 
Company once again and with a focus on profitable organic growth. 
 
An Extraordinary General Meeting (‘EGM’) on 15 November 2010 voted 9:1 to delist from the Alternative 
Investment Market (‘AIM’), accepting a Board recommendation that it was in the best interests of the Company 
and shareholders as a whole. 
 
The Board had concluded that: firstly, changed circumstances meant AIM was unlikely to be a vehicle for 
growth funding for a Company of our size in the foreseeable future; and, secondly, de-listing would release 
some immediate cost savings while also allowing Directors’ and managers’ to devote all their time to building 
shareholder value. 
 
While we are disappointed not to be able to pursue our original strategy, we believe the Company has a robust 
business model and considerable potential for development.  
 
Freshwater is the only national PR and marketing Group that combines a complete UK network with wide-
ranging sectoral and specialist expertise. We have teams in every nation and region and the capacity to meet 
multiple client communication needs in multiple locations, online or offline. 
 
Freshwater won awards in 2009-10 for our work for John Lewis, Basque Wines, Specsavers and Donate 
Wales. Our team involved in golf’s 2010 Ryder Cup was publicly described as ‘magnificent’ by the organisers. 
And our stakeholder communications support for National Grid plc was rewarded last April with selection for 
their supplier framework for another two years. 
 
While it has not been the easiest of periods in many of our markets, these results (for the period to 31 August 
2010) show we have managed to maintain profitability and generate cash to reduce liabilities substantially.  
 
Moreover, we have started the 2010-11 trading year encouragingly well and are trading profitably in line with 
the Board’s budget. 
 
As promised at the EGM, the Board will provide shareholders with regular updates through a quarterly 
newsletter, the maintenance of an investor section of the website and the publication of half year and full year 
results. We also look forward to seeing you at the Annual General Meeting on 27 January 2011. 
 
Finally, I would like to thank my fellow Directors’, the Company’s senior managers and all the staff for their 
hard work and professionalism. It has been a very tough year, but we can take pride in the fact that 
Freshwater is a profitable operation providing high quality services to hundreds of valued clients.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2010 
4
 
Freshwater has completed its tenth year of trading with its record of consistently operating profitably intact and 
having substantially reduced its liabilities. 
 
Despite exceptionally tough economic conditions, the Group delivered an EBITDA of £0.49m (before making a 
goodwill impairment of £0.76m) on revenue of £5.43m.  
 
At the same time, the statement of financial position was markedly strengthened by a reduction in liabilities 
from bank borrowings, tax and deferred consideration from £2.06m to £1.37m.  
 
This was achieved by a combination of generating cash from trading and raising £0.4m for working capital 
from an Open Offer to shareholders in April (after expenses and the costs and consideration relating to the 
acquisition of Profileplus UK Limited in Edinburgh). 
 
Financial Review 
 
The maintenance of profitability and a reduction in liabilities were all the more remarkable in the context of the 
impact on Freshwater’s markets of the recession, political uncertainties and cuts in public spending.  
 
Overall, annual revenue of £5.43m was 19% below the £6.70m achieved in the previous year and additional 
cost savings of more than £1.3m were required to protect margins.  
 
Almost all parts of the business were affected to some degree by the adverse trading conditions. However, our 
stakeholder communications work for National Grid plc grew 35% and the Creative division had a strong 
second half, mainly as a result of winning a substantial contract to provide marketing and event management 
support for Wales, The True Taste Awards. 
 
Profitability increased in the second half as a whole as the benefits of cost savings came through. However, 
this was mainly because of a strong third quarter in which EBITDA reached 15%. The final quarter saw 
EBITDA drop to 8% because several NHS communication projects were put on hold due to an unexpected 
Government decision to reorganise healthcare. 
 
The Group has nevertheless started its 2010-11 trading year encouragingly well with the business trading 
profitably and revenue holding steady in the first quarter. Meanwhile, we have also secured confirmation of 
several major projects that will underpin the rest of the year. 
 
The Board’s primary objective is to achieve sufficient profitable growth in 2010-11 to largely eliminate the 
Group’s remaining bank and earn-out liabilities by the year end, thus creating a strong financial platform for 
further growth. Following the decision by shareholders to de-list from AIM, the management team is in a 
position to focus all its energy on this goal.  
 
Dividend 
 
No interim dividend was paid during the year, and the Board is recommending that there should also not be a 
final dividend in order to conserve cash to improve the Group’s financial position. We are, however, conscious 
of the importance of giving shareholders an ongoing return on their investment and will resume dividend 
payments at an appropriate level as soon as circumstances permit. 
 
Operational Review 
 
Freshwater’s competitive advantage derives from it being the only national PR and marketing Group that offers 
a complete UK-wide network of offices. 
 
The Group continues, despite the downsizing of the last two years, to have a presence in all the nations and 
regions of the UK and is able to provide major national clients with multiple services in multiple locations, 
online and offline. 
 
Clients for whom Freshwater provided a mix of services in more than one location in 2009-10 include John 
Lewis, E.On, National Grid, High Speed Rail, Kingspan, Basque Wines, Specsavers, Football Association of 
Wales and Ryder Cup Europe.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2010 
5 
 
Significant new business successes since the interim results include: 
 
• Life Communications appointed to work on General Mills brands El Paso and Green Giant in 2010 and 
will be working across a wider portfolio in 2011, including Nature Valley and Betty Crocker. 
• Public Affairs won projects for Deutsche Bahn, First Transpennine Express, Leeds City Region 
Partnership, Forth Ports, RAC Foundation and Inchcape Shipping.  
• Technology team expanded its role for Morgan Crucible plc to cover Thermal Ceramics as well as 
Technical Ceramics. 
• Profileplus chosen to handle destination PR for Scotland’s Islands, appointed by distiller Morrison 
Bowmore and given a wider brief by the Drambuie Liqueur Company. 
• Glasgow office commissioned to handle projects for Bellway and Redrow for first time for two years 
• Mixed Creative and PR team produced 150-page document for a Football Association of Wales bid to 
host a major European event. 
• Cardiff appointed to provide consultancy and PR for the University of Wales. 
• Wales team’s Ryder Cup contract extended to April 2011 to cover legacy PR. 
• Consumer team won further contract with online and catalogue retailers, Bon Prix. 
• Creative commissioned on a variety of event, DVD, media buying and other marketing projects for 
clients such as Cardiff Harbour Authority, Linde, Castleoak, Harp International and Barry Waterfront 
(Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey, Barratt).  
• Selected for Welsh Assembly Government supplier matrix for creative and event services. 
 
In addition, Freshwater is handling a number of new projects for National Grid plc since being selected in April 
2010 for its supplier framework for another two years. The Group is currently undertaking work for National 
Grid covered by purchase orders with an unspent value of £0.68m, including initial stakeholder engagement 
for the North West Coast Connections. 
 
The Group provided services to a total of 303 clients during 2009-10. The largest client was National Grid plc 
with 14% (£0.76m) of revenue. The top 20 clients, including National Grid, accounted for 51% (£2.80m) of 
revenue. 
 
Client revenue from each sector in 2009-10 was as follows (prior year in brackets): 
 
Public sector      23% (22%) 
Consumer and retail    22% (18%) 
Transport      16% (20%) 
Utilities      14% (11%) 
Housing and property    8% (8%) 
Professional and business services  7% (9%) 
Industry and technology    5% (7%) 
Leisure and hospitality    4% (1%) 
Other       1% (4%)     
 
The public sector revenue share reflects the strong performance of Healthcare until the final quarter and 
Creative’s success in being appointed to handle the marketing and event management for the Wales, The 
True Taste Awards. While the latter is confirmed for 2011, work in the NHS remains unpredictable and the 
Group currently receives less than 15% of its revenue from the public sector. 
 
Consumer and retail revenue remains healthy because of a strong performance by Life Communications in 
Ireland and work in Britain for clients such as John Lewis, Bon Prix and Specsavers. 
 
Revenue from transport clients fell in the year, but this was mainly because they use our specialist Public 
Affairs service, which was affected by the General Election. We see transport as a growth area in 2010-11, 
with prospects for providing a wider range of services. 
 
Utilities is another growth area, not only because of the increasing requirements of National Grid but also 
because there are more major investment projects in the energy sector requiring stakeholder communications. 
 
Leisure and Hospitality has emerged as a significant sector because of the acquisition of Profileplus in 
Edinburgh, and we see potential for building on this.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2010

Strategy 
 
Freshwater’s strategy of concentrating on profitable organic growth is summed up in an action plan we are 
calling ‘Focus on Fundamentals’. 
 
The main points of the first phase of the plan, most of which have been implemented, are: 
 
• Reducing the number of profit centres from 12 to 7 in 2010-11 
• Appointing Managing Directors’ responsible for profit centres and incentivised to deliver their budgets 
• Creating a new 10 strong operational management team consisting of Executive Directors’ and MDs 
• Focusing Group new business activity around growth specialisms such as stakeholder communications 
and digital media and growth sectors such as energy and transport 
• Producing new marketing collateral, including separate websites aimed at growth sectors 
• Further tightening discipline in relation to costs, debtors and cash flow 
• Introducing a common system of account management planning to maximise utilisation of staff time and 
increase revenue per head. 
• Appointing a Director responsible for best practice and innovation to enhance client service, 
development and retention.  
  
The strategy is still evolving, and we look forward to giving shareholders an update at the AGM in January.

The Directors’ present their report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31
 
August 2010. 
 
Principal Activities  
 
Freshwater Group (‘the Group’ or ‘Freshwater’) comprises Freshwater UK Plc (the ‘Company’) and its 
subsidiary undertakings. The Group’s principal activity is the provision of public relations and marketing 
services. The Company operates as a service Company providing staff and administrative services to other 
Group members.  
 
Business Review  
 
A review of the Group’s business and the likely future developments therein is provided in the Chief 
Executive’s Review. Financial and other key performance indicators (‘KPI’) including revenue per full time 
employee have been used in the Chief Executive’s Review to facilitate the understanding of the development, 
performance and position of the Group’s business. The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group 
can be categorised as follows: 
 
Client loss 
 
Client relationships are key to the business but some turnover over time is normal and to be expected. During 
the financial year, Freshwater provided services to over 300 clients with only 4 accounting for more than 3% of 
revenue. A diverse and balanced client base mitigates the impact of any individual loss. 
 
Economic 
 
Our industry like others has not been immune to the prolonged economic downturn and at a macro level there 
is increased competition to satisfy reduced demand from a rapidly changing market place. We believe 
however that Freshwater is well placed to compete in these difficult times and is helped in this by its exposure 
to defensive sectors such as utilities, transport and energy coupled with a strong regional network. 
 
Staff loss 
 
As a people based business our staff play a critical role in our client offering, and the loss of key staff could be 
a risk to our client relationships. To offset this risk, we have developed a team based approach to client 
service, so that no one member of staff is the sole point of contact with any given client. The Group 
additionally seeks to pursue employment practices that attract, retain and develop the talent it needs for its 
ongoing success.   
 
Results and Dividends 
 
The Group’s results are on page 16. The Company did not pay an interim dividend in 2010 (2009: 0.75p), and 
are not proposing to pay a final ordinary dividend at the year end (2009:0.5p).  
 
Post Balance Sheet Events  
 
Bank agreement 
 
In November 2010, the Group agreed a new temporary overdraft facility and an amendment to the £1.2 million 
term loan it entered in February 2007. The Group’s borrowings have otherwise remained unchanged since 31 
August 2009. Further information on the new arrangements which have provided the Group with additional 
working capital is provided in notes 19 and 22 to the financial statements.

De-listing from AIM 
 
An Extraordinary General Meeting on 15 November 2010 voted 9:1 to de-list from the Alternative Investment 
Market, accepting a Board recommendation that it was in the best interests of the Company and shareholders 
as a whole. The listing was cancelled on 22 November 2010. 
 
The Board recognises that not all shareholders were able or willing to own shares in an unlisted public 
Company, and has made available a “matched bargain” facility for those who wish to register an interest to buy 
and sell shares in the Company.  
 
A Company share buy-back and cancellation scheme will also be established when the Company’s financial 
circumstances allow.  
 
Business combination outside the scope of IFRS 3 (revised) 
 
On 1 June 2009, Freshwater Midlands Limited transferred its trade and certain assets to Freshwater (UK 
Regions) Limited, a fellow wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to help the Group rationalise its legal 
structure and reduce its administrative overheads. Since then the trade has continued as a going concern 
within Freshwater (UK Regions) Limited but still ring-fenced within the Group’s internal management systems 
as its Midlands operation. 
 
On 1 September 2010, as part of a Group restructuring plan Freshwater (UK Regions) Limited transferred the 
ring-fenced Midlands trade within Freshwater (UK Regions) Limited to Freshwater Consumer Limited.

Creditor Payment Policy 
 
The Group agrees payment terms with its suppliers when it enters into binding purchase contracts. The Group 
seeks to abide by the payment terms agreed with suppliers whenever it is satisfied that the supplier has 
provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. The Group seeks to treat 
all of its suppliers fairly. At the end of the financial year creditor days were at 64 for the Company and the 
Group (2009: 65). 
 
Political and Charitable Donations 
 
During the year the Group made charitable donations of £2,198 (2009: £1,000). The Political Parties, Elections 
and Referendums Act 2000 (the ‘Act’) requires disclosure of any donations to an EU political organisation 
(including a registered political party in the UK) or EU political expenditure in excess of £200. The terms 
‘donation’, ‘EU political organisation’ and ‘EU political expenditure’ are given broad definitions by the Act.  
Whilst the Group does not make donations to political parties or incur political expenditure within the normal 
meaning of those expressions, as part of its normal work on behalf of clients and as part of its own marketing, 
the Group can need to attend or sponsor events which are organised by political parties or other political 
organisations for which a charge is made.  
 
Financial Instruments 
 
A commentary on the financial instruments held by the Group and the Group’s exposure to credit, interest rate 
and liquidity risk is provided in note 16 to the financial statements.

Corporate Governance 
 
The Company is not required to comply with the ‘Combined Code on Corporate Governance’ issued in June 
2008 by the Financial Reporting Council (‘the 2008 FRC Combined Code’) and does not report on how it has 
applied the principles therein or on the extent to which it has complied with the provisions therein throughout 
the year. The Company’s Directors’ are however committed to ensuring a high standard of corporate 
governance that reflects the 2008 FRC Combined Code in a manner proportionate to the Group’s size. An 
insight into the Company’s current corporate governance practice is provided below. 
 
Board of Directors 
 
The members of the Company’s Board of Directors (‘the Board’) are listed above. The Board includes both 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors’. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are held by 
separate individuals. In the situation where Executive Directors’ take on Non-Executive roles the Board 
considers that this does not necessarily affect their independence. In determining whether there are any such 
issues the Board takes into account the previous experience / background of the individual concerned. The 
Board meets regularly and its responsibilities include formulating, reviewing and approving strategy, budgets, 
acquisitions, capital expenditure and senior personnel appointments.   
 
Audit Committee 
 
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee include monitoring the integrity of the Company’s and the Group’s 
financial statements, reviewing the external auditor’s independence, objectivity and effectiveness and making 
recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment, reappointment and removal of the external 
auditor. The following individuals served as members of the Audit Committee during the year.  
 
 Appointed Resigned  
E G Carter 8 June 2009 31 August 2010 
M-L Windeler 1 October 2008 -  
   
   
Other individuals including other Directors’ of the Company and the Company’s auditors may attend meetings 
of the Audit Committee at its request.  E Carter was replaced by D Howell on the Audit Committee on 1 
October 2010. 
 
Remuneration Committee 
 
The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee include reviewing the performance of the Company’s 
Executive Directors’ and setting the scale and structure of their remuneration and the basis of their service 
agreements and appointment with due regard to the interests of shareholders. The Remuneration Committee 
also determines the bonuses to be paid to Executive Directors’. The following Non-Executive Directors’ served 
as members of the Remuneration Committee during the year:  
 
 Appointed Resigned  
E G Carter  8 June 2009  31 August 2010 
M-L Windeler 8 June 2009 - 
 
Other individuals including other Directors’ of the Company and the Company’s auditors may attend meetings 
of the Remuneration Committee at its request. E Carter was replaced by D Howell on the Remuneration 
Committee on 1 October 2010. 
 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors’ is determined by the Executive Directors’ who consider it 
essential, notwithstanding the size of the Company, to recruit and retain individuals of the highest calibre. The 
Executive Directors’ believe it is in the interests of shareholders that Non-Executive Directors’ should be able 
to acquire shares and be provided with share options in addition to the fees they receive for their services.

Going Concern 
 
The Directors’, at the time of approving the financial statements, have determined that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future.  
 
In reaching this conclusion the Directors’ noted that the Company and the Group had net current liabilities on 
31 August 2010 and considered the Company’s and the Group’s recent and forecast financial performance. 
The current economic environment is difficult. However, after taking into account a range of variances in the 
Company’s and Group’s forecast financial performance and the arrangements in place with the Company’s 
and the Group’s bankers described in notes 19 and 22 to the financial statements, the Directors’ consider that 
the Company and the Group has, and should continue to have, adequate working capital to meet its 
requirements for the foreseeable future. For this reason the Directors’ have adopted the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. 
 
Auditors and Disclosure of Information to Auditors  
 
As far as the Directors’ are aware there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware and they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors’ in order to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of 
that information. 
 
The auditors, PKF (UK) LLP, have indicated their willingness to continue in office, and a resolution that they be 
re-appointed will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2010 
 
The Directors’ are responsible for preparing the Directors’ report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.  
 
Company law requires the Directors’ to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors’ have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. Under Company law the Directors’ must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements the Directors’ are required to: 
 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company and the Group will continue in business. 
 
The Directors’ are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
 
The Directors’ are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of the financial statements and other information included in annual reports may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

We have audited the financial statements of Freshwater UK Plc for the year ended 31 August 2010 which 
comprise the consolidated and parent Company statements of financial position, the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the consolidated and parent Company statements of cash flows, the consolidated and 
parent Company statements of changes in equity and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent Company financial statements, as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.   
 
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
 
Respective responsibilities of Directors’ and auditors 
 
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Directors’ are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
 
Scope of the audit 
 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors’; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
 
Opinion on financial statements 
 
In our opinion; 
 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the parent Company’s 
affairs as at 31 August 2010 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union; 
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006. 
 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2010

1. FRESHWATER GROUP  
 
Freshwater Group (‘the Group’) comprises Freshwater UK Plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiary 
undertakings. The Company is a limited liability Company incorporated and domiciled in the United 
Kingdom. As at the 31 August 2010, the Group’s ordinary shares were traded on the Alternative 
Investment Market up until delisting on 22
 
November 2010. The Company’s registered number is 
4059741 (England and Wales) and its registered office is Raglan House, Cardiff Gate Business Park, 
Cardiff, CF23 8BA. 
 
2. AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE   
 
The Group and parent Company financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 August 
2010 (‘the financial statements’) were authorised for issue by the Company’s Board on 16 December 
2010 and signed on the Board’s behalf by S B Howell and J H Evans. The financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) adopted by the 
European Union (‘EU’) and in accordance with applicable provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
 
3. BASIS OF PREPARATION   
 
 The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs and International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations issued and effective for the year ended 31 
August 2010.  
  
 The Directors’, at the time of approving the financial statements, have determined that there is a 
 reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
 operational existence for the foreseeable future. In reaching this conclusion the Directors’ noted that the 
 Company and the Group had net current liabilities on 31 August 2010 and considered the Company’s 
 and the Group’s recent and forecast financial performance. The current economic environment is 
 difficult. However, after taking into account a range of variances in the Company’s and Group’s forecast 
 financial performance and the arrangements in place with the Company’s and the Group’s bankers 
 described in notes 19 and 22 to the financial statements, the Directors’ consider that the Company and 
 the Group has, and should continue to have, adequate working capital to meet its requirements for 
 the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors’ have adopted the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. 
 
a)  Adoption of Standards effective in 2009-10 
 
The following standards have been applied by the Group from 1 September 2009: 
 
• IFRS 8 – Operating Segments 
• IAS 1 (Revised) – Presentation of Financial Statements 
• IAS 23 (Amendment) – Borrowing Costs 
• IFRS 3 (Revised) - Business Combinations  
• IFRS 2 (Amendment) – Share-based Payments 
• IAS 27 (Amendment) – Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements  
• IFRS 7 (Amendment) – Financial Instruments: Disclosure 
• IAS 38 (Amendment) - Intangible Assets  
 
 
IFRS 8 – The adoption of IFRS 8 has not impacted on the disclosures in the Group financial statements. 
More detail is given in note 4 (c). 
 
IAS 1 – The revised standard has changed the way the Groups primary financial statements have been 
prepared. The revision required information to be aggregated on the basis of shared characteristics and 
introduced a ‘statement of comprehensive income’ to enable readers to analyse changes in an entity’s 
equity resulting from transactions with owners separately from ‘non-owner’ changes. The revisions 
included changes in the titles of the primary statements to reflect their function more clearly. The new 
titles have been adopted by the Group. There has been no material impact on the Group financial 
statements.

3. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED) 
 
a)  Adoption of Standards effective in 2009-10 (continued) 
 
 IAS 23 – The amendment changes the previous version of the standard by removing the option to 
expense borrowing costs that relate to assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for use 
or sale. Such borrowing costs are now required to be included in the cost of the fixed asset or inventory 
item to which they relate. The amendment has not had any material impact on the Group financial 
statements. 
 
IFRS 3 – The application of the revised standard has resulted in a material effect on the loss of the 
Group due to expensed acquisition costs.  See Note 4 (g) for more detail. 
 
IFRS 2 – The amendment clarified that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance 
conditions only, and that other features of a share-based payment are not vesting conditions. It also 
specified that all cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same 
accounting treatment. The adoption of this amendment has not had any material impact on the Group 
financial statements. 
 
IAS 27 – The amendment introduced a requirement to account for all post-acquisition dividends as 
income in the parent’s own financial statements, irrespective of whether those dividends arose out of 
pre or post acquisition reserves. In accordance with the transitional provisions of the amendment this 
change has been prospectively applied to all dividends received from subsidiaries in the current year. 
There has been no material impact on the reported loss as there is a corresponding write down of the 
investment in the subsidiary. 
 
IFRS 7 – The amendment introduced a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement disclosures and 
required entities to provide additional disclosures about the relative reliability of those fair value 
measurements. In addition the amendment clarified and enhanced liquidity risk disclosures to enable 
users to better evaluate the nature and extent of liquidity risk arising from financial instruments on how 
the entity managed that risk. The Group has provided these additional disclosures in the notes to the 
financial statements. 
 
IAS 38 – The amendments changed the probability criterion for separately acquired intangible assets 
and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. The presumption that the fair value of 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination can be reliably measured may no longer be 
rebutted. The amendment has not had any material impact on the Group financial statements. 
 
b) IFRS effective in 2009-10 but not relevant 
 
The following standards were mandatory for the Group for the current accounting period, but are not 
relevant to the operations of the Group: 
 
• IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners  
• IFRIC 9 (Amendment) Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives  
• IFRIC 16 (Amendment) Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation 
 
c) Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet applied 
 
Any standards and interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective, and that are available 
for early application, have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements. Application of 
these standards and interpretations is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements 
in the future. 
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are set out 
below. These policies were consistently applied. The functional currency and presentational currency of 
the Group is Sterling. 
 
a)  Basis of consolidation 
 
 The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and the entities 
that it controls (its subsidiaries) drawn up to 31 August each year. Control comprises the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities. The 
financial statements of subsidiaries are incorporated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on 
which control passed to the Group, and continue to be included until the date that such control ceases. 
The effects of intra-group transactions and intra-group balances are eliminated in full. 
 
b) Revenue and turnover 
 
 Revenue comprises professional fees and mark-ups. Professional fees and mark-ups are recognised in 
proportion to the extent to which the service to be provided under the related contract has been 
performed. Revenue is stated exclusive of value added tax. Turnover (billings) is revenue stated gross 
of marginal costs such as print costs and the purchase of advertising space that are incurred in 
providing a service and that in accordance with industry practice are marked up and passed on to 
clients. Amounts billed to clients in advance are carried in the statement of financial position as deferred 
income until the related service has been provided or the related cost incurred. Work carried out and 
costs incurred that are to be marked up and passed on to clients that have yet to be invoiced are 
included in accrued income.  
 
c) Operating segments 
 
The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments during the year. IFRS 8 supersedes IAS 14 
Segmental Reporting being effective from accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. 
IFRS 8 requires that segmental information be disclosed on the basis of information reported to the chief 
operating decision maker. The Group considers that the role of chief operating decision maker is 
performed by the Group’s Board of Directors. IAS 14 required segmental information to be reported for 
business segments and geographical segments based on assets and operations that provide products 
and services subject to different risks and returns.  
 
 The adoption of IFRS 8 has not impacted on the disclosures in the Group financial statements. Although 
the Group has within it different entities located around the United Kingdom operating as wholly-owned 
subsidiaries, all their primary activities focus on the provision of public relations and marketing services. 
It is on this basis the Directors’ consider the Group to be one business segment assessable only by its 
performance as a whole and for the purpose of making decisions about its resources. 
 
d) Dividends 
 
 Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are considered to have become no longer at the 
discretion of the Company. Interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid. Final 
dividends are recognised in the period in which they are appropriately authorised.  
 
e) Pension Costs 
 
The Group operates a defined contribution plan. A defined contribution plan is one where the Group 
pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. These contributions are expensed in the period in which 
they accrue.

4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
 
f) Property, plant and equipment 
 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses. The residual values of property, plant and equipment are reassessed annually and 
when there is an indication of a change in residual value. Freehold land is not depreciated. Property, 
plant and equipment is depreciated so as to write off cost less estimated residual value over its 
expected life on the following bases: 
 
• Leasehold land and buildings– 33% straight line 
• Plant and Machinery – 25% reducing balance  
• Motor Vehicles – 25% on cost 
• Fittings and equipment – 10% - 25% reducing balance  
 
g)  Business combinations within the scope of IFRS 3 (revised) – Business Combinations 
  
 In preparation of the financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2010, in accordance with IAS 1 
Presentation of Financial statements, it is relevant to gain an understanding of how IFRSs that relate to 
the current accounting year preparation, but have been revised since the prior year differ. It is therefore 
pertinent to understand the difference in applying IFRS 3 (revised) Business combinations as effective 
from accounting periods beginning from 1 July 2009, comparable with the original IFRS 3 Business 
combinations.  
 
 The main relevant differences in application relate to the previously allowable capitalisation of 
acquisition-related costs and the accepted measurement method of revaluing contingent consideration 
one year past an acquisition date. To the extent that the Group incurred acquisition-related costs during 
the current accounting year, they have been recognised as expenses in the statement of 
comprehensive income, whereas capitalisation would have been acceptable under the old standard. To 
the extent that contingent consideration has been revised since the prior year, revisions made have led 
to a movement in goodwill in the statement of financial position. 
 
Business combinations are accounted for in accordance with the purchase method. 
 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of acquisition, of 
the assets given, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued in exchange for control of the 
acquiree. Acquisition-related costs such as accountancy and legal fees are not considered to form part 
of the cost of an acquisition and are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. 
 
The acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition are recognised 
at their fair value at the acquisition date albeit that exceptionally: 
 
• deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements 
are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits respectively;  
 
• liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement of an acquiree’s share-based payment 
awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment;  
 
• assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-
current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that 
Standard. 
 
Goodwill is recognised equal to the excess of the aggregate of the cost of the acquisition, the amount of 
any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and, in the case of a business combination achieved in 
stages, the value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In the event of a bargain purchase, the associated gain is 
recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.

4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
 
g)  Business combinations within the scope of IFRS 3 (revised) – Business Combinations 
(continued) 
 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in 
which it occurred, provisional amounts are reported for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. 
During the measurement period, the provisional amounts recognised at the acquisition date are 
adjusted retrospectively to reflect new information obtained about the facts and circumstances that 
existed at the acquisition date and which, if known, would have affected the measurement of the 
amounts recognised at that date. The measurement period is the period from the acquisition date to the 
date by which complete information has been received about the facts and circumstances at the 
acquisition date subject to a maximum of one year.  
 
h) Business combinations outside the scope of IFRS 3 (revised) – Business Combinations  
 
Certain business combinations fall outside the scope of IFRS 3 including combinations that involve 
entities or businesses under common control (e.g. Group restructurings). IFRS does not provide specific 
guidance on how to account for such combinations. In the absence of such guidance, the Group refers 
to IFRS 3 and other elements of generally accepted accounting practice and explicitly discloses the 
accounting treatment it has followed.  
 
i) Business combinations IFRS 3 (old standard) 
 
 Business combinations within the scope of IFRS 3 are accounted for under the purchase method. 
 
Goodwill comprises the excess of the cost of a business combination over the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. The cost of a business combination is 
measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of acquisition of the assets given, the liabilities 
incurred or assumed and the equity instruments issued in exchange for control of an acquiree plus 
associated directly attributable costs. Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Where the cost of a business combination is less than the net fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired the associated gain is recognised in the income statement in 
the period of acquisition.  
 
The terms of a business combination may require for purchase consideration to be provided subsequent 
to the acquisition date. The value of such deferred consideration may additionally be dependent upon 
future events. In such circumstances, an estimate of the ultimate value of the deferred contingent 
consideration is recognised at the date of acquisition. Subsequent revisions are accounted for as a 
revision to the cost of the business combination and lead to a revision to the cost of goodwill associated 
with the combination. Such revisions are recognised prospectively in the accounting period that they are 
made if this after 12 months from the date of the business combination, otherwise they are recognised 
retrospectively. Deferred consideration is not discounted where the effect of such discounting is 
considered immaterial and is recognised as a liability or as a component of equity depending on its 
nature. 
 
j)   Goodwill  
 
Goodwill is otherwise stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill acquired in a 
business combination is allocated from the date of acquisition to the cash generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. In the event of the subsequent reorganisation 
of the cash generating units to which it has been allocated, goodwill is correspondingly reallocated. 
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. An impairment review consists of 
comparing the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill to its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its 
value in use being an estimate of the present value of the future cash flows it is expected to generate.

4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
 
j)   Goodwill (continued) 
 
If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised, firstly, by 
reducing the carrying amount of goodwill, and then by reducing the carrying value of the other assets of 
the cash generating unit on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income. Impairments of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.  
 
k)  Other intangible assets  
 
Other intangible assets are as stated in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets, at historical cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Where their useful lives are indefinite 
they are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may 
not be recoverable. Where their useful lives are finite, they are amortised from the date they are 
available for use over their useful economic lives.  
 
Useful lives applicable are as follows: 
• Intellectual property – 20 years 
 
Amortisation is included in administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income.  
 
l)  Trade receivables 
 
Trade receivables are stated at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful 
receivables. Provision is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will be unable to 
recover balances in full. Trade receivables are not discounted as the effect would not be material.  
  
m)  Derivative financial instruments  
  
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate movements. No 
derivatives are held for financial trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value at the contract date and continue to be stated at fair value at the statement of 
financial position date with gains and losses on revaluations being recognised immediately in the 
statement of comprehensive income. Derivatives are carried as assets where this fair value is positive 
and as liabilities where fair value is negative.  
 
n)  Cash and cash equivalents 
 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of change in value. The Group overdraft facility is an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management strategy and is considered to form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of 
the statement of cash flows. 
 
o)  Trade payables 
 
 Trade payables are stated at cost. They are not discounted as the effect would not be material. 
 
p)  Borrowings 
 
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
calculated in accordance with the effective interest method.

4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
 
q)  Leases  
 
Where the use of an asset is funded by leasing arrangements that give rights over the asset 
approximating to ownership, the asset is accounted for as if it has been purchased and recognised at 
the lower of fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The capital element of the 
obligations, under the associated leasing arrangements, is shown as obligations under finance leases, 
and lease payments are apportioned between interest which is charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income and liability which reduces the outstanding obligation so as to give a constant 
rate of charge on the outstanding lease obligations. All other leases are considered operating leases 
and payments therefore are recognised as expenses in the statement of comprehensive income on a 
straight line basis over the lease term.   
 
r)  Deferred taxation 
 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Exceptionally such assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the recognition of goodwill or the initial 
recognition (other than a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither taxable profit nor accounting profit. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is 
reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset 
to be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply 
to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date. 
    
s)  Share-based payments  
 
The cost of equity settled share option contracts is measured as the fair value of the associated options 
at the date of their grant. Fair value is calculated using the recognised Black–Scholes–Merton 
methodology. This cost is expensed on a straight line basis over the associated vesting period in a 
manner that reflects the expectation of the number of options that will eventually vest.  More particularly 
at each statement of financial position date before vesting the cumulative charge that should have been 
expensed in view of the extent to which the vesting period has expired and management’s then best 
estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest is calculated. The movement in the 
cumulative expense since the previous statement of financial position date is then recognised as an 
expense in the statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding entry in equity.  
 
t)  Accounting estimates and judgements 
 
In applying the accounting polices detailed above, decisions sometimes have to be made as to the likely 
 outcome of future events. Those judgements and estimates made in preparing the financial statements 
 are based on historical experience and assumptions that the Directors’ believed were reasonable in the 
circumstances. 
 
The Directors’ consider the key judgements and estimates made in preparing the financial statements to 
have been those relating to: 
 
• the recognition of revenue in relation to contracts which straddle the year end; 
• the valuation of deferred contingent consideration; and; 
• the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
  
 These judgements and estimates are discussed in more detail both above and in the relevant notes to 
 the financial statements.

 5. LOSS BEFORE TAX 
 
Loss before tax is stated after charging the following: 
    2010  2009 
   
 £  £ 
  Depreciation of property, plant and equipment  230,129  219,338 
  Amortisation of other intangible assets  4,504  4,984 
  Amounts payable under operating leases  429,716  478,803 
  Unrealised loss on derivative contract    16,816  56,951 
  Employee costs   3,258,560  4,135,849 
  Goodwill impairment  758,595  - 
  Acquisition costs  19,947  - 
 
Within depreciation of property, plant and equipment is £69,315 (2009: £10,000) relating to assets held 
under finance leases. Amounts payable under operating leases primarily relate to leases entered into in 
order to occupy office premises.  
 
Acquisition costs expensed in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income directly relate to the 
Profileplus UK Limited business combination. There is no comparable figure in the prior year relating to 
prior year acquisitions due to the changed application of IFRS 3 Business combinations no longer 
allowing the capitalisation of such costs. See note 4g. 
 
6. EXCEPTIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES   
 
    2010  2009

  Goodwill impairment loss  758,595 -
 
 As a result of an impairment review conducted on the carrying value of goodwill as at 31 August 2010, 
as detailed in note 12 an expense has been recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. 
 
7. EMPLOYEE COSTS 
 
    2010  2009

  Wages and salaries  2,919,337 3,644,440
  Social security costs  303,399 387,158
  Other pension costs  35,824 104,251
    3,258,560 4,135,849
 
 The Company is the sole employer within the Group. Bonuses dependent upon the achievement of 
certain financial and non-financial targets are payable to qualifying employees following the end of a 
financial year. Included in wages and salaries are bonuses of £nil (2009: £nil). The Group’s holiday year 
runs from 1 January to 31 December and employees are entitled to accumulate holiday not taken within 
a leave cycle subject to a maximum of five days. This must be taken within 12 months of the end of the 
associated leave cycle. Unused accrued holiday benefits vest upon the termination of employment and 
provision is made to reflect this.  
 
 The Group offers qualifying employees the opportunity to enter into a Group personal pension contract 
that provides money purchase benefits, at the Directors’ discretion. More generally, at the request of a 
qualifying employee, the Group will contribute an amount equal to 3% of their basic salary to a personal 
pension arrangement of their choice.  
  
 During the year the employer’s pension contributions were suspended for all staff between February 
and August 2010 to reduce costs in difficult trading conditions.

12. INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS (CONTINUED) 
 
There are no intangible assets classified as having an indefinite useful life in the Company or the Group 
other than goodwill. See below notes on measurement of goodwill.  
 
The other intangible assets represent Intellectual Property. None are individually material to the Group’s 
financial statements. The remaining amortisation periods of these assets are between one to thirteen 
years. No intangible assets are pledged as security for the Group’s liabilities. 
 
 Changes during the year 
 
Goodwill in the Group and Company statements of financial position increased by £380,000 during the 
year as a result of acquiring Profileplus UK Limited in March 2010. During the year, the Group and 
Company statements of financial position were also affected by a £29,000 reduction in goodwill 
resulting from the completion of the fair value measurement of acquisition costs provisionally capitalised 
in the prior year as accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations (pre-revision). 
 
Goodwill in the Company’s statement of financial position also changed as a result of one of the 
Company’s subsidiaries, Freshwater Technology Limited, transferring its trade to another Group 
member. This transfer was done so as to help the Group reduce its administrative costs by centralising 
its operations in a smaller number of companies. The transfer constituted a business combination 
involving entities under common control. IFRS does not provide specific guidance on how such 
combinations should be accounted for. In accounting for the transfer, the carrying value in the 
Company’s statement of financial position of its investments in the subsidiaries was reduced by the 
goodwill carried in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position in relation to this entity. 
Goodwill in the Company’s statement of financial position was increased by a corresponding amount. 
The accounting, which served to reflect the transfers of value between the Company’s subsidiaries, had 
no impact on goodwill recognised in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position. 
 
Impairment testing of cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. 
 
The Group is considered to comprise a single cash generating unit and operating segment as defined in 
IFRS 8. In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, the carrying value of this unit, including the 
goodwill in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position, has been tested for impairment. 
This was done in a similar manner to prior years with the recoverable amount being taken as value in 
use calculated based on certain key assumptions. The key assumptions were: 
 
• Future time period – 10 years 
• The use of an EBITDA forecast, being a reasonable estimate for future cash flow 
• A positive growth rate of 2.5% 
• A discount factor of 7.5% 
 
Projected returns are calculated based on a detailed forecast for two years, and growth assumptions 
based on expected overall sector growth for up to 10 years (2009: 10 years). Expected future cash 
flows were based on the Group’s detailed budget for the financial year ending 31 August 2011 and the 
assumption that cash flows will grow steadily thereafter at 2.5% per annum (2009: 2.5%). The Directors’ 
are content that this growth is achievable, due to the relatively low base for the 2010-11 budget. In 
calculating value in use the present value was calculated using a pre-tax discount factor of 7.5% (2009: 
8%). In determining the assumptions used in this year’s impairment review management considered a 
range of factors including the Group’s historic performance, the Group’s cost of capital and the 
approach adopted by other organisations within the industry. The change in discount rate application is 
representative of a refined view taken based on lower costs of borrowing and the longer term outlook for 
interest rates. 
 
As a result of the impairment review, the Group’s carrying value of goodwill has been reduced in the 
statement of financial position to its recoverable amount through recognition of an impairment loss of 
£758,595. Consequentially, the impairment loss has been recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income as an exceptional item.

12. INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS (CONTINUED) 
 
The events and circumstances that led to the recognition of the impairment loss were the Group’s 
trading in a recession, political uncertainties and cuts in public spending. No other class of asset within 
the Group’s accounts was impaired other than goodwill. In the parent Company accounts, the 
impairment has been allocated against goodwill, investments and intercompany receivables.

Different assumptions could have resulted in adjustments to the impairment in the year. Using a growth 
factor of 1% rather than 2.5% would have resulted in a total impairment of £1,054,684, or using a 
discount factor of 8% would have resulted in an impairment of £1,057,078.

15. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS   
 
Information on business combinations effected in the current year and on those business combinations 
effected in prior years, which remained provisionally accounted for in the prior year financial statements, 
is provided below. The information is organised in chronological order. 
 
a) Life Communications 
 
On 1 July 2009, the Company acquired the business and certain of the fixed assets of a sole trader, 
 Life Communications. At the date of acquisition Life Communications was a Northern Ireland based 
public relations and marketing services agency. Life Communications provided expansion to the 
Group’s existing consumer division, as well as increasing the regional spread, providing services to both 
Northern Ireland and Eire clients. The acquisition was done in line with the Group’s objective of 
constructing a major regional specialist PR and marketing Group. 
 
To obtain control, initial consideration comprised a cash payment of £300,000 and the issue of 263,505 
10p ordinary shares. The contingent consideration provided for included the promise of a cash payment 
dependent on the agreed value of the fixed assets acquired at the completion date. It also included the 
promise of a cash payment dependent on the financial performance of the acquired business in the first 
year subsequent to completion, and the promise of a further cash payment dependent on the financial 
performance of the acquired business in the second year subsequent to completion. Up to 40% of the 
value of these cash payments at the option of the Company being able to be settled by it through the 
issue of 10p ordinary shares at the average quoted mid-market price of the Company’s shares in the 
last month of the respective earn out periods.  
 
 The goodwill that arose on the acquisition was representative of the future economic benefits that the 
Group expected to receive as a result of factors such as the brand, the employment contracts Life 
Communications was party to and the synergistic benefits the Group expects to see realised due to the 
acquisition. 
 
The goodwill of £1,146,000 associated with this business combination is deductible for tax purposes.

15. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (CONTINUED) 
 
a) Life Communications (continued) 
 
The Company and vendor agreed that the fair value of each of the 263,505 10p ordinary shares issued 
upon completion should be considered 37.9p after due regard to the quoted mid-market price of the 
Company’s shares. The contingent fixed asset payment was agreed and paid in September 2009. The 
financial performance of the acquired business in the year subsequent to completion led to its vendor 
receiving a cash payment of £280,000 and being issued with 368,034 ordinary shares in August 2010. 
The estimate of the payment that will be made as result of the year two earn out arrangements is on the 
expectation that the acquired business goes through the top of its earn-out target. A reduced amount 
will be payable if this proves not to be the case.  
 
The acquired business contributed £510,737 to the Group’s revenue for the year ended 31 August 2010 
(2009: £152,841) as presented in the statement of comprehensive income. It is not possible to 
accurately separate the profit the acquired business contributed to the Group’s result in the year ended 
31 August 2010 as the Company has been fully integrated into the Group.

On 1 March 2010, Freshwater Southern Limited and Freshwater Technology Limited transferred their 
trades and certain assets to Freshwater Consumer Limited, a fellow wholly-owned subsidiary of the 
Company. The transferred trades continue as going concerns. The transfers were done to help the 
Group reduce its administrative costs by centralising its operations in a smaller number of companies. 
Each constituted a business combination involving businesses under common control. IFRS 3 does not 
provide specific guidance on how such combinations should be accounted for. In the absence of such 
guidance assets were transferred at book value and trades for nil value. In recognition of the transfers, 
the carrying value of the Company’s investment in Freshwater Technology Limited was reduced by 
£150,655 (being the carrying value of goodwill in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial 
position in relation to Freshwater Technology Limited) and goodwill in the Company’s statement of 
financial position increased by a corresponding amount.  
 
c) Profileplus UK Limited 
  
On 30 March 2010, the Company acquired control of Profileplus UK Limited. At the date of acquisition 
Profileplus UK Limited was a Scotland based public relations and marketing services agency. 
Profileplus UK Limited provided expansion to the Group’s existing Scotland division, as well as 
increasing the regional spread, providing services to a greater range of clients in Scotland including the 
leisure and lifestyle sectors. The acquisition was done in line with the Group’s objective of constructing 
a major regional specialist PR and marketing Group. 
 
Control was obtained by acquiring its ordinary share capital in exchange for a cash payment of 
£135,000, the issue of 126,390 10p ordinary shares and certain contingent consideration. The 
contingent consideration provided included the promise of an additional cash payment dependent on 
what subsequently was agreed as Profileplus UK Limited's net assets at the completion date. It also 
included the promise of a cash payment dependent on the financial performance of the acquired 
business in the first year subsequent to completion and the promise of a further cash payment 
dependent on the financial performance of the acquired business in the second year subsequent to 
completion. Up to 50% of the value of these cash payments may, at the option of the Company, be 
settled by the issue of 10p ordinary shares at the average quoted mid-market price of the Company's 
shares in the last month of the respective earn out periods.  
 
The goodwill that arose on the acquisition was representative of the future economic benefits that the 
Group expected to receive as a result of factors such as the brand, the employment contracts 
Profileplus UK Limited was party to and the synergistic benefits the Group expects to see realised due 
to the acquisition.  
 
The goodwill associated with this business combination is not deductible for tax purposes.

The Company and vendor agreed that the fair value of each of the 126,390 10p ordinary shares issued 
upon completion should be considered 19.78p after due regard to the quoted mid-market price of the 
Company's shares. The estimates of the payments that will be made as a result of the earn out 
arrangements are on the expectation that the acquired business will go through the top of its earn-out 
targets. Reduced amounts will be payable if this proves not to be the case. 
                   
The acquired business contributed £136,446 to the Group’s revenue for the year ended 31 August 2010 
as presented in the statement of comprehensive income. It is not possible to accurately separate the 
profit the acquired business contributed to the Group’s result in the year ended 31 August 2010 as the 
Company has been fully integrated into the Group.   
 
The Group incurred £19,947 acquisition-related costs in the year, recognised as expenses in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
 
The net asset value of £70,750 as at 31 August 2010 has not been settled in full. In accordance with the 
share purchase agreement the Company has retained £5,798 of the fair value of trade receivables until 
the debts are subsequently settled.  
 
On 1 April 2010, Profileplus UK Limited transferred its trade and certain assets to Freshwater Scotland 
Limited, a fellow wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The transferred trade continues as a going 
concern. The transfer was done to help the Group reduce its administrative costs by centralising its 
operations in a smaller number of companies. The transfer constituted a business combination involving 
businesses under common control. IFRS does not provide specific guidance on how such combinations 
should be accounted for. In the absence of such guidance, the assets were transferred at book value 
and the trade for nil value. In recognition of the transfer, the carrying value of the Company’s investment 
in Profileplus UK Limited was reduced by £380,000 (being the carrying value of goodwill in the Group’s 
consolidated statement of financial position in relation to Profileplus UK Limited) and goodwill in the  
Company’s statement of financial position increased by a corresponding amount.

16. FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (CONTINUED) 
 
During the year ended 31 August 2010 the Group and the Company faced credit risk, interest rate risk 
and liquidity risk as a result of their financial assets and liabilities. Neither faced significant currency risk 
being the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign exchange rates. There were no significant changes in the risks, the objectives, 
processes and policies for managing the risks or the methods used to measure the risks during the year 
ended 31 August 2010. 
 
Credit risk  
 
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party 
by failing to discharge an obligation. The Group faces credit risk as a result of offering credit terms to its 
customers and holding cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions. The Company faces credit 
risk as a result of advancing funds to other Group members and as a result of holding cash and cash 
equivalents with financial institutions. The Group seeks to mitigate the risk that arises from offering 
credit terms by performing credit checks before terms are advanced and thereafter actively monitoring 
amounts receivable and denying additional credit when appropriate. Funds advanced by the Company 
to other Group members are repayable on demand. The Company looks to mitigate the risk that arises 
from advancing such funds by monitoring Group members’ financial position and performance on an 
ongoing basis and denying additional credit where appropriate. The risk that arises as a result of holding 
cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions is mitigated by both the Group and the Company 
holding the majority of such amounts with the same recognised UK high street bank that provides the 
Group’s overdraft facility and that provided the Company’s floating rate borrowings. Both the Group’s 
and the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the value of loans and receivables. 
 
 Interest rate risk  
 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates. The Group and the Company primarily face interest rate 
risk as a result of the Company’s floating rate borrowings, a derivative contract entered into by the 
Company and through holding cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions. See notes 19, 21 
and 22. 
  
 Liquidity risk 
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with 
financial liabilities. The Group’s financial liabilities include its borrowings and trade and other payables. 
See notes 20 and 22. Within the Group the responsibility for monitoring liquidity risk and for ensuring 
that Group members are adequately funded has been centralised and lies with the ultimate parent 
undertaking, Freshwater UK Plc, which leads all capital raising activities. Contractual maturity analysis 
for financial liabilities is shown in notes 20, 21 and 22.

Impairment of £41,763 has been recognised in line with the impairment review carried out at Group 
level (discussed further in note 12). This impairment reduces the level of the amounts owed by 
Freshwater Scotland Limited by £30,053 and Freshwater Technology Limited (now Freshwater 
Consumer Limited) by £11,710. These companies were created to acquire the trade and assets of 
Reekie Limited and Black and White Communications Limited respectively. As such the parent 
Company provided an intercompany loan to enable the acquisitions. The goodwill for both of these 
subsidiaries is held within the respective subsidiary Company. The value of the goodwill has reduced as 
a result of the impairment review and this has been reflected by a reduction in the intercompany 
receivable due to Freshwater Plc from the two subsidiaries. 
 
None of the balances bear interest. An aged analysis of unimpaired trade receivables is provided below. 
An amount is considered past due if the counterparty has failed to make payment when contractually 
due. All other receivables are due within one year.

Each Group member’s primary current account is with the same recognised UK high street bank. On 31 
August 2010, a Group overdraft facility was in place under which the aggregate of the balances on 
these accounts could be overdrawn by up to £400,000 subject to the aggregate of individual overdrawn 
balances not exceeding £2.3 million. Interest was payable at 4% above the counterparty bank’s base 
rate on any aggregate overdraft. Interest was receivable at 0% on any aggregate debtor balance. Any 
aggregate overdraft is secured by unlimited intercompany composite guarantees (under which Group 
members are jointly and severally liable for amounts outstanding) and various debentures by Group 
members in favour of the counterparty bank.  
 
 Bank covenant 
 
 Pre-defined cumulative EBITDA covenants were breached in May, June, July and August 2010, as 
defined in the supplemental agreement to the Group facility agreement. The breaches were anticipated 
and occurred due to a fall off in income in the Healthcare sector in these months. The bank waived the 
covenants in respect of these breaches and on 22 November 2010 a new Group overdraft facility was 
put in place.

New overdraft facility 
 
 In November 2010 a new Group overdraft facility was agreed allowing the aggregate of the balances on 
Group members’ primary current accounts to go overdrawn by up to a net limit of £550,000, but still 
subject to the aggregate of individual overdrawn balances not exceeding a £2.3 million gross limit. 
Interest is payable at 4% over the base rate to the extent that the aggregate of the balances on Group 
members’ primary current accounts total an amount up to the net limit. Interest is payable at 8% over 
the base rate to the extent that the aggregate of the balances on Group members’ primary current 
accounts exceed the net limit. The base rate on the date of the agreement 10
 
November 2010 was 0.5% 
per annum. A risk fee of £3,000, per month is payable in each month the Group does not meet its 
agreed EBITDA target. 
 
 The agreement will be due for review on 28 February 2011 at which time it is expected that the overdraft 
facility will reduce back down to £400,000.

21. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  
 
The Company currently has one derivative financial instrument, a free standing ten year sterling 
denominated amortising base rate swap to mitigate the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk as a result 
of the Company’s floating rate borrowings. This contract was entered into in March 2007. This base rate 
swap has been fair valued based on data supplied directly by the counterparty, and is effectively the 
market surrender value of the policy. Under the swap which had an initial nominal value of £900,000 the 
Company pays interest at a fixed rate of 5.6% in exchange for the counterparty bank's (floating) base 
rate. It does not qualify for hedge accounting and associated gains or losses are recognised in the 
Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income under administrative expenses. 
 
The following table provides an analysis of this financial instrument measured subsequent to initial 
recognition at fair value, Grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is 
observable. 
 
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities. 
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included 
within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs 
for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The above amounts exclude interest. The Group’s borrowings on 31 August 2010 and 31 August 2009 
with the exception of ‘Various finance leases’ lay entirely within the Company. Carrying value is 
considered a fair approximation of fair value.  
 
The Group’s borrowings on 31 August 2010 with the exception of ‘Various finance leases’ were with a 
single counterparty bank and secured by unlimited intercompany composite guarantees (under which 
Group members are jointly and severally liable for amounts outstanding) and various debentures by 
Group members in favour of the counterparty bank. The amounts outstanding under the finance leases 
entered into during the year ended 31 August 2009 are additionally secured against certain of the 
Group’s fixed assets. The interest rates and repayment terms associated with the Group’s borrowings 
on 31 August 2010 were: 
 
  Fixed rate  Interest rate    Repayment terms 
  £76,000 finance lease  8%  Level monthly payments of capital and interest over 2.5 years 
  £95,000 finance lease   10%  Level monthly payments of capital and interest over 2.5 years

 In November 2010, the Group agreed a further amendment to the £1.2 million term loan it entered in 
February 2007. At the date of the amendment £228,184 remained outstanding. The loans covenants 
were agreed to be removed and the loan thereafter to be repayable on demand. Monthly instalments 
continued to be settled at £25,353 per month due to complete in August 2011. The base rate on the 
date of the agreement 15
 
November 2010 was 0.5% per annum. 
 
 In January 2010 and subsequently on 10 March 2010 the Group agreed amendments to the £1.2 million 
term loan it entered in February 2007. At the date of both of the amendments, £380,307 remained 
outstanding. In January 2010 the balance outstanding changed to being repayable in monthly 
instalments of £25,353 starting in January 2011. On 10 March 2010 the balance outstanding changed to 
being repayable in monthly instalments of £25,353 starting in June 2010. 
 
In December 2009, the Group agreed an amendment to the £1.2 million term loan it entered in February 
2007. At the date of the amendment £380,307 remained outstanding. This is now repayable in monthly 
instalments of £25,353 starting January 2011. The Group’s borrowings have otherwise remained 
unchanged since 31 August 2009.  
 
In March 2007, the Company entered a free standing ten year sterling denominated amortising base 
rate swap to mitigate the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk as a result of its floating rate borrowings. 
Since entering the swap the Group has been exposed to interest rate risk through its floating rate 
borrowings to the extent that they have exceeded the swap’s amortised nominal value. See note 21.

During 2010 and 2009 the Company was fully hedged. Consequently, taking into account the effect of 
the base rate swap, had interest rates differed during the last two financial years the Group’s reported 
(loss) / profit would remain unchanged.

 Finance leases 
 
All finance lease contracts are in the name of the Company, and therefore are the same for the Group. 
 
Further detail on how the leasing liabilities correspond with the Group’s total borrowings is contained in 
note 22. 
 
A reconciliation of the total minimum lease payments at the end of the reporting period, and their 
present value at the end of the reporting period is shown below.

 All remaining finance leases are non-cancellable leases as defined by IAS 17 that are cancellable only: 
 
• Upon the occurrence of some remote contingency; 
• With the permission of the lessor; 
• If the lessee enters into a new lease for the same or an equivalent asset with the same lessor; or 
• Upon payment by the lessee of such an additional amount that, at inception of the lease, 
continuation of the lease is reasonably certain. 
 
 Present values have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 7.5%.

28. SHARE OPTIONS  
 
 The Company entered into share option contracts with employees of the Group under the umbrella of 
an Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme in February 2005, January 2006, July 2006, July 2007, 
June 2008 and July 2010. The contracts provide employees with the option to acquire ordinary shares 
in the Company at a fixed exercise price. An employee’s ability to exercise this option is not subject to 
any vesting criteria other than the passage of time and his or her continued employment by the Group. 
Exceptionally the occurrence of certain defined control events may cause the options under the 
contracts to fully vest immediately. All the contracts have a ten year term and lapse inter alia upon an 
employee either giving or receiving notice of the termination of his or her employment with the Group. 
Any obligations arising under the contracts are to be settled by the Company through the issue of new 
shares at the relevant exercise price.   
 
 The Company determines the fair value of the share option contracts it enters on the grant date, adjusts 
this to reflect its expectation of the options that will ultimately vest and then expenses the calculated 
balance on a straight line basis through its statement of comprehensive income over the expected 
vesting period with a corresponding credit to its share option reserve. Subsequent changes to the 
expectation of the number of options that will ultimately vest are dealt with prospectively such that the 
cumulative amount charged to the statement of comprehensive income is consistent with latest 
expectations. Subsequent changes in what is considered to have been the fair value of options at the 
grant date do not impact the amount charged to the statement of comprehensive income. 
 
The Company determines the fair value of the share option contracts it enters using the recognised 
Black-Scholes-Merton methodology. 
 
There is no share based payment charge in either the current or the prior year as the market value of 
the Company’s shares is significantly lower than the exercise price of recent option contracts. 
The fair value of shares options in issue as at 31 August 2010 is disclosed in the statement of financial 
position as other reserves.

29. EARNINGS PER SHARE (CONTINUED) 
 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjusting these amounts for the effects 
of dilutive potential ordinary shares. Contingent share consideration is taken into account from the 
earlier of the beginning of the period and the date of the related business combination to the extent that 
the relevant conditions have been met by the statement of financial position date and the consideration 
is dilutive. In calculating diluted earnings per share for the year ended 31 August 2010 and the year 
ended 31 August 2009 the share option contracts entered into by the Company in February 2005, 
January 2006, July 2006, July 2007, June 2008 and July 2010 were considered antidilutive due to the 
exercise price being greater than the Company’s recent share price.  
 
* As the result for the year ended 31 August 2010 is a loss, any conversion of the remaining contingent 
share consideration would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share. Consequently earnings per 
share and diluted earnings per share are the same and the calculation has not been included. 
 
30.  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
 
 Capital is defined as equity plus borrowings.  The Group’s capital structure is driven by the parent 
Company which drives all assessment of risk and leads in all capital raising activity. The Group is not 
subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. In managing its capital structure the Group’s 
objective is to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, managing cash flows so 
that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders.  
 
 Changes in economic conditions impact on the risk assessment the Group takes in conjunction with its 
primary objectives. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount 
of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
 
 The Group refers to a variety of ratios when considering its capital structure including the gearing ratio 
defined as borrowings divided by total capital and interest cover defined as operating profit divided by 
net interest expense. The table below identifies these ratios at the end of the current and prior financial 
year. It should be noted that these ratios are dynamic and that in the case of the Group which is growing 
and whose capital structure is constantly evolving are best considered over a period of time as opposed 
to at a given point in time.

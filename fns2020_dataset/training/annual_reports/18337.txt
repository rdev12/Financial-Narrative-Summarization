EMEA
“Signiﬁcant revenue growth in EMEA
was driven by acquisition and organic
development throughout the region
with strong growth in Germany,
Central Europe, Middle East and Russia.
Valuation and professional services
performed particularly well and
occupational markets remained largely
robust. The credit crunch has had a
negative impact on capital markets and
on demand for direct investment services.
The market deterioration has inevitably
reduced proﬁtability and consequently
we are aligning our cost base to reﬂect
market conditions and improve
operational efﬁciencies.”

The Americas
“With the successful acquisition of
JJ Barnicke last year, a major real estate

America. In Mexico, we continued to
invest capital across property types and
cities on behalf of a global investment

business adapted to changing market

emerging opportunities in the debt

Chairman’s statement
Since my previous report to shareholders, economic
conditions have continued to deteriorate, especially
as a result of the credit crisis prompted by the sub-prime
mortgage difﬁculties in the United States. These have had
a substantial impact on property markets generally and,
inevitably, our business. Despite this, I am pleased to report
that underlying proﬁtability is at a creditable level and in
line with revised market expectations.
These changed market conditions have led us to make
some signiﬁcant exceptional charges for the full year.
We regard these, together with signiﬁcant cost savings
throughout the business and a slower pace in the continuing
implementation of our global strategy, as essential
ingredients in the prudent management of the business
which will ensure that we are well placed in the future to
beneﬁt from the return of more normal market conditions
and thereby deliver long-term value to our shareholders.
Results
Revenue increased substantially by 44% to £446.3 million
(2007: £310.3 million) boosted by the impact of the
Donaldsons and Barnicke acquisitions, the full year
effect of our North Asia acquisition, and initial returns
from the substantial investment we have made in
additional staff resources in previous years.
Despite this increase in revenue, proﬁt before tax and
exceptional items reduced by 46% to £20.6 million
(2007: £38.0 million). This was largely the result of the
change in mix of our income streams with our capital
markets business particularly affected by difﬁcult
economic conditions, the delay between recruitment of
additional staff and their capacity to generate revenue,
and adverse trading conditions.
In the light of the degree of exposure of DTZ Rockwood
and our other investments in North America to these
conditions, we have decided to make an impairment charge
of £11.7 million against these investments. We are also
making exceptional charges to reﬂect the reorganisation
costs associated with the Donaldsons acquisition and
redundancy charges associated with the staff reductions
needed in the light of prevailing market conditions. The net
result of these is that proﬁt before tax and after exceptional
items is £5.6 million. Further details of this and the Group’s
cash position are given in the ﬁnancial review on page 23.
As a prudent measure in difﬁcult and uncertain conditions,
the Board has decided to recommend a reduction in the
ﬁnal dividend to 3.0 pence per share (2007: 8.0 pence)
bringing the total dividend for the year to 6.5 pence (2007:
11.5 pence). The reduction in the total dividend is broadly
in line with the movement in the Group’s underlying
pre-tax proﬁt.
Strategy
The Board ﬁrmly believes that, especially in difﬁcult market
conditions, it is vital to remain focused on the development
of the Group’s strategy. This is to work with clients to create
leading-edge property, investment and business solutions
“We will use all our people,
our skills, our assets and our
connections to continue to build
our market presence in what are
undeniably challenging times.
We believe that the broad spread
of our activities over many
geographic markets and sectors
will stand us in good stead.”
Tim Melville-Ross, Group Chairman DTZ Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 / 5
Chairman’s statement
worldwide. It is precisely because we have been pursuing
this strategy for some years that the Group is able to
generate proﬁts in these difﬁcult market conditions, albeit at
reduced levels. Both our geographic and skill diversiﬁcations
have broadened the range of income sources to give us
some protection from adverse developments in certain areas
and thereby improve the overall quality of our earnings.
A good example of this is the successful merger with and
integration of Donaldsons. This was an important milestone
for us, strengthening our position still further in the UK and
the rest of the EMEA region across many of our skill lines,
and especially in the retail sector.
The need for us to diversify across skill lines as well as
geographically is reinforced by our recent experience in
the United States. Because our strategy and presence is
less well established there to date, with a disproportionate
exposure to capital markets activities, we have been more
affected by the current adverse market conditions. We
therefore fully intend to continue with the development
of a full range of real estate advisory services in all key
North American markets to augment our existing signiﬁcant
presence in a number of locations, not least because of
the ending of our alliance with the Staubach Company.
However, in recognition of current conditions expansion in
the immediate future will clearly be done at a slower pace.
By contrast, the already diversiﬁed and well established
businesses in Asia Paciﬁc saw increases in both revenue
and proﬁtability. We continued during the year with the
successful integration of our acquisitions in North Asia,
Australia and New Zealand, and to build our business in
India. In China we maintained market leadership and
increased coverage with further ofﬁce openings.
Through our focus on cross-border services and skills,
we now have a wide range of very valuable capabilities
within the Group. It is therefore important that we continue
to invest in these and manage them effectively to ensure
that we continue to grow our market share and thereby
deliver the best possible returns to shareholders.
People
As already announced, our Chief Executive, Mark Struckett,
has indicated his desire to step down after 14 years in the
post. Under his leadership, the Group has grown its
geographic and service coverage very signiﬁcantly. When
Mark was appointed Chief Executive, the Group was
principally a UK based business employing just over a
thousand people, and turnover in his ﬁrst year in ofﬁce was
£58 million. Turnover has increased more than seven-fold
during Mark’s term of ofﬁce, and the Group now offers a
wide range of real estate services in 150 cities in 45
countries, employing some 12,500 people. His commitment
and far-sighted leadership have been invaluable to the
Group and its shareholders, and I would like to take this
opportunity to express the Board’s grateful thanks for his
long and distinguished service. We are also grateful for
Mark’s willingness to assist with an orderly transition to
his successor when appointed.
The commitment and resilience of our staff are even
more important when business conditions are difﬁcult,
and I would like to thank them on behalf of the Board
and shareholders for the great efforts that they are putting
into maximising the Group’s business opportunities in
these conditions.
Outlook
It is difﬁcult to predict how ﬁnancial and property markets
throughout the world will develop over the next two or
three years. I will only say that we will use all of our people,
our skills, our assets and our connections to continue to
build our market presence in what are undeniably
challenging times. In addition, we believe that the broad
spread of our activities over many geographic markets
and sectors will stand us in good stead even in a prolonged
downturn and should ensure that we are best positioned
to deliver growth and value for our shareholders on the
recovery of ﬁnancial and real estate markets worldwide.

CEO’s strategic review
Overview
Following many years of strength, the past ﬁnancial year
has seen substantial changes in the economy and real
estate markets.
The shock to the ﬁnancial systems from the credit crisis
that started in late summer 2007 had a quick and traumatic
impact on several of the world’s main property investment
markets. Initially, the most substantial effects were seen in
the UK and the USA with large falls in pricing and activity
levels. This spread to property investment markets in other
geographic areas and, by our year end, was affecting
most of the world’s main markets. However, occupational
markets remained generally robust against a background
of reasonable occupier demand, attractive current
availability ratios and a development supply that, while
rising, is at lower levels than in past cycles. Financially,
our business thus saw one signiﬁcant area of its activity
(capital markets) change from being very strong to very
weak relative to historic norms while the remainder of the
business saw a much steadier environment.
In addition to the markets, the structure of our business
has also changed signiﬁcantly. In early July 2007, the Group
completed the largest ever merger of commercial real estate
advisory businesses in Europe – the merger of DTZ and
Donaldsons. This acquisition assisted the Group in key
strategic objectives. It substantially strengthened the
Group’s capacity in retail property markets, particularly in
the consultancy, leasing and management of major shopping
centres, and it also cemented our position as one of the clear
top three commercial real estate advisers across Europe –
important in a consolidating market. In addition to Donaldsons,
the Group also made acquisitions in Canada, Sweden and
Australia. However, with the change in market conditions,
the Group concentrated on its existing business to prepare
the Company for continuing difﬁcult market conditions.
Results
Overall Group revenue increased to £446.3 million (2007:
£310.3 million), an increase of 44%. This increase can
be apportioned approximately 29% to the impact of our
corporate development activities and 15% to organic
growth. A signiﬁcant part of the organic growth is a result
of the investment made in additional people during previous
years who have started to contribute meaningful fee revenue
to the Group during the course of the ﬁnancial year, after the
normal period of limited contribution following recruitment.
Underlying proﬁt before tax and before exceptional items
for the Group was £20.6 million (2007: £38.0 million), a
decrease of 46%. Our proﬁtability was signiﬁcantly affected
by the collapse in the capital markets after summer 2007
and the movement of parts of our transactional activities
in this area from substantial proﬁt into loss.
Our proﬁt before tax was further affected by the impact
of a number of exceptional items totalling £15.1 million
which were one-off events during the course of this year.
These are described in more detail in the ﬁnancial review
on page 23. As a result, the Group’s proﬁt before tax fell
to £5.6 million for the year (2007: £41.8 million).

Strategy
The commercial property services market has been rapidly
consolidating, reﬂecting the globalisation of our clients’
requirements. We ﬁrmly believe this trend will continue and
have positioned the business as one of the major operators
in the market place in both EMEA and Asia Paciﬁc and will
focus on the integration and development of this leading
position. We will also seek to improve our market position
in North America through organic and other means but
without investing signiﬁcant equity in the short term until
market conditions strengthen.
The Group’s expanded operations in Continental Europe
and Asia Paciﬁc have mitigated the impact of the very
difﬁcult conditions in the UK and US capital markets. We
have continued to diversify our sources of income and both
the Donaldsons acquisition and organic growth assisted this
process last year. We intend to continue this policy, focused
in the short term on defensive income sources but with the
long term aim of a full spread of activities by geography,
skill and sector.
Property markets are cyclical and while the downturns can
be uncomfortable, we have historically gained market share
during such periods. We are also aware that the current fall
in capital values will in time recover and so we will use this
next period to position the business to beneﬁt from this
upturn when it arrives.
Corporate development
The major event of the year was our purchase of
Donaldsons in July 2007. This is believed to be the
largest ever merger amongst European property advisers.
Donaldsons brought around 900 people to the DTZ
business, primarily in the UK but with signiﬁcant operations
in Continental Europe. At the time of the merger, it was the
region’s leading adviser in the development consultancy,
leasing and management of shopping centres and ﬁtted
well with our operations. Our rationale was to increase
our expertise in the retail and public sectors, to exploit
synergies with our own leading position in UK retail
investment and to strengthen our operations in other
activities across Europe.
We are pleased with the merger process to date and
the physical integration has been largely completed.
Client reaction has been overwhelmingly positive, overall
staff turnover has been in line with our projections and while
the integration costs were slightly higher than budgeted, the
acquired business has performed in line with our expectations.
Our other acquisitions have also had a good start. In July,
we purchased a further 50% of our associate in Sweden,
taking us to 80%, and the business then acquired the
Stockholm leasing company of Fastighetsplanering AB.
At the same time, our Australian business acquired Harlow
Associates in Sydney, providing the Group with industrial
property expertise in that market.

In August, we acquired an option to purchase the leading
Boston ﬁrm, FHO Partners. This option was exercisable
at our year end, in April 2008. However, at that time we
considered market conditions had deteriorated so as
to make further capital investment in the United States
inappropriate for the time being. We therefore did not
exercise the option but instead have entered into a
licensing arrangement.
In November 2007, we acquired JJ Barnicke Ltd in Canada,
the country’s largest independent commercial property adviser
and third largest overall. In addition to giving us new coverage
in this resource rich country, it has given us better access to
the Canadian institutions who are active internationally.
Since the year end, The Staubach Company in the USA,
with whom the Group has had an alliance agreement to
service occupational clients, has announced that it is being
acquired by a competitor. We have therefore formally
terminated the alliance agreement. We had anticipated this
possibility which was part of the rationale for our separate
expansion in North America, and have also built up our own
staff numbers there to deal with our American based clients.
We therefore do not anticipate any impact on 2008/09
earnings. Looking forward, as market conditions allow,
we will continue our development in North America, where
directly and indirectly we now have around 600 staff.
Corporate and practice matters
Our organisational structure has focused on the further
development of our key business lines across geographies,
particularly in Asia Paciﬁc where we had obtained majority
control across all our operations during 2006/07. We are
pleased with progress, which positions us well for winning
additional business across the region as Asia continues its
rapid development.
This integration has been run in parallel to our rebranding
exercise where the substantial majority of our operations
have now rebranded as ‘DTZ’, losing many of the legacy
sufﬁxes. This change was ﬁnalised during the ﬁrst four
months of the ﬁnancial year and greatly assists the
integration referred to above.
The business has had substantial success in winning
various industry awards across the world, including
industry recognition as European Ofﬁce Agency Team
of the Year as well as a number of national awards.
As set out in more detail in the Corporate responsibility
report on page 30, there has also been a substantial focus
on improving our performance, both as a company and as
advisers in the area of sustainability and other aspects of
corporate responsibility. These efforts have brought a further
improvement but are part of an on-going programme.

CEO’s strategic review
People
Our business relies on attracting and retaining the best
people in our industry and this is inevitably a key focus each
year. This is especially the case during the major integration
process that follows the acquisitions we have undertaken
during 2007/08, particularly Donaldsons. This has seen a
period of planned reductions allied with a pause in general
recruitment reﬂecting market conditions. Overall staff
retention has been satisfactory while we continue to make
some key recruitments to meet speciﬁc needs.
A particular feature of the year has been increased mobility,
both geographically and by business line. Tougher market
conditions facilitate voluntary relocation and we have been able
to ﬁll posts internally more easily, aiding long term efﬁciency.
There have been some signiﬁcant senior management
changes during the course of the year. In addition to
welcoming Colin Child as Group Finance Director, we have
appointed new Managing Directors for the UK & Ireland,
Czech Republic, Spain, India and New Zealand and a new
Group Marketing & Communications Director. Our
practitioners have also been active winning individual
awards, including ﬁve nominations as top agents in the UK,
with John Forrester being named as the UK’s leading agent,
and similar wins as far apart as Stockholm and Sydney.
Market outlook
There is now no doubt that much of the world is
experiencing a substantial economic downturn, albeit the
extent of this varies widely by geography. While the initial
focus was on the ﬁnancial crisis, there is now more
evidence of general recessionary pressure across many
sectors. This inevitably has an impact on occupational
demand and we expect this to dampen rental growth
and performance around the world although some areas,
particularly in developing markets, continue to perform well.
Current availability ratios are generally low while new ofﬁce
development supply is more modest than in past cycles,
except in a few of the most challenged locations. New
construction is now being deferred in many parts of the
world and for most sectors of commercial property. This
lack of new supply should limit the length of the downturn
in the occupational cycle.
The major repricing that occurred on investment property in
the UK ﬁrst is generally spreading. In addition to reﬂecting
the prospective weakening in some occupational markets,
on which all investment value is ultimately based, the markets
will also take note of the recent rise in long-term rates driven
by fears of inﬂation. This, combined with absence of debt
availability, means that there could be further falls in capital
value before the signiﬁcant sources of equity that are
available are encouraged to recommence purchasing.

Group performance
by 13.7%, despite a good start to the year and its solid
income from investment management.
Operating proﬁt before exceptional items fell to £14.7 million
(2007: £31.2 million). This resulted in a fall in operating proﬁt
margin to 7.0% (2007: 17.7%).
The acquisition of Donaldsons saw staff numbers in the
UK peak at 2,409. Following the ﬁnancial crisis, we
controlled recruitment in most areas reducing staff
numbers to 2,274 by the year end.
During the year, we committed to a substantial relocation
of our London estate, taking new space in 125 Old Broad
Street in the City and disposing of four existing premises,
primarily expensive accommodation in the West End. The
rationale is to increase operating efﬁciency and manage
overall occupational costs.
EMEA (ex UK & Ireland)
Overall revenue grew strongly by 42.5% to £124.5 million
(2007: £87.4 million) with growth in all skill areas.
Around £12.5 million of this increase came from our
acquisitions, so that organic revenue increased by 28.2%.
There was particularly strong growth in valuation and
professional services which both had record years,
showing revenue increases of 61.5% and 146.9%
respectively. Professional services got a particular beneﬁt
from Donaldsons, but also performed strongly organically.
Occupational and development markets and consulting
and research also performed well. Transactional activities
in capital markets were less affected than in the UK while
asset management again performed well, so that overall
capital markets revenue increased by around 17.1%.
Operating proﬁt before exceptional items increased slightly
to £14.2 million (2007: £13.6 million). This steady
performance disguised many factors – the positive
contribution of our signiﬁcant recruitment campaign in
2007 and some good performances through the region,
offset by some slowing investment markets and the costs
of developing certain ofﬁces.
Individually, there were strong performances again from
France and Germany. The German performance is
particularly pleasing, where staff numbers have trebled in
two years to 370 people in six main ofﬁces while two thirds
of the revenue comes from non-transactional services.
We have continued to invest in Central & Eastern Europe
(particularly Russia, where revenue increased by 75%)
and in the Middle East.
We extended our geographic reach to meet existing client
requirements by opening in Leipzig, our sixth ofﬁce in
Germany, and Kuwait, our sixth ofﬁce in the Middle East,
as well as entering into new licence arrangements with
afﬁliates in Croatia and Kazakhstan.
Operating review
The Group’s underlying performance was dominated by
two factors in the year. Firstly, the collapse in the capital
markets spreading to many parts of the world following the
ﬁnancial crisis of summer 2007 and, secondly, the impact
of various acquisitions.
All areas of the business, except aspects of our capital
markets related activity, showed signiﬁcant growth in
revenue, both before and after taking account of
acquisitions. However, the substantial reduction in the
performance of the capital markets after the ﬁrst quarter
rippled through to the overall performance of the Group
during the course of the year.
We review below the Group’s operations by geographic
and by practice area.
UK & Ireland
Overall revenue increased to £212.1 million (2007: £176.0
million), growth of 20.5%. These ﬁgures include the
contribution of Donaldsons since July 2007 – if this is
ignored, then overall organic revenue was broadly ﬂat.
Most business streams did well, with growth from
professional services (64.9% growth), occupational and
development markets (26.6% growth), consulting and
research (23.7% growth) and valuations (10.2% growth).
However, from autumn 2007, investment agency income
suffered so that overall capital markets revenue reduced

Asia Paciﬁc
Results for Asia Paciﬁc are complicated by the effect of
the full year ﬁgures for North Asia, where we purchased the
remaining equity in December 2006. Overall, revenue has
grown to £93.5 million (2007: £39.4 million) with signiﬁcant
growth in all areas. If we adjust for the impact of North Asia,
we have still seen an underlying organic growth of 70.8%.
Operating proﬁt before exceptional items has increased to
£3.0 million (2007: £1.1 million), again reﬂecting the impact of
the North Asian acquisition, as well as organic performance.
The region shows some extremes of ﬁnancial performance.
For example, Singapore had an outstanding year and
produced the highest proﬁt margin of any signiﬁcant business
in the Group. However, the overall regional ﬁgures are offset
by the substantial ongoing investment that we have been
making to develop our services further in other countries,
particularly Japan and India, so that the overall proﬁt margin
before exceptional items was just 3.2% (2007: 2.7%).
We continued to invest in China, where we are the market
leaders, opening ofﬁces in our twelfth and thirteenth
mainland cities in Qingdao and Shenyang while, since the
year end, we have opened our fourth ofﬁce in India, in
Chennai. We took the decision to exit agency on small
homes in mainland China in order to focus on large projects.
Accordingly, we have disposed of our business in this area
in Shanghai and, since the year end, in Shenzhen.
Since the year end, our ofﬁce in Chengdu was affected by
the Chinese earthquake but we are relieved to report that
none of our staff or their immediate families were seriously
hurt, although several are facing the dreadful trauma of
having lost their family homes.
The Americas
Our business in North America is less substantive than
elsewhere in the world. Our underlying ﬁnancial results
reﬂect two equity holdings. Firstly, our 50% holding in
DTZ Rockwood which is a capital markets specialist. As
mentioned earlier, this business suffered with the downturn
in the markets and lack of diversiﬁcation to offset this
impact. Consequently, our 50% share of revenue showed
a decline to £6.2 million (2007: £7.5 million) despite higher
staff numbers.
Our other ownership in North America is DTZ Barnicke in
Canada, which became a subsidiary in November 2007.
This is a diversiﬁed business across both capital and
occupational markets and contributed £10.0 million
revenue in the year.
Together, these operations produced revenue for the Group
of £16.2 million (2007: £7.5 million). However, our operating
loss before exceptional items in the Americas increased to
£5.2 million (2007: £3.7 million loss), reﬂecting increased
losses in DTZ Rockwood and central management costs.
Our American operations also include a team in corporate
services based in several locations across the continent,
responsible for relationships with American-based clients
that we service throughout the world. We also established
DTZ FHO Partners as our licensee in Boston during the year. Directors’ Report: Business Review

Capital Markets
Investment / asset management
Our investment management team, with £2.0 billion
under management, produced a steady ﬁnancial
performance and excellent ﬁgures for our clients, winning
a British award for the eighth year in a row for the best
performing pension fund managed on a discretionary basis.
Our asset management teams have more than €3.5 billion
(£2.8 billion) in assets under management in continental
Europe. They performed well and have added many
pan-European mandates from global institutional clients.
Notable success was evidenced by our appointment by
Realkapital, a Norwegian investor, €100 million (£80 million)
for whom we acquired assets for their ﬁrst fund of €50
million (£40 million) in France and Germany. Additionally we
won a mandate from GE Asset Management for a new
European fund and also launched the Hexagone
French Regional Property Fund, a joint Morley and
DTZ Asset Management initiative.
Investment agency
Our ﬁnancial performance in agency directly reﬂected the
state of the markets, but nonetheless saw some notable
instructions. In EMEA, mandates included advising
Hammerson and Kajima on the prominent disposal of One
London Wall for £136 million, advising Legal & General on
the sale of a mixed sector portfolio consisting of 11 UK
properties for circa €185 million (£147 million) and the
exclusive marketing of a portfolio of eight properties across
Germany with a net lettable area of approximately 60,400 sq
m for €75.5 million (£60 million) for a Middle Eastern investor.
Following the acquisition of Donaldsons, our retail
investment team doubled its UK shopping centre market
share by value from 11% to 21%, albeit in a reduced
market. We advised on the acquisition of The Telford
Shopping Centre, the largest single retail UK asset deal in
2007 while on the continent, we purchased a €700 million
portfolio for the AIM Europe joint venture.
In Asia, we advised on the acquisition of Shama Luxe in
Shanghai for US$138 million (£69 million), the Shin Kong Bank
Min Sheng Building in Taipei was sold for US$225 million
(£113 million) while in Singapore we sold Leedon Heights
for SGD835 million (£307 million) to Guoco Land Limited.
Activity increased in India where we arranged several equity
participations for development funds in Delhi and Mumbai.
In the US, highlights for DTZ Rockwood included the
US$515 million (£257 million) sale of North Bridge, a
68,100 sq m mall in Chicago; and the US$360 million
(£180 million) re-ﬁnancing of a 2,152 unit multifamily
apartment portfolio in California and Colorado.
Corporate ﬁnance
We have substantially restructured our corporate ﬁnance
team during the year under new leadership, integrating
two teams and resulting in over 50 people with expertise
in mergers and acquisitions, property structured ﬁnance,
corporate advisory and indirect investment. During the year,
the team successfully raised money for a number of indirect
vehicles and development funds.
“The global credit squeeze continued to
cast an economic shadow over the US
and Europe in Q1 2008, but most of
Eastern Europe and Asia Paciﬁc
remained relatively well shielded from
the worst of its effects due to strong
economic fundamentals.”
Strong capital ﬂows continued into the real estate
sector in the ﬁrst quarter of the Group’s ﬁnancial year
until expectations of a substantial correction in the market
started materialising around August 2007. The US
sub-prime housing crisis then acted as a catalyst for the
long awaited move from a focus on capitalisation rates
and ﬁnancial arbitrage towards market fundamentals, while
the rising cost and diminishing availability of ﬁnance placed
upwards pressure on real estate yields, particularly in the
UK and USA.
The global credit squeeze continued to cast an economic

Eastern Europe and Asia Paciﬁc remained relatively well
shielded from the worst of its effects due to strong

exposure to public debt ﬁnance or syndicated loans
paid off in a more stable environment.
Revenue increased by 17.1% to £110.7 million (2007:
£94.5 million), reﬂecting a sharp rise in Asia Paciﬁc but
offset by the fall in agency revenue in the UK. Of the
increase, 5.5% came from organic growth and 11.6%
from acquisition activity. These growth ﬁgures have
been boosted by £1.4 million from internal transfers
during the year from consulting and research.

representing Helios in the acquisition of 66 hectares of
prime logistics development land in Germany for a

increasing ﬂoor space transacted by 32% this year to
3.95 million sq m.
DTZ’s global and local corporate services client base
expanded by circa 25% this year through instructions
on over 4 million sq m in response to cost saving initiatives

Directors’ Report: Business Review

Over the last 12 months a number of the major inﬂuencing
trends on the performance of Europe’s occupational and
development markets have moved from positive to neutral
or negative. Whilst economic volatility has impacted on
certain sectors of tenant demand, such as ﬁnancial
services, on the whole the take-up of accommodation
across Europe remains robust, albeit with rental growth
slowing. Construction costs continue to rise and combined
with the softening of investment yields generally, this has
caused residual land values to fall and reduced the viability
of development, which will help to restrict future supply.
Asia Paciﬁc has, however, remained more robust.
Our teams in occupational and development markets
performed well in the year. Revenue rose by 56.5% to
£136.8 million (2007: £87.4 million). This increase was split
18.4% from organic growth and 38.1% from acquisitions.
DTZ continues to advise upon major transactions across
all geographies. Successful appointments include:
• Joint adviser to the 490,000 sq m ofﬁce element of
King’s Cross Central in London, a development by Argent
(King’s Cross) Limited, London & Continental Railways
and DHL-Exel Supply Chain.
• In London, Hutchinson Whampoa has acquired a 30
acre site in Deptford from News International and DTZ

world’s leading banks and real estate developers and investors.
Major research projects included an examination of
alternative asset classes across Europe, supporting the real
estate strategy of a major bank in Saudi Arabia, a report on
Islamic Finance and an examination of commercial property
markets in South Africa and Central & Eastern Europe.
Sustainability continued as a key topic, with our specialists
presenting at conferences, publishing articles and advising
international clients. Emerging asset classes were on the
agenda in the US, where the team produced a strategy
for the US student housing market.
In China and India, demand for consultancy and research
projects continues to increase. Indeed, consulting and
research is at the forefront of assisting clients in new areas
of property investment including property linked securities

projects in the region, ranging from the world’s largest new
airport development, Dubai World Central, to Europe’s third
largest urban regeneration project in Prague, spreading
across 27 hectares with a total investment over €2.5 billion.
This saw revenue increase by 35.8% to £30.5 million (2007:
£22.4 million), with 0.7% from organic growth and 35.1%
from acquisitions (primarily Donaldsons), although the
growth ﬁgures are understated by around £1.4 million
because of the internal transfer of various teams during
the year to capital markets.
Corporate consultancy
Our corporate real estate consulting group has worked
with major clients in the corporate and public sectors to
help align the estate, its management and ﬁnancing, with
business strategy. The team has been particularly active in
Central & Eastern Europe where it has helped organisations

Directors’ Report: Business Review
Financial review
The 2007/08 ﬁnancial year has been both exceptionally
busy, with the acquisition and integration of Donaldsons,
and challenging with the ‘credit crisis’ having a material
impact on our industry and therefore our business.
In addition, it has also been necessary to provide for
a number of exceptional charges, described below,
which have reduced the Group’s proﬁt for the year.
Results
It should be noted that acquisitions during the year and in
the previous year make comparisons between the periods
difﬁcult. The 2008 results include a full year contribution
(2007: four months) of our North Asia business which
was acquired in December 2006. The 2008 ﬁnancial year
includes a ten month contribution from Donaldsons which
was acquired in July 2007 and a ﬁve month contribution
from DTZ Barnicke.
Colin Child, Group Finance Director
“Revenue has increased signiﬁcantly

of this is attributable to the effect

Revenue has increased signiﬁcantly in the year, approximately
£90.0 million of this is attributable to the effect of acquisitions
during the year and the full year effect of acquisitions that
were completed in the previous year. An analysis of revenue
by geography and by skill is set out above.
Revenue generated within our capital markets business
is materially below our original expectations for the year,
having been impacted by the credit crisis. However, the
geographical spread of our business together with greater
depth in our non-transactional operations has given us
greater stability and enabled us to report good revenue
growth in such areas.

Depreciation 5.0 2.1 7.1 3.1
348.6 81.3 429.9 278.1
Costs before exceptional items have increased by £151.8
million to £429.9 million of which £81.3 million is attributable
to the effect of acquisitions as summarised above.
The Group’s largest cost remains staff which, allowing for
the effect of acquisitions on both cost and revenue, was
68.7% of revenue compared with 62.9% in the previous
year. This increase reﬂects the full year effect of new staff
recruited during 2006/07 and also the more difﬁcult market.
As the Group’s most signiﬁcant cost, we monitor the
relationship between staff costs and revenue very closely.
Approximately 30% of total staff costs is represented by
bonuses and commissions.
Other costs before exceptional items and the effect of
acquisitions increased by 24% to £98.8 million. As a
proportion of revenue, other costs were 27.5% in the
year compared with 25.7% in the previous year.
Exceptional items
During the year, a number of exceptional items have been
recognised and charged to the proﬁt and loss account. To
enable a clearer understanding of the Group’s underlying
performance and to assist comparability between periods,
the exceptional items have been separately shown in the
proﬁt and loss account. The reasons for these exceptional
items are summarised below:
1 As a consequence of the acquisition of Donaldsons in
July 2007, the Group has incurred integration costs of
£2.5 million largely relating to staff costs, rebranding,
marketing, relocation and the co-ordination of systems.
2 Restructuring costs of £0.8 million have been incurred
during the year in respect of adjusting staff numbers in those
parts of the business most affected by the credit crisis.
3 The Group has carried out an impairment review of its
North American investments as a result of the
deterioration of the trading conditions in this market.
This review requires a comparison of the discounted
future cash ﬂows of the business with its carrying value.
The conclusion of this review has resulted in an
impairment of £9.5 million against the carrying value of
DTZ Rockwood. In addition, as a result of not exercising
an option to acquire FHO Partners, we have written off
the £2.2 million cost of this option.
The 2006/07 exceptional item arose on the realisation of
the Group’s interest in Curzon Capital Partners.
It should be noted that the exceptional item relating to the
impairment review and £0.5 million of the integration costs
do not have a cash ﬂow impact.
The exceptional items also have an impact on the Group’s
tax charge for the year which is referred to below.
Associates
The Group’s share of the proﬁts of our associates marginally
increased to £6.7 million (2007: £6.5 million). Our business
in The Netherlands performed particularly well.

The decrease in ﬁnancial results and the impact of acquisitions
has been commented on in detail in the Group Chief
Executive’s review and above. The strong performance in Asia
Paciﬁc, although affected by the full year impact of acquisitions,
has been achieved notwithstanding the costs associated with
the organic investment in new ofﬁces and staff in this region.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation (‘EBITDA’)
EBITDA has fallen by 67% to £15.2 million (2007: £45.6
million). EBITDA adjusted to exclude the effect of exceptional
items fell by 28% to £30.2 million (2007: £41.8 million).
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate on proﬁts before exceptional
items has increased to 33% (2007: 31%) reﬂecting the mix
in proﬁts and tax regimes in the countries the Group
operates in. Unfortunately, as only a small proportion of
the exceptional items qualify for tax relief, the overall tax
charge on proﬁts after exceptional items is therefore
disproportionately high.
Earnings per share and dividends
Earnings per share before exceptional items has decreased
to 17.56p from 44.35 p in 2006/07. Basic earnings per share
after exceptional items has fallen to a loss per share of
(7.65)p (2007: 49.38p) as a consequence of the size of the
exceptional items and their associated lack of tax relief.
As a result of the decline in underlying trading results, your
Board is recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 3.0p per share
(2007: 8p), a reduction of 62%. With the interim dividend
of 3.5p, the total dividend for the year is 6.5p (2007: 11.5p).
The Board expects the dividends for 2008/09 to reﬂect our
usual 30:70 split between the interim and ﬁnal dividend.
On this basis, the 2007/08 dividends rebased for the 30:70
split would have been an interim dividend of 2.0p and a
ﬁnal dividend of 4.5p.
DTZ Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 / 25
Acquisitions
The most material acquisition during the period was
the business and assets of Donaldsons LLP which was
completed on 10 July 2007. Initial consideration comprised
£20.1 million in cash and £19.5 million satisﬁed by the issue
of loan notes, of which £9.2 million has been converted
into 1,685,110 DTZ shares. Deferred consideration of
£7.3 million in cash is payable.
Pensions
At 30 April 2008, a deﬁcit (net of tax) of £0.8 million was
held on the balance sheet (2007: £1.2 million). The deﬁcit
has reduced as a result of an increase in investment values
and a reduction in future obligations due to changes in
bond yields. The next triennial valuation as at 30 April 2008
is underway and results should be available in the ﬁnal
quarter of 2008.
Balance sheet
At 30 April 2008 the Group’s net assets were £117.6 million
(2007: £112.1 million). In addition to the effect of the
ﬁnancial results for the year, the increase in net assets
reﬂects the issue of shares to fund acquisitions and
issued to participants in the Group’s share option plans.

operating activities of £14.2 million.
The Group’s bank borrowings are available under a number
of bi-lateral acquisition facility agreements denominated in
the currency of the country in which the acquisitions have
been made. These agreements require the maintenance
of minimum ratios of (i) earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation to debt and (ii) cash ﬂow to
ﬁnancing costs. These ratios are tested every six months.
At 30 April 2008, the Group had an uncommitted overdraft
facility of £10 million which was available for general purposes.
Since the year end date this overdraft facility has been
replaced with a £15 million committed revolving credit facility.
Treasury management
The Group has formal ﬁnancial risk management policies
in place designed to minimise ﬁnancial risks for the Group.
These policies and risks are reviewed annually and
appropriate delegated authorities put in place. All material
ﬁnancing transactions are subject to approval by the Board.
The treasury function is not a proﬁt centre and the Group
does not undertake speculative transactions.
The key ﬁnancial risks impacting the Group are:
• Foreign currency risk. The Group reports its results
in sterling but has a number of overseas businesses
operating in foreign currencies. The Group does not,
at this stage of its development, consider it necessary
to hedge the foreign exchange risks arising from the
translation of overseas trading results into sterling.
However, the Board does seek to hedge against the
translation of foreign currency denominated assets
and liabilities by arranging acquisition ﬁnance in the
same currency. At 30 April 2008, the Group had bank
loans denominated in foreign currencies of £32.5 million
in order to hedge against speciﬁc investments.
• Interest rate risk. The Group’s current policy is that
interest rate exposure to ﬂoating rates should not exceed
50%. The Group has interest rate swaps to manage its
exposure to interest rate ﬂuctuations.
• Liquidity risk. The Group seeks to maintain sufﬁcient
liquidity to meet its long-term strategic objectives. The
Group’s requirements are reviewed regularly as part of
the budget and business plan process.

Group’s aim is to ensure we have appropriate systems and
controls in place to enable the Group to develop and grow
while managing the associated risks.
It is of course not possible to mitigate completely the risks
the Group faces, especially in a rapidly changing economic
climate, however the principal risks are:
Changing market conditions
The international property market is cyclical and will be
impacted by changes in economic activity, interest rates
and the availability of ﬁnance. The Group’s geographic
spread and range of services provided helps mitigate,
but cannot eliminate, this risk.
Reputational and brand risk
In a professional services business there is always a risk
that professional opinions given in good faith can in some
circumstances lead to claims against the business and
associated adverse publicity. These risks may increase
in deteriorating markets.
With increasing recognition of DTZ as a global brand and
with an excellent reputation, we understand the importance
of maintaining high standards and reputation. Accordingly,
procedures are in place which seek to minimise the risk of
claims against the business.
Recruitment and retention of staff
The Group’s employees are crucial to the success and
future development of the Group. It is therefore essential
that we reward and manage the development of our
employees to ensure their retention and continued
contribution to our business.

Our people
Global people policies
DTZ has grown signiﬁcantly over the last 18 months both
organically and through a number of acquisitions alongside
taking full ownership of its North Asia business.
Following this growth, DTZ is aiming to put in place a
number of global people policies which are applicable to all
employees regardless of which country they work in. These
global policies will connect with the local policies of each
DTZ business, taking into account local legislation as well
as a global DTZ culture. Examples of policies which will be
implemented globally, in the next 12 months, are DTZ’s
Diversity & Inclusion and Global Mobility programmes.
Merger & acquisition (‘M&A’) integration
Overseeing the integration of the Donaldsons business
has been a major focus of the past year, which saw an
additional 900 people predominantly in the UK but also
from across continental Europe join the Group. Emphasis
has been placed on extending the DTZ culture and
processes such as performance management and induction
programmes, whilst ensuring we gather best practice and
innovations from Donaldsons to give us competitive
advantage in the market.
With other acquisitions such as Barnicke, it is paramount
to ensure importance is placed on valuing our different
cultures and different ways of approaching issues, whilst
still retaining the core DTZ culture globally. This approach is
adopted with all acquisitions no matter how large or small,
as well as where we increase our shareholding in afﬁliate
and associate organisations, as appropriate.
Learning & development
DTZ aims to ensure that learning & development
opportunities are in place to equip all employees with the
skill, knowledge, experience and behaviour necessary to
maximise their current performance and career potential.
Learning initiatives for 2007/08 included:
Induction workshop. The workshop, ‘Welcome to DTZ’,
which aims to enable new joiners to deliver a return on
investment as quickly as possible, continued its successful
global rollout during the year. The programme has been
embedded in EMEA, and launched across Asia Paciﬁc
and The Americas.
Performance Management. A comprehensive review of
DTZ’s approach to the business critical area of individual
performance reviews was undertaken during the year.
Outcomes have included a simpliﬁed global objective
framework with closer alignment to Business Plans, and
a series of workshops to equip managers with the skills
to support implementation.

& development opportunities are
in place to equip all employees
with the skill, knowledge,
experience and behaviour
necessary to maximise their
current performance and career
potential.” DTZ Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 / 29
Graduate development. This year a record number of
graduates joined DTZ. For example there are currently
37 graduates in The Netherlands and 27 in our Indian
business, while 129 graduates were recruited from UK
universities with 114 joining domestic ofﬁces and 15
employed abroad in China, Germany, France, Hungary and
Poland. The key focus in the next 12 months will be fast
track development for graduates in order that they
contribute to our clients’ needs.
Foundation4Success. The talent development workshop that
focuses on career planning for newly qualiﬁed surveyors and
consultants, is now in its third year. The programme has
supported DTZ’s retention ﬁgures, increasing the number of
graduates one year post-qualiﬁcation choosing to continue
their career at DTZ to 82% of workshop attendees.
Building4Success. A third cohort of high-potential
Directors successfully completed DTZ’s leadership
programme. The programme contains two parallel themes
to focus participants on individual and organisational
learning. This year, almost 50% of participants were non-UK
based, emphasising DTZ’s commitment to supporting its
global growth.
Flexible beneﬁts
DTZ recognises that people’s personal circumstances
constantly change and with these changes come different
requirements and needs from remuneration packages.
With this in mind DTZ has a ﬂexible beneﬁts package in the
UK which can be tailored and adapted as necessary.
In the last 12 months 73% of people in the UK took the
opportunity to review their package (2007: 70%). DTZ
believes this level of choice, whereby employees can opt
to ﬂex beneﬁts as varied as holiday allowance, dental
insurance or retail vouchers is pioneering in the industry.
New for 2008 DTZ is also introducing an environmentally
friendly beneﬁt allowing employees to carbon offset within
their ﬂexible beneﬁts package.
DTZ continues to review its ﬂexible beneﬁts and is now
evaluating the beneﬁts of introducing this to other countries
in the DTZ network to give it a further competitive
advantage in attracting and retaining the best people.
Diversity & inclusion
At DTZ it is recognised that a diverse and cohesive
environment is essential for the success of our business
through building relationships with our people, clients and
suppliers. While the vast majority of our people are recruited
locally, we consider increasing staff global mobility essential
to promoting cultural awareness and building our global
capability. To ensure global consistency and integrity a global
diversity policy is being implemented across the DTZ network.
The ‘Diversity Action Group’ focuses on improving ﬂexible
working opportunities, and educating DTZ people on
diversity related topics. In the coming year the Diversity
Action Group will be working closely with the global
resourcing team to ensure we have a diverse candidate
selection process in place, with preferred recruitment
suppliers sharing the diversity vision with DTZ.
For DTZ, diversity is about achieving business excellence
through valuing individual differences, and embracing the
advantages that these bring. Our business in Sweden for
example was named No. 1 in the ‘Best Camaraderie’
category by ‘Great Places to Work in Sweden’, and its
Managing Director, Agneta Jacobsson, was awarded the
title, Real Estate Woman of the Year.
This year DTZ was selected by ‘London First’ to participate
in a diversity practice review of major ﬁrms in London. The
resulting report will offer guidance to ﬁrms wishing to move
their own diversity agenda forward.
Global mobility
DTZ is committed to growing its global presence and
recognises the key role our employees play in the
Company’s success. Globalisation brings an increased
requirement for cross-border working, cross-selling of
services and the sharing of knowledge, skills and best
practice. It also maximises development opportunities
for our people by providing exposure to varying work
assignments, working environments and cultures. The
methods we employ for global resourcing include
international assignments, permanent transfers and the
Graduate Global Exchange Programme.
During the last year over 100 people at any one time were
either working in a host country on a local contract or
working on a formal International Assignment in a country
which was not their place of residence. Of these, 41 were
new cross-border moves, within 17 countries.
Particular areas of growth over the past 12 months have
been the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe with a
corresponding increase in mobility to these regions. A trend
we are witnessing is increased demand for permanent
transfers rather than the traditional International Assignment.
We are currently in the initial stages of formulating a deﬁned
best-practice global mobility policy for all countries. This will
standardise the internal process ensuring the smooth
relocation of employees, and enable us to meet the global
resourcing demands of the next few years.
Succession planning
During 2007/08, DTZ reviewed and enhanced its succession
management process and created succession plans for key
leadership roles within Group functions and across its three
geographic regions.
DTZ is currently reviewing the development needs of its key
talent in order to fast track their careers. This process will
be rolled out during 2008/09 and greater focus will be
placed on developing our young leaders of the future.

Corporate responsibility
It matters how we do business...
At DTZ, Corporate Responsibility (‘CR’) is embedded in
our core approach to how we work and interact with all
our stakeholders – it really does matter to us how we
do business.
As a major real estate adviser, our inﬂuence on how CR
is handled and the importance attributed to it extends far
beyond our own operations to the global network of clients,
giving us the opportunity to make a signiﬁcant difference.
DTZ is listed in the FTSE4Good index series, the responsible
investment index that is designed to facilitate investment
in companies that meet globally recognised corporate
responsibility standards. Speciﬁc Board responsibility
for CR at DTZ is led by Robert Peto, Executive Director
and Chairman of DTZ UK & Ireland, whilst the Board as
a whole ensures Company compliance with the Group’s
policies including CR, environment, health & safety and a
range of people policies. A CR steering group, comprising
senior executives from client-facing and operational roles,
meets quarterly and reports to the Board. Its mandate is
to monitor, advise and assist with the execution of relevant
policies and to provide co-ordination across the Group.
Each DTZ country operation takes responsibility for setting
its own priorities and developing appropriate implementation
plans in accordance with its local environment and the
overarching Group policy. Over the past 12 months we
have formalised a network of CR representatives in each
of our operations to aid the roll out of Group-wide CR
programmes and facilitate best practice.
Our marketplace
We recognise as an organisation that the area where
we can have the biggest impact in terms of CR is in the
advice we provide to clients and the inﬂuence we have
with our suppliers.
We are committed to developing and leading these
relationships wherever possible, using our expertise to
create a more intelligent and efﬁcient way of working
together. To aid our capability we have formed a partnership
with ‘forum for the future’, the sustainable development
charity, which works in partnership with leading organisations
to promote working towards a more sustainable future. The
partnership helps to embed more sustainable practices
within the Company, reinforce our sustainability credentials
and underpin the services we offer to clients.
In the area of sustainability DTZ has built up a strong
reputation over recent years as a dedicated provider of
high level sustainable services and we see sustainability
as a key business growth area. We have recently made
the senior appointment of Peter Langley as Head of
Sustainability. He will drive this area of the business
forward and continue to grow and innovate our service
offering to help clients meet and exceed their own
sustainability objective.
In our approach to business we aim to:
• Deliver the highest standards of business conduct
• Be renowned for client service excellence
• Excel in the way we treat our people/suppliers/clients
• Build good relationships with our communities
• Be exemplary in our environmental performance
Highlights for 2007/08:
• ‘CR at DTZ’ handbook issued to all staff
• Appointment of new Head of Sustainability
• Video conference facilities set up in 33 ofﬁces
across 16 countries, reducing air travel
• People Communications Forum established
for the UK Business
• H&S management systems for Donaldsons
and DTZ combined
• ISO 14001 certiﬁcation extended to all new
UK ofﬁces DTZ Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 / 31
Corporate responsibility
Our suite of sustainability services, delivered by in-house
specialists from across our business, spans both occupier
and investor clients and includes: the development of
sustainability standards and procedures, sustainability
audits, benchmarking and portfolio risk analysis,
socio-economic impact assessments, research,
and advice on ethical funds and investment.
Recent projects by our leading research team include an
analysis of the progress of the implementation of the
Energy Performance of Buildings Directive across Europe,
as well as research into sustainable investment strategies.
DTZ has also presented on the subject at several major
conferences, including Sustainable Building 2007 (London),
ICSC Annual Conference (Warsaw) and the Nordic Property
Congress (Stockholm).
DTZ also uses its inﬂuential position in the supply chain
to promote sustainability. In 2007, property management
contractors appointed via Buying Force (our appointed
procurement management ﬁrm and joint venture partner)
were asked to complete a sustainability questionnaire with
regard to assessing their own sustainability performance.
Our workplace
DTZ has over 12,500 people operating from 150 cities
in 45 countries. We aspire to be recognised as the best
employer in our industry, and over the last 12 months we
have implemented a series of new initiatives and continued
to develop our people policies to drive this vision. Details
of some of our leading edge people policies and progress
to date are described further on pages 28 and 29 and below.
People’s Communication Forum
Following the establishment of the ‘comité d’entreprise’
in France in 06/07 , DTZ has introduced a People
Communications Forum (PCF) for its UK based staff
this year. Employees from across the UK volunteered
for election by colleagues to become employee
representatives. There are currently 43 representatives,
covering the four UK regions and each representative is
required to attend a minimum of three forums per year.
Our marketplace targets for 2008/09:
• Introduce sustainable facilities management
services for occupiers.
• Supplier performance and progress will be
monitored throughout the year and DTZ will
aim to extend its environmental requirements
to suppliers not appointed via Buying Force.
The forums are used to communicate on a wide range
of business and people related matters, or where there
is a statutory duty to inform and/or consult.
Alongside establishing the PCF , DTZ also this year
undertook a UK staff survey to ﬁnd out how our people
felt the integration of the Donaldsons business was
progressing, what was working and what still needed
improvement. The information was fed back to staff along
with a plan of how any material outstanding issues would
be resolved over the coming months.
125 Old Broad Street
In March 2008 we announced that we had signed an
agreement for a new UK and global headquarters at 125
Old Broad Street in the City of London. As well as offering
world class facilities for clients and staff, the ﬁt out of the
building is being carefully considered to make sure it is
aligned with the green credentials of the Company.
The space has also been designed to provide a ﬂexible
and open plan working environment, coinciding with
the completion of our UK all staff laptop roll out, which
delivers the ﬂexibility for our people to work in the way
which best suits their individual needs.
The overall reorganisation of our London estate will
increase the total workspace for staff as well as offer
enhanced facilities and increased opportunities for
inter-team communications.
DTZ Net
DTZ Net is an internal conference which takes place
twice a year within EMEA, annually in Asia Paciﬁc and
we recently introduced a smaller sub regional Net for CEE.
The programme has been running for 12 years and over
500 staff from more than 40 countries have taken part and
beneﬁted. The purpose of DTZ Net is to create an employee
network, generally at Associate Director level and above,
to encourage cross-border business between delegates
and provide market updates. It also allows senior people to
give feedback to business leaders and enhances cultural
understanding, whilst giving a better knowledge of
DTZ’s global capabilities and the plans for the business.
Internal communications
We realise the importance of keeping our people informed
and involved in the business and its activities. To this end
we have introduced a series of initiatives during the year to
improve the manner and frequency of communication
to staff, taking a more proactive personnel approach
to communicating the Company’s news. Directors’ Report: Business Review

Our community
As a people business we have the potential to make an
enormous impact on our surrounding environment and
communities, and it is our responsibility to ensure that
those impacts are positive. It is important to us to make
a difference and we are fortunate that through our operations
there are clear opportunities for us to make our mark.
We are working in partnership with a number of community
organisations and charities to invest employee time,
expertise and ﬁnancial donations. These include,
Forum for the Future and Business in the Community.
All DTZ’s global ofﬁces are committed to embracing
their local communities, with each country responsible for
managing its own charitable and community activities. In
the UK, DTZ’s past support of Wellchild and the Meningitis
Trust raised funds of over £350,000 through a combination
of corporate donations and employee fundraising.
One area which has been a major focus of our community
support has been homelessness. A number of our people
work as job coaches, helping the homeless ﬁnd and sustain
employment and DTZ has been involved with Business in
the Community’s ‘Business Action on Homelessness’
(BAOH) programme since 2006.
Our support for homelessness includes The Americas and in
New York, DTZ Rockwood makes an annual donation to The
Bowery Mission, one of New York’s most effective programmes
for breaking cycles of homelessness and addiction.
Our Health & Safety targets for 2008/09:
• Gain certiﬁcation to OHSAS 18001 standard for
the UK business and commence global roll out.
• Develop a common H&S framework for all of our
global operations, enabling us to reduce the
number of accidents at work and be able to deliver
consistent H&S advice and support for our clients.
Initiatives to achieve this include:
• A global H&S intranet, to enable policies and
procedures to be shared, alongside individual
country sites to ensure compliance with local
legal requirements;
• Online basic training modules, to ensure that
all employees are competently trained to a
consistent level;
• An independent auditing programme of our own
ofﬁces and managed sites against our H&S
standards to monitor compliance.
Health & Safety (‘H&S’)
As a people business DTZ fully understands that its
workforce is its greatest asset. We are therefore
committed to improving the safety and well-being of
all those who work with us and to reducing accidents.
For the reporting period 2007/08, we have again maintained
our accident rates well below the Health and Safety
Executive (HSE) averages for our industry sector for UK
based employees.
DTZ was not subjected to any prosecutions, prohibition or
improvement notices, served by the HSE, Fire Authorities
or local Environmental Health Departments, during 2007/08.
Following the acquisition of the Donaldsons business
in July 2007 we set about combining the two H&S
management systems in order to maintain the high
standards that existed in both companies. Over the
course of the year this has been successfully achieved
and a common system, including enhanced policies and
procedures now exists.
During the year we made encouraging progress on
the majority of the targets we set ourselves last year.
These include:
• Global H&S – an annual H&S declaration was issued
to all our global operations. Each country will adopt
and endorse the DTZ global H&S policy.
• Working at Heights – recognising that working at height
is a signiﬁcant risk for the property sector, we revised
and re-issued our related procedures. This included the
appointment of a specialist consultant to undertake
audits of our managed properties and the introduction
of a speciﬁc training programme for employees involved,
in or managing, work at height.
• OHSAS 18001 – Our acquisition of the Donaldsons
business during the year delayed our move towards OHSAS
18001 (an assessment speciﬁcation for Occupational Health
and Safety Management Systems), but a programme to
achieve this will commence in 2008/09.
Our workplace targets for 2008/09:
• Continue to focus on developing our internal
communications taking a more global approach
wherever possible.
• Review the effectiveness of setting up a Directors’
brieﬁng on a quarterly basis from regional
management teams.
• Hold more ‘listening’ groups to gain feedback,
particularly from those who are on international
assignments across the DTZ network. DTZ Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 / 33
Corporate responsibility
Our environment
Delivering environmental best practice for ourselves and
our clients is central to the way we operate as a socially
responsible business. As we advise clients on
environmental improvement programmes, understanding
our own environmental impacts is essential and we are
committed to making all reasonable efforts to reduce these
wherever possible.
Following the acquisition of the Donaldsons business our
ISO 14001 certiﬁed Environmental Management System
has been extended to cover all UK ofﬁces. We also continue
to work towards our broad environmental policy goals
of continual improvement and pollution prevention.
An update on our efforts to-date is provided below.
Waste
In 2007, waste recycling schemes were implemented at
nine of our major UK ofﬁces. We provided the resources,
information and feedback to encourage staff to recycle
wherever possible. We disposed of an estimated 454 tonnes
from our larger ofﬁces (occupied by over 50 people) and
29% of this waste (160 tonnes of paper, card and glass)
was recycled. In 2008, we will continue with efforts to
reduce the amount of waste sent to landﬁll, building on
earlier initiatives in continental Europe.
Energy consumption
In 2007 we continued to improve data collection and
reduce energy consumption in our ofﬁces. To help improve
the availability of accurate data we are investigating the
installation of ‘smart meters’, during 2008 which provide
live and accurate up-to-the-minute energy data. This will
allow us to analyse energy consumption automatically.
We have also replaced all old laptops and desktop
computers in the UK. The new laptop models are energy
efﬁcient, have reduced power consumption and allow for
ﬂexible working, saving travel costs and associated carbon
emissions. We believe that the introduction of new laptops
will save 146,850 kWh of electricity per year, equivalent to
631 tonnes of carbon. To ensure long-term carbon neutrality
the supplier agreed to plant over 2,000 trees, one for every
new laptop supplied.
Our community targets for 2008/09:
• Appointment of a new corporate charity partner.
• Propose to implement an employee
volunteering policy.
• Review community involvement in key countries
across the DTZ network.
In 2007 we also reduced our UK gas consumption per sq m
by 27% from the previous year, to 193kWh/m
2
.
Reducing our environmental impact from travel
DTZ has substantially strengthened its global video
conferencing capability, which reduces the need for staff
to travel. As well as saving on costs and expenses, this
also helps reduce DTZ’s carbon footprint. In 2007 video
conference facilities were made available to 33 ofﬁces
across 16 countries.
The difﬁculties in quantifying travel impact in a company
the size of DTZ are signiﬁcant, but we aim to capture all car,
rail and plane travel for UK based staff starting from 2009.
In the interim, we have initiated a three month sample
survey which requires 10% of our UK workforce to record
business travel. Survey results will help us to form a
baseline assessment and establish improvement objectives.
Delivering for clients
DTZ continues to advise clients in the development of
Environmental Management Systems in the property
sector. Our services extend to over 50 sites, incorporating
fund portfolios and corporate head ofﬁces. The value
of our service is recognised by clients through reducing
operational risk and identifying improvement programmes
to enhance efﬁciency and reduce overheads.
There has been an increasing interest in our ‘sustainability
audits’ as part of a traditional property transaction due
diligence process. The audit is practice focused – outlining
on-the-ground risks which remote environmental due
diligence assessments might not identify – and can be
inherited through a property purchase.
Lastly, Energy Performance Certiﬁcates (‘EPC’) are an
increasingly topical issue for which clients are turning
to DTZ for advice. DTZ provides guidance on the
applicability of the legislation and has project managed
in excess of 200 EPC surveys to meet client needs.
Our environment targets for 2008/09:
• Swedish ofﬁces to obtain ISO 14001 certiﬁcation
by the end of 2008.
• Continue to roll out further video conferencing
globally and work to reduce signiﬁcantly our carbon
footprint in this way.
• Our move to a new London global headquarters in
2008 has provided us with an excellent opportunity to
maximise environmental performance. The ofﬁce will
be designed to minimise waste and maximise energy
efﬁciency during occupation. Fit out is now underway
and we have established plans to ensure a carbon
neutral ﬁt out and minimise waste to landﬁll. Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance

Employee involvement 
The Directors recognise that the key to delivering consistent high-quality client services lies in the skill, loyalty and motivation  
of all its employees. It is the policy of the Group that all employees are provided with support, advice, training and development 
opportunities to allow them to achieve their own potential within the framework of the business. 
The Group has made and continues to make substantial investment in network information technology, to improve service to 
clients, and facilitate good internal communications and information sharing. 
Employment of disabled persons 
The Group has continued its existing policy regarding the employment of disabled persons. Full and fair consideration is given  
to applications for employment made by disabled persons, taking into account their particular aptitudes and abilities and the 
nature of the work involved. Appropriate training is available for disabled employees, including retraining for alternative work if 
necessary for those employees who become disabled, to promote their career development within the Group. 
AGM special business 
This year, the Directors are putting forward one item of special business at the AGM. This is resolution 9 as set out in the notice  
of meeting and described in the letter to shareholders accompanying that notice. 
Donations 
During the year, the Group made donations for charitable purposes of £214,401 (2007: £42,224). No donations were made  
for political purposes (2007: nil). 
Creditor payment policy 
It is the Group’s normal policy to pay suppliers within the payment terms of the contract, where these have been agreed in 
advance, or within 30 days of the end of the calendar month of supply. Sub-contractors, in accordance with their contract  
terms, are paid when the Group is paid. As at 30 April 2008, creditor days were calculated at 47 days (2007: 51 days).  Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance: Other statutory information continued 
/ www.dtz.com 38 
Directors’ indemnities 
The Articles of Association grant indemnities to each of the Directors and the Group Secretary to the extent permitted by law. 
These indemnities are uncapped in amount in relation to certain losses and liabilities, which may incur to third parties in the 
course of acting as Directors (or Company Secretary as the case may be) or employees of the Company or one or more of  
its subsidiaries and associates. 
Going concern 
The Directors are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for  
the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. 
Auditors 
In accordance with the provisions of Section 234ZA of the Companies Act 1985, each of the Directors at the date of approval  
of this report confirms that: 
• So far as the Director is aware there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s Auditors are unaware; and

DTZ Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 / 39
Directors’ remuneration report 
Directors’ remuneration report  
The Directors submit their report on remuneration for the year ended 30 April 2008. 
This report has been approved and adopted by the Board and has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (‘Regulations’) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. In accordance 
with the Regulations, the tables of Directors’ Share Options under the Deferred Share Scheme, Company Share Option Plan 
(‘COSOP’) and tables of Long-Term Incentive Plan awards in section 3 and the whole of section 4 have been  
subject to audit. The remaining parts of section 3 and sections 1, 2 and 5 are not subject to audit. 
1. The Remuneration Committee (‘Committee’) 
The Board has appointed a Remuneration Committee which considers, for recommendation to the Board, Company policy  
on remuneration and conditions of service, and, within the terms of the agreed policy, approves the composition and level of 
remuneration of Executive Directors, the Chairman of the Company and such other members of the Executive Management  
as it is designated to consider. The Board has accepted, without amendment, the Committee’s recommendations. 
The Committee members during the year comprised, Mr P J Stone, Mr L Cullen, Mr D Detter and Ms A Lesniak. Mr P J Stone 
served as Chairman of the Committee, Mr T D Melville-Ross, Chairman and Mr M D Struckett, Group Chief Executive, are invited 
to join its meetings, as appropriate. The Group Company Secretary is the Secretary to the Committee. No Director takes part in 
discussion on their own remuneration. 
2. Remuneration policy 
In determining an appropriate remuneration policy for recommendation to the Board, the Committee’s objective is to ensure  
that the Group is able to attract and retain high quality professional staff while incentivising exceptional performance. Basic salary 
and benefits are set at a level having regard to other comparable listed companies and those within the professional services 
sector and are monitored on a regular basis. Remuneration for Executive Directors and Senior Executives takes account of the 
Company’s overall performance, achievement of corporate objectives and personal contribution, through an annual performance 
related bonus scheme and, for long-term performance, by the award of shares or options under the Long Term Reward Plan, 
approved at the AGM in September 2006. 
To assist the Committee in determining remuneration policy, although he is not a member of the Committee, information  
and advice has been provided and recommendations have been made by Mr M D Struckett, (other than in respect of his own 
position). This includes information from internal and independent sources on the remuneration for comparable positions in listed 
companies and in the professional services sector. 
3. Remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives 
The remuneration packages for Executive Directors consist of the following elements: 
• Salary and benefits 
• Performance related bonus 
• Pension 
• Long term incentive plans 
and are structured to relate reward to both corporate and individual performance. Details of all payments to Executive Directors, 
which are disclosed in section 4 on page 45, show the relative value of the basic and performance related elements of their 
remuneration. The Group’s remuneration structure is such that in 2007/08 the highest paid employees within the Group were  
not Directors of the Company. 
i) Salary and Benefits 
Basic salaries for Executive Directors and other Senior Executives are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee annually, having 
regard to competitive market practices and remuneration levels in companies which it considers to be comparable by taking into 
account their market capitalisation and annual turnover, the Committee’s own judgement of the performance of the Group’s 
businesses and the contribution made by individual Directors. 
The main benefits provided to the Executive Directors and Senior Executives are the use of a Company car or the provision of a 
cash allowance, medical insurance and life assurance cover. Details of Directors’ emoluments are given in section 4 on page 45.   Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance: Directors’ remuneration report continued 
/ www.dtz.com 40 
ii) Annual Performance Related Bonus Scheme 
UK based staff, including Executive Directors, participate in a performance related bonus scheme. Payments under the scheme 
are based on the achievement of profit and operational targets, which are set so that they are relevant both to the specific 
circumstances of the Company and the performance of the individual against their annually agreed objectives. In the case of the 
Executive Directors, any performance related bonus is based on the achievement of their objectives and Group performance and 
any payment to them is made partly from the UK bonus scheme and partly from a discretionary bonus pool related to the pre-tax 
profits of the Group, which provides individual performance bonuses against pre-set Group-related objectives. 
The UK bonus scheme consists of two components: 
a) Profit Share – an annual bonus scheme in which all UK based employees are entitled to participate, where the bonus is directly 
related to the performance of the individual against objectives set for the year; and 
b) Individual Performance Bonus – the main purpose of this component is to create flexibility in the allocation of bonus amounts 
based on an individual’s contribution and the overall success of the Company. Bonus awards to individuals are determined by 
scoring individual performance during the year against pre-set objectives, covering five areas: business development, client 
relationship management, personal financial performance, people management and risk management. 
The calculation of the discretionary bonus pool from which these two components are paid and the calculation of the 
discretionary bonus pool in relation to Group-related objectives are directly related to, respectively, the audited pre-bonus,  
pre-tax profits of the UK operating companies or the Group so as to provide both for a return to shareholders and for the  
creation of a bonus pool for distribution to employees.  
The Remuneration Committee agrees bonus payments, which are not pensionable. 
iii) Pensions 
The Executive Directors, apart from Mr D M Gray and Mr C Y Leung, are members of the Company’s non-contributory money 
purchase pension scheme of which Mr M D Struckett is a deferred member. 
iv) Long Term Incentive Plans 
At the AGM in September 2006 approval was given to implement a new Long Term Incentive arrangement, known as the DTZ 
2006 Long Term Reward Plan (the ‘Plan’). The Company has confirmed the strategy of aiming to become, a leading global 
provider of integrated property solutions to clients. Achievement of this strategy will require a greater focus on long-term results, 
and will require significant cross-working between the different service lines within the Company in order to provide the integrated 
solutions that clients are seeking. 
The Plan has four components: 
Deferred Bonus 
Under the Plan, a percentage of any annual bonus payable, that exceeds a value prescribed each year by the Remuneration 
Committee, will be delivered as an award of Shares (‘Deferred Shares’), the receipt of which will be dependent on continuing 
employment within the Group over the three year period of deferral (the ‘Deferral Period’). This element of the Plan incorporates 
the previous deferred bonus arrangements. 
The formula for determining the percentage of the annual bonus that is delivered in Deferred Shares and the threshold for  
deferral determined by the Remuneration Committee is disclosed each year in the remuneration report. For the operation of  
the Plan in 2008, the following tiered structure has applied to determine the value of the annual bonus that will be delivered  
in Deferred Shares. 
• 10% of any annual bonus that is in excess of £100,000 but less than or equal to £250,000  
(i.e. a maximum of £25,000); plus 
• 20% of any annual bonus that is in excess of £250,000. 
In addition, for certain individuals, 100% of their annual bonus above an agreed level will be delivered in Deferred Shares. 
Co-investment 
Under the Plan, the Remuneration Committee may invite selected employees to make a further investment (‘Co-investment’)  
in shares which must be held for a three year period. Individuals who participate in Co-investment will receive awards of free 
matching shares (‘Matching Shares’). The Matching Shares will vest at the end of the three year retention period (‘Retention 
Period’) if the individual remains in employment with the Group (subject to ‘good leaver’ provisions) and to the extent that he  
has retained his Co-invested shares. Vesting of the Matching Shares is also subject to the satisfaction of a performance  
condition over a three year performance period (‘Performance Period’). 
The Remuneration Committee determines each year the individuals to whom Co-investment is to be offered, the Co-investment 
parameters, the matching multiples and the performance condition. 
In 2008 it is envisaged that Co-investment is offered only to participants who receive Deferred Shares in respect of their annual 
bonus for the immediately preceding financial year and that the maximum number of Co-invested Shares would be limited to the 
number of the Deferred Shares awarded in respect of that year. However, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to offer 
Co-investment more widely.   
DTZ Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 / 41
Directors’ remuneration report 
The Remuneration Committee proposes that the matching multiples for the 2008 operation of Co-investment will range from  
20% of the number of co-invested shares to 100% of the number of co-invested shares for maximum performance.  
The Remuneration Committee has confirmed that the performance condition attaching to the Matching Shares will be based on 
Group Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) annual growth targets. The range of EPS growth targets is set each year by the Remuneration 
Committee, taking into account the prospects for the business at that time and analysts’ forecasts of Group EPS for the ensuing 
three years. 
The proposed EPS growth targets for awards of Matching Shares under the Plan will be aligned with those for the LTIP awards 
(see below). For the 2008 operation of the Plan, the following vesting schedule has been used: 
Group EPS Growth Matching Shares as multiple of Co-invested Shares
<RPI + 5% pa 0% of number of Co-invested Shares
RPI + 5% pa 20% of number of Co-invested Shares
RPI + 12% pa 100% of number of Co-invested Shares
The number of Matching Shares awarded will be determined on a pro rata basis, if annual Group EPS growth is between RPI + 
5% and 12% per annum. 
Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) awards 
The LTIP awards are designed to provide a long-term focus to senior members of the management team. The Remuneration 
Committee has agreed to extend participation in LTIP awards in the 2008 year of the Plan to those Executives whose roles 
require them to take a longer-term perspective. 
LTIP awards will be structured to provide the full value of the underlying share to participants. Awards will vest at the end of a 
three year period, providing the participant continues to be employed within the Group and to the extent that the performance 
conditions have been met over the Performance Period. 
Each year, the Remuneration Committee will determine individual levels of participation. Maximum grants will be 150% of  
annual salary.  
The Remuneration Committee has determined that the performance condition for the 2008 LTIP awards will be based on annual 
Group EPS growth targets as follows: 
Group EPS Growth Percentage of LTIP award vesting
<RPI + 5% pa Nil
RPI + 5% pa 20%
RPI + 12% pa 100%
The percentage of an LTIP award vesting for annual Group EPS growth between RPI + 5% and 12% will be calculated on a pro 
rata basis. 
Company Share Option Plan (‘COSOP’) options 
The Plan will provide for the grant of market value options. The COSOP will consist of an HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’) 
approved section and an unapproved section. Options over shares having a value at the time of grant of up to the limit specified 
from time to time by HMRC (currently £30,000) will be granted under the HMRC approved section and all other COSOP options 
will be granted under the unapproved section. 
COSOP options will be subject to performance conditions selected from time to time by the Remuneration Committee. For the 
2008 COSOP options, the Remuneration Committee has determined that the performance condition will be based on annual 
Group EPS growth targets, similar to that attaching to LTIP and Matching Share awards. 
For COSOP options, the following Group EPS growth targets will apply: 
 Percentage of COSOP option vesting
Group EPS Growth Approved options  Unapproved options
<RPI + 5% pa Nil  Nil
RPI + 5% pa 100%  20%
RPI + 12% pa 100%  100%
The percentage of an unapproved COSOP option vesting for annual Group EPS growth between RPI + 5% and 12% will be 
calculated on a pro rata basis.   Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance: Directors’ remuneration report continued 
/ www.dtz.com 42 
Eligibility 
All Executive Directors and employees of the Group are eligible to participate in the Plan. The Remuneration Committee will 
approve the participation in the Plan of individual employees each year. The Remuneration Committee will determine each  
year the types of award to be made to each participant.  
Exercise period 
The period during which a participant may exercise a vested option granted in respect of Deferred Shares, an LTIP award or  
an award of Matching Shares will be the period of 12 months after the end of the Restricted Period. The period during which  
a participant may exercise a vested COSOP option will be the period of seven years after the end of the Restricted Period. 
Employment condition 
If a participant ceases to be employed within the Group before the end of a Restricted Period in respect of any awards, his or  
her Deferred Share award, any Matching Share awards, any COSOP options and any LTIP awards will lapse forthwith (subject  
to ‘good leaver’ provisions), unless the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion determines otherwise. 
Change of control 
In the event of a change of control of the Company, if a court sanctions a compromise or arrangement under Section 425 of  
the Companies Act 1985 or if a resolution is passed for the voluntary winding-up of the Company, the Deferral, Retention and 
Performance Periods will come to an end. Co-invested shares and Deferred Shares will vest in the participants immediately. 
Matching Share awards, COSOP options and LTIP awards will vest in the participants to the extent that the relevant performance 
condition has been satisfied prorated to reflect the part of the Restricted Period that has elapsed at the date of the event. Any 
options will be exercisable for a period of up to six months from the date of vesting. 
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the Plan will allow for awards to be exchanged for awards over shares of 
equivalent value in the acquiring company, by agreement with the acquiring company. 
Timing 
COSOP options and co-invested share, Deferred Share, Matching Share and LTIP awards will be granted within a 42 day period 
following the announcement of half year or year end results for the financial year. 
Dividends or dividend equivalents 
Dividends or dividend equivalent amounts in respect of Deferred Share, co-invested share, Matching Share and LTIP awards may 
be rolled up over the Restricted Period and paid out to participants to the extent that their respective Plan awards vest at the end 
of the Restricted Period. 
Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) 
At the AGM in September 2006 approval was given to implement a new SIP. This was in order to ensure the alignment of all of 
our UK employees’ interests with those of shareholders and to provide them with an opportunity to invest in the Company. The 
SIP will provide for free shares, partnership shares and matching shares but for the foreseeable future it is being restricted to  
the purchase by employees of partnership shares. 
The SIP is an HMRC approved all employee scheme under which employees must generally participate on similar terms.

of such directorships unless otherwise approved.  
5. Shareholders’ return 
The graph below shows the total shareholder return (‘TSR’) in respect of the Company’s ordinary shares of 5 pence each for the 
five years ended 30 April 2008 relative to the total return for the FTSE Small Cap Index. The Directors believe that the FTSE Small 
Cap Index, as an index of companies of similar size to the Company, is the most appropriate against which to compare total 
shareholder return.

Statement of corporate governance 
Statement of corporate governance   
Compliance with the Combined Code  
on Corporate Governance  
Throughout the year ended 30 April 2008 the company has 
been in compliance with the provisions set out in Section 1 of 
the July 2003 FRC Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
(the ‘Combined Code’) except, as specified below, as regards 
the nomination of a Senior Independent Director. 
The Board continues to endorse and apply the principles  
of good corporate governance reflected in the Combined  
Code and in accordance with the Combined Code, a narrative 
statement of how the company has applied the provisions of 
the Combined Code is set out below. 
The Board of Directors  
The Board comprises Mr T D Melville-Ross, Chairman,  
Mr M D Struckett, Group Chief Executive, four other  
Executive Directors and four Non-Executive Directors.  
There is a separation of the roles and responsibilities of  
the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive. The Board has 
considered carefully the need to appoint a Senior Independent 
Director and concluded that, in view of the calibre and number 
of the Non-Executive Directors, it is not necessary to nominate 
a Senior Independent Director at present. 
The Directors submit themselves for election at the first AGM 
after their appointment and for re-election at least every three 
years thereafter. Details of the Directors submitting themselves 
for re-appointment at the AGM on 4 September 2008 are 
shown on page 35. 
As Chairman, Mr Melville-Ross is not considered independent, 
but the other Non-Executive Directors are considered by the 
Board to be independent of management and free from any 
business or other relationships that could materially interfere 
with the exercise of their independent judgement. Non-
Executive Directors are appointed for periods of up to three 
years. Biographies of the Non-Executive Directors appear  
on page 35 and demonstrate the calibre and breadth of 
experience they provide to the Company, which complements 
the industry experience of the Executive Directors. Through  
the Company Secretary, all Directors can, if they so wish,  
take independent advice at the expense of the Company. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it  
for decision that includes: 
• Approval of annual budgets and strategic plans; 
• The establishment of new businesses or businesses  
in new geographical areas; 
• Acquisitions and disposals, major capital projects  
and material contracts; and 
• Changes to the Group’s capital, corporate or  
management structure. 
All Directors receive written reports prior to each Board 
meeting that enable them to take informed decisions on the 
corporate and business issues which they are considering.  
The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board for 
ensuring that its procedures are followed and is available  
to individual Directors for advice on those procedures. 
The Company Secretary supports the Chairman and Group 
Chief Executive in ensuring new Directors receive appropriate 
training and induction to the Company and that on-going 
training for Directors is provided when a need for such training 
is identified as part of the Board’s annual evaluation process. 
Board evaluation 
Formal evaluation of the performance of the Board and of the 
principal Board committees was conducted during the year 
under the leadership of the Chairman and the respective 
Committee chairmen. This was done through structured 
discussions, including separate discussions dealing with the 
Chairman’s performance. The Board and each committee  
has concluded that its performance and that of its individual 
members is generally satisfactory and is aligned with the 
Company’s strategic objectives and the interests of shareholders. 
Board committees 
The Board has established the following committees details of 
which are set out below, each with defined terms of reference, 
procedures, responsibilities and powers. Each committee reviews 
its terms of reference and effectiveness at least annually. The 
minutes of committee meetings are normally sent to all Directors 
and oral reports of committee activities are given at Board 
meetings. The terms of reference of the Board committees  
are available, on request, from the Company Secretary. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee is chaired by Mr L Cullen and comprises 
the Non-Executive Directors excluding the Chairman.  
The external and internal Auditors, the Chairman, Group Chief 
Executive and the Group Finance Director normally attend 
meetings of the Committee and the Committee also meets 
separately with the external and internal auditors without 
management present. The Audit Committee discharges its 
responsibilities by meeting at least three times a year to: 
• Review the interim and annual financial statements prior  
to submission to the Board; 
• Keep under review the operation and effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal financial control and accounting policies; 
• Monitor and review the effectiveness of the company’s 
operational and compliance controls and risk management; 
• Review the nature and extent of non-audit services 
provided by the external auditors; and 
• Review the plans and work of the internal auditors. 
The Audit Committee also reviews the scope and cost of both 
the internal and external audit and makes a recommendation to 
the Board regarding re-appointment of the external auditors.  Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance: Statement of corporate governance continued 
/ www.dtz.com 48 
As part of its role in relation to the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditors, the Audit Committee  
agrees with the external auditors which types of work the 
external auditors are permitted to undertake and monitors  
the nature and extent of non-audit work undertaken by the 
external auditors. 
In forming their opinion of the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditors, the Audit Committee takes into account 
the safeguards operating within Deloitte & Touche LLP. Regard 
is given to the nature of remuneration received for other services 
provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP to the Company and, inter 
alia, confirmation is sought from them that the fee payable  
for the annual audit is adequate to enable them to fulfil their 
obligation in relation to the scope of the audit. 
The Board considers that the members of the Audit Committee 
as a whole have sufficient recent and relevant experience to 
carry out the functions of the Committee and has not identified 
a particular member of the Committee as having such experience. 
Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee is chaired by the Chairman and 
comprises the Non-Executive Directors and the Group Chief 
Executive. There were no changes to the composition of the 
Committee in the year. 
The Committee meets as and when required to: 
• Review the structure, size and composition of the Board 
and make recommendations as to any changes; 
• Keep under review the leadership needs of the Company 
and consider succession planning for Directors and other 
senior executives; 
• Assist in identifying and become involved in the selection 
process for candidates to fill Board vacancies; and 
• Evaluate the time required to be spent by the Non-
Executive Directors and ensure that what is required of 
them is clearly specified. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mr P J Stone  
and comprises the Non-Executive Directors excluding the 
Chairman. The Committee meets at least once a year and 
considers, for recommendation to the Board, Company policy 
on remuneration and conditions of service, and, within the 
terms of the agreed policy, approves the composition and  
level of remuneration of Executive Directors, the Chairman  
and such other members of the Executive Management as  
it is designated to consider. 
When the Committee considers matters relating to an individual, 
that person is not present nor does that person act in relation 
to any matters relating to him.  
The remuneration report is on pages 39 to 46. 
Meetings 
During the year there were thirteen Board meetings, five Audit 
Committee meetings, one Remuneration Committee meeting 
and one Nomination Committee meeting. Attendance at these 
meetings by individual Directors is given in the table below:

Relations with shareholders 
The Company reports formally to shareholders twice each 
year, when its half-year and full-year results are announced. 
The AGM takes place in London and all the Directors who  
are able to attend are available, formally at the meeting and 
informally afterwards, for questions. 
The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director hold 
regular meetings throughout the year with institutional 
investors and analysts. 
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
financial statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and financial statements. The Directors are required to prepare 
financial statements for the Group in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by EU (‘IFRSs’). 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial 
statements in accordance with IFRSs, the Companies Act 
1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This 
requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, 
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions 
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards 
Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation  
of Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a  
fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all 
applicable IFRSs. Directors are also required to: 
• Properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• Present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and 
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance.   
DTZ Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 / 49
Statement of corporate governance 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company, for safeguarding the 
assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation 
of a Director’s report and Directors remuneration report which 
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company website, in so far as it relates to the financial 
statements. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Statement on internal control and risk management  
The Board takes ultimate responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management. The system of control 
is designed to enable the Board to govern and manage the 
business to achieve the Group’s risk management objectives. 
A system of internal control can provide reasonable but not 
absolute assurance against misstatement or loss. 
The Board conducts an annual review of the effectiveness of  
the system of internal control and risk management. This review 
is based on reports to the Board and the Audit Committee, 
prepared by the internal auditors and management.  
The principal elements of the Group’s system of internal 
control and risk management are: 
• The Board’s various committees, which have defined 
financial authorities and operational responsibilities 
designed to enable effective decision making. A matrix 
management structure operates within the business 
focusing on commercial matters, the technical excellence  
of the Group and client relationship management; 
• The Group Risk Management Committee, which is chaired 
by the Group Chief Executive, meets regularly to review the 
management of risk arising out of the Group’s activities; 
• Each of the Group’s regional businesses has a regional Board 
which comprises Group Executive Directors and other senior 
employees. These Boards and their risk committees meet 
regularly to consider significant commercial matters, 
including risk management and internal control, and  
have formal reporting structures to the Board;  
• The Group Executive conducts a top-down identification 
and review of the main risks facing the Group and internal 
control activities to mitigate these risks; 
• Ongoing processes for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks faced by the Group in accordance with 
requirements of the Combined Code and Turnbull Guidance 
on internal control. A Group risk register identifies the risks 
the business faces, their potential impact, likelihood of 
occurrence and the key controls and action plans to 
mitigate these;  
• The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its 
responsibility to review the system of internal control; 
• An internal audit function, which has been outsourced to 
KPMG, that is subject to the controlling direction of the Audit 
Committee. Internal audit provide to the Audit Committee an 
independent assessment of the Group’s system of internal 
control, through reviewing how effectively key risks are being 
managed, and assist management in the effective discharge 
of their responsibilities by carrying out independent 
appraisals and making recommendations for improvement; 
• Business policies and procedures are being progressively 
embedded across the global operations of the Group; and 
• Certain aspects of the Group’s activities are also subject to 
regulatory control by external bodies such as the FSA and 
are audited in respect of the quality standard ISO9001.  
Health & safety  
The Company recognises that the maintenance of high 
standards of health & safety management is imperative to 
ensure the welfare of its employees. Clients too are placing  
a greater emphasis on health & safety when deciding which 
service providers they will work with. Our commitment to 
improving health & safety performance will demonstrate our 
ability to meet their expectations, and help the Group to win 
more business. The Company’s policy is to strive towards  
an integrated approach to health & safety throughout the 
supply chain.  
Managing the environment 
The Company regards the promotion of an environmental 
strategy an important element in operating a successful 
business, not only to minimise its impact on global resources 
but also to maintain good investor and client relations.  
We believe that we have already taken significant steps in 
reducing the potential for the Group’s activities impacting on the 
environment, by the development of environmental standards 
for properties, training for employees and the adoption of a 
recycling programme. These initiatives have been 
acknowledged through a number of client award schemes. 
Approved by the Board of Directors and signed on behalf of

Group Finance Director Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance: Independent auditors’ report 
DTZ Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 / 51
Independent auditors’ report  
Independent auditors’ report to the members of DTZ Holdings plc 
We have audited the Group and parent Company financial 
statements (the ‘financial statements’) of DTZ Holdings plc for 
the year ended 30 April 2008 which comprise of the 
Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated and 
Company balance sheets, the Consolidated and Company cash 
flow statement, the Consolidated statement of recognised 
income and expense and the related notes 1 to 30. These 
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting 
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in 
the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having 
been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required  
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company  
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work,  
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union 
are set out in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements  
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report  
to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report  
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.  
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Statement of corporate governance 
reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of 
the 2006 Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it 
does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s 
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or 
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report 
as described in the contents section and consider whether it  
is consistent with the audited financial statements. The other 
information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the unaudited 
part of the Directors’ remuneration report, the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Business Review and the Statement of 
corporate governance. We consider the implications for our 
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or 
material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside 
the Annual Report. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in 
the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited.  
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 April 2008 and of 
its loss for the year then ended; 
• the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 1985, of the state of the parent Company’s 
affairs as at 30 April 2008;  
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the financial statements. 
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs 
As explained in note 2 to the Group financial statements, the 
Group in addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also complied  
with the IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board. 
In our opinion the Group financial statements give a true and  
fair view, in accordance with IFRSs, of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 30 April 2008 and of its profit for the year then ended.

The Group will adopt the new standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective. However, the Directors do

in the period of initial application. 
Accounting convention 
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of unlisted investments  
which are held at their fair value under IAS32 and IAS39. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company its subsidiaries and joint venture 
undertakings, together with the Group’s share of the results of its associates. 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the  
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from  
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line  
with those used by other members of the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated  
on consolidation. 
Investments in associates 
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint 
venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not 
control or joint control.   
DTZ Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 / 59
Financial statements 
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
Under this method investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses 
of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate are not recognised. The Group’s share of profit, net of tax, is 
recognised in the income statement. 
Where a Group entity transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in the relevant associate. 
Interests in joint ventures 
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject  
to joint control, that is when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control. Joint ventures are accounted for using the proportional consolidation method. The Group’s 
share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the joint venture are combined line by line with similar items in the Group’s 
financial statements. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue comprises commissions and  
fees receivable from agency and professional activities, exclusive of sales-related taxes and amounts due to third parties. 
Agency commissions are recognised either on the unconditional completion of a contract or when a fee is contractually  
due. Professional fees are recognised on completion of the assignment. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially 
recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement  
and is not reversed in a subsequent period. 
Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is included in intangible fixed assets. Goodwill relating to associates is included within the 
carrying value of the associate. 
For acquisitions that completed prior to 30 April 1998, goodwill was written off directly to reserves in the year in which it arose. 
Goodwill acquired from 1 May 1998 to 30 April 2004 was capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life. Goodwill arising 
on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP carrying value subject to being 
tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill previously written off directly to reserves has not been reinstated and will not be 
included in determining any profit or loss on disposal of the entity to which it relates. 
Intangible fixed assets 
Licences are classed as intangible fixed assets as per IAS38. As such they are measured initially on the balance sheet at the 
carrying value at the date of transition to IFRS. At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible 
fixed assets to determine whether there is any indication of an impairment loss. 
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are valued at fair value on acquisition and amortised over the  
useful life. Amortisation charges are spread on a straight line basis over the period of the assets’ estimated useful lives using  
the following rates: 
• Brand 33%-50% per annum 
• Customer relationships and contracts 33%-50% per annum 
• Software 33% per annum  
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any related impairment losses. 
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful lives, on a straight-line  
basis, using the following rates: 
• Long and short leaseholds  over term of lease 
• Furniture and equipment 10% to 33% per annum 
• Motor vehicles 20% to 25% per annum 
Provision is made for asset impairment if the asset’s recoverable amount (the higher of net realisable value and value in use) falls 
below its carrying value.  Financial Statements continued

2. Significant accounting policies continued 
Work in progress 
Work in progress is recognised in relation to professional activities over the duration of the assignment and is stated at the lower  
of cost, including attributable overheads, and net realisable value. No account is taken of work in progress relating to agency 
activities if the recovery of such costs is contingent upon the successful completion of the transaction and such completion  
had not occurred at the balance sheet date. 
Taxation 
The tax charge comprises current tax payable and deferred tax. The current tax charge represents an estimate of the amounts 
payable to tax authorities in respect of the Group’s taxable profits. 
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition (other than in a 
business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and 
interest in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance 
sheet date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement. 
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
expressed in sterling using exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the translation reserve. 
Such translation differences are released to the income statement in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are, after the date of transaction, treated  
as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet at fair value when the Group becomes a party to  
the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when 
there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the  
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed  
at initial recognition. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that  
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, 
using the effective interest rate method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or 
redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for 
borrowing costs (see above). 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
rate method.

Financial statements 
Investments 
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially at  
cost including transaction costs. 
Investments are classified as either held-for-trading or available-for-sale, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair 
value. Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit 
or loss for the period. For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly 
in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period. Impairment losses recognised in profit or loss for equity 
investments classified as available-for-sale are not subsequently reversed through profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised  
in profit or loss for debt instruments classified as available-for-sale are subsequently reversed if an increase in the fair value of  
the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss. 
Retirement benefit obligations 
Retirement benefit obligations to employees are provided by three principal schemes, which are funded by contributions from 
certain Group companies and employees. Payments are made in accordance with periodic calculations by a professionally 
qualified actuary. Contributions to the defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense on a payable basis. 
For the defined benefit scheme, the cost of providing benefits is calculated by a professionally qualified actuary using the  
projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and are  
presented in the statement of recognised income and expense. 
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represent the present value of the defined benefit obligations 
determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows using the rate of interest or a high quality corporate bond less the fair 
value of scheme assets. 
Capitalised pension liability 
Provision is made for the capitalised value of future pensions payable to certain former partners and widows of the Bernard Thorpe 
partnership. This is calculated in accordance with advice provided by Lane Clark & Peacock, professionally qualified actuaries,  
on bases appropriate as at the year-end date. In the event of a permanent diminution in the profits of the Group, the liability would 
substantially reduce. The deferred tax asset relating to this liability is recognised within non-current assets. Payments in respect  
of these pensions are charged to the provision. 
Leasing 
Assets held under finance leases and the related lease obligations are recorded in the balance sheet at the fair value of the leased 
assets at the inception of the leases. The excess of each lease payment over the recorded lease obligations is treated as a finance 
charge which is amortised over each lease term to give a constant rate of charge on the remaining balance of the obligation. Rental 
costs under operating leases are charged to the income statement in equal annual amounts over the period of the leases. 
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Share-based payments 
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS1, IFRS2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 
that had not vested as of 1 May 2006. 
The Group issues share option awards to certain employees and Senior Executives on a periodic basis under the Company Share 
Option Plan (‘COSOP’). The awards are measured at fair value at the date of the grant and are expensed on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
The fair value of the share awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation method. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group  
will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to 
settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. 
Derivative financial instrument and hedge accounting 
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures. The Group does not use derivative instruments for 
speculative purposes. 
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provides written 
principles on the use of financial derivatives.  Financial Statements continued 
/ www.dtz.com 62 
2. Significant accounting policies continued 
Derivative financial instrument and hedge accounting continued 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designed and effective as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow hedge 
of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then at the time the asset or liability 
is recognised, the associated gain or loss on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity is included in the initial 
measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in 
equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income 
statement as they arise. 
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve. The gain 
or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. Gains and losses deferred in the foreign currency translation 
reserve are recognised in profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity 
until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss is 
transferred to net profit or loss for the period. 
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of the financial statements necessitates the use of estimates, assumptions and judgements. These estimates, 
assumptions and judgements affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date  
as well as affecting the reported income and expenses for the year. Details of these estimates, assumptions and judgements are 
discussed below: 
Impairment of goodwill 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill 
has been allocated. The value-in-use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. Actual outcomes could vary significantly 
from these estimates. Estimates used in this analysis are set out in note 13 to the financial statements. 
Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes as described in note 27 to the financial statements. The assets 
of the schemes are measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date. Scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit 
credit method, which takes account of projected earnings increases, using actuarial assumptions that give the best estimate of the 
future cash flows that will arise under the scheme liabilities. These cash flows are discounted at the interest rate applicable to high-
quality corporate bonds of the same currency and term as the liabilities. Any surplus or deficit of scheme assets over liabilities is 
recognised in the balance sheet as an asset (surplus) or liability (deficit). In determining the value of scheme liabilities different 
assumptions could significantly alter the amount of the deficit recognised in the balance sheet and the pension cost charged to the 
income statement. The assumptions adopted for the Group’s pension schemes are set out in note 27 to the financial statements. 
Income taxes 
As the Group operates across many income tax jurisdictions, judgement is required in determining the consolidated provision for 
income taxes. 
Fair value of assets available-for-sale 
The fair value of assets available-for-sale that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.  
The Group has used discounted cash flow analysis for those available-for-sale assets not traded in an active market.

A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of timing differences relating to trading losses in overseas subsidiaries 
where there is insufficient evidence that the asset will be recovered. The amount of the asset not recognised is £4,121,000  
(2007: £1,400,000). The asset will be recovered if sufficient suitable profits are made in the future against which the asset  
could reverse.

12. Earnings/ (loss) per ordinary share 
The basic earnings/ (loss) per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders by  
the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. The diluted earnings/ (loss) per ordinary share is calculated by 
adjusting the weighted average number of shares to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. In 2008, neither  
the convertible unsecured loan notes nor the share options were dilutive.

Goodwill 
Goodwill is not amortised but the Group tests goodwill annually for impairment with the recoverable amount being determined  
from value in use calculations. Value in use is determined through the analysis of discounted cash flow forecasts based on financial 
forecasts approved by management which takes account of both past performance and expected future market developments. 
Management have used a pre-tax discount rate of 7.8%, equivalent to its weighted average cost of capital. This has been 
determined as reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the industry and Company. 
At 30 April 2008, prior to impairment testing, goodwill of £28,731,000 was held in the Group’s accounts in relation to DTZ 
Rockwood. Due to the poor underlying performance of this business as a result of the ‘credit crisis’ in the US economy, the 
goodwill has been reduced by £5,199,000 related to deferred consideration that is deemed no longer payable, and there has been 
an impairment charge recognised in the period of £9,517,000. The revised goodwill allocated to DTZ Rockwood is now £14,015,000.

Financial statements 
The preliminary goodwill arising on the acquisition of the above subsidiaries, which may be subject to amendment, is attributable to 
the anticipated future operating synergies from the combinations, and the anticipated profitability from the combined businesses. 
No intangible asset has been recognised in relation to employees acquired in the above transactions, as the Group has insufficient 
control over the expected future economic benefits arising from a team of skilled staff and from training for these items to meet the 
definition of an intangible asset. 
Harlow contributed £466,000 revenue and an operating profit of £45,000 to the Group’s profit before tax for the period between 
date of acquisition and 30 April 2008. Had the acquisition been completed on the first day of the current period, the estimated 
contribution to the Group would have been revenues of £602,000 and an operating profit of £105,000. 
Donaldsons contributed £47,254,000 revenue and an estimated operating profit of £3,481,000 to the Group’s profit before tax for  
the period between date of acquisition and 30 April 2008. Had the acquisition been completed on the first day of the current period, 
the estimated contribution to the Group would have been revenues of £58,854,000 and operating profit before tax of £4,881,000. 
DTZ Sweden contributed £6,458,000 revenue and £417,000 to the Group’s profit before tax for the period between date of 
acquisition and 30 April 2008. Had the acquisition been completed on the first day of the current period, the estimated contribution 
to the Group would have been revenues of £7,916,000 and operating profit before tax of £617,000. 
Barnicke contributed £9,960,000 revenue and a loss of £413,000 (after associated financing costs) to the Group’s profit before tax for 
the period between date of acquisition and 30 April 2008. Had the acquisition been completed on the first day of the current period,  
the estimated contribution to the Group would have been revenues of £23,585,000 and operating profit before tax of £2,850,000. 
Also during the period the Group acquired additional minority interests in DTZ New Zealand Limited (34%) and the remaining 
minority interest in DTZ Austria (14%), DTZ Russia – Donaldsons (40%), DTZ Turkey – Donaldsons (40%) and DTZ Germany – 
Donaldsons (20%). Goodwill arising from other acquired interests resulted in a further increase to goodwill of £3,641,000. 
Additional deferred consideration is payable in relation to the New Zealand minority interest purchase of £28,000.

past due beyond eight months are generally not recoverable. Fees receivable between one month and eight months are provided 
for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large, unrelated and internationally dispersed. 
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts. 
The current year increase in the allowance for doubtful debts is a result of the growth in revenues and through acquisitions during 
the period.

The other principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows: 
(i) Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand. The average effective interest rate on bank overdrafts is approximately 5.25% (2007: 7.36%) 
per annum. 
(ii) The Group has three principal bank facilities: 
a. A loan facility of US$35,000,000; £17,659,000 (2007: £17,515,000) secured on certain current and non-current assets  
of the Group. This loan was advanced in full on 9 May 2006 and is due for repayment in two equal instalments on 9 May 
2010 and 9 May 2011. The Group hedges 50% of the loan via an interest rate swap exchanging floating rate interest for 
fixed rate interest. At 30 April 2008, the bank loan carries a floating interest rate of 3.98% (2007: 5.36%), and a fixed interest 
rate of 5.48%. 
b. A loan facility of HK$229,350,000; £14,851,000 (2007: £14,671,000) secured on certain current and non-current assets  
of the Group. The initial loan was advanced on 27 April 2007, and a subsequent draw down took place on 1 August 2007 
with a total drawdown of HK$152,502,098; £9,875,000 (2007: HK$99,201,000; £6,346,000) and is due for repayment in 
four equal annual instalments commencing 16 March 2009. At 30 April 2008, the bank loan carries a floating interest rate 
of 2.91% (2007: 3.41%) on amount drawn down in year ended 30 April 2007, and 3.05% for amounts drawn down in 
current year. 
c. A loan facility of £70,000,000 (2007: £nil) secured on certain current and non-current assets of the Group. The initial  
loan of £30,000,000 was advanced on 13 September 2007, subsequent draw downs took place on 7 November 2007 
(£10,554,000) and 28 February 2008 (£6,875,000) and is due for repayment in ten equal semi-annual instalments 
commencing 31 October 2008. The bank loan accrued interest at floating rates of 4.75%-6.68% (2007: nil %) at  
30 April 2008. The Group hedges part of the sterling denominated interest exposure by swapping part of the floating  
rate debt to fixed rates for the full term of the loan.

Available committed bank facilities 
At 30 April 2008, the Group had available undrawn facilities of £22,571,000 under the £70,000,000 facility and a further  
HK$76,848,000 (2007: HK$130,149,000), £4,976,000 (2007: £8,326,000) available under the HK$ facility. 
DTZ Rockwood - breach of credit facility agreement 
During the current year, DTZ Rockwood, a joint venture in which DTZ has a 50% interest, was in breach of its credit facility 
agreement. At 30 April 2008, the overdraft was US$4,773,000 (£2,408,000) with £1,204,000 being reflected in these accounts.  
The breach was in relation to the financial covenants and repayment of the facility. Subsequent to year end, this facility has  
been renegotiated with the Signature Bank of New York. The breach occurred due to DTZ Rockwood’s underlying poor trading 
performance for the year ended 30 April 2008.

Financial statements 
21. Financial instruments 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the 
return to stakeholders through optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, 
which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 20, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the 
parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 23 to 24. 
Significant accounting policies 
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement 
and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and 
equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements. 
Categories of financial instruments 
 
Financial risk management objectives 
The Group has formal financial risk management policies which cover those financial risks which are considered material to the 
Group’s operations and results. These policies and limits are reviewed annually and to ensure compliance, appropriate delegated 
authorities have been set together with reporting procedures. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, 
including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes. 
Market risk 
Foreign currency risk management 
The Group publishes its results in sterling but has a number of overseas businesses operating in foreign currencies. The Group 
does not hedge the foreign exchange risks arising from the translation of overseas business results into sterling but will, within 
limits agreed by the Board, hedge against committed transaction foreign currency exposures and the translation exposure of 
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. 
The net amount of monetary assets and liabilities and the carrying value of financial liabilities at 30 April 2007 and 30 April 2008 
denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the operations involved were not significant.

At 30 April 2008, if the Euro had weakened / strengthened by 10% against Sterling with all other variables held constant, post-tax 
profit for the year would have been £640,000 lower / £782,000 higher (2007: £369,000 lower / £451,000 higher). Net assets would 
have been £640,000 lower / £782,000 higher (2007: £369,000 lower / £451,000 higher). 
At 30 April 2008, if the US$ had weakened / strengthened by 10% against Sterling with all other variables held constant post-tax 
profit for the year would have been £83,000 lower / £101,000 higher (2007: £192,000 lower / £235,000 higher). Net assets would 
have been £83,000 lower / £101,000 higher (2007: £192,000 lower / £235,000 higher). 
Interest rate risk management 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is 
managed by the Group maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate 
swap contracts. The Group’s guideline is that no more than 50% of net interest rate exposures on debt (net of any working capital 
balances) should be at floating rates.  
If interest rates had been 1% higher / lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended  
30 April 2008 would decrease/increase by £357,000 (2007: decrease/increase by £150,000).  
The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section  
of this note. 
Interest rate swap contracts 
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts 
calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates  
on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate held.  
The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis. The floating rate on the interest rate swap is 3 month LIBOR. The Group will 
settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis. All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating 
rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow 
exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings. 
The fair value of the US$17,500,000 swap at 30 April 2008 is estimated at US$1,145,000; £578,000 (2007: US$393,000; £197,000) 
and has a maturity date of 9 May 2011.  
The fair value of the £30,000,000 swap at 30 April 2008 is estimated at £455,000 and has a maturity date of 1 May 2013. 
Both interest rate swaps have been designated and deemed 100% effective as cash flow hedges allowing the fair value to be 
deferred in equity. At 30 April 2008, the fair value deferred in equity for interest rate swaps was £837,000 (2007: £197,000). 
Credit risk management 
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments. The Group’s 
credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for 
doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event, which, based on previous 
experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit 
ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. 
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

Liquidity risk management 
The Group maintains a debt to capital ratio that has flexibility to allow it to meet its strategic objectives. In addition, policies have 
been set on borrowing levels to net cash requirements and covenants of financing sources to be used. The Group’s requirements 
are reviewed annually or more often if the need arises. Included in note 20 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the 
Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.

The DTZ Holdings plc 2006 Co-investment and Long Term Incentive Plans 
Full details of the Co-investment Plan and Long Term Incentive Plan are included in the Directors’ remuneration report on  
pages 39 to 46. 
The Co-investment Plan is available to a Group of approximately 20 (2007: 21) Senior Executives including the Executive Directors. 
The maximum number of shares awarded in 2008 is 127,711 (2007: 109,939) and no shares have vested. The fair value of the 
shares under the plan is based on the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at the date of the award. Awards made under 
this Co-investment Plan are classified as equity settled. The expense recognised in respect of these awards was £103,000 (2007: 
£246,000). 
Six (2007: five) Senior Executives (including the Executive Directors) were granted a conditional award of shares under the Long 
Term Incentive Plan. The number of shares awarded in respect of 2008 was 186,868 (2007: 103,412). The fair value of the shares 
under the Long Term Incentive Plan is based on the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at the date of the award. All 
performance criteria are expected to be met. Awards made under this Scheme are classified as equity settled. The expense 
recognised in respect of these awards was £409,000 (2007: £231,000).

and therefore the full cost, before minority interests, has been disclosed.

27. Retirement benefit obligations 
Within the UK the Group operates two occupational pension schemes, one of which (the DTZ 2002 Retirement Plan) provides 
benefits based on final pensionable salary and is closed to new entrants, and the second being a defined contribution scheme.  
In addition the Group operates a personal pension plan open to employees not covered by the other two schemes. The assets  
of all the pension schemes are held separately from those of the Group. Provision is also made for the capitalised value of future 
pensions payable to certain former partners and widows of the Bernard Thorpe partnership (‘Bernard Thorpe Annuitants’). 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. The Group has adopted the revised version  
of IAS19 (Employee Benefits) published in December 2004. As permitted by the revised standard, actuarial gains and losses are 
recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense. The liability recognised in  
the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, as reduced by the fair value of assets. The cost  
of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method. 
DTZ 2002 Retirement Plan (‘2002 Plan’) 
The results of the formal actuarial valuation as at 30 April 2005 were updated to the accounting date by an independent qualified 
actuary in accordance with the IAS19. As required by IAS19, the value of the defined benefit obligation and current service cost  
has been measured using the projected unit credit method. 
The expected rate of return on assets for the financial year ended 30 April 2008 was 6.3% pa (2006/07: 6.4% pa). This rate is 
derived by taking the weighted average of the long-term expected rate of return on each of the asset classes that the 2002 Plan 
was invested in at 30 April 2007. 
The amount of contributions paid to the 2002 Plan during 2007/08 was £0.8 million (2006/07: £0.9 million) and these are not 
expected to materially change in 2008/09. 
The 2002 Plan’s benefits were amended from 1 April 2006 and these changes have been reflected in our calculations accordingly. 
The changes only affect pension earned after 1 April 2006. 
The following table sets out the key IAS19 assumptions used:

The amount recognised outside profit or loss in the statement of recognised income and expense for 2008 for the 2002 Plan is a 
loss of £0.1 million (2007: gain of £3.4 million). This is the sum of actuarial gains and losses on the defined benefit obligation and 
the assets. The figure for the Bernard Thorpe Annuitants is a gain of £0.3 million (2007: gain of £0.2 million). 
The actual return on the 2002 Plan’s assets over the year was £1.1 million (2007: £3.4 million).

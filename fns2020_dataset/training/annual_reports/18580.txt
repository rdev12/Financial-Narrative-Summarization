“ The Board is recommending

A Year of Strategic Delivery
Genus had a strong year in 2015, as 
we delivered on our innovation-led 
strategy and increasingly focused on 
the larger scale commercial producers 
of pork, beef and milk, who are most 
able to benefit from our genetic 
improvement. We achieved particularly 
strong profit growth, driven by an 
excellent year for Genus PIC in the 
Americas. Genus ABS grew sales 
worldwide but higher product costs 
meant its profits were flat in constant 
currency. Difficult conditions in China 
and Russia held back Genus Asia 
but both markets now appear to be 
exhibiting early signs of improvement.
Our genetic lead in our porcine and 
bovine products is underpinned by our 
R&D programmes and we continued 
to strengthen our pipeline. During the 
year, we continued to increase the 
rate of porcine genetic improvement, 
accelerated the production of high-
quality dairy genetics through 
our elite herds and conducted 
successful trials of our Genus Sexed 
Semen (‘GSS’) technology. 
We also added to our capabilities 
in dairy and beef, through the 
purchase of a majority stake in IVB. 
IVB will enhance our model in ABS, 
allowing us to offer superior male and 
female genetics through embryos 
to our beef and dairy customers. In 
addition, we successfully completed 
the integration of Génétiporc, which 
we acquired in the previous year, 
and acquired Birchwood Genetics.
High-Calibre Leadership
The Genus Executive Leadership 
Team (‘GELT’) is now well established 
and we are seeing the team’s impact 
across the business. GELT is made 
up of highly qualified leaders, who 
are working together to deliver our 
strategy and tackle the issues we 
face, through collaboration and by 
constructively challenging each other. 
GELT’s members bring deep sectoral 
or functional expertise to the business, 
coupled with the strength of intellect 
we need to drive the business forward.
The latest evaluation of the Board’s 
performance confirmed that it 
continues to perform well and provides 
the right oversight and guidance to the 
Group. Following the appointments of 
Professor Duncan Maskell and Lykele 
van der Broek as Non-Executive 
Directors, which we reported on last 
year, there were no further additions 
to the Board in 2015. During the year 
both new Board members completed 
their induction and are already making 
a significant contribution. The principal 
change from the evaluation has been 
that the Board has increased time 
devoted to developing our strategy.
Professor Barry Furr retired as 
a Non-Executive Director at the 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) in 
November 2014. We were greatly 
saddened by his death in early 2015 
and want to record our thanks for 
his immense contribution to the 
Company during the eight years 
that Barry served on the Board.
More information about our corporate 
governance arrangements, including 
details of the Board evaluation and 
our induction programme, can 
be found on pages 54 to 83.
A Responsible Business
CSR is fundamental to our business 
and integral to every part of our 
strategy. Its importance is reflected 
in our vision – pioneering animal 
genetic improvement to help 
nourish the world – which captures 
our contribution to society. Our 
CSR Committee helps lead these 
efforts, defines our CSR strategy 
and oversees the execution of this 
strategy. Its members include our in-
house experts on animal welfare, the 
environment, safety and employees.
Genus employs over 2,600 people 
worldwide and I want to thank every 
one for their dedication and hard work 
throughout the year. We continue to 
invest in developing their skills and 
unleashing their talent, recognising 
that this underpins our service delivery 
for customers and our ability to 
innovate. We recognise exceptional 
new thinking through our coveted 
Chairman’s Award. This year, the award 
went to a team from ABS in North 
America, who devised “Net Profit 
Genetics”, a programme challenging 
dairy customers to think differently 
about selecting sires for their 
herds. The programme exemplifies 
the spirit that runs through the 
Chairman’s Award and I congratulate 
the team for its achievement.
Providing Returns to Shareholders
The Board directs the Company 
on shareholders’ behalf. Providing 
attractive returns on capital 
and dividends to shareholders 
are therefore an important part 
of our corporate goals.
We are recommending a final dividend 
of 13.4 pence per share. Combined 
with the interim dividend of 6.1 pence 
per share, this gives a total dividend 
for the year of 19.5 pence per share. 
This is an increase of 10% over last 
year. The final dividend will be paid 
on 4 December 2015 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of 
business on 20 November 2015.
Summary
Genus performed strongly 
during the year and continued to 
successfully deliver on its strategy. 
The Board remains focused on the 
Group’s leadership and talent, its 
R&D capabilities, the execution 
of its strategy, and overseeing 
the Company’s performance. 
The long-term drivers of our 
markets remain attractive and we 
continue to position the business 
to benefit from this opportunity.

Chief Executive’s Review
Karim Bitar
Genus achieved very good progress in 2015, 
with the benefit of many of the strategic 
changes that have been made over the last 
few years contributing towards the strong 
operational performance overall. We continued 
to step up the pace of genetic improvement 
and achieved encouraging progress in our R&D 
initiatives, which bodes well for the future  
as we become an increasingly science and 
intellectual property based company. The 
acquisition of 51% of IVB will also enable us to 
provide innovative new genetic solutions to our 
customers in the dairy and beef industries. 
Group Performance
Genus’s overall performance was 
strong in 2015. Revenues grew 7% 
to £398m, on volume growth of 6% 
in porcine and 6% in dairy and beef. 
Adjusted profit before tax, including 
joint ventures (‘JVs’), was up 19% 
to £46.6m and growth in constant 
currency was even stronger at 23%.
PIC had an outstanding year, with 
17% operating profit growth including 
JVs in constant currency. This was 
driven by an excellent performance 
in the Americas, with the completion 
of Génétiporc’s integration and 
the addition of Birchwood both 
contributing. We also saw a 
recovery in the porcine industry, 
as the impact of porcine epidemic 
diarrhoea virus (‘PEDv’) waned.  Genus plc Annual Report 2015

INFORMATION
“ Genus’s overall performance 
was very strong in 2015.”
Performance in ABS and Asia was 
more mixed, with both businesses 
delivering stable profits in constant 
currency compared with the prior year. 
ABS’s sales performance was positive 
in all regions despite weakening 
conditions in global dairy markets 
but higher product costs held back 
overall profits. Our strategic actions 
in ABS to increase differentiation 
through breeding our own bulls, 
developing proprietary indices and 
new technologies, such as IVF and 
GSS, all made good progress. 
Our Asian operations continued to 
face challenging conditions in porcine 
markets, with Chinese producers 
making losses through most of the 
year. Russia was also affected by weak 
markets and closure of the border to 
imports. Conditions in both of these 
markets appear more encouraging 
as we enter the new financial year.
Strategy
Our innovation strategy starts with 
R&D. We continued to implement 
advances in selection techniques 
that are significantly accelerating 
genetic gains in our porcine nucleus 
herds. These new genetics are now 
working their way through our 
supply chain, and customers will 
start to benefit from them during 
2016 and 2017. We also applied 
these approaches in bovine, as we 
developed proprietary indices and 
pursued our breeding programme 
in the dairy and beef nucleus herds 
we initiated in 2014. Some of the elite 
young sires from this programme 
will enter production in 2016. 
Our leading-edge research 
programmes in the areas of disease 
resistance and genetic dissemination 
technology passed several 
scientifically significant milestones, 
although these projects remain 
long-term in nature. In addition, we 
continued to make good progress 
with the technical milestones on 
GSS and are vigorously pursuing 
our anti-trust litigation in the US to 
seek to create an open market for 
our technology. The trial date has 
now been set for 1 August 2016.
In March, we acquired 51% of IVB, the 
world’s leading supplier of bovine IVF 
services. Combining IVB’s skills with 
ABS’s leading genetic management 
tools will enable us to accelerate 
the genetic improvement of our 
customers’ herds and opens up 
new opportunities. During the year, 
IVB introduced a novel method of 
producing frozen embryos which 
makes their implantation significantly 
easier. Our initial integration of the 
business is progressing well. 
We generate value for our genetics by 
targeting key markets and segments 
and tailoring our business model to 
the needs of our customers in these 
markets. PIC increased its market 
share and grew penetration of the 
royalty model, particularly in Europe 
and Asia. Génétiporc was fully 
integrated a year ahead of schedule 
and we are very pleased with the 
results in North America and Latin 
America. We also acquired Birchwood, 
a boar stud operation serving mid-
sized customers in North America, to 
strengthen our distribution of male 
genetics in this segment. Its results 
are consistent with our expectations.
In China, we continued to adapt 
our business model to reduce 
financial investment and exposure 
to the volatile farming market, 
exiting two owned farms and 
completing the stocking of our first 
third-party multiplier, Riverstone, 
during the year. Riverstone, which 
is also a royalty-based customer, 
will stock a second farm in 2016. 
We gave more details of our strategy 
and our progress with its execution  
at a Capital Markets Day we hosted  
in London in May 2015. A webcast  
of the event is available at 
www.genusplc.com.
Our People
GELT was unchanged in 2015 and I 
am very pleased with the Group’s high 
energy, individual capabilities and 
collective teamwork. It is a privilege 
to work with such a strong team. 
During the year, we strengthened 
further our people management 
practices, training and talent 
development, and increased our 
emphasis on the health and safety 
of employees. Our employee pulse 
survey showed that our employees 
have a very significant commitment 
to our vision, values and strategy. 
Their passion and engagement 
makes a big contribution to the 
value we deliver to our customers 
and our success in the market. 
Outlook
In 2015, we significantly exceeded our 
target double-digit compound annual 
growth in adjusted operating profit 
in constant currency. Our constant 
currency growth rate in 2016, while 
in line with expectations, is expected 
to be more moderate. Based on 
current conditions, we are cautiously 
optimistic about improved results in 
Asia. However, we remain cautious 
about prospects in dairy, where market 
conditions are very tough for our 
customers, and porcine commodity 
prices have worsened compared 
with last year. The sharp depreciation 
of the Euro, Rouble and most Latin 
American currencies over the last year 
will also be a continuing headwind.

Market Opportunities
The Animal Genetics Market
Consumers around the world are increasingly demanding safe, 
affordable and high-quality animal protein. At the same time, 
farmers are striving to produce animal protein more efficiently, 
in part because of increasing competition for finite resources. 
Genetics are critical to addressing these challenges.
1. Growing demands for 
animal protein
The global population continues to 
grow and is becoming increasingly 
urbanised. These demographic 
shifts mean much of the increase 
in demand is coming from 
emerging markets, in regions such 
as Asia and Latin America.

As consumers move from an 
agricultural to an urban lifestyle, 
they tend to become wealthier. 
This in turn leads to an increasing 
demand for animal protein, as 
meat and dairy products become 
a larger part of people’s diets.
2. Supply constraints
At the same time as demand is 
rising, production is becoming more 
challenging. Competition for resources 
such as water and land for producing 
animal protein is intensifying. 
Increasingly volatile and unpredictable 
weather patterns can also significantly 
affect crop harvests and hence the 
availability and cost of animal feed. 
This puts pressure on producers 
to be as efficient as possible.
3. Shorter, simpler  
supply chains
Supply chains that were previously 
fragmented, with multiple steps 
between food producers and 
consumers, are becoming shorter 
and transparency is increasing. 
The result is that consumer needs 
are having a more direct influence 
on food producers. This is driving 
demand for higher-quality animal 
protein and less use of drugs.
4. Changes in production
In response to all these issues, 
food producers are increasingly 
turning to high-quality genetics to 
increase production and efficiency. 
For example, artificial insemination 
(‘AI’) in dairy has reached 75% in 
the US and 50% in India. There is 
scope for considerable growth 
in markets such as Brazil, where 
AI is used in just 13% of herds.
The scale of production is also 
increasing, as producers focus on 
efficiency and look to consolidate 
and vertically integrate, leading 
to a greater proportion of animal 
protein being delivered by larger, 
more technified producers globally. 
For example, in porcine, large scale 
integrated pork production accounts 
for the majority of pork production 
in the US and Brazil, and is a growing 
proportion of production in China.

Genus PIC and Genus ABS operate 
in markets with different dynamics.
The global porcine sector is 
consolidated and technified in many 
of our key markets, with strong 
representation of large integrated pork 
producers. Such producers are more 
able to measure and realise the direct 
benefits of genetic improvement and 
often rely on head-to-head validation 
trials to select their preferred supplier 
of genetics. These genetics are 
supplied from proprietary animal lines 
and purchased on multi-year genetic 
improvement contracts, with payment 
tied to the resulting improvement in 
the customer’s breeding herd. The net 
result is a market with differentiated 
products and high barriers to entry.
In dairy and beef, the global market 
is much more fragmented and 
customers are typically less technified. 
Products and their genetic merit 
have historically been benchmarked 
to public indices and all breeders’ 
genetics are typically sold in an open 
market system, with no restrictions on 
further genetic dissemination through 
the resale of genetic offspring. Barriers 
to entry are therefore lower and 
products are priced on a transactional 
basis. However, both the dairy and 
beef industry are seeing an increasing 
trend towards technification, with 
some of the leading dairy and 
beef producers looking to invest in 
bilateral partnerships with genetic 
suppliers to improve their productivity 
and the quality of their herds.

DELIVERING & SHARING V ALUE
“ Genus is absolutely focused on driving genetic 
improvement faster than ever, delivering this 
improvement to our customers more quickly 
and efficiently, and capturing a share of the 
value we deliver to our customers.”
Karim Bitar
Chief Executive
Our competitive edge comes from:
• continuously improving our proprietary lines of 
breeding animals, using the best science available;
• our global distribution capability, through our supply 
chain, technical service and sales network;
• long-lasting customer relationships, enhanced by our 
services to help farmers get the best from our 
products; and
• a business model and multi-species approach that 
allow us to continually strengthen and leverage our 
technology platform.
Genus’s Competitive Advantages
Genus’s business model is built on competitive 
advantages which help us create value for our 
customers and shareholders. Our strategy 
(see pages 14 and 15) reinforces and builds  
on these advantages.
Genus accelerates genetic 
improvement by exploiting 
rapid advances in molecular 
and genetic biology. We do 
this through our world-class 
in-house team of scientists and 
technicians, and by strategically 
collaborating with universities 
and other biotech companies. 
Our proprietary techniques help 
us determine the best animals 
to mate, so our customers see 
faster genetic gains. To determine 
breeding goals, we use proprietary 
indices of desirable animal 
traits. We own elite animals, 
and supplement them with elite 
genetics from outside our herds.
We work closely with customers 
and tailor our genetic programmes 
to their needs. This enables 
us to deliver outstanding and 
differentiated products, to maximise 
our customers’ profitability.

Our porcine business owns 
genetic nuclei herds, where 
we continuously improve the 
genetic traits of our proprietary 
elite pig lines. We then cross and 
multiply these lines, to provide 
breeding stock for commercial 
pig production. We do this 
through more than 500 breeding 
herds in 35 countries, around 
98% of which are owned by 
our customers or third-party 
multipliers. This structure is a 
significant strength, allowing 
us to meet demand for our 
genetics throughout the world, 
protect our intellectual property 
and reduce our exposure to 
farming and commodity risk.
Genus ABS operates owned 
studs in the UK, US, Canada 
and Brazil, with a further stud 
currently under construction in 
India. We also house our bulls 
in third-party owned studs in 
North America, Europe, Australia 
and Latin America, providing 
ABS with a significant distribution 
platform. We process and 
distribute genetics to over 
40,000 customers worldwide, 
selling directly in 23 countries 
and through distributors in a 
further 54 countries. Following 
our acquisition of 51% of IVB, 
Genus ABS also produces and 
distributes embryos. Through 
embryo production, we are 
able to provide our customers 
with an elite genetic product, 
by controlling the selection 
of both male and female 
parent donors (see page 4).
To maximise our products’ 
potential, our technical service 
teams assist customers to achieve 
the best results in nutrition, 
reproduction, health management 
and other areas. Our teams 
help customers select the right 
genes to meet their goals, and 
we also benchmark our products 
against our competitors’.
We look to capture an 
appropriate share of 
the value we deliver to 
customers. We do this by:
• targeting customers who will 
value Genus genetics;
• demonstrating the value of 
our genetics; and
• aligning Genus’s interests with 
its customers’, by linking our 
prices to higher productivity 
and the genetic improvement 
delivered.

INFORMATION
Our strategy for growth has four elements:
Increasing 
Genetic Control 
and Product 
Differentiation
To maintain and enhance 
our product leadership.
We do this by:
• enhancing our use of 
genomics, to strongly 
accelerate the rate of 
genetic improvement;
• increasing our control of 
bovine genetic 
development, through 
elite nucleus herds and 
proprietary indices;
• investing in proprietary 
technologies, with a focus 
on disease resistance and 
gender skew; and
• collaborating with 
universities and 
biotechnology companies 
on the latest 
developments in 
quantitative and 
molecular genetics.
Targeting Key

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Genus supplies biological products to agricultural 
customers and is exposed to a wide range of risks and 
uncertainties. Some of these risks relate to current 
business operations in our global agricultural markets, 
while others relate to future commercial exploitation of 
our extensive R&D portfolio. The table below outlines 
the principal risks and uncertainties affecting Genus 
and how we manage them.
More information on how we identify and manage risks 
can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement 
on pages 58 and 59.
Strategic Risks
Risk description How we manage risk Strategy Risk change in FY15
Developing products and 
our competitive edge
• Development programme fails to 
produce best genetics for 
customers.
• Increased competition reduces 
market share and margins.
Dedicated teams align our 
product development to customer 
requirements, while our technical 
services help customers make best 
use of our products. We frequently 
measure our performance against 
competitors in customers’ systems, 
to ensure the value added by our 
genetics remains competitive.
Commercialising GSS 
technology
• Launching a new product 
technology carries technical, 
production and financial risks.
• Failure to commercialise our GSS 
technology due to intellectual 
property (‘IP’) and other disputes.
We have a rigorous process 
to prepare for the successful 
commercial launch of our GSS 
technology, supported by 
dedicated internal resources 
and external expert advice.
We also initiated legal proceedings 
in the US, in relation to anti-trust 
issues. The outcome of these 
proceedings will not be known 
until the second half of 2016 
and could prevent or delay our 
plans to commercialise GSS.
Increased due to higher 
investment in GSS in 
2015 in response to 
successful field trials. 
Commercialising research
• Failure to focus research initiatives 
on commercially important areas.
• Failure to lead on ‘game-changing’ 
technology or to make new 
initiatives commercially viable.
• Regulatory changes may affect the 
approval process for products or 
our ability to export products to 
certain countries.
Our R&D Portfolio Management 
Team oversees our research, 
ensures we correctly prioritise our 
R&D investments and assesses 
the adequacy of resources and 
its IP freedom to operate. The 
Board is updated regularly on 
key development projects.
Key initiatives are progressing 
through the R&D life cycle.
Capturing value through 
acquisitions
• Failure to identify appropriate 
investment opportunities or to 
perform sound due diligence.
• Failure to successfully integrate an 
acquired business.
We have a rigorous acquisition 
analysis and due diligence 
process, with the Board reviewing 
and signing-off all projects. We 
also have a structured post-
acquisition integration planning 
and execution process.
The robust process that 
helped us to successfully 
acquire and integrate 
Génétiporc in 2014 was used 
again for the acquisition and 
integration of Birchwood 
and IVB in 2015.

Growing in emerging markets
• Failure to appropriately develop 
business in China and other 
emerging markets.
We have a robust organisation, 
blending local and expatriate 
executives supported by the 
global species teams, to ensure 
we comply with our global 
standards. The Board provides 
regular oversight and dedicated 
significant time in FY15 to 
discussing our strategy and the 
results of our operations in China.
Volatility in the Chinese 
porcine market continued 
in 2015. In response, we 
adjusted our plans and 
approach to the market, 
which reduced our risk. 
However, we were also 
affected by border closures in 
the Russian porcine market, 
which increased our risk.
Operational Risks
Protecting IP 
• Genus-developed genetic  
material, methods and technology 
could become freely available to 
third-parties.
We have a global, cross-functional 
process to identify and protect our 
IP. Our customer contracts and 
our selection of multipliers and 
JV partners include appropriate 
measures to protect our IP. We 
conduct robust ‘Freedom To 
Operate’ searches to identify 
third-party rights to technology.
Ensuring biosecurity and 
continuity of supply
• Loss of key livestock, owing to 
disease outbreak. 
• Loss of ability to move animals or 
semen freely (including across 
borders) due to disease outbreak, 
environmental incident or 
international trade sanctions.
• Industry-wide disease outbreaks 
affecting demand for Genus 
products.
We have stringent biosecurity 
standards, with independent 
reviews throughout the year to 
ensure compliance. We continue to 
extend the geographical diversity 
of our production facilities, to 
avoid over-reliance on single sites.
We continued to strengthen 
our health management and 
supply chain resilience. The 
risks associated with the 
2014/15 outbreak of PEDv 
in North America have been 
significantly mitigated. 
Financial Risks
Managing agricultural market 
and commodity prices 
volatility
• Fluctuations in agricultural markets 
affect customer profitability and 
therefore demand for our products 
and services.
• Increase in our operating costs, due 
to commodity pricing volatility.
We continuously monitor markets 
and seek to balance our costs and 
resources in response to market 
demand. We actively monitor and 
update our hedging strategy to 
manage our exposure. Our porcine 
royalty model and extensive use of 
third-party multipliers mitigates the 
impact of cyclical price reductions 
or cost increases in pig production.
Funding pensions
• Exposure to costs associated with 
failure of third-party members of 
joint and several liabilities pension 
scheme.
• Exposure to costs as a result of 
external factors (such as mortality 
rates, interest rates or investment 
values) affecting the size of the 
pension deficit.
We are the principal employer 
for the Milk Pension Fund and 
chair the group of participating 
employers. The fund is now closed 
to future service and has an agreed 
deficit recovery plan, based on 
the 2012 actuarial valuation. The 
result of the 2015 triennial actuarial 
valuation is due in late 2015. We 
monitor the strengths of other 
employers in the fund and have 
retained external consultants 
to provide expert advice. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

Strategic Progress
“ We have continued to make 
significant strategic 
progress, including further 
increases in the rate of 
genetic gain and a reduction 
in genetic lag. We see the 
potential for further growth 
across the world and have 
developed robust plans to 
help us seize these 
opportunities.”
Bill Christianson
Chief Operating Officer,  
Genus PIC
Increasing Genetic Control  
and Product Differentiation 
Progress Against 2015 Objectives 
We aimed to: 
• increase the rate of genetic gain by a further 10%; 
enhance our products, by completing the integration 
of Génétiporc; and reduce genetic lag by four months.
During the year, we: 
• increased the rate of genetic gain by more than 10%, 
by applying genomic analysis across all traits and 
product lines;
• integrated Génétiporc, including embedding its genes 
in our improvement programme and assimilating its 
employees; 
• acquired Birchwood Genetics to strengthen our 
genetic distribution platform serving mid- and 
small-sized customers in North America; and
• reduced genetic lag globally by two months, despite 
the impact of PEDv in North America.
2016 Priorities 
We will: 
• continue to harness genomics to accelerate the rate of 
genetic improvement; 
• develop two new product lines, combining our 
proprietary genes with those acquired from 
Génétiporc;
• invest in product validation trials, to demonstrate the 
value of our products against the top five competitors 
in each market;
• increase global distribution of our elite boars; and
• reduce genetic lag by two months. 
Targeting Key Markets  
and Segments 
Progress Against 2015 Objectives 
We aimed to: 
• build on our strength in the Americas; increase our 
presence in the top 40 European accounts; and 
introduce a relationship management system, 
enabling the global deployment of our Key Account 
Management and Technical Service offering to meet 
customers’ needs.
During the year, we: 
• increased volumes across the Americas by 8% and 
grew our share of business with the region’s top 50 
customers;
• reshaped the European team to focus on the top 40 
customers, while maintaining performance; and 
• introduced a global relationship management system, 
the Targeted Customer Interface (‘TCI’), to draw 
together information and insights on customers 
worldwide. 
2016 Priorities 
We will: 
• continue to build our presence and share of business 
with large customers in every region; 
• strengthen and standardise processes and customer 
offerings across our business, such as adopting a 
consistent global approach to key account 
management; and
• continue to build relationships with key industry

LINK TO STRATEGY
Tailoring the Business Model 
 
Progress Against 2015 Objectives 
We aimed to: 
• continue the transition to a royalty pricing model in 
South America, Europe and Asia; establish and stock 
three new sire line nucleus farms across the US and 
Latin America; and further increase supply chain 
efficiency.
During the year, we: 
• increased the proportion of global volumes under the 
royalty model, including increases of 11% in Asia and 
21% in Europe;
• established sire line nucleus farms in Quebec 
(Canada), Ohio (US), and Chihuahua (Mexico); and
• increased effectiveness across our supply chain, 
including through closing inefficient units and 
managing transport costs. 
2016 Priorities 
We will: 
• continue to implement a more consistent approach to 
our global supply chain;
• ensure our facilities remain open and operational at 
least 90% of the time, and make them more resistant 
to livestock disease; and 
• add 10,000 sows to large multiplier sites and remove 
at least 5,000 from smaller sites, to further increase 
efficiency.
Strengthening Core  
Competencies 
Progress Against 2015 Objectives 
We aimed to: 
• complete our first product validation trials in Asia; and 
develop and roll-out further training modules through 
our Key Account Manager Academy. 
During the year, we: 
• completed and won validation trials in China and 
Thailand, and started to extend trials to Europe; and 
• introduced seven new modules to our PIC Academy, 
which is our training resource for key account 
managers around the world. 
2016 Priorities 
We will: 
• continue to invest in our Academy and develop new 
training modules; 
• implement customer-centric sales techniques across 
our porcine business; and 
• continue to enhance the culture of employee health 
and safety across our business, including developing, 
implementing, communicating and measuring 
progress on global standards.  Genus plc Annual Report 2015

TRANSFORMING OUR 
JOINT VENTURE
Agroceres PIC is our JV in Brazil and 
Argentina with the Agroceres Group, 
a leading agriculture supplier. In recent 
years, Agroceres PIC has transformed 
its business and performance. Major 
changes include conversion from 
upfront sales to a royalty model, the 
construction of South America’s largest 
and most modern boar stud and the 
creation of key account management 
and technical services, dedicated to 
the top 80 accounts. The result has 
been a market share increase from 
42% to 53% and impressive operating 
profit growth in the last two years. 
The business is now well positioned 
to deliver further strong growth in 
these highly important markets.
LINK TO STRATEGY
Market
Market conditions for Genus PIC’s 
customers were generally favourable 
throughout the year, with the 
exception of Europe. In North America, 
the outbreak of PEDv that peaked 
in early 2014 led to tight pork supply 
and record pig prices in the first half 
of this financial year. Combined with 
low input costs, this gave producers 
exceptional margins. A strong rebound 
in supply during the second half of 
the year led to a considerable drop in 
US pork prices, to levels that are more 
reflective of long-term averages. 
In Brazil, pig prices reached a record 
high in October 2014 helped by 
strong exports, particularly to Russia, 
following the ban on exports from 
the EU to Russia. By the end of the 
year, prices had fallen back to more 
normal seasonal patterns. However, 
the outlook remains positive for the 
Brazilian pork sector, with strong 
domestic consumption expected and 
continuing export demand helped by 
the devaluation of the Brazilian Real.
In Europe, the first half of the 
financial year was affected by 
continuing production expansion 
and export bans, primarily to Russia, 
leading to oversupply and a 21% 
decline in pork prices compared 
with the prior year. Despite some 
stabilisation of prices in the first half 
of calendar year 2015, helped by 
increased exports, prices were still 
17% below the prior year and farmer 
margins were generally negative. 
Performance
Genus PIC performed very strongly, 
with operating profits including 
JVs up 17% in constant currency, on 
revenue growth of 15% to £175.5m. 
Volumes grew by 8%, with all 
regions contributing. Operating 
margins per MPE improved through 
completion of the integration of 
Génétiporc and the benefit of 
synergies a year ahead of schedule 
and price and cost management. 
In North America, profits were up 
11% in constant currency, on volume 
growth of 8%. Following the PEDv 
outbreak in 2014, royalties were 
impacted during the first half of this 
financial year. However, this was 
offset by strong animal shipments, 
as customers started to expand and 
improve their herds once the impact of 
the disease became better contained. 
There was also the benefit of a full 
year of Génétiporc and Birchwood 
contributed positively, as expected. 
Latin American profits improved 
42% in constant currency on a 14% 
volume increase, helped by an 
exceptionally strong operating profit 
performance from the Agroceres PIC 
JV (up 98%). Agroceres PIC benefited 
from a full year’s contribution from 
Génétiporc, investments made in 
updated genetics and an improved 
supply chain, market share gains 
and favourable market conditions. 
We also saw strong profit growth in 
Mexico (up 38%), while Latin America’s 
overhead costs were well controlled.

BENEFITING FROM OUR 
ROBUST GENETICS
Kekén is Mexico’s leading pork 
producer, with 61,500 sows. It 
operates feed manufacturing and 
processing plants, and sells through 
its 272 retail stores and via export. 
PIC has partnered with Kekén since 1992, 
supplying top genetics and technical 
expertise. The climate makes conditions 
difficult for intensive rearing but the 
robustness of our genetics has helped 
Kekén increase sales by over 100% in the 
last five years, to 153,000 tonnes in 2014.
LINK TO STRATEGY
In Europe, volumes increased 2% 
and operating profit increased 5% in 
constant currency, as we continued 
to make progress with our strategy 
to target the larger integrated pork 
producers. Progress with a number of 
key accounts was encouraging and 
the proportion of volumes sold under 
royalty contracts increased to 59% 
during the year (2014: 38%). At the 
same time, we took further action to 
reduce our exposure in directly owned 
operations, including streamlining 
and standardising the UK boar stud 
operations; establishing European 
focused support in Technical Services, 
Genetic Services, Health Assurance 
and Supply Chain; and expanding the 
supply of high indexing animals at 
multiplication partners, to supply our 
best products to European customers.
During the financial year, we 
successfully integrated Birchwood 
and Génétiporc into our operations, 
delivering the expected synergies 
from both acquisitions ahead of the 
planned timeframes. Genus PIC also 
continued to invest in technology 
(particularly genomics), distribution 
networks, technical service capabilities 
and key account management, to 
help us add even greater value for 
customers. We made continued 
progress in demonstrating the 
strength of our product offering 
through increased validation trials 
with a number of large integrated 
pork producers around the world. 
“ We have shown it is possible 
to have good results at low 
cost, through high health 
status, nutrition and the 
genetic support of PIC.”

Increasing Genetic Control  
and Product Differentiation 
Progress Against 2015 Objectives 
We aimed to: 
• increase genetic control and bovine product 
differentiation; strengthen our portfolio of genomic 
dairy bulls; and develop a genetic nucleus herd for beef.
During the year, we: 
• grew our genomic bull presence in public ranking 
indices by 18%;
• established a nucleus herd for beef and expanded our 
elite dairy female breeding programme, complementing 
our existing bulls;
• developed the two highest-ranking tropical bulls in 
Brazil, with proprietary type and management 
information; and
• acquired 51% of IVB, to help accelerate genetic 
improvement in our customers’ herds by enabling the 
selection of both male and female parents through the 
use of IVF technology.
2016 Priorities 
We will: 
• maintain competitiveness in public ranking indices, 
while positioning our products by introducing 
proprietary indices;
• further strengthen the elite female programme and 
develop plans to ring-fence our proprietary genetics;
• develop our beef nucleus herd and begin to identify 
bulls with the best genetic potential; and
• continue to develop our proprietary gender skew 
technology.
Targeting Key Markets

Progress Against 2015 Objectives 
We aimed to: 
• continue implementing our customer segmentation 
model around the world, helping us identify and meet 
the needs of each segment; grow in our existing dairy 
markets and explore new markets; and pursue direct 
service agreements with integrated beef or dairy 
suppliers.
During the year, we: 
• grew revenue by 9% (13% in Latin America, 9% in 
North America and 5% in Europe);
• used our segmentation model to start tailoring 
offerings to different customer types; and
• built relationships with leading integrated beef 
producers worldwide, with the aim of replicating the 
model established with ABP Group.
2016 Priorities 
We will: 
• build partnerships with customers seeking to improve 
operational efficiency and profit, tailoring our offering

Tailoring the Business Model 
 
Progress Against 2015 Objectives 
We aimed to: 
• demonstrate the benefits of our genetics by using our 
Genetic Management System (‘GMS’); and work with 
large integrated beef supply to validate our genetics in 
a beef-on-dairy offering.
During the year, we: 
• increased GMS use by 16%;
• tested Net Profit Genetics with profit-focused 
customers, aligning the value of our genetics with 
their commercial goals;
• progressed our beef-on-dairy offer, harnessing dairy 
herds to disseminate beef genetics; and
• worked with Powerline partners and beef processors, 
to assess the value of our genetics.
2016 Priorities 
We will: 
• emphasise the economic value of genetic 
improvement using our genetic toolbox;
• introduce globally consistent offerings for partner-
oriented customers;
• conduct further trials for our beef-on-dairy and 
Angus-on-Nelore products; and
• launching IVB USA, to capture the demand for 
commercial IVF.
Strengthening Core

Progress Against 2015 Objectives 
We aimed to: 
• upgrade our GMS, to help customers select products 
for more breeding situations; refine our supply chain 
processes, to improve product availability; and deploy 
new systems and processes, so our sales and technical 
service teams can meet their objectives.
During the year, we: 
• upgraded our hand-held GMS tool for dairy 
customers;
• enhanced our product forecasting techniques, to 
improve the efficiency of our supply chain;
• introduced tablet technology and tools, to help sales 
staff communicate with customers; and
• certified 30 Reproductive Management System 
technicians and delivered Technical Service solutions 
to more than 1,000 customers with over 1 million cows 
in 25 countries.
2016 Priorities 
We will: 
• roll-out phase 1 of our GMS software rewrite;
• promote knowledge sharing and develop an 
integrated go-to-market strategy with IVB in key 
markets; and
• continue to invest in our people, particularly

UNDERSTANDING AND 
MEETING CUSTOMER 
NEEDS
Genus ABS focuses on its customers’ 
needs. T o do this, we segment our 
customer base and tailor our offer to 
individual requirements. This can range 
from supplying quality genetics to a 
full Reproductive Management System 
(‘RMS’) package, which helps customers 
to optimise their herd pregnancies. 
We also innovate to improve 
performance. Research showed 
that non-RMS customers found it 
challenging to detect when cows 
were in heat. In response, we helped 
to develop Breeder T ag. More than 
150 farms now use the system across 
Europe. It increases the number of 
pregnancies by nearly 50% in the 
first year, subsequently generating 
a significant return on investment.
LINK TO STRATEGY
Market
Following a period of buoyant prices 
in the early part of 2014, dairy prices 
declined significantly in Europe, North 
America and Latin America. This 
resulted from a number of causes, 
including: a Russia dairy import 
ban; the slow down of China milk 
powder imports; intense pressure in 
many international retail consumer 
markets; the impact of the removal 
of EU dairy quotas in the spring 
of 2015; and favourable weather 
conditions in key dairy producing 
countries, resulting in oversupply. 
By June 2015, global dairy prices 
were down 32% over the prior year, 
with Europe down 19%, the US down 
28% and Brazil down 5%. In the short 
term, dairy prices are expected to 
remain depressed, with global supply 
still exceeding demand and countries 
with milk production deficits having 
already taken advantage of low 
prices to stockpile imports. Market 
predictions are for a gradual recovery 
at best, towards the end of this 
calendar year and going into 2016. 
Beef prices have continued on their 
upward trajectory in the US, with 
average prices 11% higher than they 
were a year ago as demand continues 
to outstrip supply. The Brazilian beef 
market should also remain strong, with 
the Brazil export industry continuing 
to expand with countries such as 
China looking overseas to meet their 
demand, and the weakening Real 
providing a competitive advantage.
Performance
Genus ABS had a flat operating 
profit in constant currency, on 
volume growth of 8% and revenue 
growth of 9%. Higher regional profit 
contributions in all regions were offset 
by increased central supply chain 
costs, principally due to royalties 
on leased genomic bulls, adverse 
foreign exchange cross-rates on 
US produced semen, and a higher 
mix of sorted semen. Effective 
sales management enabled a 2% 
improvement in average selling prices 
(‘blend’) across the business and 
ancillary product sales also improved. 
In North America, profits grew by 
13% in constant currency, driven 
by a 1% volume increase, increased 
blend, strong cost management 
and additional contributions from 
adjacent products. Beef performance 
was strong, with volumes up 18% 
over the prior year, including the 
continued increased use of beef 
semen in dairy cows. Sorted 
semen volumes grew 54%.
In Europe, profits improved 7% in 
constant currency. France, UK and 
the European Distributor business 
helped volumes to grow 14%. 
However, the strong growth in the 
European Distributor business, where 
product is sold at wholesale prices, 
led to an overall 5% blend decrease 
in Europe. Profit growth of 3% in 
the core markets of the UK, Italy 
and France was tempered by the 
challenging dairy market conditions.

EXPANDING OUR 
PRESENCE IN INDIA
ABS India is expanding rapidly. Having 
grown from 700,000 units of semen in 
2011 to over 2 million in 2015, ABS India is 
now investing in a greenfield production 
facility, through our JV with Chitale.
The state-of-the-art facility is scheduled 
to commission in the second quarter 
of FY16. It will be able to produce over 
7 million semen straws a year and draws 
on our global best practice in health 
and safety, product development and 
production. It will fast-track the genetic 
progress of our stud, reducing the 
genetic gap for Indian dairy animals. 
The investment demonstrates our 
commitment to the Indian dairy market 
and our belief in its long-term growth.
LINK TO STRATEGY
Market
Market conditions continued to be 
challenging across much of the region 
in the period. In China, a slow down 
in demand for higher priced protein 
foods combined with over supply 
continued to depress pork prices for 
much of the year, impacting pork 
producer profitability. The total sow 
herd over the last 18 months reduced 
by 19%, or almost 9.5 million animals. 
By way of comparison, the total 
US sow herd size is approximately 
6 million. The reductions in supply 
led to a recovery in the pork price 
of approximately 15% towards the 
end of the financial year, helping 
producers’ margins to return to 
positive in June 2015 based on 
Genus’s analysis. Though imports 
into China are a small proportion of 
the market (approximately 2–4%), 
the recent increase in price and low 
domestic supply may provide some 
support to the global market as a 
whole in the next financial year.
Russia implemented a ban on pig 
imports from Europe and North 
America for much of the period. 
However, weakness in the general 
economy and reduced access 
to finance have had a significant 
impact on producers’ willingness to 
expand, despite the business being 
profitable and the country needing 
further growth in agriculture to 
become self-sufficient. As we enter 
the new financial year, Russia has 
approved imports from Canada 
which should benefit Genus. 
In the Philippines, pig prices were 
lower than last year’s record high but 
still ahead of expectations. Producers 
are profitable and the industry 
continues to attract investment. 
Dairy prices across Asia have been 
impacted by the fall in global dairy 
prices, caused at least in part by a 
reduction in Chinese milk powder 
imports, as well as the Russian 
ban on dairy imports from Europe, 
North America and other countries. 
However, in Russia prices are up 3% 
due to the supply constraints caused 
by the import bans. In Australia, 
dairy prices have remained stable, 
helped by the fall in the currency, 
while in India, prices are down 12% 
compared to the prior year. 
Performance
Adjusted operating profit including 
JVs was unchanged in constant 
currency, while revenue declined by 
9%, primarily due to lower porcine 
sales in Russia, which was affected 
by the border closure and the 
slower economy. Results in actual 
currency were lower than constant 
currency, primarily due to the 
devaluation of the Russian Rouble. 
Porcine
Overall results for the porcine business 
reduced, with volumes 7% lower, 
revenue 18% lower and operating 
profit including JVs 7% lower. In 
Russia, operating profit reduced by 
£1.2m in constant currency (£1.8m in 
actual currency). Although upfront 
sales of gilts and boars were heavily 
affected by the market conditions,

GROWING LOCAL 
SUPPLY THROUGH 
PARTNERSHIP
In the Philippines, demand for quality 
pork is rising. However, producers find 
it difficult to increase output because 
of the high investment required, limited 
local supply of quality breeding stock 
and the long production cycle. 
PIC Philippines therefore partners with 
investors and the Bank of the Philippine 
Islands, giving producers access to 
our genetics and technical services, 
alongside funding on favourable terms. 
This is supporting the construction 
of two contract production facilities, 
whose owners are long-standing PIC 
supply chain partners. The units will be 
stocked in FY16 with our genetically 
advanced breeding stock, to upgrade 
and expand the local supply chain 
and serve customers nationwide.
LINK TO STRATEGY
strong customer relationships kept 
the business profitable and healthy. 
As the industry resumes growth to 
enhance self-sufficiency, and with 
the border recently opening to 
imports from Canada, Genus is well 
positioned to capture this opportunity. 
The operating loss in China porcine 
reduced by £0.6m. Market prices 
remained low during most of the year, 
depressing demand for breeding 
stock, and volumes and breeding 
margin reduced. However, increased 
productivity at the Besun JV and 
in our owned farms, and control 
of selling costs, more than offset 
this. Slaughter test results and the 
operational metrics being achieved 
by our customers have demonstrated 
the value of PIC genetics in China. 
We are working closely with top 
producers, including delivering animals 
under the first royalty agreement with 
Riverstone. In line with our strategy 
of reducing farming exposure, we 
exited two owned farms during the 
year. Following these actions, we 
now have two owned farms in China 
and our share of the Besun JV.
We continued to have good growth 
in the Philippines where operating 
profit grew by 24% and in Vietnam, 
volumes grew by 37%. Both 
businesses grew royalty revenues. 
Bovine
Overall bovine results improved, 
with revenue up 10% on 1% growth 
in volumes, and operating profits up 
7%. In China, revenues and profits 
improved as we continued to broaden 
and develop our sales channels, while 
strengthening our non-exclusive 
distributor relationship with SKX.
Operating profit in India more than 
doubled, with continued growth 
in average selling prices as the 
mix of genomic semen increased. 
Construction of the new Chitale JV 
stud is on track to complete this 
calendar year, which will enable 
us to expand our range of bulls. A 
series of marketing campaigns has 
better positioned ABS as the largest 
international supplier and the only 
one with local production in India. 
The Australian business was 
operationally stable during the 
year but incurred a loss on the sale 
of a legacy property. Distributor 
markets were lower due to reduced 
volumes in Japan in the first half, 
although performance improved 
as the year progressed. 
Summary
2015 was a challenging year, with 
adverse market conditions in 
Russia and China. Our continued 
focus on strategic initiatives has 
positioned the business to benefit 
from an improvement in market 
conditions when they arise. 
“Despite market challenges 
in China and Russia, 
Genus maintained overall 
performance with profits

Genus R&D
Strategic Progress
“ Our R&D programme uses 
multiple technologies, 
collaborative partnerships 
and computational 
techniques to generate the 
genetic improvement that 
delivers economic benefits 
for our customers.”
Dr Jonathan Lightner
Chief R&D and Scientific Officer 
Delivering Results Today, Shaping 
Success for Tomorrow 
Our business is founded on 
discovering, developing and delivering 
genetic improvement, to create 
economic benefit for our customers. 
In particular, we are harnessing the 
revolution in genome science, as the 
platform for predictive modelling that 
informs our product development. 
This improves the speed with 
which we select products with trait 
combinations that help customers 
achieve their commercial goals. 
The mission of our R&D teams is 
to deliver sustained profit growth 
across our businesses, by:
• continuously improving the quality 
of our products, using the best tools 
available; 
• discovering new value that can be 
delivered by genetics; and 
• exploring the limits of genome 
science, to enhance our current 
businesses and create new ones. 
We target the majority of our 
research investment in three 
value-creation areas: health and 
welfare, obtaining offspring of the 
optimal gender (gender skew), 
and applying genome science 
advances to genomic selection.
Animal Health and Welfare 
During the year, we continued to 
work with public sector researchers 
to explore genetic improvements 
that enhance animal well-being. 
We pursue multiple approaches 
to creating relevant disease 
resistance. These range from 
applying genomic information 
in natural selection breeding, 
through to cutting-edge gene 
editing, to produce highly targeted 
changes to the animal’s genes. 
We also advanced the application 
of genome science in improving 
the health of dairy cattle. We used 
genomics and naturally occurring 
variation to identify dairy sires that 
produce daughters with a far lower 
incidence of multiple health problems, 
during the transition from giving birth 
to entering the milking herd. These 
sires were developed by leveraging 
our Real World Data (‘RWD’) data sets 
and will be introduced in the coming 
financial year, with a star ranking on a 
proprietary TransitionRight™ index. 
Gender Skew 
We continued to invest in developing 
proprietary gender skew technology, 
to deliver sexed semen for beef 
and dairy customers. This will allow 
livestock producers to achieve 
offspring of their desired sex. 
Dairy producers, for example, 
may wish to gain female calves. 
We believe that the biomechanical 
technology we are developing will 
deliver this benefit with better results 
than other approaches available in the 
market today. We have now conducted 
extensive field testing, which has 
resulted in over 1,000 pregnancies.  Genus plc Annual Report 2015

INFORMATION
In parallel, we have made significant 
progress with developing the 
infrastructure required to bring 
the technology into production. 
We have tested the technology, 
to ensure it can operate at the 
required intensity over sustained 
periods. We have also remodelled 
a commercial production facility. 
This activity has moved us 
from proof of concept in early 
2014 to manufacturing scale up 
and commercial readiness. 
Genomic Selection 
We lead the industry in applying 
molecular markers, imputation and 
single step genomic prediction to 
genetic improvement in livestock. 
Within our porcine product 
development, for instance, we have 
accelerated genetic improvement 
significantly since the advent of 
relationship-based genomic selection 
in 2013. While we continue to harness 
and improve existing techniques, we 
are also exploring another potential 
step change by working with the 
Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, UK, to 
assess genotype by sequencing as 
an alternative to single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms. This would change 
the amount of information we use in 
the genome from tens of thousands 
of data points today to billions of data 
points, potentially transforming our 
ability to accurately predict product 
performance and to fully leverage the 
natural genetic variation in our animals.
Within beef and dairy, we are 
also applying genomics to aid the 
development of proprietary genetics 
that will shape a more differentiated 
offer. Progress is evident in the 
development of our beef nucleus 
herd and offspring from our elite 
female programme for dairy, 
through which we are bringing the 
male and female sides of product 
development under our control. In 
parallel, we are developing proprietary 
indices for both beef and dairy, built 
around the traits that will deliver 
economic benefits for customers. 
This differs from public rankings, 
which typically put greater emphasis 
on physical attributes. These indices 
will help our customers identify 
the animals that are best suited to 
support their commercial goals.  Genus plc Annual Report 2015

Operating Review
Performance
Investment in R&D for the year 
increased by 1% in constant currency. 
This reflected investments in our 
research and IP capabilities, our 
computational capabilities in 
bovine and investments in beef 
product development. In porcine 
product development, increased 
investments in product validation 
and genomic testing were more 
than offset by the early exit from 
the Génétiporc Quebec nucleus and 
favourable commodity prices. 
Research expenditure continued, as in 
previous years, to focus on genomic 
evaluation, gender skew and animal 
health and welfare. In genomic 
evaluation, we continued to explore the 
frontiers of genomic information and 
its use in animal genetic improvement. 
We are actively exploring genotype 
by sequencing approaches that 
could be applied across our animal 
systems. In gender skew, we 
completed additional field trials of the 
GSS technology and validated the 
production characteristics of our GSS 
instrumentation. Capital expenditure 
to support the GSS development and 
production validation was increased 
in the year to £7.6m (2014: £1.8m). In 
health and welfare research projects, 
our university collaborations produced 
several gene-edited animals, with the 
intention of testing specific approaches 
to improve animal health. We also 
stepped up our internal capabilities 
in IP development and research 
strategy, with key talent additions.
Bovine product development 
expenditure increased by 4%, with 
key investments in genetic services to 
create custom indices using our RWD 
data system, and in beef resources 
and progeny testing, to deliver higher 
genetic control and differentiation 
in beef. Our RWD system allows us 
to develop unique genetic insights, 
which deliver customer value. The 
system continued to grow in 2015, 
with a 24% increase in the number of 
herds it covers to 1,438, representing 
over 23.8 million animals, and now 
include operations in five countries.
In the dairy genetic nucleus of elite 
females, the quality and quantity 
of Holstein animals delivered is 
exceeding our expectations. We 
continue to create and acquire 
high-quality female animals for 
this programme, including our first 
Jersey additions in 2015. Our first 
genomic sires from the proprietary 
Holstein programme will be placed 
into stud in the next few months. Our 
beef product development nucleus 
is achieving aggressive goals in 
terms of the quantity of pregnancies 
produced and has delivered the 
first bulls to stud in the UK, in 
support of our ABP collaboration.
Porcine product development 
expenditure declined by 9% due to 
the operational synergies from the

VALIDATING OUR 
PRODUCTS’ 
PERFORMANCE
Genus PIC has long used scientific 
trials run in commercial systems. These 
help us to understand our products’ 
performance and benchmark them 
against competitors, to aid business 
growth and identify improvements. 
In the past, we have conducted these 
projects in the technically mature North 
American market. However, in recent 
years we have significantly expanded 
our validation activities. In 2015, we 
completed trials against local leaders 
in Spain and China, two key growth 
markets. These trials showed our 
products had significant advantages 
for traits such as efficiency, growth and 
robustness. This demonstrates the value 
our genetics add for customers and will 
enable targeted product refinements.

OPTIMISING 
CUSTOMERS’ 
BREEDING
Selection indices help dairy farmers 
choose bull mates with the right genetic 
traits for their females. However, the 
common indices do not always reflect 
our customers’ breeding objectives. 
T o address this, our geneticists 
have derived custom economic 
indices for our dairy key accounts. 
These indices include production, 
reproduction, health and fitness traits, 
with weightings tailored to customers’ 
specific needs and incorporating the 
cost of feed, labour and milk pricing. 
Customers receive a monetary ranking 
for their females and potential bull 
mates, allowing better selection and 
management strategies. This leads to 
higher profitability for customers and 
strengthens their relationship with us.

Revenue
Revenue grew 8% (7% in actual 
currency) to £398.5m (2014: £372.2m), 
with Genus PIC growing at 15% helped 
by a full year of Génétiporc and a 
strong underlying performance. 
Genus ABS grew at 9%, while Asia 
declined 9% due to adverse market 
conditions in Russia. The rest of 
Asia, without Russia, grew 4%.
Adjusted Operating Profit Including 
Joint Ventures
Adjusted operating profit including 
JVs was £51.2m (2014: £44.8m), up 
18% in constant currency and 14% in 
actual currency. Genus’s share of JV 
profits was higher at £4.6m (2014: 
£1.9m), helped by continuing strong 
growth at Agroceres PIC in Brazil 
and an improved performance by 
Besun in China, following the high 
start-up costs during the prior year.
Genus PIC had a very strong year, 
with profits including JVs up 17%. 
Volume growth of 8% benefited 
from a full year of the Génétiporc 
acquisition, another strong year in 
Latin America and growth in royalty 
volumes in North America, following 
the PEDv outbreak in the prior year. 
Genus ABS grew volumes and 
revenues in all regions but operating 
profit was unchanged, with product 
costs across ABS impacted by the 
increased mix of sorted semen, 
higher royalty payments on 
certain leased genomic bulls and 
the depreciation of the Euro and 
Latin American currencies relative 
to the US Dollar, where most 
production costs are incurred. 
Profits in Genus Asia, including JVs, 
were unchanged. The Asia bovine 
business achieved high single digit 
growth, helped by China, where 
we continued to develop and 
strengthen our sales channels. The 
Asia porcine business achieved 
strong growth in PIC Philippines and 
costs were reduced in PIC China. 
However, these improvements were 
more than offset by declines in our 
Russia porcine business caused 
by adverse market conditions. 
R&D costs increased by 1%. Increases 
in key research investments, expansion 
of our beef and dairy nuclei and 
additional investments in product 
validation and genomic testing 
were largely offset by the benefit of 
strong by-product slaughter prices 
and early exit from the Génétiporc 
Quebec porcine nucleus.
Performance by Species
The table overleaf shows our global 
performance by species, after 
allocating product development 
costs specific to each species.
Dairy and beef revenues grew 9% 
on volumes up by 6%, with growth 
strongest in Brazil and our European 
Distribution business and an improved 
mix towards the higher priced sorted 
semen, particularly in North America 
and Asia. Sales of semen from our 
global studs, which represent 77% 
of semen sales by volume, increased 
by 8%. Profits were stable, primarily 
due to increased ABS product costs.
Porcine revenues grew by 9%, with 
royalty income up 15% to £77.1m. 
Volumes were up 6% (including 
Agroceres PIC, our JV in Brazil), mainly 
due to a strong product portfolio, a 
full year of the Génétiporc acquisition 
and strong performances across 
most regions. However, Russia and 
China volumes declined by double 
digits. Profits were up 22% on 2014, 
due to Latin America’s continued 
robust growth, the early completion 
of synergies from Génétiporc and 
a somewhat improved result in 
China as we reduced costs there.

Finance Costs
Net finance costs reduced by 
£0.9m to £4.6m (2014: £5.5m) and 
include IAS 19 pension interest of 
£2.3m (2014: £2.9m). Higher net 
borrowings following the acquisitions 
of Birchwood and IVB, and higher 
capital spending were offset by 
lower average interest rates, due 
to the renewal of US$60m of fixed 
interest rate cover at lower rates.
Exceptional Items
There was a £5.1m net exceptional 
expense in 2015 (2014: £2.0m 
expense), of which £1.4m was for 
acquisition and integration related 
expenses, primarily Birchwood and 
IVB, £2.8m was for ongoing legal 
fees in Genus ABS’s case against 
Sexing Technologies (see note 7), 
and £1.3m was for restructuring 
costs, with a £0.4m settlement gain 
related to the Milk Pension Fund. 
Statutory Profit Before Tax 
Operating profit on a statutory basis 
was £59.5m, (2014: £41.8m) while 
our statutory profit before tax was 
£57.8m (2014: £38.2m). The statutory 
results benefit from an increase of 
£24.9m (2014: £7.5m) in the net IAS 41 
valuation of biological assets driven 
largely by the strength of the porcine 
business. Amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets and exceptional items 
increased following the Génétiporc, 
Birchwood and IVB acquisitions. The 
Board believes the volatile nature 
of these items, most of which are 
non-cash, is less representative of 
the Group’s underlying performance 
than adjusted measures.
Taxation
The effective rate of tax for the year, 
based on adjusted profit before 
tax, was 26.0% (2014: 28.2%), with 
the decrease primarily due to the 
benefit of a full year of the UK 
finance company tax regime and 
favourable prior period adjustments. 
The effective rate remains higher 
than the UK corporate tax rate. 
This is due to the mix of overseas 
profits, particularly the proportion 
of profits generated in the US, 
where the statutory tax rate 
is approximately 39%, and the 
impact of withholding taxes on the 
repatriation of funds to the UK.
The tax rate on statutory profits was 
29.9% (2014: 24.3%). In addition to the 
factors mentioned above, there was an 
unfavourable impact in the year due 
to the majority of the IAS 41 biological 
assets valuation movement having 
deferred tax applied at US rates.
Earnings Per Share
Adjusted basic earnings per share, 
including the benefit of the lower 
tax rate, increased by 22% to 56.8 
pence (2014: 46.5 pence) and rose 
26% in constant currency. Basic 
earnings per share on a statutory 
basis were 66.7 pence (2014: 47.7 
pence), an increase of 40%.
Biological Assets 
A feature of the Group’s net assets is 
its substantial investment in biological 
assets, which IAS 41 requires us to 
state at fair value. At 30 June 2015, 
the carrying value of biological 
assets was £315.9m (2014: £275.5m), 
as set out in the table opposite. 
The movement in the overall 
carrying value of biological assets, 
excluding the effect of exchange 
rate translation changes, includes:
• a £20.4m increase in the carrying 
value of porcine biological assets, 
due principally to higher value 
animals, particularly boars, in the 
pure line herds as well as an 
increase in the number of animals 
sold on royalty contracts; and
• a £4.5m increase in dairy and beef 
biological assets, arising from an 
increase in the number of beef bulls 
as well as an increased sales 
demand for beef units. 
The historical cost of these assets, less 
depreciation, was £34.1m at 30 June 
2015 (2014: £36.2m), which is the 
basis used for the adjusted results. 
Retirement Benefit Obligations
The Group’s retirement benefit 
obligations at 30 June 2015, calculated 
in accordance with IAS 19, were 
£63.1m (2014: £58.2m) before tax 
and £49.9m (2014: £46.1m) net of 
related deferred tax. The largest 
element of the liability relates to the 
multi-employer Milk Pension Fund, 
where we continue to account on 
the basis of Genus being responsible 
for 75% of the plan’s funding.
During the year, contributions 
payable in respect of the Group’s 
defined benefit schemes amounted 
to £6.1m (2014: £5.6m).
Cash Flow
Cash generated by operations 
remained strong at £50.7m 
(2014: £44.3m). Conversion of 
adjusted operating profit into cash 
was 107% (2014: 103%) before 
capital expenditure, investments, 
interest, tax and dividends.

INFORMATION
This performance was generated by 
continued strong working capital 
management and the benefit of the 
exit from the Quebec nucleus.
The cash outflow from investments 
was £11.1m, primarily from the 
acquisitions of Birchwood and IVB. 
This compares with £34.1m from 
the Génétiporc acquisition and 
Besun JV investment in 2014. The 
increase in capital expenditure of 
£8.2m to £14.8m (2014: £6.6m) 
included increased investment in GSS 
technology. The total cash inflow 
for the year after these investments, 
interest, tax and dividends was 
£0.4m (2014: outflow £18.0m).
Net Debt
While cash flow was positive, net 
debt increased from £63.9m to 
£71.8m at 30 June 2015, due to the 
impact of exchange movements, as 
our borrowings are denominated 
primarily in US Dollars.
The Group’s financial position remains 
strong and there is substantial 
headroom of £51.1m under our 
borrowing facilities of £138.1m, 
which run to September 2017.
Our borrowing ratios are strong. 
Interest cover was 31.9 times (2014: 
20.6 times). The ratio of net debt 
to EBITDA, as calculated under our 
financing facilities, remained the 
same as the prior year at 1.2 times.
Return on Invested Capital
We measure our return on invested 
capital on the basis of adjusted 
operating profit including JVs after 
tax divided by the operating net 
assets of the business, stated on the 
basis of historical cost, excluding 
net debt and pension liability. 
This removes the impact of IAS 41 
fair value accounting, the related 
deferred tax and goodwill. The 
return on invested capital increased 
to 21.2% after tax (2014: 19.2%).

Dividend
Reflecting the Board’s continuing

the Group, it is recommending 
to shareholders a final dividend 
of 13.4 pence per ordinary share, 
resulting in a total dividend for the 
year of 19.5 pence per ordinary 
share, an increase of 10% for the year. 
Dividend cover remains strong, with 
the dividend covered 2.9 times by 
adjusted earnings (2014: 2.6 times).

PROGRESS  
THROUGH  
PEOPLE 
Genus’s progress is driven by the 
dedication, determination and 
passion of our employees. They are 
talented professionals, committed 
to pursuing Genus’s goals while 
developing their careers.
During the year, we continued to 
focus on performance management, 
talent and succession planning, while 
delivering leadership development 
and employee engagement 
initiatives. This creates a firm 
foundation for further success.
Performance Management
Enabling our people to understand 
how they are doing is vital for 
their personal development 
and our business performance. 
All our staff had performance 
reviews at the half and full year.
We continued to improve the  
quality of objective setting and 
development planning. This  
included refresher training for 
our managers and supporting 
our people’s development plans 
with mentoring and coaching.
Talent and Succession Planning
We completed our third annual 
cycle of talent management, 
covering all our people managers 
and those with potential. All have 
clear development plans. 
The benefits of our talent development 
were shown by the promotion of two 
scientists to lead the GSS project, 
and development of talented Latin 
American PIC key account leads 
into new roles in Mexico, the US and 
Spain. We also recruited high-calibre 
professionals, including Dr Dan 
Tucker (Global Adviser on PIC Health 
Assurance), Dr Uislei Orlando (PIC 
Global Director of Nutrition), Mark Birri 
(Strategy and Business Development 
Director) and Adam Schilffarth (Senior 
Engineering Director for Genus ABS).
Training and Developing Our People
We continue to invest in developing 
our people. One initiative included 
extending High Performing Teams, 
our successful management 
development programme, with two 
programmes in North America and 
three in Latin America. To complement 
our investment in employee 
communication, we trained 242 
managers in communications skills. 
This helps them to inspire, challenge 
and support their teams. We also ran 
core training in health and safety, anti-
bribery and corruption, and safe animal 
handling, and added seven modules 
to PIC’s Sales Academy, including 
PIC Product Differentiation, Farm 
Economics and Optimum Boar Life. 
Using Our Diversity
We continued to add experience and to 
transfer knowledge around the Group, 
through international appointments 
and recruitment. For example, in PIC, 
Jürgen Kramer and Wilson Pineda 
moved from their roles in the US 
and Mexico to become Regional 
Director and Commercial Manager 
respectively for PIC Europe based 
in Spain. We also recruited two PhD 
geneticists into our PIC China team.
In ABS, Jesus Martinez, Global 
Director of Business Development, 
supported our Asia ABS business, 
particularly China. Pierpaolo Dordoni 
(General Manager of ABS Italia) 
supported our ABS Russia business 
and Arun Baral joined us to head 
up our Genus ABS Asia business.

INFORMATION
Genus takes diversity seriously. We 
appoint the best people to do the job, 
with a focus on talent right across 
the leadership team. During the year, 
we recruited more senior women, 
including a senior IP counsel and 
a Global ABS Marketing Director. 
The table below shows our gender 
diversity across the business.
Engaging Our People 
Employee feedback showed they 
wanted more information about the 
business, so we invested in internal 
communications in 2014/15. This 
included a quarterly staff update, 
manager briefing packs to support 
local communication, quarterly calls 
with GELT for senior managers, and 
‘Ask The Expert’ webinars for all staff, 
to share knowledge and experience. 
We ran a short staff survey in 
November 2014, covering 35% of 
our people. This showed a double-
digit increase (to 81%) in employees 
feeling they are regularly told 
about business performance and 
plans, while the proportion of 
employees who understand our 
strategy rose from 80% to 87%. 
See page 45 for full results. 
Human Rights
We are committed to protecting 
the human rights of our employees 
and the people who come into 
contact with our business. During 
the year, we continued to comply 
with our human rights policy.
Our Plans for FY16
In the coming year we will continue 
our leadership education, running our 
Advanced Leadership Programme 
and three High Performing Teams 
programmes, including our first 
in Asia. We are planning a further 
seven modules for the PIC Sales 
Academy and will develop an ABS 
Sales Academy, to provide training 
in areas such as sales and genetics.
We will enhance our recruitment 
processes, introducing a new 
website and online recruitment, and 
continue to run our intern programme 
in Europe, the US and China.
Engagement remains high on the 
agenda: a Global Leaders Conference 
was held in July 2015, a full staff survey 
is due to be carried out in November 
2015, and an update for all our staff 
three years on from introducing 
our strategy will take place. We 
will also upgrade our intranet, to 
further improve communication.

ADVANCED LEADERSHIP 
PROGRAMME
Our Advanced Leadership Programme is our first-ever 
programme for senior leaders. It explores how Genus can 
work profitably with customers, accelerate our strategy, 
enhance employee engagement and maintain a culture of 
innovation. We ran three programmes during the year, in 
Nashville, Barcelona and Shanghai, with 56 attendees.

RESPONSIBL Y
“ Corporate social responsibility is not optional for 
Genus. It is integral to the way we run the business 
and to every part of our strategy.”
Catherine Glickman
Chair of CSR Committee and Group HR Director
‘Pioneering animal genetic improvement to help nourish 
the world’ – words we chose carefully to describe our 
contribution to society. We believe that our genetics 
support countries’ health, by helping to increase sustainable 
animal protein production, for people to eat as part of a 
nutritious diet. 
Leading the CSR Agenda
Our CSR Committee established our vision for CSR,  
which is to ensure that Genus continues to act in a socially 
responsible, ethical and compliant manner, adopting the 
highest levels of ethical oversight for the benefit of all  
our stakeholders. The Committee defines our Group-wide 
CSR strategy, reviews our policies and practices, monitors 
external developments, and advises GELT and the Board 
about CSR matters. It recommends annual goals and 
initiatives, and identifies the key performance indicators  
for monitoring and reporting our performance. 
The Committee meets four times a year and reports to 
GELT in May and the Board in June. Its members include 
our in-house experts on animal welfare, employees, 
environment and safety, who were already leading 
programmes within the business.
This year, the Committee has ensured the Group has 
maintained its focus on achieving its CSR objectives and 
continued to raise the profile of CSR within the business. 
Each Committee member has personally led an initiative 
within the CSR strategy. We have also agreed to increase 
the areas of activity covered by our CSR strategy, by 
focusing on our work to extend access to high-quality 
genetics under a new area – Food Quality and Abundance. 
This involves working with our customers to contribute to 
producing more abundant, sustainable and affordable 
protein. More details can be found on pages 44 to 47.
We are passionate about protecting the 
welfare of our animals and operate a 
policy of zero tolerance of animal 
mistreatment. We have an Animal 
Welfare Committee, reporting to the 
CSR Committee, chaired by Dr Bill 
Christianson, Chief Operating Officer of 
Genus PIC. The Committee oversees our 
animal welfare policies, practices and 
training. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

Annual emissions figures have been calculated based on actual ten-month data for July to April extrapolated to

Greenhouse Gas (‘GHG’) Reporting
Our GHG emissions are primarily methane produced by our 
animals and carbon dioxide (‘CO
2
’) from consuming fuel and 
other materials, and transport. Our primary intensity ratio is 
based on animal weight, which is a key driver of our GHG 
emissions. Our secondary intensity ratio is based on turnover. 
  
Total emissions and animal weight reduced by 13,800 
tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent (‘CO
2
e’) and 1,300 tonnes 
respectively, driven by a 34,000 reduction in pig numbers, 
mainly due to exiting the Génétiporc Quebec porcine 
nucleus. Our primary and secondary ratios have decreased, 
with the decrease in the secondary ratio due to growth in 
porcine royalty. This has no corresponding impact on 
emissions, as we do not own animals sold on a royalty basis.
Our reporting approach
We use operational control as our reporting approach. 
We have determined and reported the emissions we 
are responsible for within this boundary and believe 
there are no material omissions. GHG data is therefore 
reported for assets, which are mainly rented or leased, 
that are otherwise not referred to elsewhere in the 
financial statements. We omitted JVs and some livestock 
held at third-parties due to our limited authority to 
introduce and implement operating policies.
performance are set out on pages 44 to 47. CSR is integral 
to each of the four elements of our business strategy. 
Achieving our CSR objectives therefore underpins the way in 
which we implement our strategy.

What we do Why are we doing it What we said we would do What we did What we plan to do next Case Study 
Operate Safely
   
We have a duty to keep our 
employees and animals safe. This 
means ensuring we maintain our 
estate, and integrate health and 
safety into our daily operations, 
led by senior management.
• Audit every Genus-owned property 
and complete any corrective action 
within six months.
• Ensure at least 90% of staff 
complete at least one health and 
safety training session.
• Reduce the number of reportable 
incidents on Genus-owned property 
by 20%.
• Ensure every manager meets their 
teams once during the year, to 
discuss how to improve safety.
• Audited our estate of 109 sites 
and completed 97% of actions 
within the six-month deadline 
with the balance due to be 
completed by September 2015.
• 97% of staff completed at least 
one training session on safety.
• Reduced the number of 
reportable incidents on Genus 
property by 29%.
• 91% of managers led a discussion 
with their staff during the year.
• Ensure at least 90% of staff 
complete health and safety training 
tailored to their role.
• Comprehensive reporting in  
every business and region,  
reviewed quarterly by the  
Chief Operating Officers.
• Maintain the reduction in incidents 
on owned premises and develop 
ways to reduce animal-related 
incidents on non-owned premises.
• Identify opportunities for 
improvement, through monthly 
incident reviews by management. Liquid nitrogen (‘LN 2 ’) plays a key part in storing 
bull semen. However, LN 2 boils at -196°C, so even 
fleeting contact can permanently damage skin 
and soft tissues. In addition, one litre of LN 2 can 
create 700 litres of gas, posing an asphyxiation 
risk. We have introduced measures to control the 
risks. For example, in the UK we have worked with 
our transport supplier to modify its vans, keeping 
LN 2 storage separate from the driver’s 
compartment.
Employees 
   
We work to attract, retain and 
motivate highly qualified and 
committed staff. We explain what 
we want them to deliver and 
regularly train them. We listen to 
their feedback and act on it.
• Listen to what staff think, through a 
short global survey.
• Ensure that every member of staff 
has clear objectives, a career 
discussion and a personal 
development plan.
• Continue to develop our staff, 
delivering operational, 
management, leadership, 
communication skills and anti-
bribery training.
• Continue to provide interesting and 
secure work within local 
communities.
• Carried out a global staff survey 
in November 2014. Four 
measures improved and two 
stayed flat.
• All staff had objectives, a 
mid-year and full year review.
• 56 managers attended the 
Advanced Leadership 
Programme: 101 attended ‘High 
Performing Teams’; 245 attended 
communication skills training, 
and 407 modules have been 
completed through the PIC Sales 
Academy. (See People section on 
pages 40 and 41.)
• Maintained stable work for staff 
during the year, including 
redeployment where business 
operations changed.
• Conduct the second all-staff survey, 
maintaining or improving results, 
with a focus on safety at work and 
acting on feedback received.
• Continue the investment in 
development and training: this will 
include 95%+ of staff completing 
Anti-bribery and Corruption training 
and knowing how to report non-
compliance.
• Continue to provide opportunities 
for those developing a career in 
agriculture through our internship 
programme.

(‘PQA+’) and standards set by National Pork 
Board in the US as templates for our global annual 
swine care training programme. In 2014/15, we 
delivered 24 PQA sessions globally, ensuring all 
our staff are trained to a consistent standard. We 
train and certify new staff as they work with us, 
with existing staff completing refresher sessions 
during the year.

Send a Cow helps poor dairy farmers in Africa by 
sharing knowledge and providing practical 
farming advice and emotional support. Every 
farmer helped pledges to ‘pass on’ the gift, by 
donating one of the cow’s offspring to another 
family. Research shows that for every person they 
help, ten more go on to benefit. Staff in our ABS 
EMEA region have supported the charity by 
sharing their skills, fund raising and matching 
customer donations. To date we have raised 
equivalent funds to send 41 cows to Africa.

• Continue annual independent audits 
of Genus PIC’s waste management 
systems, covering at least 80% of 
our owned animals.
• Produce more home-grown feed for 
Genus ABS’s bulls, to reduce 
reliance on purchased feed, reduce 
emissions from transporting feed 
and improve biosecurity.
• Explore opportunities to recycle the 
manure produced by Genus ABS’s 
bulls, both on crop land producing 
our feed and by converting it to 
heat or electricity, for example by 
using a furnace-type recycler.
• Audited 83% of animals in our 
owned sites.
• Installed an irrigation pivot 
system on a 160-acre square field 
at Dekorra, enabling us to ‘double 
crop’ in 2014, with hay and late 
season corn.
• Recycled manure in exchange for 
straw at Whenby, UK – see case 
study.
• Continue Genus PIC’s external 
audits, to cover at least 80% of 
animals on owned sites. 
• Improve food conversion efficiency 
by 0.02kg of feed per kg of pork 
produced averaged over a rolling 
3 year period: this genetic trend will 
be measured across the PIC pure 
populations.
• Upgrade the Genus ABS production 
estate, working with the Future 
Farmers of America and a local 
school to landscape our Dekorra 
site with over 300 trees, and 
reducing light impact on our 
neighbours.
We house 300 bulls at Whenby Lodge in the UK. 
Since 2011, we have developed a unique 
agreement with neighbouring arable farmers 
David and Tom Unsworth. In 2014/15, we 
exchanged 3,000 tonnes of manure for nearly 
1,600 tonnes of high-quality straw for feed and 
bedding – keeping our bulls happy and protecting 
us from volatility in straw prices.

Dear Shareholder
Strong corporate governance is critical for the Group’s long-term success. The way 
the Board carries out its responsibilities – from approving strategy to overseeing risk 
management – has a profound effect on the Group’s future and the interests of our 
stakeholders. The quality of our corporate governance ultimately determines our ability 
to serve our customers, create rewarding jobs for employees, support our suppliers and 
communities, and deliver growth and returns to shareholders.
We therefore regularly evaluate our corporate governance and the Board’s performance, 
to ensure it provides the direction Genus needs to succeed. We also remain supportive of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and its principles-based approach. Genus complied 
with all the provisions of its 2012 edition, which was the applicable standard for this 
financial year.
A Strengthened Board
There were two changes to the Board this year. Lykele van der Broek joined us as a 
Non-Executive Director on 1 July 2014, bringing with him significant international 
experience of agricultural markets. Professor Barry Furr retired at the Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’) in November 2014. We were greatly saddened by Barry’s death in early 
2015 and are grateful for his immense contribution to the Company during his eight years 
on the Board.
Professor Duncan Maskell has taken on Barry’s role as adviser to our R&D Portfolio 
Management Team, having joined us in April 2014. Both Duncan and Lykele have actively 
engaged with the Company through their inductions, and provided fresh insight and 
new perspectives to the Board’s discussions. Combined with the deep knowledge and 
experience of our longer-serving Non-Executive Directors, this gives us a Board that has 
a well-balanced array of skills and is well-attuned to the Group’s requirements.
Evaluating the Board’s Effectiveness
This was the third year of our Board evaluation cycle. We therefore carried out an internal 
evaluation, using questionnaires, followed by telephone conversations between me and 
individual Directors and by Board discussions, to drill down into particular issues that 
arose in the questionnaires and individual discussions.
The evaluation confirmed that the Board continues to function effectively, with an open 
and candid culture, and positive engagement from Board members with wide-ranging 
but complementary skills. More information on the evaluation can be found on page 57.
We take diversity seriously and the Board continues to bear in mind Lord Davies’ 
recommendations about gender diversity. Our policy is to recruit the right people based 
on merit, so that the Board has the diversity of skills and experience it needs. In this 
regard, our recruitment of Duncan and Lykele in the last 18 months has expanded the 
Board’s diversity by increasing our scientific and international experience.
Summary
The Board is committed to further enhancing Genus’s corporate governance. This will 
facilitate our ability to drive genetic improvement faster and more effectively, and to 
capture the value we deliver to customers, so we can in turn create value for shareholders.

Adding Value Through Strong 
Governance
Our business success depends on 
having strong corporate governance. 
The Board’s decisions are critical to 
the Group’s future, from approving 
and monitoring our strategy to 
the way we identify, monitor and 
manage risks. We therefore look to 
ensure that the Board has the right 
mix of skills and experience, that it 
has a deep understanding of the 
Group and that its members work 
well together, in a spirit of openness 
and constructive challenge.
This section explains our corporate 
governance approach, including 
how we structure the Board and 
its Committees, its oversight of the 
Group, and its performance and main 
activities during the financial year.
Who is on the Board?
At the date of this report, the Board 
had a large majority of independent 
Non-Executive Directors.

As noted in our 2014 Annual Report, 
Lykele van der Broek joined the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director 
on 1 July 2014 and Professor Barry 
Furr retired as a Non-Executive 
Director at the conclusion of the 
AGM on 14 November 2014, after 
eight years on the Board. There 
were no other changes to Board 
membership during the financial year.
The chart below shows the length of 
time our Non-Executive Directors, 
including the Chairman, have 
been members of our Board. This 
demonstrates that the Board continues 
to have a good mix of well-established 
and newer Non-Executive Directors.

The blend of our Non-Executive 
Directors’ general experience and 
areas of expertise, together with 
their depth of knowledge about the 
Group’s operations, result in an even-
handed oversight of the business 
and its growth strategy. This balance 
allows the Board to operate in a 
constructive and focused manner.
As required by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all the Directors 
will offer themselves for election 
at the next AGM, details of which 
can be found in the Notice of 
AGM at the end of this report. 
Following the performance evaluation 
described on page 57, the Board 
confirms that all the Directors continue 
to be effective and to demonstrate 
their commitment to their roles.
Board Roles and Responsibilities
To ensure we have clear responsibilities 
at the top of the Company, the Board 
has set out well-defined roles for 
the Chairman and Chief Executive. 
These, along with the responsibilities 
of our Senior Independent Director, 
are summarised in the table below.
Some issues and decisions are so 
important that only the Board as 
a whole can consider them. The 
Board is therefore responsible for:
• approving and monitoring our 
strategy;
• approving our corporate goals;
• reviewing our operational 
performance against these goals;
• approving the corporate budget 
and ensuring we have the right 
funding;
• approving material contracts;
• approving material acquisitions and 
investments; and
• reporting to shareholders.
Title Individual(s) Responsibilities
Chairman Bob Lawson As Chairman, Bob’s primary responsibility 
is to lead the Board and ensure its effective 
operation. This is achieved in part through 
promoting an open culture, with the courage 
to challenge the status quo. Bob is also 
responsible for communications between 
the Board and shareholders.
Chief Executive Karim Bitar Karim is responsible for managing the 
Company’s day-to-day operations and is 
accountable to the Board for the Company’s 
development, consistent with its strategy 
and with due regard for the risks, objectives 
and policies set out by the Board and its 
Committees.
Senior Independent 
Director
Nigel Turner Nigel is responsible for providing a sounding 
board for the Chairman and acting as an 
alternative line of communication between 
the Chairman and other Directors. He leads 
meetings of the Non-Executive Directors in 
the Chairman’s absence and consults with 
shareholders in the absence of the Chairman 
and CEO.

R&D Portfolio Management Team
The R&D Portfolio Management 
Team (‘R&D PMT’) meets twice a 
year. The R&D PMT provides a forum 
for prioritising our R&D initiatives, 
monitoring their progress and 
assessing the quality of our R&D 
infrastructure, personnel and pipeline.
During 2015, Professor Duncan Maskell 
joined the R&D PMT as a regular 
member and Board representative. 
Professor Maskell brings to the 
team his years of experience as an 
innovation leader in animal agriculture. 
The R&D PMT’s other members 
include Dr Jonathan Lightner, Chief 
Scientific Officer, key R&D personnel 
and other key GELT members. 
The R&D PMT’s meetings during 
the year were held in Chicago and 
Edinburgh. As part of the Edinburgh 
meeting, the team joined our 
collaborators at the Roslin Institute 
for an update on the progress of 
our key collaboration projects. 
The R&D PMT’s principal 
responsibilities are to periodically:
• review and prioritise the Company’s 
investment in research, 
development and technology; 
• assess the quality and 
competitiveness of the Company’s 
R&D pipeline, including considering 
their risk profiles;
• oversee and encourage the ideation 
management process; and
• approve patent and other IP 
strategies for new technologies, 
based on business and technical 
opportunities.
R&D PMT Special Focus Areas in 2015
In addition to the standing agenda 
items, in 2015 the R&D PMT 
reviewed two strategic proposals:
• a comprehensive revision of our 
overarching IP strategy and 
approach, before its presentation to 
the Board; and
• a proposal for managing R&D 
project progression through stage 
gates, into advanced development.
Board Skills and Experience
Genus operates in a complex and 
evolving global business environment. 
To lead us effectively, the Board must 
have the skills and experience to 
manage the associated challenges.
Almost all our Directors have held 
leadership positions in international 
companies, with several having 
run businesses overseas. Nearly 
half our Directors have strong 
backgrounds in scientific research 
or in leading science-based 
businesses, while the same number 
has significant financial experience.

Non-Executive Inductions
During the year, Duncan Maskell and Lykele van der Broek underwent 
comprehensive inductions. These included:
• A visit to our US business in January 2015. This covered a tour of our 
facilities in DeForest and Dekorra; a series of presentations from our Genus 
ABS and Genus PIC teams, led by their Chief Operating Officers; 
presentations on our approach to R&D, and a tour of our facilities; and visits 
to a number of PIC and ABS customers.
• Workshops run by Spencer Stuart, covering Board behaviour, Board 
strategy, and Board and Committee meetings.
• Ad hoc updates on the latest developments in corporate governance and 
updates to the Corporate Governance Code. These were provided by 
internal and external presenters.
In addition, both Non-Executive Directors attended the Board visit to Brazil 
in May 2015.
We also want to ensure that the Board as a whole has first-hand experience of 
key areas of our business and markets, so we include an annual site visit in the 
Board calendar. In 2015, the Board visited operations in Brazil (see opposite).

Board Diversity
As Genus grows, the Board must 
evolve to keep pace. While we 
consider diversity in its broadest 
sense when recruiting, our aim 
is to ensure that the Board has 
the right skills to manage the 
evolving nature of the business.
Board Induction and Training
A good induction is a key part of 
ensuring new Board members can fully 
contribute, so we get the most benefit 
from their experience. Our induction 
programme has three main elements:
• helping our Board members to 
conduct themselves effectively, 
through a course run by Spencer 
Stuart, one of the world’s leading 
global executive search and 
leadership consulting firms;
• ensuring our Directors understand 
the legal and regulatory aspects of 
being a Board member, and how to 
maintain their independence; and
• an introduction to our business, 
through site visits and meetings 
with our management teams. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

Board Visit to Brazil
In May 2015, the Board spent a week visiting our operations in Brazil. This 
included meeting the senior management of our local Genus businesses, 
visiting IVB’s laboratories and meeting its leadership team, and meeting the 
management of Agroceres PIC, our 49% JV in Brazil. In addition, the Board 
met a number of Brazilian bovine and porcine customers.
The visit was designed to enhance the Board’s understanding of our local 
business, its operations on the ground, the markets and our key relationships, 
as well as Brazil’s contribution to global protein production. The meetings with 
several of our largest customers in the region gave the Board insight into 
customer perspectives of Genus and the drivers of their purchasing decisions. 
The visit was also motivating for our local management, enabling them to 
engage with the Board at a local level.
Board Strategy Review
One of the Board’s key responsibilities 
is to review, approve and monitor 
our strategy. To understand how 
well our strategy is working and to 
ensure it remains appropriate, the 
Board holds an annual strategy review 
each January. Relevant members 
of GELT present to the Board on 
their business unit or function.
At this year’s review, the Board was 
taken through:
• a review of global industry trends 
and Genus’s markets;
• an update on each business unit’s 
progress against the four elements 
of the strategy we first set out in 
2012; and
• an update on each business unit’s 
plans over the next two to five 
years.
Board Effectiveness Review
Effective leadership is integral to the 
execution of the Company’s strategy 
and therefore to the fulfilment 
of its objectives. The Board is 
committed to ensuring the Company 
operates in accordance with the 
highest standards of governance, 
in order to promote its success for 
the benefit of all stakeholders.
We assess the Board’s effectiveness 
over a three-year cycle, using a mixture 
of internal and external evaluations.
Year 1
External Board effectiveness review 
produces an action plan for areas of 
focus
Year 2
Follow-up questionnaires by same 
external evaluation consultant, to 
monitor progress with the focus 
areas
Year 3
Internal questionnaires and 
interviews with the Chairman
This was the third year of our review 
cycle. The evaluation process 
therefore consisted of anonymous 
questionnaires, follow-up telephone 
conversations between the Chairman 
and Board members, and an open 
discussion of the evaluation results 
prepared at the end of this process.
All Non-Executive Directors completed 
the performance and effectiveness 
questionnaire, and responses were 
combined on an anonymous basis, 
then shared with the Board. In 
addition, the Chairman interviewed all 
of the Directors to discuss individual 
training needs and overall Board 
effectiveness. The aggregated 
responses from the anonymous 
questionnaires and individual Director 
feedback allowed the Chairman to 
lead the performance evaluation and 
effectiveness review at the Board.
The performance of the Chairman 
was evaluated by the Senior 
Independent Director, through 
discussions with the other Non-
Executive Directors. The evaluation 
allowed the Senior Independent 
Director to discuss with the Chairman 
his performance during the year.
The Review’s Conclusions
The review concluded that the Board 
has:
• an open and candid culture, that 
encouraged challenge of the status 
quo; 
• high integrity individuals, with 
complementary skills; and
• highly engaged individuals, who 
were committed to excellence.
The review also identified the 
following as areas of focus for 2016:
• continued oversight of competitor 
activity;
• further training in corporate 
governance;
• further exposure to the science that 
underpins our R&D programmes; 
and
• further focus on succession 
planning and gender diversity.
Research and Development
• Received regular updates on R&D 
developments, new initiatives and 
potential collaborations.
Company Performance
• Received updates on the 
operational performance of the 
business and market conditions for 
each division. 
• Carefully monitored the Group’s 
performance against its goals.
Employees
• Reviewed and monitored the 
Company’s health and safety 
performance (monthly written 
updates and quarterly review).
• Received updates on the global 
staff survey results and follow 
up actions.
• Received updates on succession 
planning at GELT level and below.
• Received updates on key 
personnel appointments, 
assignments and developments 
across the Group. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

Risk Management and Internal 
Control
The Board is responsible for our risk 
management system and for reviewing 
our controls and risk mitigations. 
The risk management system is 
designed to identify, evaluate and 
prioritise the risks and uncertainties 
we face, and applies to the Board, 
the Audit Committee, GELT, our 
businesses and our divisional 
business reviews. Our principal risks 
and our mitigations for them are 
summarised on pages 18 and 19.
The Board continued its programme 
of visits to our local operations and 
received regular political, economic 
and industry risk updates from the 
relevant business groups. The Board 
also sought regular updates on a 
number of specific risks during the 
year, including the Group’s work on its:
• emerging market strategy, in 
particular, progress in China and 
Russia; 
• Genus Sexed Semen (‘GSS’) project, 
particularly in light of the litigation 
the Group initiated, as detailed in 
note 7; and
• acquisition and integration of 
companies.
Internal Control
The Board, with the help of the 
Audit Committee, has reviewed the 
effectiveness of our internal control 
system, as well as our financial, 
operational and compliance controls 
and our risk management.
Corporate Governance Statement
continued
The review covered our internal 
audit programme and the reports 
our management prepared when 
the Board approved our interim 
and final reports, and financial 
statements. It also assessed:
• whether we had identified, 
evaluated, managed and controlled 
significant risks; and
• whether any significant weaknesses 
had arisen, and if so, whether we 
had addressed them.
The assessment also took into 
account any risk or control issues 
we identified through our divisional 
business reviews, Board and GELT 
meetings, and insurers’ reviews.
These assessments routinely identify 
areas for improvement. However, 
the Board has not identified or been 
told of any material weaknesses 
in our internal controls.
Progress Against 2014/15 Areas of Focus
Last year’s Board effectiveness review identified a number of areas for the Board to consider this year. The table below 
shows our progress against these objectives.
Focus area Progress
Sharper focus on technology across the Board, both in R&D and 
the use of technology in commercial sales.
• Coverage of the R&D portfolio was included in the Board’s 
January strategy session and Duncan Maskell joined the R&D 
PMT (see page 55).
Continued focus on competitors. • The Board was updated on competitor profiles during the 
January strategy session.
• Competitors’ ongoing activities are monitored through our 
business development team and relevant activities are 
periodically reported to the Board.
Consideration of how risk is disclosed and considered through 
the Audit Committee and through the Board.
• Internal audit regularly updates the Audit Committee on the 
Group’s material risks.
• Private sessions between the Audit Committee, internal audit 
and the external auditor have been initiated.
• The roll-out of whistleblowing policy refresher training and 
the establishment of a whistleblowing hotline, to ensure there 
is an anonymous line of communication for the indentification 
of Group risks. 
Consideration of communications with shareholders and other 
external stakeholders.
• In May, GELT conducted an Investor Day in London outlining 
the Company’s strategy and direction as described further on 
page 59.
• Regular meetings were organised between the CEO, CFO 
and institutional investors/private client brokers, to discuss 
the Company’s strategy and progress.
• An extensive shareholder consultation process was 
undertaken by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
and the Chairman of the Board, in connection with approving 
the 2014 share schemes and our remuneration policy. 
• The Company’s AGM was held in November 2014, to outline 
the Group’s performance. 
Consideration of other skill sets required by the Board, such as 
diversity, agri-business and international markets.
• Duncan Maskell and Lykele van de Broek joined the Board in 
summer 2014, bringing considerable scientific, agri-business 
and international markets expertise to the Board. 
• Business induction plans were performed for the new 
Directors, as described on page 56.  Genus plc Annual Report 2015

Risk Management Framework
The roles and responsibilities within 
our risk management framework are 
set out below:
The Board
• Has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems.
• Approves strategic objectives.
• Monitors the nature and extent of 
risk exposure against risk appetite, 
for our principal risks.
• Provides direction on the 
importance of risk management 
and risk management culture.
GELT
• Identifies, addresses and mitigates 
risks Group-wide.
• Monitors our risk management 
process and internal controls.
Audit Committee
• Supports the Board in monitoring 
risk exposure against risk appetite.
• Reviews the effectiveness of our risk 
management and internal control 
system.
Risk Management and Internal Audit 
Function
• Oversees the risk management 
process and provides guidance on 
risk management.
• Maintains the risk schedule created 
in consultation with senior 
management.
• Engages with senior management 
to review risks and their mitigation.
Our Internal Control System
The key elements of our internal 
control systems are set out below. 
An internal control system cannot 
completely eliminate the risks we 
face or ensure we do not have a 
material misstatement or loss.
Management Structure
The Board sets formal authorisation 
levels and other controls that allow 
it to delegate authority to run our 
businesses to the Chief Executive, 
GELT and their management teams. 
Our management supplements these 
controls by setting the operating 
standards that each subsidiary 
needs for its business and location.
GELT regularly reviews our 
performance against strategy, budget 
and a defined set of operational 
key performance indicators. The 
Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director, Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary and the Group 
Financial Controller also hold monthly 
reviews with each business unit.
Quality and Integrity of Our People
We strive to operate with high 
integrity in everything we do. Our 
control environment depends on 
high-quality people who maintain 
our ethical standards. We ensure 
our people’s ability and integrity 
through our recruitment standards, 
training and consistent performance 
management. The Board approves 
appointments to our most senior 
management positions.
Information and Financial Reporting 
Systems
We create detailed operational 
budgets for the year ahead, along 
with five-year strategic plans, which 
the Board reviews and approves. 
We then monitor our performance 
throughout the year, so we can 
address any issues. The information 
we consider includes our monthly 
financial results, key performance 
indicators and variances, updated full-
year forecasts and key business risks. 
The main internal control and risk 
management processes relating to our 
preparation of consolidated accounts 
are our Group-wide accounting 
policies and procedures, segregation 
of duties, a robust consolidation and 
reporting system, various levels of 
management review and centrally 
defined process control points 
and reconciliation processes.
Investment Appraisal
We control our capital expenditure 
through our budget process and 
by having clear authorisation levels, 
above which our businesses must 
submit detailed written proposals 
to the Board for approval.
We carry out due diligence for 
business acquisitions and material 
licences, and conduct post-
completion reviews of major projects, 
to ensure we identify areas for 
improvement and correct any areas 
of underperformance or overspend.
Internal Audit
Our internal audit activities are 
provided by both in-house and 
external resources, under the 
leadership of our Head of Risk 
Management and Internal Audit. 
During the year, Internal Audit 
completed a risk-based audit 
programme agreed by the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee 
reviews the results of these audits 
and the subsequent actions we 
take, which we also communicate 
to the external auditor.
The regions and businesses complete 
risk and control self-assessments 
twice a year. Internal Audit reviews 
these to identify any deficiencies 
in our controls and how we should 
address them. The results are 
communicated to senior management 
and the Audit Committee.
Understanding Shareholder Views
Our Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director regularly meet 
institutional investors and private 
client brokers, to discuss our strategy 
and progress, and to understand 
how investors view our business. 
The Chairman also attends certain 
meetings. During the year, our 
investor relations programme 
included meetings in London, 
Edinburgh, Paris and New York.
In May 2015, we also held a Capital 
Markets Day in London, which was 
attended by almost 100 institutional 
investors and analysts. The investor 
presentations were given by our 
Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director, Chief Scientific Officer 
and the Chief Operating Officers of 
Genus ABS, Genus PIC and Genus 
Asia. The presentations covered:
• an introduction to Genus and our 
strategic direction;
• an update on the Company’s 
strategic progress since the last 
Investor Day; 
• our R&D approach to continuous 
genetic improvement;
• our porcine, dairy and beef 
businesses, including Asia; and
• our financial performance.
The Board sets time aside during 
the Board meetings to discuss 
feedback from the Capital Markets 
Day and other shareholder meetings, 
including relevant feedback obtained 
by independent brokers and our 
advisers. This allows all Directors to 
understand major shareholders’ views.
The AGM also gives the Board 
an opportunity to communicate 
with both private and institutional 
investors, and we welcome their 
involvement. All our Board members 
will be available to answer questions 
at the AGM on 19 November 2015. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

Dear Shareholder
The Audit Committee (‘Committee’) acts on behalf of the Board and shareholders, to 
ensure the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting, evaluate its system of risk 
management and internal control, and oversee the performance of the internal and 
external auditors. We design our annual work programme to deliver these commitments.
The membership of the Committee changed during the year, with the retirement of 
Professor Barry Furr and the appointment of Professor Duncan Maskell and Lykele van 
der Broek. I am happy to report that the Committee membership not only continues to 
comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code and related guidance, with all members 
being Non-Executive Directors, but also to maintain a sound range of financial, 
commercial and scientific expertise required to fulfil its role effectively. More details on 
this, and the appointment and induction process for new members, is in the corporate 
governance section of this Annual Report.
During the year, I chaired five Committee meetings and invited the Company’s Chairman, 
Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller, the Head of 
Risk Management and Internal Audit, and senior representatives of the external auditor to 
attend these meetings. The Committee members and I also held separate private sessions 
during the year with the Head of Risk Management and Internal Audit and the external 
audit partner.
The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the half-year and annual financial 
statements. Among other matters, we focused on critical accounting policies, key 
assumptions and judgements, the quality of disclosures, compliance with financial 
reporting standards and all material issues affecting the financial statements. I am 
comfortable that the Committee fully discussed all critical policies and key assumptions 
and judgements. In addition, the Committee reviewed the Group’s tax and treasury 
strategy and its pension arrangements. The Committee reviewed the Annual Report and 
Accounts taken as a whole, to ensure they are fair, balanced and understandable, and 
provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s strategy, 
business model and performance.
In meeting its commitment to oversee the performance of our internal and external 
auditor, the Committee reviewed and agreed internal audit’s terms of reference and 
work plans, as well as the scope, fees and work undertaken by the external auditor. 
The Committee received the results of the management feedback on the external 
audit process and reviewed the effectiveness of internal and external audit, discussed 
the outcomes of these assessments and agreed any actions that were needed. The 
Committee was satisfied with the performance of the internal audit function and 
the external auditor during the year.
As I reported last year, in keeping with best practice we decided to tender the external 
audit for fiscal year 2016, as it has been ten years since the last tender. The Committee 
was actively involved in the tender process and provided oversight and directions as 
the work progressed. I chaired a special meeting of the Committee to consider the 
proposals presented by the two shortlisted audit firms. After careful consideration, 
the Committee recommended the award of external audit services to Deloitte LLP,  
with a new lead audit partner.

Committee Composition and 
Governance
The Committee’s members are 
Non-Executive Directors with a 
wide range of financial, commercial 
and scientific research expertise, 
appropriate for fulfilling the 
Committee’s duties. In FY15, the 
Committee met the UK Corporate 
Governance Code’s requirement 
that at least one Committee 
member should have recent and 
relevant financial experience.
The Committee has formal terms of 
reference, approved by the Board, 
that comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. These are available 
from our website: www.genusplc.com. 
Our annual review of these terms took 
place during the year. The Committee 
also assessed its own effectiveness, 
through a structured questionnaire, 
and concluded that it was effective.
Committee Role and Responsibilities
The Committee’s role and 
responsibilities include reviewing 
and monitoring: the financial 
reporting process; the integrity of 
the Group’s financial statements; 
the Company’s reporting to 
shareholders; the effectiveness of 
the Group’s accounting systems 
and control environment, including 
risk management and the internal 
audit function; and the effectiveness 
and independence of the Group’s 
external auditor, including any 
non-audit services it provides to 
the Group. The Committee also 
ensures that the Company maintains 
suitable confidential arrangements 
for employees to raise concerns and 
reviews the Company’s systems and 
controls for preventing bribery.
The Committee reports its findings 
to the Board, identifying any matters 
that require action or improvement, 
and making recommendations 
about the steps to be taken.
The Committee’s Main Activities During the Year
At its five meetings during the year, the Committee focused on:
Financial Reporting
The main areas of focus and matters where the Committee specifically considered management’s judgements are set out 
below: 
Financial reporting area Judgement and assumptions considered
Biological assets valuation In compliance with IAS 41, Genus records its biological assets at fair value in the 
Group balance sheet (£315.9m), with the net valuation movement shown in the 
income statement. At each reporting period, the Committee was updated on the 
methodology and outcomes of the biological assets valuation. Having noted that the 
methodology was unchanged during the year, the Committee debated and considered 
management’s assumptions and estimates, and discussed and reviewed the external 
auditor’s report on this area. The Committee was satisfied with management’s 
accounting treatment.
Intangible assets – capitalisation and 
impairment of development costs
Genus’s policy is to capitalise certain development costs and to perform periodic 
reviews of the carrying amounts to determine whether there is any indication 
of impairment. At the balance sheet date, the Group had £11.1m of capitalised 
development expenses in respect of GSS, as well as £5.4m in associated fixed assets. 
During the year, the Committee received reports from management detailing the cost 
incurred and the outcome of the impairment reviews. The Committee also reviewed 
progress against plans and the projects’ timelines to full operation. The Committee 
discussed management’s reports in detail, including whether any known issues might 
block the projects’ completion. The Committee reviewed the external auditor’s 
work, including its assessment of management’s models supporting the estimates 
and judgements. After due challenge and debate, the Committee was satisfied with 
management’s assumptions and judgements.
Acquisitions – Birchwood and IVB During the financial year, Genus acquired 100% of the share capital of Birchwood 
Genetics Inc., a privately owned boar stud operation. In addition, Genus acquired 51% 
of the share capital of In Vitro Brazil S.A., the world’s leading commercial provider of 
bovine IVF technology. These transactions are described in note 37 to the accounts. 
The Committee received updates on the transactions’ structure and reviewed 
management’s proposed accounting treatment. The external auditor’s views supported 
these proposals. After discussing the accounting options available, the Committee 
agreed with management’s recommendations.
Pensions The Committee received and reviewed management reports on the treatment of 
pension costs and also received and considered the external auditor’s pensions 
accounting input. The Committee considered management’s recommendations were 
appropriate. The Committee continued to review the status of the other parties who 
are jointly and severally liable for the Milk Pension Fund deficit and concurred with 
management’s assumptions for reporting Genus’s share of the fund. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

Monitoring Business Risks
The Committee reviewed the Group-
wide risk management process 
designed to identify, evaluate 
and mitigate risks. In the external 
auditor’s presence, the Committee 
discussed the risks identified with the 
Chief Executive and Group Finance 
Director, along with management’s 
plans to mitigate them. In view of 
their importance during the year, the 
Committee ensured that the Board 
received and discussed detailed 
input from management on the 
following key risks and mitigations:
• China and emerging markets: this 
risk is the threat to our growth if we 
are unable to develop appropriate 
businesses in China and emerging 
markets. With a focus on China, the 
Board discussed with management 
the current developments in China 
and Russia and the actions taken by 
both regional and global 
management teams to minimise the 
impact on our strategy execution.
• GSS: this is the risk that we are 
unable to commercialise our GSS 
technology. The Board continued to 
receive regular updates throughout 
the year on go-to-market readiness, 
as well as the legal proceedings 
relating to the anti-trust issues 
connected with this key initiative.
• Information systems continuity and 
recovery: this risk is relevant to our 
ability to continue to operate our 
business in case of a system outage 
or extended downtime. The Board 
received an update on the IT system 
strategy and the results of a 
comprehensive IT security review 
performed during the year. The 
Board discussed the actions taken 
to strengthen IT security and 
resilience.
• Biosecurity and continuity of 
supply: this is the risk of a negative 
outcome for Genus if we lose key 
livestock or lose our ability to move 
animals and/or semen freely 
(including across borders), due to 
disease outbreak, an environmental 
incident or international trade 
sanctions. The Board discussed the 
outbreak of PEDv in North America 
and its impact on the entire porcine 
industry. Genus PIC’s management 
presented to the Board on the 
additional measures being taken to 
strengthen health management and 
supply chain resilience.
Internal Control System
Our risk management process 
and system of internal controls are 
described in detail on pages 58 
and 59. The Committee reviewed 
the results of the key financial 
controls self-assessment process, 
which covers key areas of financial 
controls and is performed on a six-
monthly basis, and conducted its 
annual review of the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal controls and 
disclosures. The Committee further 
reviewed internal audit’s findings at 
each scheduled meeting, and the 
Group’s whistleblowing policy and 
bribery prevention procedures. 
The Committee’s review of the Group’s 
system of internal control did not 
identify any material deficiencies. 
However, Genus routinely identifies 
and actions control improvement 
opportunities and the Committee 
discussed with management various 
opportunities to further strengthen the 
Company’s system of internal control.
Oversight of External Audit and 
Internal Audit
Internal Audit
The Committee reviewed and 
agreed the internal audit function’s 
scope, terms of reference, resources 
and activities. The Head of Risk 
Management and Internal Audit 
provided regular reports to the 
Committee on the work undertaken 
and management’s responses to 
proposals made in the internal audit 
reports issued during the year. The 
Committee continued to meet the 
Head of Risk Management and Internal 
Audit without management being 
present. The Committee reviewed 
and was satisfied with the internal 
audit function’s performance.
External Audit
The Committee reviewed and 
agreed the external auditor’s scope 
of work and fees, held detailed 
discussions of the results of its audits 
and continued to meet the external 
auditor without management being 
present. The Committee reviewed 
the external auditor’s objectivity and 
independence and the Company’s 
policy on engaging the external 
auditor to supply non-audit services. 
The Committee received details 
of the external auditor’s non-audit 
services to the Group, reviewed 
the nature and monetary levels 
of these services, which stood at 
47% of audit fees, and reviewed 
compliance with the Company’s 
Non-Audit Services by Auditor 
Policy. The Committee was satisfied 
that using Deloitte for such services 
did not impair its independence 
as the Group’s external auditor. 
The Committee assessed the 
external auditor’s performance, 
based on questionnaires completed 
by key finance staff and Committee 
members. The questionnaires covered 
the external auditor’s fulfilment 
of the audit plan, the auditor’s 
robustness and perceptiveness in 
its handling of key accounting and 
audit judgements, the content of the 
external auditor’s reports, and cost 
effectiveness. The Committee also 
considered any regulatory reviews 
performed on the external auditor. 
The Committee concluded that the 
external auditor was effective.
External Auditor’s Appointment
The external auditor, Deloitte 
LLP, was first appointed as the 
Company’s external auditor for 
the period ended 30 June 2006, 
following a formal tender process. 
The current audit partner’s first 
audit period was the financial year 
ended 30 June 2011 and he is due 
to hand over to a new partner after 
signing off this year’s accounts. 
In compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code’s requirement 
for FTSE 350 companies to put the 
external audit out to tender at least 
every ten years, the Committee 
oversaw a formal audit retender 
process for the audit of the financial 
year ending 30 June 2016. All big four 
audit firms were invited to tender, of 
which two accepted and engaged in 
the discovery process. Both firms had 
access to the Company’s management 
and finance teams, as well as all key 
information relevant to developing 
their proposals. The final proposals 
were presented to the Committee 
at a special meeting dedicated to 
this topic. The presentations were 
followed by question and answer 
sessions, during which the Committee 
questioned each team’s audit 
approach, global and IT capabilities 
and how they could add value through 
the audit process. The Committee 
then discussed the strengths and 
weaknesses of the two proposals 
and how they would meet its primary 
objective of securing the highest 
audit standards and the best overall 
client service. The process concluded 
with the selection of Deloitte LLP, 
and the Committee recommended 
its appointment to the Board. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

Letter from the Chairman
Our remuneration policy is 
transparent, supports our business 
strategy and is working. The pay of 
our executives is aligned with the 
value received by our shareholders.
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am 
pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for 2015.
 
The Remuneration Committee 
(the ‘Committee’) believes the 
remuneration policy should support 
the Group’s strategy and deliver 
value to stakeholders by focusing 
on sustainable profit growth. The 
remuneration policy, therefore, 
clearly aligns corporate performance 
and individual remuneration, 
with a significant proportion 
of pay delivered in shares and 
vesting over the longer-term.
How does Executive remuneration 
align with our strategy?
Our remuneration policy encourages 
the achievement of the corporate 
goals: through the structure of 
the annual bonus, it targets profit 
growth, cash generation and 
strategy implementation; through 
the 2014 Performance Share Plan 
(‘PSP’), it provides incentives for 
sustained profit and Earnings 
Per Share (‘EPS’) growth. This is 
detailed in Section C: Remuneration 
and Performance Statement.
How did we perform in 2015?
As highlighted in the Strategic 
Report, 2015 has been a very good 
year for the Company, led by the 
strong performance of PIC. Genus 
continued to deliver successfully on 
its strategic goals seeing very good 
progress across our R&D programmes, 
strong commercial progress in 
key markets, a rapid integration of 
Génétiporc and the acquisition of IVB. 
 
As referred to in the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Chief Executive, Karim 
Bitar, has appointed high-quality 
executives who are performing very 
well as a team and are capable of 
leading Genus as it becomes an 
increasingly science and intellectual 
property based company. They have 
focused on executing the strategy, 
managing the risks inherent in our 
sector and effectively tackling 
challenges such as PEDv and 
uncertainty in emerging markets. 
Overall, the Committee is of the view 
that management had a very good 
year in 2015 with adjusted profit 
before tax growth of 19% to £46.6m 
coupled with strong cash flow and 
tight management of working capital.
What does this mean for 
remuneration in 2015?
The Committee has focused on 
meeting shareholders’ expectations:

STRATEGIC
REPORT

ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION
we believe the best way to achieve this 
is to retain and motivate the current 
leadership team. We want them to 
continue to deliver the strategy and 
to be rewarded for achievement of 
sustained growth. The short-term 
incentive policy is designed to reward 
10% year-on-year profit growth in 
constant currency as ‘target’ and 
15% as ‘stretch’. Similarly, the 2014 
PSP fits our remuneration strategy 
of encouraging the delivery of 
sustained EPS growth, which aligns 
executive and shareholder interests.
 
Being clear about our performance 
expectations is critical. The Committee 
continued to set stretching strategic 
objectives for each member of the 
GELT. The detail and specificity of 
these objectives define each team 
members’ expected contribution 
and aligns their remuneration 
with their performance.
The very good result for 2015 means 
that, for remuneration purposes, the 
adjusted profit before tax growth of 
23% in constant currency and cash 
generation of £22.6m delivered the full 
award on both measures. Executives 
had stretching strategic objectives: 
Karim Bitar achieved 95% and Stephen 
Wilson 90% on these measures see 
pages 68 and 69 for the detail of 
performance. Overall this generated 
a short-term award of 98.75% of 
the maximum for Karim Bitar and 
97.5% for Stephen Wilson which the 
Committee believes is fully justified 
given the performance in the year. 
The 2012 long-term incentive award 
partially vested in 2015. The three-
year EPS growth rate was 23.2%, 
Retail Prices Index (‘RPI’) was 7.6%, 
resulting in an average annual EPS 
growth over the period of RPI +5.2%. 
25.6% of the award will vest for Karim 
Bitar and 23.4% for Stephen Wilson.
What did the Committee do in 2015?
The Committee had five meetings 
during the year and on page 73 
we describe the issues that were 
discussed. However, in summary, 
in terms of remuneration it was a 
steady-as-she-goes year. The most 
notable aspects of the implementation 
of the remuneration policy were:
1. It was brought to our attention that 
we had been inconsistent in our 
communication on whether or not 
adjusted EPS included or excluded 
the share-based payments 
accounting charge (also known as 
IFRS 2) for the purposes of the PSP. 
I confirm that no change is being 
made to the presentation of our 
financial statements, but that when 
determining vesting under the PSP, 
EPS will be calculated after the 
deduction of the share-based 
payments accounting charge. This 
applies to both the base year and 
final year adjusted EPS figures. We 
think that this change is the right 
approach for the future in that the 
PSP should be self-funding and the 
share-based payments charge does 
represent a quantifiable cost to 
shareholders.
2. We clarified our policy on malus 
and clawback, confirming to the 
Executive Directors that both apply 
to the short-term incentive and the 
PSP awards. When combined with 
our policy on bonus deferral and 
the two-year holding period 
applying to PSP awards, we think 
we have a comprehensive approach 
to malus and clawback should 
events ever arise for us to invoke 
this.
3. We have rewritten this Directors’ 
Remuneration Report so that it 
is clearer on what we have paid 
Executive Directors in respect of 
2015, what they can earn in 2016 
and why we do it. We have sought 
to explain how our remuneration 
policy supports our strategy and is 
linked to the results achieved. 
Will anything change in 2016?
Following your approval of the 
remuneration policy in 2014 (please 
see Section E: Director’s remuneration 
policy table), the Committee will 
continue to pursue this policy in 2016. 
It believes the policy remains fit for 
purpose, driving growth without 
encouraging undue risk taking.
 
In line with this policy, in 2016 we are 
recommending that the Executive 
Directors’ salaries will increase by 
the same percentage as the award 
to employees in the country where 
“Our remuneration policy 
is transparent, supports 
our business strategy and 
is working. The pay of our 
executives is aligned with 
the value received by 
our shareholders.”
This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been 
prepared so it complies with the provisions of 
the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts & Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013, which set out the disclosures 
required for Directors’ remuneration as at the 
reporting date. The report is also in accordance 
with the requirements of the Financial Conduct 
Authority’s Listing Rules.
The legislation requires the auditor to report to 
the Company’s members on the ‘auditable 
parts’ of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and to state whether, in its opinion, the parts of 
the report that have been subject to audit have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the 
legislation. We have highlighted the parts of this 
report which have been audited.
the executive is based: for the 
Executive Directors this will be 2%.
Shareholders’ views
The Committee was delighted that 
it received 99% approval of both the 
Policy Report and the Remuneration 
Report in 2014. We will continue to 
engage with shareholders, welcoming 
feedback and taking into account 
shareholder views and best practice.
 
On behalf of the Board, I would 
like to thank shareholders for their 
continued support. The Committee 
hopes that the new form of report 
is clear, succinct and, as always, 
would welcome feedback. If you wish 
to contact me, please email me at

The Committee looks forward to 
your support for our remuneration 
report at the 2015 AGM.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Section B: At a Glance
What the Executive Directors were paid in 2015 and why
Chief Executive Group Finance Director Explanation
Base salary £526,830 £357,000 These were the salaries set on 1 July 2014.
Benefits £24,000 £14,000 This comprises a car allowance and insured benefits for both 
Executives and a medical screen for the Group Finance Director.
Pension £131,708 £53,550 This is a cash allowance (25% of salary for the Chief Executive and 15% 
for the Group Finance Director) in lieu of participation in a pension 
plan.
Annual bonus £650,306 £435,094 On the short-term bonus award, the Group’s strong financial 
performance meant the bonus results are close to the maxima. Karim 
Bitar will receive 98.75% of maximum and Stephen Wilson 97.5%. This 
is made up of:
• Adjusted profit growth in constant currency of 23% > up to 60% of 
bonus – maximum achieved.
• Cash generation of £22.6m > up to 15% of bonus – maximum 
achieved.
• Non-financial strategic targets > up to 25% of bonus – Karim Bitar 
achieved 95% (23.75%) of this element, Stephen Wilson 90% 
(22.5%).
We explain the link between pay and corporate performance on page 
67 and detailed disclosure of the bonus targets on page 68.
PSP £275,511 £143,785 The 2014/15 adjusted EPS of 56.8 pence per share did meet the 
threshold, and therefore the Tier 1 awards granted to the Chief 
Executive (on 7 December 2012) and to the Group Finance Director 
(on 28 February 2013) partially vest.
Total £1,608,355 £1,003,429 This should be viewed in context of:
• A total shareholder return over the 2014/15 financial year of £183m 
(+ 26.2%).
• Adjusted EPS growth of +22%.
What the Executive Directors can earn in 2016 and how
Chief Executive Group Finance Director Explanation
Base salary £537,367 £364,140 Consistent with the general approach taken for Genus UK staff, the 
Executive Directors have been awarded a salary increase of 2% as 
from 1 July 2015.
Benefits £25,000 £14,000 There is no change to the provision of a car allowance and insured 
benefits: a medical screen has been introduced. The year-on-year 
change is adjustments in life and medical insurance premiums and 
medical screen. 
Pension £134,342 £54,621 The Chief Executive continues to be paid a 25% cash allowance in lieu 
of participation in a pension plan; the Group Finance Director receives 
a 15% cash allowance.
Annual bonus A target bonus of 
62.5% of salary and  
a maximum bonus of  
125% of salary
A target bonus of 
62.5% of salary and  
a maximum bonus of  
125% of salary
The measures will remain:
• Adjusted profit growth > 60% of bonus.
• Cash generation > 15% of bonus.
• Non-financial strategic targets > 25% of bonus.
For the adjusted profit growth measure, target bonus requires 
10% growth and maximum bonus requires 15% growth in constant 
currency.
PSP – September 
2013 awards 
Up to 73,107 shares Up to 43,347 shares The vesting of these awards depends on the EPS achieved in 2016. 
Full details are given on page 70.
PSP – awards 
that will be 
granted in 2015 
and may vest in 
2018
An award over 
shares worth  
200% of salary
An award over 
shares worth  
175% of salary
The vesting of these awards will be subject to an EPS growth 
condition, with the 2018 EPS being compared to the 2015 adjusted 
EPS of 56.8 pence per share.
• 6% annual growth > threshold 20% vesting.
• 20% annual growth > 100% vesting.
For illustration, 20% annual growth corresponds to a 2018 adjusted 
EPS of 90.9 pence per share. At a price/earnings ratio of 25, this would 
translate to a Genus share price of £22.72 and a market capitalisation 
of £1,379m. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

How the Long-term Incentive Figure was Calculated in The Single Total Remuneration Table
Karim Bitar’s PSP award granted on 7 December 2012 and Stephen Wilson’s PSP award granted on 28 February 2013 
were both subject to an EPS performance condition, based on the growth in EPS from a base year of 2012 compared to 
the EPS in 2015. These awards were granted under our former policy. The performance targets were as follows in relation 
to the awards: 
Tier 1
The range of targets applicable to awards with a value of 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary to the 
Group Finance Director were as follows:
Per annum growth in adjusted EPS
1
% of award vesting
2
<RPI +4% Nil
RPI +4% 30%
RPI +11% 100%
Tier 2
The range of targets applying to an additional award with a value of 75% of salary were as follows:
Per annum growth in adjusted EPS
1
% of award vesting
3
<RPI +9% Nil
RPI +9% 10%
RPI +10% 20%
RPI +11% 35%
RPI +20% 100%
1 Growth in adjusted EPS over the three-year performance period will be computed based on a simple average annual growth rate.
2 From RPI +4%, a linear scale of 10% vesting per % increase in adjusted EPS was applied. 
3 From RPI +11%, a linear scale of 7% vesting per % increase in adjusted EPS was applied.
The adjusted 2015 EPS after the cost of share-based payments was 55.1 pence per share. The comparable base 2012 
adjusted EPS figure after the cost of share-based payments and with the effect on pension interest of the exceptional 
provision in respect of the Milk Pension Fund recognised in that year was 44.7 pence. This represents a three-year growth 
rate of 23.2%. RPI over the three-year period was 7.6%. As a consequence the average annual growth in EPS was RPI +5.2%. 
By applying the performance condition calibration, the resulting level of vesting is 25.6% for Karim Bitar and 23.4% for 
Stephen Wilson.
Karim Bitar’s award was over a maximum of 75,420 shares, so the actual level of vesting is 19,307 shares and these will vest 
on 8 December 2015. Stephen Wilson’s award was over a maximum of 43,063 shares, so the actual level of vesting is 10,076 
shares and these will vest on 29 February 2016.
The Company’s share price on 30 June 2015 was 1,427 pence, meaning that the value of Karim Bitar’s award was £275,511 
and Stephen Wilson’s award was worth £143,785.
Material Contracts
There have been no other contracts or arrangements during the financial year in which a Director of the Company was 
materially interested and/or which were significant in relation to the Group’s business.
Payments for Loss of Office and Payments to Former Directors (Audited)
There were no payments for loss of office in the year.
Executive Directors’ External Appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to accept an external non-executive position with the Board’s approval. Any fees 
received in respect of these appointments may be retained by the Executive. Stephen Wilson received £50,000 in relation 
to his Non-Executive Directorship at Xchanging plc for the year to 31 December 2014.
2. What the Executive Directors can earn in 2016
A summary of this chapter is given on page 66. 
Base Salary
The Committee reviews the Executive Directors’ base salaries prior to each financial year, taking into account factors such 
as individual and corporate performance, an assessment of market conditions and, most importantly, the salary increases 
applicable to the Group’s other UK employees.
The Executive Directors’ current salary levels (with effect from 1 July 2015) are as follows:
• Karim Bitar: £537,367 (2% increase from 2015); and
• Stephen Wilson: £364,140 (2% increase from 2015).
The Committee determined that salaries would be increased by 2%, reflecting the average increase awarded across the UK 
employee population. It did not refer to other market benchmarking data this year when making this decision.

Benefits
The Executive Directors will receive the following benefits-in-kind, namely a car allowance, life assurance, an annual medical 
screen and private medical insurance.
Pension
In lieu of company pension contributions, the Company pays Karim Bitar and Stephen Wilson a taxable pension allowance 
of 25% and 15% of basic salary per annum respectively.
Performance-Related Annual Bonus
Consistent with the approved remuneration policy and past practice, the Company bonus scheme for the 2016 financial 
year for the Executive Directors is: 
On-target value of bonus 62.5% of salary.
Maximum bonus 125% of salary.
Performance measures Adjusted profit before tax – 60% weighting.
Cash generation – 15% weighting.
Non-financial strategic targets – 25% weighting.
Calibration of profit target No bonus is payable unless the prior year’s result is exceeded. Thereafter, the bonus is 
determined on the following basis:

Straight-line pay out between performance points.
1 In constant currency.
Calibration of cash generation target The cash target is the budgeted figure, with a specific range of £3m below the target and £3m 
above. Specific numbers were set (rather than a percentage range) to ensure the executives 
were focused on actual cash generation.
Calibration of non-financial 
strategic targets
Non-financial strategic targets are linked to successful implementation of the Company’s 
strategy, with the targets being both quantifiable and stretching. Achievement of these targets 
is central to unlocking the Group’s growth potential and as such it would be commercially 
sensitive to disclose them in advance. We will disclose retrospective performance against the 
strategic targets as we have done on page 69. 
Bonus deferral 25% of any bonus will be deferred by way of shares for three years and will vest subject to 
continued employment, other than in certain good leaver circumstances.
Malus and clawback The Committee can apply malus to deferred bonuses and claw back any element of paid 
bonuses that should not have been awarded or paid, in the event of a material misstatement of 
the Group’s annual results.
Long-Term Incentives
At last year’s AGM, shareholders approved a new 2014 PSP. This will be used in the manner set out in the Notice of 2014 
AGM to grant awards in 2015 in line with the approved policy. The Chief Executive will be granted an award over shares 
worth 200% of salary and the Group Finance Director will be granted an award over shares worth 175% of salary. These 
awards are in line with those in 2014.
The performance targets for the awards to be granted in 2015 will primarily relate to average annual growth in adjusted 
EPS, measured over three years. The range of targets for the 2015 awards is as follows:
Average Annual Growth in Adjusted EPS
1
Vesting  
(% award)
Less than 6% per annum 0%
6% per annum 20%
20% per annum 100%
Straight-line vesting between performance points
1 Growth in adjusted EPS over the three-year performance period will be calculated on a simple average annual growth rate after the cost of share-based payments. Genus plc Annual Report 2015
72
The Committee remains convinced that using adjusted EPS is the correct approach, for the reasons set out in the 
Performance and Remuneration Statement above. The Committee believes the above targets are appropriately 
challenging. They incentivise Executives to deliver the Company’s growth strategy and are therefore aligned with 
shareholders’ interests. They also adhere to the principles of transparency and simplicity to maximise the incentive 
provided to participants by the PSP.
As with awards currently granted under the PSP, the Committee will retain the ability to scale back vesting based on EPS 
performance if it does not consider the vesting result to be consistent with the progress achieved against the Company’s 
strategy during the performance period. This is considered appropriate, to broaden the executive team’s focus beyond 
financial performance.
Another key feature of the 2015 PSP awards will be the requirement to retain the after tax number of shares vesting in 2018 
for two years. Clawback and malus provisions may be applied at the Committee’s discretion if the Company’s results are 
found to have been misstated within three years of vesting.
3. The process that the Committee followed to arrive at these decisions
The Company’s Committee complies with the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Committee makes recommendations 
to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on remuneration for the Executive Directors and other members of GELT. 
The Committee’s full terms of reference are available on the Company’s website at www.genusplc.com.
During 2015, the Committee comprised:

Mike Buzzacott Yes 5/5
Barry Furr

Yes 2/2
Duncan Maskell Yes 5/5
Lykele van der Broek Yes 5/5
Bob Lawson Yes 5/5
1 Barry Furr retired from the Board at the Company’s AGM on 14 November 2014 and sadly died in February 2015.
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests 
arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Chief Executive and the Group 
Finance Director attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee, but are not present when their own remuneration is 
being discussed. The Committee is supported by the Group HR Director, Finance and Company Secretariat functions. 
During the year, the Committee reviewed its advisers and after a tender process decided to appoint PwC as from 
23 January 2015 (New Bridge Street advised until that date). This tender process has reassured the Committee that the 
advice it receives is of value, objective and is independent. New Bridge Street (part of Aon plc) fees were £38,783 and PwC 
fees were £32,583 for their remuneration advice to the Committee. New Bridge Street fees were £37,032 for advice relating 
to the PSP preparation. Both firms are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and comply with its Code of 
Conduct. Aon plc acts as insurance broker to the Company and PwC provides international assignment support and 
associated tax advice to the Group.

How Employees’ Pay is taken into Account
While the Company does not consult employees on matters of Directors’ remuneration, the Committee does take account 
of the policy for employees across the workforce when determining the remuneration policy for Directors.
The Group HR Director facilitates this process, presenting to the Committee the pay structures across the organisation and 
how they fit the Group’s remuneration policy. The process includes an annual staff engagement survey that includes 
questions on pay, as well as consulting employees informally on their views of the current overall remuneration policy. This 
forms part of the feedback provided to the Committee and is used by the Group HR Director to assess the policy’s ongoing 
effectiveness and the changes that should be made.
When setting the Executive Directors’ base salaries, the Committee compares the salary increases proposed for each 
Executive Director within those proposed for employees in their geographical location, as well as considering the typical 
increase proposed across the Group as a whole.

The Directors’ remuneration policy was approved by shareholders last year. We were very pleased to receive 99.36% support.
There are no proposed changes to the policy this year. Accordingly, there will be no resolution at this year’s AGM seeking 
approval of the policy. Please note that we will have the annual resolution seeking shareholder approval of how we have 
implemented the policy.
As such, we repeat the table summarising our policy below, but refer you to the 2014 Annual Report found on our website 
(www.genusplc.com) for the full details.

Operation Operation Operation
Normally reviewed annually, with 
increases normally effective from 
1 July.
Periodically benchmarked against 
relevant market comparators, 
reflecting the size and nature of the 
role, individual performance and 
experience, increases awarded to 
other employees, Group performance 
and broader economic conditions.
Benefits generally include a 
car allowance and insured 
benefits (e.g. life assurance and 
private medical insurance).
Where Executive Directors are 
recruited from overseas, or required 
to relocate on an international 
assignment, benefits more tailored to 
their geographical location may be 
provided and may include relocation 
costs and/or tax equalisation 
arrangements as necessary.
Where revised benefits are offered 
in a geographic location or across 
the Group, Executive Directors 
are likely to be eligible to receive 
those benefits on similar terms.
If the Company introduces 
an all-employee share plan, 
Executive Directors will be 
eligible to participate on the same 
terms as other employees.
Only basic salary is pensionable.
Pension is provided by way of 
contribution to a personal pension 
or as a salary supplement in 
lieu of pension provision.
Maximum Maximum Maximum
Annual percentage increases are 
generally consistent with the range 
awarded across the Group.
Percentage increases in salary above 
this level may be made in certain 
circumstances, such as a change 
in responsibility or a significant 
increase in the role’s scale or the 
Group’s size and complexity.
The car allowance value is limited 
to £20,000 per annum.
The value of insured benefits will 
vary year on year, based on the 
cost of providing insured benefits, 
and is included in the total single 
figure table on page 68.
Pension contribution or salary 
supplements in lieu of pension 
are provided to a maximum 
of 25% of basic salary.

Annual Bonus
Incentivises achievement of annual 
objectives which support the Group’s 
short-term performance goals.
PSP
The PSP incentivises executives to achieve superior returns to shareholders over 
a three-year period, to retain key individuals and align their interests with 
shareholders. 
Operation Operation
Payments under the annual bonus 
plan are subject to:
• compulsory deferral of 25% of any 
bonus earned into the Company’s 
shares; and
• malus and clawback provisions for 
a period of three years, which may 
apply in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Group’s 
financial results.
DSBP awards will vest after three 
years subject to continued service.
A dividend equivalent provision 
operates, enabling dividends to 
be paid (in cash or shares) on 
deferred shares that vest.
Eligibility to receive awards 
is at the discretion of the 
Committee each year.
Awards vest three years from grant, 
subject to continued employment 
and satisfaction of challenging 
three-year performance targets.
For awards granted from 2014, 
the after tax number of vested 
shares must be held for at 
least a two-year period.
A dividend equivalent provision 
enables dividends to be paid (in 
cash or shares) on shares that vest.
Malus and clawback provisions may 
apply for a period of three years, in 
the event of a material misstatement 
of the Group’s financial results.
Maximum Maximum
125% of salary. Maximum annual award of 200% of 
salary (300% of salary in exceptional 
circumstances such as recruitment).
Performance Conditions Performance Conditions
Bonus awards are subject to 
achievement against a sliding scale 
of challenging financial targets 
and personal objectives, which the 
Committee sets each year to reflect 
the priorities for the year ahead.
Financial targets govern the 
majority of bonus payments and are 
typically linked to the Group’s key 
performance indicators (e.g. profit 
and cash generation), with a minority 
earned based on performance 
against personal objectives.
For financial performance targets, 
bonus is earned on a graduated 
scale, with 0% payable up to a 
predetermined threshold, through 
to a maximum payment for 
substantial out-performance of 
the threshold (100% payable).
A summary of the performance 
targets for 2016 is included on 
page 66.
Awards vest based on three-
year performance against a 
challenging range of targets, 
aligned with the delivery of the 
Company’s long-term strategy.
Financial targets (including adjusted 
EPS growth) will determine 
the vesting of a majority of 
awards granted in any year.
Targets are typically structured as 
a challenging sliding scale, with no 
more than 20% of the maximum 
award vesting for achieving the 
threshold performance level through 
to full vesting for substantial out-
performance of the threshold.
The awards will also be subject to an 
underpin that enables the Committee 
to scale back (but not scale up) 
vesting, if the Group’s performance 
over the period is not considered to 
reflect the progress made against 
its strategic business targets.
A summary of the performance 
targets for 2016 is given on page 66.
The Committee will review 
performance conditions annually, in 
terms of the range of EPS targets 
and the metrics and weightings 
applied to each element of the 
PSP. Any revisions to the metrics 
and/or weightings will only take 
place if it is necessary because of 
developments in the Company’s 
strategy and, where these are 
material, following dialogue with 
the Company’s major shareholders. 
Should the Committee believe 
that a major change of the current 
approach is appropriate (for example, 
replacing a primary performance 
metric with an alternative), this 
would only take place following a 
revised Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy being tabled to shareholders.

Nomination Committee Report
Chairman’s Overview
The Committee’s purpose is to 
propose candidates for appointment 
to the Board. Our duties include 
reviewing the Board’s structure, 
size and composition, including the 
skills, knowledge and experience 
the Board needs. We then make 
recommendations to the Board, 
taking into account succession 
planning for Directors and other 
senior executives, and the Group’s 
challenges and opportunities. The 
Committee meets when required.
Membership and Governance
Bob Lawson chairs the Committee. 
Its other members are currently 
Nigel Turner, Mike Buzzacott, 
Duncan Maskell, Lykele van 
der Broek and Karim Bitar.
The Committee has written terms 
of reference, which set out the 
authority delegated to it by the 
Board. These are available from 
our website: www.genusplc.com.
Activities During the Year
In our 2014 Annual Report, we 
reported on the appointment of 
two Non-Executive Directors, 
Duncan Maskell, who has a scientific 
background, and Lykele van der 
Broek, who has experience in 
agriculture. Their appointments 
followed an objective assessment 
of the Group’s needs and strategy 
and the Board’s current skills and 
experience, and involved a thorough 
search with the help of one of the 
world’s leading global executive 
search firms. During FY15, both 
new Non-Executive Directors have 
integrated well into the Board and 
made valuable contributions. 
The Committee did not meet during 
the year but did conduct a review 
of its effectiveness. This included 
considering the value of a gender-
diverse Board, and identifying and 
discussing further improvements to 
the Non-Executive Director succession 
planning process. We already conduct 
a formal executive succession 
planning process each year, and we 
intend to introduce a similar formal 
process for Non-Executive Directors, 
to be carried out at the same time.

Report confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware; and
• the Director has taken all the steps 
that he ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make himself 
aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that 
information.
This confirmation is given and 
should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of section 
418 Companies Act 2006. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
Financial Statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare Financial Statements for 
each financial year. Under that law, 
the Directors are required to prepare 
the Group Financial Statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as 
adopted by the European Union and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and 
have elected to prepare the Parent 
Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under 
company law, the Directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company 
Financial Statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the Financial Statements; and
• prepare the Financial Statements on 
the going concern basis, unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group Financial 
Statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply 
accounting policies;
• present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable 
information; 
• provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are 
insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and 
conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; 
and
• make an assessment of the 
Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the 
Company and enable them to ensure 
that the Financial Statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
Financial Statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement 
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
• the Financial Statements, prepared 
in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and 
profit or loss of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
• the Strategic Report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
• the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable, 
and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.

Opinion on financial statements of Genus plc
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
30 June 2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group Statement of Cash Flows, the Group Statement of Changes in 
Equity and the related notes 1 to 51. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company Financial Statements is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement contained within the Other Statutory 
Disclosures section that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below, which are the same risks as were identified in the prior year, 
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Fair value of biological assets under  
IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’
The Group calculates the fair value of 
biological assets through the use of 
discounted cash flow models and recent 
transaction prices. 
The valuation models and related data inputs 
and assumptions require a number of 
management estimates as explained in note 
15 to the financial statements.
For bovine asset valuations the key 
assumptions include: the future demand for 
semen; estimated production volume; 
expected marketable life of each bull; the 
discount rate applied to the future cash 
flows; current market prices and the 
percentage of bulls which are expected to be 
actively marketed.
For porcine asset valuations the key 
assumptions include: the percentage of 
production animals expected to be sold; the 
expected sales price; the expected useful life; 
the discount rate applied to the future cash 
flows; and for the pureline pigs the number 
of future generations from which output is 
attributable to the current herd.
Our response to this risk considers the separate elements of the fair value 
calculations: the basis for management’s estimates and judgements 
applied in the key assumptions; the validity of transactional data used for 
other inputs; and the mechanical integrity of the models themselves.
For the bovine asset valuations, our audit work included obtaining an 
understanding of management’s processes surrounding the compilation of 
the future demand, marketable life and production volume forecasts. We 
considered the appropriateness of projected volume growth rates against 
historical trends and current performance, and analysed management’s 
historical forecasting accuracy.
For the porcine asset valuations our audit work included consideration of 
the appropriateness of management’s assessment of the number of future 
generations from which output is attributable to the current herd and 
expected useful lives. We tested the expected percentages of animals to be 
sold, retained and slaughtered by reference to historical transactional data. 
For all other assumptions in each model we challenged the significant 
estimates with reference to third party or historical transactional data as 
appropriate.
For both species’ valuation models, we used internal valuation experts 
in our testing of the discount rates applied to the cash flows. 
We also tested the mechanical integrity of the spreadsheets used to 
calculate the fair values using analytical tools and performed sensitivity 
analyses on the key assumptions.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Valuation of pension schemes and 
post‑retirement benefits
The Group operates several defined benefit 
pension schemes, for which there is 
judgement in determining the net deficit 
valuation under IAS 19 of £63.1m as recorded 
at the balance sheet date. The valuation is 
based on a number of assumptions disclosed 
in note 28 such as the discount rate, inflation 
rate and life expectancy.
Genus is party to the Milk Pension Fund, a 
multi-employer pension scheme and is 
exposed to the risk of additional liabilities 
from the default of other scheme members 
beyond its current 75% share of the liabilities.
In conjunction with our actuarial specialists, we have evaluated the 
appropriateness of management’s methodology and assumptions used to 
value the defined benefit pension schemes by benchmarking the 
assumptions to those used in the external market as at the same date.
In addition we circularised the independent actuaries and investment 
managers responsible for managing the pension funds to confirm the 
source inputs into the pension valuations.
In response to the risk of additional liabilities for the multi-employer 
scheme arising from other employers, we have considered the financial 
strength and stability of remaining employers in the scheme and their 
ability to contribute to the deficit through a review of the most recent 
publicly available financial information.
Accounting for acquisitions
Genus acquired two businesses during the 
year, Birchwood Genetics, Inc. and In Vitro 
Brasil S.A. In relation to these acquisitions, 
£7.6m of intangible assets were identified 
which predominantly relate to customer 
relationships and technology assets as set 
out in note 37.
The determination of the fair value of 
identified intangible assets is a matter of 
management judgement. The significant 
assumptions include the growth rates 
inherent in the forecast sales expected to be 
generated from the acquired customer 
relationships and technology; customer 
churn; royalty rates and the discount rate 
applied to the future cash flows.
The carrying values of each of the put and 
call options over the remaining 49% share 
capital of In Vitro Brasil S.A. require 
judgement as they are dependent on the 
company’s future profitability.
In respect of the intangible assets identified, we involved our valuation 
specialists in our testing of the valuation model, including checking the 
appropriateness of the valuation methodology employed and 
benchmarking the discount rates applied against comparable companies.
We agreed the forecast cash flows used in the models to Board approved 
plans and understood the related key assumptions including the growth 
rate, with reference to recent performance.
In respect of the carrying values of each of the put and call options, we 
evaluated the consistency of management’s forecasts with those used in 
the intangible assets valuation.

Impairment of goodwill and capitalised 
development costs
Goodwill
The Group has £73.9m of goodwill on its 
balance sheet, as set out in note 14. There is a 
risk regarding potential impairment of the 
carrying value of goodwill arising from 
historical acquisitions.
In management’s impairment assessment 
there are a number of key judgements used 
to determine the recoverable amount, 
including the identification of cash-
generating units (‘CGUs’), growth rates in 
future cash flow forecasts, the cost savings 
to be derived from the Genus Sexed Semen 
(‘GSS’) project and discount rates applied to 
these forecasts.
Goodwill
We challenged the assumptions used by management in their annual 
impairment assessment by comparing the projected growth rates and 
forecast cash flows against historical trends achieved in the business. We 
analysed historical budgeting accuracy to assess the reliability of 
management’s forecasts. We reviewed third party market data sources 
used by management in their forecast models.
We reviewed management’s identification of CGUs, which is consistent 
with last year.
We agreed the projected cost savings from the GSS project to detailed 
plans and forecasts.
We evaluated management’s assessment of the sensitivity of the Group’s 
impairment assumptions to reasonably possible changes and considered 
the associated disclosures provided by the Group in relation to its 
impairment review within note 14.
We used valuation specialists within the audit team to challenge the 
discount rates applied to these cash flows by reference to market data, 
including the risk premium applied to each CGU. This involved 
benchmarking the rates against other companies operating in similar 
regions.
Capitalised development costs
There is also a risk regarding potential 
impairment of development costs of £11.4m 
capitalised in relation to the GSS project.
Capitalised development costs
We tested the development costs capitalised to assess whether they meet 
the criteria for capitalisation as set out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. We 
reviewed management’s assessment of the carrying value of costs 
capitalised and challenged the assumptions applied to the total project 
valuation model including: the projected cash flows, growth rates and 
discount rates applied.
To corroborate the information contained within the valuation model we 
discussed the progress and future prospects with project managers and 
discussed the potential impact of the related litigation with management.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee 
discussed on pages 60 to 63.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not 
modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in 
planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £2.3m (2014: £2.5m), which is 5.8% (2014: 7.5%) of pre-tax profit before 
exceptional items and changes in fair value of biological assets, and below 1.0% of equity. We have used this measure to 
eliminate volatility due to non-recurring items and fair value movements.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.1m (2014: 
£0.1m), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also 
report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the

An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide 
controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our 
Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 20 (2014: 21) components.
Twelve (2014: eleven) of these were subject to a full audit, whilst the remaining eight (2014: ten) were subject to specified 
audit procedures where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of 
the materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations.
The entities subject to a full scope audit represent the principal business units and other components and account for 85% 
(2014: 75%) of the Group’s net assets, 78% (2014: 69%) of the Group’s revenue and 86% (2014: 62%) of the Group’s 
operating profit. They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of 
material misstatement identified above.
The entities subject to specified audit procedures account for 10% (2014: 19%) of the Group’s net assets, 14% (2014: 21%) of 
the Group’s revenue and 9% (2014: 29%) of the Group’s operating profit.
Our audit work at the 20 entities was executed at levels of materiality which were lower than Group materiality. A senior 
member of the group audit team visits some of the more significant components each year. We include all the component 
audit teams in our team briefing, review documentation of the findings from their work and attend their audit close 
meetings via conference call.
We also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were 
no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not 
subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company Financial Statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from 
our review.

INFORMATION
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information 
in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable 
and whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee 
which we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or 
misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also 
comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure 
that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our 
dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the 
financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

INFORMATION
1. Reporting entity
Genus plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. Its 
registered office is Matrix House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4DZ. The Group Financial Statements for the 
year ended 30 June 2015 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). We have used 
the equity method to account for the Group’s interests in joint ventures and associates. Genus at a Glance on pages 2 and 3 
explains the Group’s operations and principal activities.
2. Basis of preparation
We have prepared the Group Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) 
as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Unless otherwise stated, we have consistently applied the significant accounting policies set out below to all periods 
presented in these Group Financial Statements.
We reclassified certain comparative amounts in 2014, to conform to the current year’s presentation.
Functional and presentation currency
We present the Group Financial Statements in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency. All 
financial information presented in Sterling has been rounded to the nearest £0.1m.
Basis of measurement
We prepare the Group Financial Statements under the historical cost convention, except for our biological assets and 
derivative financial instruments. In accordance with IFRS, we measure:
• biological assets at fair value less point-of-sale costs, which represent the costs of distribution and selling expenses; and
• derivative financial instruments at fair value.
Use of estimates
Preparing financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect our 
application of accounting policies and our reported assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Our actual results may differ 
from these estimates. We review our estimates and underlying assumptions on an ongoing basis, and recognise revisions to 
accounting estimates in the period in which we revise the estimate and in any future periods affected.
Note 4 provides information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and the critical judgements we made in 
applying accounting policies that have the most effect on the amounts we recognised in the financial statements.
Going concern
After reviewing the available information including the Group’s business plans and after making enquiries, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
At 30 June 2015 the Group had net debt of £71.8m (2014: £63.9m) and undrawn committed borrowing facilities of £51.1m. 
The Group’s credit facilities at the balance sheet date comprised a £65m multi-currency revolving credit facility, a US$100m 
revolving credit facility and an amortising US$15m term loan, repayable in instalments by 15 September 2017. We do not 
expect the financial covenants on these facilities to prevent the Group making further use of the facilities if required. This, 
together with the maturity profile of debt, gives the Directors confidence that the Group has sufficient financial resources 
for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business 
despite current uncertainties in the economic environment.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities the Group controls. We have control when we have the power to govern the entity’s financial and 
operating policies, so we benefit from its activities. In assessing control, we take into account potential voting rights that we 
can currently exercise or convert. We fully consolidate the results of subsidiaries we acquire from the date that control 
transfers to the Group. We cease consolidating the results of subsidiaries we sell from the date that control passes.
Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating 
policies. The Group Financial Statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised income and expense of 
associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date it ceases. When 
our share of losses exceeds our interest in an associate, we reduce the carrying amount to nil and stop recognising further 
losses, except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on an 
associate’s behalf.
Joint ventures are entities over whose activities we have joint control, under a contractual agreement. The Group Financial 
Statements include the Group’s share of profit or loss arising from joint ventures.
In preparing the Group Financial Statements, we eliminate intra-Group balances and any unrealised income and expenses 
arising from intra-Group transactions. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are 
eliminated against the investment, to the extent of our interest in the investee. We eliminate unrealised losses in the same 
way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

2. Basis of preparation continued
Non-GAAP measures – adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit before tax from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share 
exclude the net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, share-based 
payment expense, exceptional items and other gains or losses.
We believe these non-GAAP measures provide shareholders with useful information about the Group’s trading 
performance. The reconciliation between operating profit from continuing operations and adjusted operating profit from 
continuing operations is shown on the face of the Group Income Statement.
Foreign currencies
We record foreign currency transactions in the relevant Group entity’s functional currency, at the exchange rate on the 
transaction date. At each balance sheet date, we retranslate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. We recognise the foreign exchange differences arising on 
retranslation in the Group Income Statement.
When non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency, we translate them at the 
exchange rate at the transaction date. When non-monetary assets and liabilities are stated at fair value in a foreign 
currency, we translate them at the prevailing exchange rate on the date we determined the fair value.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill arising on consolidation, are translated into Sterling at the 
prevailing exchange rates at the balance sheet date. We translate these operations’ revenues and expenses using an 
average rate for the period.
When exchange differences arise from translating foreign operations into Sterling, or from the fair value movement of 
related effective hedges, we take them to the foreign currency translation reserve. When we dispose of the foreign 
operation, we release these differences to the income statement.
Exchange movements on inter-company loans designated as long-term funding are taken to the foreign currency 
translation reserve, together with any related taxation.
The principal exchange rates were as follows:

3. Significant accounting policies
Business combinations
We use the purchase method to account for all business combinations. The cost of acquisition is the aggregate of the fair 
value at the date of exchange of assets we give, liabilities we incur or assume, and equity instruments we issue in exchange 
for control of the acquiree. We recognise acquisition related costs in the profit and loss as we incur them.
We recognise the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, which meet the conditions for 
recognition under IFRS 3, at their fair values at the acquisition date. The exceptions are non-current assets (or disposal 
groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations’, which we recognise and measure at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill
When we acquire a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the goodwill arising is the excess of the acquisition cost, excluding 
transaction costs, over our interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities. Identifiable assets include intangible assets which could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights, 
regardless of whether those rights are separable.
We state goodwill at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. We allocate goodwill to cash-generating units, which 
are the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
from other assets or groups of assets. We do not amortise goodwill but we do test it annually for impairment. For 
associates, we include the carrying amount of goodwill in the carrying amount of our investment in the associate.
IAS 21 requires us to treat the following as assets and liabilities of the acquired entity rather than of the acquiring entity:
• goodwill arising on acquisition of a foreign operation; and
• any fair value adjustments we make on acquisition to the carrying amounts of the acquiree’s assets and liabilities.
We therefore express them in the foreign operation’s functional currency and retranslate them at the balance sheet date. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

INFORMATION
Research and development
We undertake research with the aim of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge, and recognise this expenditure in the 
income statement as we incur it.
The Group constantly monitors its research activities. When research projects achieve technical feasibility and are 
commercially viable, our policy is to capitalise further development costs in accordance with IAS 38.
Our development activities include developing and maintaining our porcine genetic nucleus herd and our bovine pre-stud 
herds. We do not capitalise development expenditure separately for these herds, as their fair value is included in the fair 
value of the Group’s biological assets, in accordance with IAS 41.
We capitalise other development costs within intangible assets when the criteria of IAS 38 are met.
We disclose the costs of research and herd development activities, as required by IAS 38.
Exceptional items
The Group presents items as exceptional when the Directors believe them to be exceptional because of their size or 
incidence.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets that we have acquired in a business combination since 1 April 2005 are identified and recognised 
separately from goodwill, where they meet the definition of an intangible asset and we can reliably measure their fair 
values. Their cost is their fair value at the acquisition date.
After their initial recognition, we report these intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. This is the same basis as for intangible assets acquired separately.
The estimated useful lives for intangible assets are as follows:
Software    2 to 10 years
Porcine and bovine genetics technology 20 years
Multiplier contracts   15 years
Customer relationships   15 to 17 years
Intangible assets acquired separately
We carry intangible assets acquired other than through a business combination at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
any impairment loss. We charge amortisation on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, and review the useful 
life and amortisation method at the end of each financial year, accounting for the effect of any changes in estimate on a 
prospective basis.
Impairment
We review the carrying amounts of our tangible and intangible assets at each balance sheet date, to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment. If any indication exists, we estimate the asset’s recoverable amount.
For goodwill, and tangible and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, we estimate the recoverable amount at 
each balance sheet date. The recoverable amount is the greater of their net selling price and value in use. In assessing value 
in use, we discount the estimated future cash flows to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.8% (2014: 
11.1%), which is derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. For some countries we add a premium to this 
rate, to reflect the risk attributable to that country. If the asset does not generate largely independent cash inflows, we 
determine the recoverable amount for the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) that the asset belongs to.
We recognise an impairment loss in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
When we recognise an impairment loss in respect of a CGU, we first allocate it to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to CGUs, and then apply any remaining loss to reduce the carrying amount of the unit’s other assets on a 
pro rata basis.
Reversals of impairment
We reverse an impairment loss in respect of assets other than goodwill when the impairment loss may no longer exist and 
we have changed the estimates we used to determine the recoverable amount.
We only reverse an impairment loss to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount it 
would have had, net of depreciation or amortisation, if we had not recognised the impairment loss. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

Biological assets and inventories
The Group’s principal activity during the period was the global application of quantitative genetics and biotechnology to 
animal breeding. We use these techniques to identify and select animals with the genes responsible for superior milk and 
meat, high health and performance traits. We sell breeding animals and semen to customers, who use them to produce 
offspring which yield greater production efficiency, milk and meat quality, for the global dairy and meat supply chain.
In bovine, we use research and development to identify genetically superior bulls in a number of breeds, primarily the 
Holstein dairy breed. Each selected bull has its performance measured against its peers, by using genomic evaluations and 
progeny testing of its daughters’ performance. We collect and freeze semen from the best bulls, to satisfy our customers’ 
demand. Farmers use semen from dairy breeds to breed replacement milking stock. They use the semen we sell from beef 
breeds in either specialist beef breeding herds, for multiplying breeding bulls for use in natural service, or on dairy cows to 
produce animals to be reared for meat.
We hold our bovine biological assets for long-term internal use and classify them as non-current assets. We transfer bull 
semen to inventory at its fair value at the point of harvest, which becomes its deemed cost under IAS 2. We state our 
inventories at the lower of this deemed cost and net realisable value.
Sorting semen is a production process rather than a biological process. As a result, we transfer semen inventory into sexed 
semen production at its fair value at the point of harvest, less the cost to sell, and it becomes a component of the 
production process. We carry sexed semen in finished goods at production cost.
In porcine, we maintain and develop a central breeding stock (the ‘nucleus herd’), to provide genetically superior animals. 
These genetics help make farmers and food processors more profitable, by increasing their output of consistently high-
quality products, which yield higher value. So we can capitalise on our intellectual property, we outsource the vast majority 
of our pig production to our global multiplier network. We sell the offspring or semen we obtain from animals in the nucleus 
herd to customers for use in commercial farming.
Pig sales generally occur in one of two ways: ‘upfront’ and ‘royalty’. Under upfront sales, we receive the full fair value of the 
animal at point we transfer it to the customer. Under royalty sales, the pig is regarded as comprising two separately 
identifiable components: its carcass and its genetic potential. We receive the initial consideration, which is approximately 
the animal’s carcass value, at the point we transfer the pig to the customer. We retain our interest in the pig’s genetic 
potential and receive royalties for the customer’s use of this genetic potential.
The breeding animal biological assets we own, and our retained interest in the biological assets we have sold under royalty 
contracts, are recognised and measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. We recognise changes in fair value in the 
income statement, within operating profit for the period.
We classify the porcine biological assets we are using as breeding animals as non-current assets and carry them at fair 
value. The porcine biological assets we are holding for resale, which are the offspring of the breeding herd, are carried at 
fair value and classified as current assets. We split our retained interest in the genetics from royalty sales between current 
and non-current assets, based on the remaining expected life of the animals.
Determination of fair values – biological assets
IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’ requires us to show the carrying value of biological assets in the Group Balance Sheet. We determine 
this carrying value according to IAS 41’s provisions and show the net valuation movement in the income statement. There 
are important differences in how we value our bovine and porcine assets, as explained below.
Bovine – we base the fair value of proven bulls, bulls with a genomic evaluation and bulls on test, on the net cash flows we 
expect to receive from selling their semen, discounted at a current market-determined pre-tax rate. Proven bulls are those 
we have evaluated and whose semen we actively market. Genomic bulls are those we market on their estimated genetic 
value. We adjust the fair value of the bovine herd and semen inventory we manage where a third party has a share in 
semen sales from a particular bull. The significant assumptions determining the fair values are the expected future demand 
for semen, estimated production value, each bull’s expected marketable life and, for bulls on test, the percentage whose 
production we expect to actively market. In assessing the sales price, we use independent statistical data for the bulls. This 
data is produced three times a year in all our major markets. In addition, we estimate which markets we will sell the semen 
in, as well as domestic and export prices. Bulls that have not yet entered our testing programme have a fair value equivalent 
to their acquisition and rearing costs.
Porcine – the fair values of porcine biological assets includes the animals we own entirely and our retained interest in the 
genetics of animals we have sold under royalty arrangements. The fair value of animals we own is calculated using the 
animals’ average live weights, plus a premium where we believe that their genetics make them saleable. We base the live 
weight value and the genetic premium on recent transaction prices we have achieved. The significant assumptions in 
determining fair values are the breeding animals’ expected life, the percentage of production animals that are saleable as 
breeding animals, and the expected sales prices. For our retained interest in the genetics of animals sold under royalty 
contracts, we base the initial fair value on the fair values we achieved in recent direct sales of similar animals, less the 
amount we received upfront for the carcass element. We then remeasure the fair value of our retained interest at each 
reporting date. The significant assumption in determining the fair value of the retained interest is the animals’ expected life.

INFORMATION
We value the pigs in our pure line herds, which are the repository of our proprietary genetics, as a single unit of account. 
We do this using a discounted cash flow model, applied to the herds’ future outputs at current prices. The significant 
assumptions we make are the number of future generations attributable to the current herds, the fair value prices we 
achieve on sales, the animals’ expected useful lifespan and productivity, and the discount rate.
Non-recognition of porcine multiplier contracts where no contractual interest is retained by the Group
To manage commercial risk, a very large part of our porcine business model involves selling pigs to farmers (‘multipliers’) 
who produce piglets on farms we neither manage nor control. We have the option, but not the obligation, to buy the 
offspring at slaughter market value plus a premium. Because the offspring have superior genetics, we can then sell them to 
other farmers at a premium.
We do not recognise the right to purchase offspring on the balance sheet, as we enter into the contracts and continue to 
hold them for the purpose of receiving non-financial items (the offspring), in accordance with our expected purchase 
requirements. This means the option is outside the scope of IAS 39. We do not recognise the offspring as biological assets 
under IAS 41, as we do not own or control them.
Property, plant and equipment
We state property, plant and equipment at cost, together with any directly attributable expenses of acquisition, or at their 
latest valuation, less depreciation and any impairment losses. Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment 
have different useful lives, we account for them separately.
We charge depreciation to the income statement on a straight-line basis, over the estimated useful lives of each part of an 
asset. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings 10 to 15 years
Leasehold buildings  over the term of the lease
Plant and equipment 3 to 20 years
Motor vehicles  3 to 5 years
We do not depreciate land and assets not available for use.
Trade and other receivables
We state trade and other receivables at their nominal amount less any impairment losses. If there is a material difference 
between the nominal amount and the present value, we state the trade or other receivable at its present value.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form an integral part of our cash management. We only include them in 
cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
We initially recognise interest-bearing loans and borrowings at their fair value, less attributable transaction costs. After this 
initial recognition, we state them at amortised cost and recognise any difference between the cost and redemption value in 
the income statement over the borrowings’ expected life, on an effective interest rate basis.
Provisions
We recognise a provision in the balance sheet when an event results in the Group having a current legal or constructive 
obligation, and it is probable that we will have to settle the obligation through an outflow of economic benefits. If the effect 
is material, we discount provisions to their present value.
Revenue
Revenue is the value of sales and royalties receivable from customers, net of trade discounts and value added tax.
The principal components of the Group’s revenue and their respective accounting treatments are:
• Revenue from the sale of bovine and porcine semen, porcine breeding animals and ancillary products, which we 
recognise when risks and rewards transfer to the customer. This is either when we ship to customers or on delivery, 
depending on the terms of sale.
• Royalties, which we recognise when receivable. We receive royalty payments from certain porcine customers based on 
key performance variables, such as the number of pigs born per litter, the number of litters born per sow and the 
average slaughter weight of the animals born.
• Revenue from consulting and other services, which represent the amounts we charged for services we provided during 
the year, including recoverable expenses but excluding value added tax. We recognise services provided but not yet 
billed as revenue, based on a fair value assessment of the work we have delivered and our contractual right to receive 
payment. Where unbilled revenue is contingent on a future event, we do not recognise any revenue until the event 
occurs. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Leases
We classify leases as finance leases whenever the lease terms transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to us. All other leases are operating leases.
We recognise the assets we hold under finance leases at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each of which we determine at the start of the lease. We include our corresponding liability in the balance 
sheet, as a finance lease obligation.
We apportion lease payments between finance charges and a reduction in our lease obligation, so we achieve a constant 
rate of interest on the remaining liability. We recognise finance charges directly in the income statement, unless they are 
directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case we capitalise them in accordance with our general policy on 
borrowing costs (see below).
For operating leases, we charge the rentals payable, and any incentives we receive to enter into an operating lease, to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Finance costs
We recognise interest income and interest payable in the income statement as they accrue. We recognise dividend income 
in the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established.
Qualifying assets are those that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale. 
Finance costs that are directly attributable to constructing a qualifying asset are added to the asset’s cost, until the asset is 
substantially ready for its intended use or sale.
We recognise other borrowing costs in the income statement in the period in which we incur them.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. We recognise tax in the income statement, unless:
• it relates to items we have recognised directly in equity, in which case we recognise it in equity; or
• it arises as a fair value adjustment in a business combination.
We provide for current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, at the amounts we expect to pay (or recover), 
using the tax rates and the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustments 
to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is tax we expect to pay or recover due to differences between the carrying amounts of our assets and 
liabilities in our financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in calculating our taxable profit. We account for 
deferred tax using the balance sheet liability method.
We generally recognise deferred tax liabilities for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets to the extent 
that we will probably have taxable profits to utilise deductible temporary differences against. We do not recognise these 
assets and liabilities if the temporary difference arises from:
• our initial recognition of goodwill; or
• our initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction (other than a business combination) that affects 
neither our taxable profit nor our accounting profit.
We recognise deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences arising on our investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where we can control the reversal of the temporary difference, and it is 
probable that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
We calculate deferred tax at the tax rates we expect to apply in the period when we settle the liability or realise the asset. 
We charge or credit deferred tax in the income statement, except when it relates to items we have charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Share-based payments
In accordance with IFRS 2, we recognise the fair value of share awards and options granted as an employee expense, with a 
corresponding increase in equity. We measure the fair value at the grant date and spread it over the vesting period of each 
option. We use a binomial valuation model to measure the fair value of options, and a Black-Scholes valuation model to 
measure the fair value of share awards. We adjust the amount we recognise as an expense, to reflect the estimated 
performance against non-market related conditions and the number of share awards and options that actually vest at the 
end of the vesting period.
Treasury shares
We include the transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group-sponsored Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust 
(‘QUEST’) in the Group Financial Statements. In particular, the trust’s purchases of the Company’s shares are deducted 
from shareholders’ funds until they vest unconditionally with employees.

Retirement benefit obligations
Defined contribution pension schemes
A number of our employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes. We charge contributions to the income 
statement as they become payable under the scheme rules. We show differences between the contributions payable and 
the amount we have paid as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet. The schemes’ assets are held separately 
from those of the Group.
Defined benefit pension schemes
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes for some of its employees. These schemes are closed to new 
members. We calculate our net obligation separately for each scheme, by estimating the amount of future benefit that 
employees have earned, in return for their service to date. We discount that benefit to determine its present value, and 
deduct the fair value of the plan’s assets (at bid price). The liability discount rate we use is the market yield at the balance 
sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds, with terms to maturity approximating our pension liabilities. Qualified actuaries 
perform the calculations, using the projected unit market method.
We recognise actuarial gains and losses directly into equity in the period in which they occur, through the Group Statement 
of Changes in Equity. Actuarial gains and losses include the difference between the expected and actual return on scheme 
assets and experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities.
We recognise pension costs evenly over the service lives of the employees concerned. We allocate any difference between 
the actuarial value of assets and the actuarial value of liabilities over the average remaining service lives of current employees.
The retirement benefit obligations referred to in note 28 include those relating to the Milk Pension defined benefit scheme. 
Genus and the other participating employers are jointly and severally liable for the scheme’s obligations. We account for 
our section of the scheme and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, and provide for any amounts we believe we will 
have to pay under our joint and several liability. The joint and several liability also means we have a contingent liability for 
the scheme’s obligations that we have not accounted for.
Under the joint and several liability, we initially recognise any changes in our share of orphan assets and liabilities in the 
income statement. After this initial recognition, any actuarial gains and losses in the orphan assets and liabilities are 
recognised directly into equity through the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, in the period in which they occur.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk, forward exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange 
risk and forward commodity contracts to manage commodity price risk.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts and forward commodity contracts are their quoted market price at the 
balance sheet date, which is the present value of the quoted forward price.
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as hedging the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, 
or a highly probable forecast transaction, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the instrument in equity, in 
the hedging reserve. We recognise any ineffective portion of the hedge immediately in the Group Income Statement.
If we hedge a forecast transaction that subsequently results in our recognising a financial asset or liability, we recycle the 
associated gains and losses that we had recognised in equity in the Group Income Statement. We do this in the same 
period or periods that the asset or liability affects the Group Income Statement, which are the periods when we recognise 
the interest income or expense.
If we expect a hedged forecast transaction to occur but the hedging instrument has expired, been sold, terminated or 
exercised, or we have revoked the designation of the hedge relationship, then the cumulative gain or loss at that point 
remains in equity and we recognise it in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If we no longer 
expect the hedged transaction to take place, we immediately recognise in the Group Income Statement the cumulative 
unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity.
Net investment hedges
Where we have designated a derivative financial instrument as hedging the variability of the net assets of an overseas 
subsidiary, which arises from the spot or forward exchange rate translation risk associated with the subsidiary’s functional 
currency, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the instrument directly in the hedging reserve. Any 
ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or we revoke designation of the hedge relationship, 
the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until we dispose of the investment it relates to.
We only apply net investment hedge accounting in the Group Financial Statements. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

New standards and interpretations
The following new standards and interpretation have been adopted in the current period: 
• ‘Improvements to IFRS 2010–2012 cycle’;
• ‘Improvements to IFRS 2011–2013 cycle’;
• IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’; and 
• Amendments to ‘Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’ (IAS 32), ’Investment Entities’ (IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and 
IAS 27), ‘Recoverable Amounts Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets’ (IAS 36), ’Novation of Derivatives and Continuation 
of Hedge Accounting’ (IAS 39), ‘Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions’ (IAS 19).
There has been no significant impact on the results or disclosures for the current period from the adoption of these new 
standards and interpretations.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
At the date of authorisation of these Group Financial Statements, the following standards and interpretations which have 
not been applied in preparing these Group Financial Statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had 
not yet been adopted by the EU):
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’;
• IFRS 14 ‘Regulatory Deferral Response’; and 
• IFRS 15 ’Revenue from Contracts with Customers’.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material 
impact on the financial statements of the Group, except as follows:
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which will introduce a number of changes in the presentation of financial instruments.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a 
detailed review has been completed.
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. The estimate and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are 
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Determination of the fair value of biological assets
Determining the fair values of our bovine and porcine biological assets requires significant judgement and assumptions.
Bovine: The key judgements are in respect of the forecast sales volumes, the expected unit prices, the animals’ useful 
lifespan and the discount rate we apply.
Porcine: The key judgements and assumptions are in respect of the animals’ useful lifespan, the proportion that go to 
slaughter, the mix of boars and gilts and, in the case of the animals in the pure line herds, the number of future generations 
attributable to the current herds, the fair value prices achieved on sales, the animals’ expected useful lifespan and 
productivity, and the discount rate we apply. See note 15.
Fair value of assets and liabilities on business combinations
The Group’s accounting policy on the acquisition of subsidiaries is to determine the net fair value of identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired with the fair value of any consideration in excess of this amount representing 
goodwill. In determining the fair values of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the use of significant 
judgement and assumptions with respect to estimated future cash flows and unprovided liabilities and commitments, 
particularly to tax, are often involved.
The determination of the useful life of intangible assets, particularly on those arising on acquisition, involves the exercise of 
management judgement.
Impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible assets
Determining whether goodwill, intangible and tangible assets are impaired requires us to consider any specific impairment 
indicators and to estimate the value in use of the cash-generating units to which we have allocated goodwill, intangible and 
tangible assets. The value in use calculation requires us to estimate the future cash flows arising from the cash-generating 
unit and the appropriate discount rate, in order to calculate present value. See note 14.

Recognition of deferred tax assets
In recognising income tax assets and liabilities, we estimate the likely decisions by tax authorities on transactions and 
events whose tax treatment is uncertain. In recognising deferred tax assets and liabilities, we also make judgements about 
our likely future taxable profits. When the final outcome of such matters, including the recognition of deferred tax assets or 
tax losses, is different or expected to be different from our previous assessments, we record a change to the carrying value 
of income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which we make the determination. See note 19.
Defined benefit pension scheme
Amounts recorded in the financial statements in respect of defined benefit pension schemes are also based on significant 
estimates and judgement. Details of the estimates and judgements we made in calculating these transactions are contained

Court for the Western District of Wisconsin alleging, among other matters, that ST: (i) have a monopoly in the processing of 
sexed bovine semen in the US; and (ii) unlawfully maintain this monopoly through anticompetitive contractual provisions 
and the repeated acquisition of exclusive patent rights related to semen processing. The legal action aims to remove these 
barriers and allow free and fair competition in the sexed bovine semen processing market (‘ABS Action’). On the same date, 
ABS also filed an Inter-Partes Review application (‘IPR’) challenging the validity of one of the ST’s group patents, US Patent 
No. 7,195,920 (the ‘’920 patent’) before the US Patent Office. Subsequently, ABS also filed IPRs challenging the validity of 
ST’s group patents US Patent No. 7,820,425 (the ‘’425 patent’) and US Patent No. 8,206,987 (the ‘’987 patent’).
On 7 November 2014, ST filed its Answer and Counterclaim to the ABS Action, denying any anticompetitive activities, and 
alleging, among other matters: (i) that ABS fraudulently induced ST to enter into the parties’ semen sorting agreement; (ii) 
that the Company and ABS repudiated and breached the agreement; and (iii) that the Company and ABS have infringed 
the ’987 patent.
On 13 January 2015 and 15 April 2015 respectively, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (‘PTAB’) ruled that ABS had 
demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on its assertion that relevant claims of the ’920 patent and the ’425 
patent were invalid, and ordered the institution of a trial.
On 31 March 2015, the Court in Wisconsin, among other matters: (i) denied ST’s motion to transfer the ABS Action to Texas, 
confirming that Wisconsin was the appropriate venue; (ii) denied ST’s partial motion to dismiss the ABS Action; and (iii) 
permitted XY Inc. (‘XY’), a subsidiary of ST, to join the litigation. Subsequently, a revised timetable for the ABS Action was 
established, and the trial is now scheduled to commence on 1 August 2016.
On 6 May 2015 XY filed an Answer and Counterclaim denying the anti-competitive activities and alleging, among other 
matters, infringement of the ’920 patent and the ’425 patent by both ABS and the Company. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

7. Exceptional items continued
On 29 April 2015, the PTAB ruled that ABS had not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on its assertion that 
relevant claims of the ’987 patent were invalid and declined to order the institution of a trial. ABS will now pursue the 
invalidity of this patent through the Wisconsin litigation.
On 12 June 2015, ST was given leave to amend its counterclaims to allege the infringement by ABS and the Company of US 
Patent No. 8,198,092 (the ‘’092 patent’).
This Wisconsin litigation continues through discovery, depositions and related preparations for trial. ABS intends to 
continue to vigorously pursue this litigation, in order to seek to enter and compete in this market using its own technology.

Impairment testing for cash-generating units (‘CGU’) containing goodwill
To test impairment, we allocate goodwill to our operating segments. These are the lowest level within the Group at which 
we monitor goodwill for internal management purposes.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each operating segment are as follows:
2015
 £m
2014 
£m
Genus PIC 49.2 47.1
Genus ABS 17.2 15.8
Genus Asia 7.5 7.0
73.9 69.9
We test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
We determine the recoverable amount of our CGUs by using value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these 
calculations relate to discount rates, growth rates, expected changes to selling prices, direct costs and the cost saving 
derived from the GSS project. We have estimated the discount rate using the Group’s weighted average cost of capital 
(‘WACC’). Our estimates of changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and our expectations 
of future changes in the market.
We prepare cash flows for the next five years derived from our most recent financial and strategic plans approved by 
management, and extrapolate cash flows beyond this period using estimated growth rates.
We have applied annual growth rates as outlined below to cash flows in the five year financial and strategic planning 
period.
A growth rate of 2.5% (2014: 2.5%) has been used to extrapolate cash flows beyond this period.
The post-tax WACC of 8.0% (2014: 8.0%) we applied to our cash flow projections equates to a pre-tax rate of 
approximately 10.8% (2014: 11.1%). We risk adjusted the discount rate on a country basis adding between nil and 16% to the 
WACC as appropriate.
Genus PIC and Genus ABS CGUs are deemed to be significant. The individual country assumptions used to determine value 
in use for these CGUs are:
Risk adjusted  
discount rate
Short-term  
growth rates (CAGR)
Long-term  
growth rates
2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014
Genus PIC 11%–26% 11%–14% 1%–14% 3%–15% 2.5% 2.5%
Genus ABS 11%–26% 11%–26% 3%–19% 3%–33% 2.5% 2.5%
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
We believe that no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any 
unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

Bovine biological assets include £6.0m (2014: £3.6m) representing the fair value of bulls owned by third parties but 
managed by the Group, net of expected future payments to such third parties and are therefore treated as assets held 
under finance leases.
There are no movements in the carrying value of the bovine biological assets in respect of sales or other changes during 
the year.
The current market determined post-tax rate used to discount expected future net cash flows from the sale of bull semen is 
the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. This has been assessed as 8.0% (2014: 8.0%).
Decreases due to harvest represent the semen extracted from the biological assets. Inventories of such semen are shown 
as biological asset harvest in note 20.
Porcine biological assets include £65.2m (2014: £49.5m) relating to the fair value of the retained interest in the genetics 
in respect of animals, other than parent gilts, to customers under royalty contracts. Total revenue in the period includes 
£94.6m (2014: £80.7m) in respect of these contracts, comprising £17.5m (2014: £13.6m) on initial transfer of animals to 
customers and £77.1m (2014: £67.1m) in respect of royalties received. Decreases attributable to sales during the period of 
£166.3m (2014: £153.2m) include £37.0m (2014: £32.8m) in respect of the reduction in fair value of the retained interest in 
the genetics of animals, other than parent gilts, transferred under royalty contracts. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

For pure line porcine herds, the net cash flows from the expected output of the herds are discounted at the Group’s 
required rate of return adjusted for the greater risk implicit in including output from future generations. This adjusted rate 
has been assessed as 11% (2014: 11.0%). The number of future generations which have been taken into account is seven 
(2014: seven) and their estimated useful lifespan is 1.3 years (2014: 1.4 years).
Included in increases due to purchases is the aggregate increase arising during the period on initial recognition of biological 
assets in respect of multiplier purchases £43.3m (2014: £34.1m).

Bovine
Long-term growth rate in volumes 3% 3% 1% decrease in the growth rate would result in 
approximately a £3.5m reduction in value.

approximately a £4.0m reduction in value.
Porcine
Weighted average cost of capital 8%–11% 8%–11% 1% increase in the discount rate would result in 
approximately a £1.8m reduction in value.
Significant increases/(decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower/(higher) fair value 
measurement. These assumptions vary significantly across different countries and species.

19. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses which are available for offset against future profits, with a 
potential tax benefit of £11.9m (2014: £12.4m). We have recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of £1.5m (2014: £1.0m) of 
these benefits as we expect these losses to be offset against future profits of the relevant jurisdictions in the near term. We 
have not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of the remaining £10.4m (2014: £11.4m), due to uncertainty about the 
availability of future taxable profits in the relevant jurisdictions.
We have not recognised deferred tax liabilities totalling £3.9m (2014: £4.2m) for the withholding tax and other taxes that 
would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain overseas subsidiaries. This is because we can control the timing 
and reversal of these differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities
We have offset deferred tax assets and liabilities above, to the extent that they arise in the same tax jurisdiction.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances:
2015 
£m 
2014 
£m 
Deferred tax assets (7.8) (4.8)
Deferred tax liabilities 105.2 90.3
97.4 85.5
UK deferred tax assets and liabilities are stated at 20%. The Government intends to enact further reductions in the main tax 
rate down to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and to 18% effective from 1 April 2020. As these tax rates were not 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, the relevant rate reductions are not yet reflected in these financial 
statements, as it is a non-adjusting event occurring after the reporting period.
We estimate that the future rate change to 18% would reduce our UK net deferred tax asset recognised at 30 June 2015 
from £7.5m to £6.7m. The actual impact will be dependent on our deferred tax position at that time.

Trade receivables
The average credit period our customers take on the sales of goods is 59 days (2014: 62 days). We do not charge interest 
on receivables for the first 30 days from the date of the invoice. We provide for all receivables based upon knowledge of 
the customer and historical experience, and estimate irrecoverable amounts by reference to past default experience.
No customer represents more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables (2014: nil).
At 30 June 2015 £45.0m (2014: £44.9m) of trade receivables were not yet due for payment.
Included in the Group’s trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £19.6m (2014: £18.7m) which are 
past due at the reporting date but which we have not provided for, as there has been no significant change in credit quality 
and we consider the amounts are recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The average 
age of these receivables is 45 days (2014: 60 days).

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. At 30 June

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, we consider any change in the receivable’s credit quality from the 
date we initially granted credit up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited, as our customer base is 
large and unrelated.
The impairment recognised is the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value 
of expected proceeds. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
Receivables denominated in currencies other than Sterling comprise £21.5m of receivables denominated in US Dollars 
(2014: £21.3m), £11.8m of receivables denominated in Euros (2014: £14.0m) and £26.3m of receivables denominated in other

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that Group entities can continue as a going concern, while maximising the return 
to stakeholders by optimising our debt and equity balance. The Group’s capital structure consists of debt, which includes 
the borrowings disclosed in note 26, cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 30.
Gearing ratio
The Group keeps its capital structure under review. The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows:

Externally imposed capital requirement
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted are disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements.
We have categorised financial instruments held at valuation into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the priority of 
the inputs to the valuation technique in accordance with IFRS 7. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs 
used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, we base the category level on the lowest priority level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety. We have estimated the fair values of 
the Group’s outstanding interest rate swaps by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market 
discount rates, representing Level 2 fair value measurements as defined by IFRS 7. We have not categorised any financial 
instruments as Level 1 or Level 3.

Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s Corporate Treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates our access to domestic and 
international financial markets, and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the Group’s operations, through 
internal risk reports that analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including 
currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
We seek to minimise the effects of these risks by hedging them using derivative financial instruments. Our use of financial 
derivatives is governed by policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign 
exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the 
investment of excess liquidity. The Board of Directors regularly reviews our compliance with policies and exposure limits. 
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative 
purposes.
Key financial risks and exposures are monitored through a monthly report to the Board of Directors, together with an 
annual Board review of corporate treasury matters.
Financial risk
The principal financial risks our activities expose us to are risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates 
and commodity prices. We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate, foreign currency 
risk and commodity price risk, including:
• forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sale of goods and purchase of 
supplies in foreign currencies;
• interest rate swaps, to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates; and
• forward commodity contracts, to hedge commodity price risk.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to movement in the US Dollar, Euro, Brazilian Real and Mexican Peso exchange rates.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in Sterling against these currencies. 10% 
is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents 
our assessment of a significant change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign 
currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency 
rates. It includes external loans, as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the loan is denominated in 
a currency other than the lender or borrower’s currency. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit when 
Sterling weakens against the relevant currency. A strengthening of Sterling against the relevant currency would produce an 
equal but opposite impact on profit, and the balances below would be negative. The impact on other equity is minimal, due 
to the net investment hedging in place.

Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, as Group entities borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. 
We manage this risk centrally, by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, using 
interest rate swaps. We regularly review our hedging activities, to align with our interest rate views and defined risk 
appetite, thereby ensuring we apply optimal hedging strategies to minimise the adverse impact of fluctuations in 
interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk 
management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
We have determined the sensitivity analyses below based on the Group’s exposure to interest rates for both derivatives 
and non-derivative instruments, at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, we prepared the analysis assuming 
the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 1.0% increase or decrease is used 
when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and is our assessment of a significant change in 
interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year 
ended 30 June 2015 would decrease or increase by £0.5m (2014: decrease/increase by £0.5m). This impact is smaller 
than would otherwise be the case due to the effects of fixed rate hedging.
Interest rate swap contracts
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest 
amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. These contracts enable us to mitigate the risk of changing 
interest rates on the cash flow exposures on the variable rate debt we hold. We determine the fair value of interest rate 
swaps at the reporting date by discounting the future cash flows, using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit 
risk inherent in the contract. This fair value is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding 
balances at the end of the financial year.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding 
as at the reporting date:

Two to five years 0.68 0.64 12.7 35.0 – –
The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis. The corresponding floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 3 month 
LIBOR. We settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
Interest rate swap contracts that exchange floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as 
cash flow hedges, to reduce our cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings. The interest rate 
swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and we recognise the amount deferred in equity in 
profit or loss, over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact profit or loss.

Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the 
Group. We have a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties. We regularly monitor our exposure and the 
credit ratings of our counterparties, and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved 
counterparties. Credit exposure on financial instruments is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and 
approved by the Board annually.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. 
We carry out ongoing credit evaluation on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for managing liquidity risk rests with the Board of Directors. We manage this risk by maintaining 
adequate reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the 
maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities, excluding 
trade payables and other creditors. We have drawn up these tables based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial 
liabilities, using the earliest date on which we can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal 
cash flows.

The Group has financing facilities with a total unused amount of £51.1m (2014: £55.4m) at the balance sheet date. We 
expect to meet our other obligations from operating cash flows and the proceeds of maturing financial assets. We expect 
to reduce the debt to equity ratio as borrowings decrease through repayment from operating cash flows.
The following table details the Group’s liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments. We have drawn up the table 
based on the undiscounted net cash outflows on derivative instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted

28. Retirement benefit obligations
The Group has a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes covering many of its employees. 
The principal funds are the Milk Pension Fund and Dalgety Pension Fund in the UK, which are defined benefit schemes. The 
assets of these funds are held separately from the assets of the Group and administered by trustees and managed 
professionally. These schemes are closed to new members.
The financial position of the defined benefit schemes as recorded in accordance with IAS 19 are aggregated for disclosure 
purposes. The liability split by principal scheme is set out below.

The Milk Pension Fund – Genus’s share 54.3 49.5
The Dalgety Pension Fund – –
Other retirement benefit obligations 8.8 8.7
Overall pension liability 63.1 58.2
Overall, we expect to pay £6.8m (2015: £6.1m) in contributions to defined benefit plans in the 2016 financial year.
The Milk Pension Fund (‘MPF’)
The MPF was previously operated by the Milk Marketing Board and was also open to staff working for Milk Marque Ltd (the 
principal employer now known as Community Foods Group Limited), National Milk Records plc, First Milk Ltd, hauliers 
associated to First Milk Ltd, Dairy Farmers of Britain Ltd (which went into receivership in June 2009) and Milk Link Ltd.
We have accounted for our section of the scheme and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, which together 
represent approximately 75% of the MPF (2014: 75%). Although the MPF is managed on a sectionalised basis, it is a ‘last 
man standing scheme’, which means that all participating employers are joint and severally liable for all of the fund’s 
liabilities.
The most recent actuarial triennial valuation of the MPF was at 31 March 2012. The valuation used the projected unit method 
(for future service, a control period of three years was used) and was carried out by qualified actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2012 valuation were that investment returns on existing assets would be 
6.4% per annum before retirement and 4.0% per annum after retirement, and that pensions in payment would increase by 
3.4% per annum.
At 31 March 2012 the market value of the fund’s assets was £312m. This represented approximately 69% of the value of the 
uninsured liabilities which were £453m at 31 March 2012, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The deficit in the fund as a whole, by reference to the 31 March 2012 valuation, was £141m (of which Genus’s notional share 
was £106m). This shortfall is being addressed by additional contributions from the participating employers and the exit 
payment of £31m made in September 2012 by two employers. Under the funding agreement, Genus has agreed to make 
deficit repair contributions of between £4.5m and £6.4m per annum between 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2016, and rising 
thereafter by 3.4% per annum for a further nine years until 31 March 2026.
With effect from 30 June 2013, Genus’s active members ceased accruing benefits in the fund and became deferred pensioners.  Genus plc Annual Report 2015

28. Retirement benefit obligations continued
Dalgety Pension Fund (‘DPF’)
The most recent actuarial valuation of the DPF was at 31 March 2012. The valuation of the scheme used the projected unit 
method and was carried out by professionally qualified actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2012 valuation were that investment returns on existing assets would be 
5.2% per annum before retirement and 3.3% per annum after retirement and that the annual increase in pensions in 
payment would be 3.5% per annum.
The market value of the available assets at 31 March 2012 was £21.3m. The value of those assets represents approximately 
99% of the value of the uninsured liabilities which were £21.6m at 31 March 2012. Under the funding agreement, the 
Company will not have to make deficit repair contributions.
The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by an independent actuary based on accurate calculations 
carried out as at 31 March 2012 updated to 30 June 2015.
There is an £13.8m reserve held by the Trustees of DPF against future unknown liabilities materialising (‘Restricted Fund’). 
As the economic benefit to Genus of this amount is not certain, it is treated as a contingent asset.
Other defined benefit scheme in deficit
The Group operates a closed defined benefit scheme for a small number of former employees of the National Pig 
Development Company Limited. The total market value of scheme assets and liabilities at 30 June 2015 under the 
provisions of IAS 19 were £5.0m (2014: £4.5m) and £6.0m (2014: £5.9m), respectively.
Other unfunded schemes
When the Group acquired Sygen International plc, it also acquired three unfunded defined benefit schemes and an 
unfunded retirement health benefit plan, which it now operates for the benefit of the previous group’s senior employees 
and executives.
The scheme liabilities for the three unfunded defined benefit schemes amount to £6.7m (2014: £6.1m) based on IAS 19’s 
methods and assumptions. This amount is included within pension liabilities in the Group’s balance sheet. Interest on 
pension scheme liabilities amounted to £0.2m (2014: £0.3m).
The principal assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities were that the discount rate would be 3.8% (2014: 4.2%) 
and that inflation and pension payment increases would be 3.1% per annum (2014: 3.2%).
The scheme liabilities for the unfunded retirement health benefit plan amount to £1.1m (2014: £1.2m), based on IAS 19’s 
methods and assumptions. This amount is included within retirement benefit obligations in the Group’s balance sheet. 
Interest on plan liabilities amounted to £0.1m (2014: £0.1m).
The principal assumptions used to calculate the plan liabilities were that the discount rate would be 3.8% (2014: 4.2%) and 
that the long-term rate of medical expense inflation would be 7.1% (2014: 7.2%).

Actuarial assumptions and sensitivity analysis
Principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date (expressed as weighted averages):
2015 2014
Discount rate 3.8% 4.2%
Expected return on plan assets 6.3% 6.6%
Medical cost trend rate 7.1% 7.2%
Future pension increases and inflation 3.1% 3.2%
The mortality assumptions used are consistent with those recommended by the schemes’ actuaries and reflect the latest 
available tables, adjusted for the experience of the scheme where appropriate. For 2015 and 2014, the mortality tables used 
are 90% of the SN1A tables, with birth year and 2011 CMI projections, with mortality rates increased by 25% at all ages.
The following table shows the assumptions used for all schemes and illustrates the life expectancy of an average member 
retiring at age 65 at the balance sheet date and a member reaching age 65 in 20 years’ time.

Female 25.9 25.8
Retiring at age 65 in 20 years’ time:
Male 25.2 25.1
Female 27.8 27.7
The overall expected long-term rate of return on assets is 6.3% (2014: 6.6%). The expected long-term rate of return is based 
on the portfolio as a whole and not on the sum of the returns on individual asset categories. The return is based exclusively 
on historical returns, without adjustments.
Duration of benefit obligations
The weighted average duration of the defined benefits obligations at 30 June 2015 is 17.5 years (2014: 17.5 years).
Sensitivity analysis
Measurement of the Group’s defined benefit obligation is sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions. The sensitivity 
analysis below shows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in isolation, result in 
an increase or decrease in the present value of the defined benefits obligation as at 30 June 2015.

The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefits obligation as it is unlikely that 
changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another.
The sensitivities assume the fund’s assets remain unchanged, however in practice changes in interest rates and inflation will 
also affect the value of the fund’s assets. The fund’s investment strategy aims to hold matching assets which should move 
broadly in line with the liabilities of the funds so as to protect partially against changes in interest rates and inflation.
In presenting this sensitivity analysis, the information has been prepared using the same method as adopted when 
adjusting results of the latest funding valuation to the balance sheet date. This is the same approach as has been adopted 
in previous periods.

Share awards
There are 1,034,287 conditional share awards outstanding at 30 June 2015. These conditional shares were awarded to 
Executive Directors and senior management on 10 September 2010, 7 December 2012, 28 February 2013, 26 September 
2013 and 14 March 2014, under the 2004 Performance Share Plan and 20 November 2014, under the new 2014 
Performance Share Plan. In accordance with the plan’s terms, participants have received a conditional annual award of 
shares or nil cost option awards which will normally vest after three years, with the proportion of the award vesting 
depending on growth in the Group’s adjusted earnings per share. Further details of the plan’s performance conditions are 
given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
In the year to 30 June 2015, awards were granted on 20 November 2014, with an aggregate fair value of £4,968,000. The

accordance with the award’s terms, participants have received a conditional annual bonus award of shares or nil cost option 
awards, which will normally vest between one and three years, providing the participant is employed by the Group at that 
time.

No share options were granted during the period.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is based on the fair value of share options granted. 
We measure this using a binomial model, with the following inputs:
Assumptions applied in valuation models at grant date:
2015 2014
Exercise price of options granted in the year (nil for awards) n/a 1,413p
Expected volatility (weighted average volatility) n/a 32%
Option life (expected weighted average life) n/a 6.5 years
Expected dividends n/a 1.10%
Risk-free interest rate (based on Government bonds) n/a 1.80%
We determined expected volatility by calculating the historical volatility of the estimated fair value of the Company’s share 
price over the previous three years. We have adjusted the option life used in the model, based on our best estimate of the 
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

37. Acquisition of subsidiaries 
On 1 September 2014 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Birchwood Genetics, Inc. a porcine distribution 
company with three sites located in Ohio, Michigan and Kentucky in North America. Birchwood has been a PIC partner for 
over 14 years. It focuses on providing male PIC genetics in a ‘service-and-product package’ that generates consistent, 
valuable results helping to build and sustain the success of the mid- and small-sized customers it serves. This acquisition 
helps secure PIC’s long-term distribution of proprietary boar genetics to customers in North America.
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below.

Net cash outflow arising on acquisition of subsidiary 5.8
The goodwill of £3.1m arising from the acquisition consists largely of future growth and synergies expected from combining 
the acquired operations with existing Genus operations. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for 
income tax purposes.
The fair value of the financial assets includes trade receivables with a fair value of £0.5m and a gross contractual value of 
£0.7m. The best estimate at acquisition date of the cash flows unlikely to be collected is £0.2m.
Acquisition and integration related costs included within exceptional items amount to £0.3m.
Birchwood Genetics, Inc. contributed £7.8m revenue and £1.0m profit to the Group for the period between date of 
acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of Birchwood Genetics, Inc. had been completed on the first day of the financial period, Group revenues 
and Group profit would have been £9.0m and £1.2m, respectively.
On 31 March 2015 the Group acquired 51% of the share capital of In Vitro Brasil S.A. (‘IVB’) for a total investment 
consideration of BRL 20m (£4.5m). Genus also expects to acquire the remaining 49% of IVB’s share capital in the first half 
of 2018 by exercising a call option. The consideration is subject to certain performance conditions and is to be capped at a 
maximum of BRL 49m (£10.0m). The selling shareholders also have a matching put option.
IVB is a leading biotechnology company focused on the production of bovine embryos through in-vitro fertilisation and the 
provision of associated services. IVB is based in Brazil and also operates in a number of countries including the US, 
Colombia and Uruguay.

37. Acquisition of subsidiaries continued
The goodwill of £2.2m arising from the acquisition consists largely of future growth and synergies expected from 
combining the acquired operations with existing Genus operations. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be 
deductible for income tax purposes.
The fair value of the financial assets includes trade receivables with a fair value of £1.1m and a gross contractual value of 
£1.3m. The best estimate at acquisition date of the cash flows unlikely to be collected is £0.2m.
Acquisition and integration related costs included within exceptional items amount to £0.9m.
IVB contributed £2.3m revenue and £0.8m profit after tax to the Group for the period between date of acquisition and the 
balance sheet date, which includes £0.5m attributable to non-controlling interest.
Due to the transaction’s nature, it is impracticable to obtain the information required to disclose what the Group’s revenues 
and profit would have been, if the acquisition of IVB had been completed on the first day of the financial period.

Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2015
39. Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
We have prepared these Financial Statements under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006 and applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. We have applied the accounting policies consistently 
throughout the current and prior year.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
The Company’s financial statements are included in the Genus plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
30 June 2015. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and 
loss account. The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the 
terms of FRS 1 (revised 1996) ‘Cash Flow Statements’. The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 ‘Related Party 
Disclosures’ from disclosing transactions with other members of the Genus Group.
Fixed assets and depreciation
We state fixed assets at cost, together with any incidental acquisition expenses, or at their latest valuation, less depreciation 
and any provision for impairment. We calculate depreciation on a straight-line basis, to write the assets down to their 
estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives. The rates of annual depreciation on tangible fixed assets are as 
follows:
Leasehold land and buildings period of lease
Equipment   3 to 20 years
We review the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments
We state fixed assets investments at cost less provision for impairment.
Pensions
A number of our employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes. We charge contributions to profit and 
loss as they become payable under the schemes’ rules. We show differences between the contributions payable and the 
amounts actually paid as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet. The schemes’ assets are held separately from 
those of the Company.
Certain current and former employees of the Company are members of one of the Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes, further details of which are given in note 28 of the Group Financial Statements. The schemes are all multi-
employer defined benefit schemes, whose assets and liabilities are held independently from the Group. The Company is 
unable to identify its share of the scheme’s underlying assets and liabilities, and therefore accounts for the scheme as if it 
were a defined contribution scheme.
Taxation
We provide for current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, at the amounts we expect to pay or recover, using 
the tax rates and the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
We recognise deferred taxation in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in future or a right to pay less tax in 
future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
We only recognise deferred taxation assets if we consider it more likely than not that we will have suitable profits from 
which we can deduct the future reversal of the underlying timing differences. Timing differences are differences arising 
between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements, and which are capable of 
reversing in one or more subsequent periods.
We only recognise deferred taxation in respect of the future remittance of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and 
associates to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
We measure deferred taxation on a non-discounted basis, at the tax rates we expect to apply in the periods in which we 
expect the timing differences to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date.
Foreign currencies
We record transactions in foreign currencies at the rate ruling at the transaction date or at the contracted rate, if the 
transaction is covered by a forward foreign currency contract. We retranslate monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies at the prevailing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract 
rate. All differences are taken to the profit and loss account. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

INFORMATION
Treasury shares
The Company has adopted UITF Abstract 38, ‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’, which requires us to recognise the assets and 
liabilities associated with the Company’s investment in its own shares in the Company’s financial statements, where there is 
de facto control of the assets and liabilities.
The Company’s own shares held by a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust remain deducted from shareholders’ 
funds until they vest unconditionally with employees.
Employee share schemes
The Company’s Executive Directors and Chief Operating Officers receive part of their remuneration in the form of share 
awards, which vest upon meeting performance criteria over a three year period.
We measure the cost of these awards by reference to the shares’ fair value at the award date. At the end of each financial 
reporting period, we estimate the extent to which the performance criteria will be met at the end of three years, and record 
an appropriate charge in the profit and loss account, together with a corresponding credit to profit and loss reserves. 
Changes in estimates of the number of shares vesting may result in charges or credits to the profit and loss account in 
subsequent periods.
Share-based payments
We have implemented the generally accepted accounting principle for accounting for share-based payments with 
subsidiary undertakings under UITF 44, whereby the Company has granted rights to its shares to employees of its 
subsidiary undertakings under an equity-settled arrangement, and the subsidiaries have not reimbursed the Company for 
these rights. Under this arrangement, the Company treats the share-based payment recognised in the subsidiary’s 
accounts as a cost of investment in the subsidiary and credits equity with an equal amount.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Our activities expose us primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
We use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk. We also use forward foreign currency contracts, implemented 
through a medium-term US Dollar cross currency borrowing and related interest rate swap, to hedge exposure to 
translation risk associated with US Dollar net assets of subsidiary entities. Forward foreign currency contracts do not 
qualify for hedge accounting in the Parent Company Financial Statements, as the hedged item is not in its balance sheet.
Our use of financial derivative instruments is governed by the Group’s policies, which are approved by the Board of 
Directors. The notes to the Group Financial Statements include information about the Group’s financial risks and their 
management, and its use of financial instruments and their impact on the Group’s risk profile, performance and financial 
condition.
The fair value of the US Dollar and interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate 
the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap 
counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, which is the present 
value of the quoted forward price.
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as hedging the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or 
liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the instrument 
directly in the hedging reserve. We recognise any ineffective portion of the hedge immediately in the profit and loss 
account.
If we hedge a forecast transaction that subsequently results in our recognising a financial asset or liability, then we 
reclassify the associated gains and losses that we had recognised directly in equity into profit or loss. We do this in the 
same period or periods that the asset or liability affects profit or loss, which are the periods when we recognise the interest 
income or expense.
If we expect a hedged forecast transaction to occur but the hedging instrument has expired, been sold, terminated or 
exercised, or we have revoked the designation of the hedge relationship, then the cumulative gain or loss at that point 
remains in equity and we recognise it in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If we no longer 
expect the hedged transaction to occur, we immediately recognise in the profit and loss account the cumulative unrealised 
gain or loss recognised in equity.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or we revoke designation of the hedge relationship, 
the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until we dispose of the investment it relates to.
We treat derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts as separate derivatives, when their 
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair 
value, with unrealised gains and losses reported in the profit and loss account. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

Debt
We initially state debt at the amount of the net proceeds, after deducting issue costs. The carrying amount is increased by 
the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.
Finance costs
We charge the finance costs of debt to the profit and loss account over the debt term, at a constant rate on the carrying 
value of the debt to which they relate.

To consider and if thought fit, to pass the following resolutions, of which numbers 1 to 12 will be proposed as ordinary 
resolutions and numbers 13 to 15 as special resolutions.

Company’s Annual Report 2015.
3. To declare and approve a final dividend of 13.4 pence per ordinary share, payable on 4 December 2015 to shareholders

the Directors to agree the auditor’s remuneration. 
12. That the Directors be generally and unconditionally authorised in accordance with section 551 of the Companies Act 
2006 (the ‘Act’) to allot shares in the Company up to a maximum aggregate nominal amount of £1,500,240.40 being 
15,002,404 ordinary shares of 10 pence each (‘Ordinary Shares’), representing 24.6% of the issued share capital of the 
Company as at 6 October 2015 (being the latest practicable date before publication of this Notice), such authority to 
expire on the conclusion of the Company’s Annual General Meeting next following or, if earlier, the close of business on 
the day which is 15 months after the date on which this resolution is passed but so that the Company may, before the 
expiry of such period, make an offer or agreement which would or might require shares to be allotted after such expiry 
and the Directors may allot shares in pursuance of such an offer or agreement as if the authority conferred hereby had 
not expired. 
13. That subject to and conditional on the passing of resolution 12, the Directors be empowered, pursuant to section 570 
and section 573 of the Act, to allot equity securities (within the meaning of sections 560 of the Act) for cash pursuant to 
the authority conferred by resolution 12 as if section 561(1) of the Act did not apply to any such allotment, provided that 
this power shall be limited to the allotment of equity securities:
13.1 in connection with an offer of such securities by way of rights issue; and 
13.2 otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraph 13.1 above up to an aggregate nominal amount of £609,869.90 being 
6,098,699 Ordinary Shares representing not more than 10% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 
6 October 2015 (being the latest practicable date before publication of this Notice), 
Notice of Annual General Meeting Genus plc Annual Report 2015

 and shall expire on the conclusion of the Company’s Annual General Meeting next following or, if earlier, the close of 
business on the day which is 15 months after the date on which this resolution is passed, save that the Company may, 
before such expiry, make an offer or agreement which would or might require equity securities to be allotted after such 
expiry and the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of any such offer or agreement as if the power had not 
expired. This power applies in relation to a sale of treasury shares as if all references in this resolution to an allotment 
included any such sale and in the first paragraph of this resolution the words “pursuant to the authority conferred by 
resolution 12” were omitted in relation to such a sale.
 In this resolution, ‘rights issue’ means an offer of equity securities open for acceptance for a period fixed by the Directors 
to holders on the register on a fixed record date in proportion as nearly as may be to their respective holdings, but 
subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the Directors may deem necessary or expedient to deal with any 
fractional entitlements or legal or practical difficulties under the laws of, or the requirement of any recognised regulatory 
body or any stock exchange in, any territory or any other matter.
14. That subject to and in accordance with article 9 of the Company’s Articles of Association, the Company be generally and 
unconditionally authorised to make market purchases (within the meaning of section 693(4) of the Act) of Ordinary 
Shares on such terms as the Directors think fit provided that: 
14.1 the maximum aggregate number of Ordinary Shares hereby authorised to be purchased is 6,098,699 (representing 
10% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 6 October 2015, being the latest practicable date before 
publication of this Notice); 
14.2 the minimum price, exclusive of any expenses, which may be paid for an Ordinary Share is 10 pence; 
14.3 the maximum price, exclusive of any expenses, which may be paid for an Ordinary Share is an amount equal to 
the higher of: (a) 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for an Ordinary Share, as derived from the 
London Stock Exchange Daily Official List, for the five business days immediately before the day on which such 
share is contracted to be purchased; and (b) the amount stipulated by Article 5(1) of the Buy-back and Stabilisation 
Regulation 2003; and 
14.4 the authority conferred by this resolution shall expire on the conclusion of the Company’s Annual General Meeting 
next following or 15 months after the date of its passing (whichever occurs first), except that the Company may, 
before such expiry, enter into a contract for the purchase of Ordinary Shares which will or may be completed by 
or executed wholly or partly after the expiration of this authority. 
15. That a General Meeting, other than an Annual General Meeting, may be called on not less than 14 clear days’ notice and 
that such authority shall expire on the conclusion of the Company’s Annual General Meeting next following. 
The Directors consider that all the proposals to be considered at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the 
Company and its members as a whole and are most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its 
members as a whole. The Directors unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of all the proposed resolutions as they 
intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings.

Explanatory Notes 
This section contains an explanation of each of the resolutions to be put to the Annual General Meeting. Resolutions 1 to 12 
are ordinary resolutions requiring the approval of a simple majority of shareholders present (in person or by proxy) and 
voting at the Annual General Meeting. Resolutions 13 to 15 are special resolutions requiring the approval of 75% of 
shareholders present (in person or by proxy) and voting at the Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 1 – To Receive the Annual Report and Accounts 
Shareholders are invited to approve the Annual Report and Accounts.
Resolution 2 – Approval of the Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Committee and the Annual Report on 
Remuneration 
Under new legislation that came into force in the UK on 1 October 2013, the Company is required to offer an annual 
advisory vote on the implementation of the Company’s existing remuneration policy in terms of the payments and 
share awards made to Directors during the year (the Annual Statement by the Chairman and the Annual Report on 
Remuneration) and a separate binding vote on the Company’s forward looking remuneration policy (the ‘Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy’) at least once every three years, or earlier if a change is made to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, 
or the advisory vote is not passed by shareholders.
Resolution 2 seeks shareholder approval for the Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and 
the Annual Report on Remuneration as set out on pages 64 to 65 and 68 to 78 respectively of the Company’s Annual 
Report 2015.
Shareholder approval for the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report, a summary of which is set out on pages 79 to 81 of the 
Company’s Annual Report 2015 for information purposes only, was given at the Company’s 2014 Annual General Meeting. 
As there are no proposed changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy this year, there will be no resolution at this year’s 
Annual General Meeting seeking approval of such Policy. 
Resolution 3 – Final Dividend
Final dividends must be approved by shareholders but must not exceed the amount recommended by Directors. If the 
meeting approves the final dividend it will be paid out in accordance with resolution 3.
Resolutions 4 to 10 – Re-election of Directors
In accordance with provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors of the Company are required to offer 
themselves for annual re-election. Biographies of all of the current Directors can be found on page 51 of the Company’s 
Annual Report 2015.
Resolution 11 – Appointment of Auditor and Auditor’s Remuneration
The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are presented, to hold office 
until the end of the next such meeting. Following the conclusion of an external audit tender carried out in compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code in the year ended 30 June 2015, this resolution is recommended by the Audit 
Committee and proposes the reappointment of the Company’s existing auditor, Deloitte LLP, and follows good practice in 
giving authority to the Audit Committee to agree its remuneration.
Resolution 12 – Authority to Allot Shares
Resolution 12 is proposed as an ordinary resolution and seeks the approval of shareholders, in accordance with section 551 
of the Act, to authorise the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares for a period as stated in resolution 12. The Directors have no 
current intention to exercise this authority and intend to comply with the guidance issued by the Investment Management 
Association. However, if the Directors do exercise this authority, the Directors intend to follow emerging best practice as 
regards to its use. As at the date of this Notice, no shares are held by the Company in treasury.
Resolution 13 – Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights 
Resolution 13, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks the approval of shareholders, pursuant to the provisions 
of section 570 of the Act, to waive the statutory pre-emption rights applicable to the allotment of equity securities for cash. 
The Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles were revised in March 2015 to allow the authority for an issue of shares 
for cash otherwise than in connection with a pre-emptive offer to be increased from 5% to 10% of the Company’s issued 
share capital, provided that the Company confirms that it intends to use the additional 5% authority only in connection with 
an acquisition or specified capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the issue or which has taken 
place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue (a ‘Relevant Acquisition or 
Specified Capital Investment’). The Board intends to adhere to the provisions in the revised Pre-Emption Group’s Statement 
of Principles and to not allot shares for cash on a non pre-emptive basis pursuant to the authority in Resolution 13: (i) in 
excess of an amount equal to 5% of the total issued ordinary share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares); or 
(ii) in excess of an amount equal to 7.5% of the total issued ordinary share capital of the Company (excluding treasury 
shares) within a rolling three-year period, without prior consultation with shareholders, in each case other than in 
connection with a Relevant Acquisition or Specified Capital Investment. The Directors’ existing authority expires at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.  Genus plc Annual Report 2015

Resolution 14 – Authority to Purchase Own Shares 
Resolution 14, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks authority for the Company to purchase up to 10% of its 
Ordinary Shares at, or between, the minimum and maximum prices specified in this resolution. This power would be used 
only after careful consideration by the Directors, having taken into account market conditions prevailing at that time, the 
investment needs of the Company, its opportunities for expansion and its overall financial position. The Directors would 
exercise the authority to purchase Ordinary Shares only if they considered it to be in the best interests of shareholders as 
a whole and if the purchase could be reasonably expected to result in an increase in earnings per share.
Under the Act, the Company is allowed to hold its own shares in treasury following buyback, instead of cancelling them 
as previously required. Such shares may be resold for cash or used to satisfy share options and share awards under the 
Company’s share incentive schemes but all rights attaching to them, including voting rights and any right to receive 
dividends, are suspended whilst they are held in treasury. If the Directors exercise the authority conferred by resolution 14, 
the Company will have the option of holding repurchased shares in treasury. As at the date of this Notice, no shares are 
held by the Company in treasury. 
At 6 October 2015, options were outstanding to subscribe for 1,531,888 Ordinary Shares, representing 2.5% of the issued 
share capital at that date. If the full authority to purchase such shares (existing and sought) was exercised, they would 
represent 2.8% of the Company’s issued share capital as at that date (assuming there have been no other changes to issued 
share capital in the meantime). The authority sought at the Annual General Meeting will expire at the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting next following, or 15 months from the date of this resolution (whichever is earlier).
Resolution 15 – Notice Period for General Meetings 
Resolution 15, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks the approval of shareholders to reduce to 14 clear days 
the notice period required for a general meeting. Changes made to the Act by the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) 
Regulations 2009 increased the notice period required for general meetings (other than Annual General Meetings) to 21 
days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which cannot however be less than 14 clear days. Annual General 
Meetings will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice. It is intended that the shorter notice period would not be 
used as a matter of routine for general meetings but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and 
is thought to be in the interests of the shareholders as a whole. The Company also acknowledges the new requirements 
in the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code and confirms that it would not call a meeting on less than 14 working days’ 
notice, except in exceptional circumstances. If given, the approval will be effective until the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting next following.

General Notes
This Notice is being sent to all members and to any person nominated by a member of the Company under section 146 of 
the Act to enjoy information rights. Information regarding the Annual General Meeting, including the information required 
by section 311A of the Act, is available from www.genusplc.com.
Members will find an attendance card and a form of proxy enclosed with this notice. If you are attending the Annual 
General Meeting, you should bring the attendance card with you. Only holders of Ordinary Shares, or their duly appointed 
representatives, are entitled to attend, vote and speak at the Annual General Meeting. Any member so entitled may appoint 
one or more proxies to attend, speak and to vote instead of him or her. A proxy need not be a member of the Company but 
must attend the Annual General Meeting to represent you. Details of how to appoint one or more proxies are set out in the 
notes to the proxy form. A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights 
attached to different shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. A vote 
withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the 
resolution. If no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will 
vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the Annual General 
Meeting.
To be valid, a duly executed form of proxy for use at the Annual General Meeting together, if appropriate, with the power 
of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or a duly certified copy of such power or authority must 
be deposited at the offices of Equiniti Registrars, Freepost RTHJ-CLLL -KBKU, Equiniti, Aspect House, Spencer Road, 
LANCING, BN99 8LU at least 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the Annual General Meeting or any 
adjournment thereof. Alternatively, proxies may be appointed by having an appropriate CREST message transmitted, 
if you are a user of the CREST system (further details are below). In the case of a member which is a company, the proxy 
form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for 
the company.
Completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude shareholders from attending the Annual General Meeting and 
voting in person if they wish to do so.
The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who 
have been nominated to receive communications from the Company in accordance with section 146 of the Act (‘nominated 
persons’). Nominated persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered member who hold shares on their 
behalf to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively, if nominated persons do not have 
such a right, or do not wish to exercise it, they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the person 
holding the shares as to the exercise of voting rights.
Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the time by which a person must be entered 
on the register of members of the Company in order to have the right to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting 
is 6.00pm on 17 November 2015 (or if the Annual General Meeting is adjourned, members on the register of members 
not later than 6.00pm on the day that is two working days prior to the reconvened Annual General Meeting). Changes to 
entries on the register of members after the relevant time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to 
attend or vote at the Annual General Meeting.
Copies of contracts of service and letters of appointment between the Directors and the Company will be available for 
inspection at the Registered Office of the Company during normal business hours until the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting, and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes prior to the Annual General Meeting 
until its conclusion.
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do 
so for this Annual General Meeting to be held on 19 November 2015 at 11.00am and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the 
procedures described in the CREST Manual found on the Euroclear website www.euroclear.com. CREST Personal Members 
or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should 
refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. 
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message 
(a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited’s 
specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The 
message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given to 
a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA19) 
by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the Notice of Annual General Meeting. For this purpose, 
the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST 
Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner 
prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be 
communicated to the appointee through other means. Genus plc Annual Report 2015

CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK 
and Ireland Limited do not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings 
and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST 
member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed 
a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall 
be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this 
connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in 
particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, as amended.
Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all 
of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
As at 6 October 2015 (being the latest practicable date before publication of this Notice), the Company’s issued share 
capital comprised 60,986,996 Ordinary Shares of 10 pence each. As at the date of this Notice, no shares are held by the 
Company in treasury. Each Ordinary Share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, 
therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company as at 6 October 2015 is 60,986,996. The Company’s website, 
referred to above, will include information on the number of shares and voting rights.
Under section 319A of the Act, the Company must answer any question a member asks relating to the business being 
dealt with at the Annual General Meeting unless answering the question would interfere unduly with the preparation for 
the Annual General Meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information; the answer has already been given on a 
website in the form of an answer to a question; or it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of 
the Annual General Meeting that the question be answered.
Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to 
require the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s 
Accounts (including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General 
Meeting; or (ii) any circumstances connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous 
meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Act. The Company may not 
require the members requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of 
the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the Act, it must forward 
the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. 
The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes any statement that the Company has been 
required under section 527 of the Act to publish on a website.
In order for the voting preferences of all shareholders including those who cannot attend the meeting but who validly 
appoint a proxy, to be taken into account, a poll will be conducted on all resolutions at the Annual General Meeting this 
year. Each shareholder and proxy present at the meeting will be invited to complete a poll card indicating how they wish 
to cast their votes in respect of each resolution. The results of the voting will be posted on the Company’s website after 
the meeting. Except as provided above, members who have general queries about the Annual General Meeting should call 
Equiniti registrars on 0871 384 2290. Calls to this number cost 10 pence per minute plus your phone company’s access 
charge. Lines open 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday (excluding UK public holidays). If calling from overseas, please call 
the Equiniti overseas helpline number of +44 121 415 7047. No other methods of communication will be accepted. You may 
not use any electronic address provided either in this Notice of Annual General Meeting, or any related documents 
(including the proxy form) to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.

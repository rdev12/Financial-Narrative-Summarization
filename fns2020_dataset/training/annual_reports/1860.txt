CHAIRMAN’S 
ANNUAL REPORT 
2004 STATEMENT 
The recovery experienced in the second half of 2003 continued 
into 2004 with demand strong in both our businesses. 
Clearly, we have been affected by the weaker US dollar on 
our translated US profits. Excluding that impact, our earnings 
grew at 5 per cent. Since 2001 our underlying profit before tax, 
in US dollar terms, have grown by 33 per cent, demonstrating 
the good inherent growth characteristics of our businesses. 
Financial Results 
In 2004, reported turnover for the Group on continuing 
operations was at £1.37 billion, £52 million higher than in 
2003, after an adverse currency translation impact of £96 
million. On a constant currency basis, turnover increased 
by 12 per cent. 
Underlying pre-tax profits at £128 million were £2 million 
less than last year after a negative currency impact of £8 
million and higher raw material input prices of £8 million. 
Statutory profit before tax was £73 million 
(2003: £55 million). 
Adjusted earnings per share (before goodwill 
amortisation and exceptional items) were 19.9 pence 
(2003: 19.7 pence). 
Acquisitions 
During the year, the Group continued to enhance its 
geographic presence and market position with nine strategic 
acquisitions for a total investment of £98 million covering 
each of our business sectors. As most of these occurred in 
the second half of the year, the benefits of their contribution 
to the Group will be seen primarily in 2005. 
Dividends 
Following the interim dividend of 3.35 pence paid on 
5 November 2004, the Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 7.95 pence (2003: 7.6 pence) payable on 20 May 2005 to 
shareholders on the register at 15 April 2005. This will make 
total dividends for 2004 of 11.3 pence (2003: 10.8 pence). 
Board and People 
Irv Yoskowitz stepped down in March after nine years as a 
non-executive director and there were no other changes at 
Board level during 2004. The Group has appointed Michael 
Harper to the Board as a non-executive director with effect 
from 23 February 2005. He is currently Chief Executive of 
Kidde plc. On the same date we also announced that Ross 
McMillan was stepping down from the Board after nearly 
four years with the Group. We thank him for his contribution 
to the business over this time. 
As always our success as a Group is dependent on the 
efforts and quality of all our people. The Board would like 
to thank everyone who works for the Group for their valued 
contribution to our progress. 
Corporate Governance 
BBA has always supported the key principles underlying good 
corporate governance. I am pleased to be able to say that the 
Company is substantially compliant with the new Combined 
Code which applied to BBA for the first time during the year . 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
We believe that a positive attitude to social responsibility 
is essential and during the year we undertook a number 
of initiatives to broaden the reach of corporate social 
responsibility within BBA. This included the issue of an 
enhanced policy on CSR and Business Ethics together with 
awareness communications and training. During the year 
we published on our website our third Annual CSR report 
and we are pleased that overall the Group continues to 
report improved performance. 
Outlook 
Both of our businesses grew sales appreciably in 2004, albeit 
that earnings were held back by currency translation and 
raw material price increases. Nevertheless, we have continued 
to invest in new businesses, strategic acquisitions and 
productivity initiatives. 
Looking to the future, we are clearly dependent, to some 
extent, on currencies and material price inputs, but our 
underlying businesses continue to grow and strengthen. 
We expect this trend to continue as we go forward.  7

AS A GROUP WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO REMAIN 
FOCUSED. 2004 HAS PROVIDED A STABLE 
ENVIRONMENT FOR BBA TO BUILD FURTHER. 
HOW? 
1	
In Aviation we further increased our market 
share through strategic acquisitions in 
Europe, new business wins and investment. 
2	
Despite high raw material costs, we have 
achieved good growth in Materials Technology 
through further acquisitions and product 
launches that have led to major contract wins. 
As we look forward our strategy continues to be 
focused on growth primarily in Aviation Services 
where we see good opportunities to increase 
revenues.  9

Trading Background 
2004 saw strong growth in revenues for both of our businesses. 
In particular, the first half showed a significant improvement 
over 2003. From an external point of view, demand in our 
markets was good. Underlying profit before tax however was 
held back by the translation impact of the weakening US dollar 
and raw material prices – in some areas they reached a 20 year 
high. Underlying profit before tax for the year overall was similar 
to those in 2003, although on a constant currency basis it 
showed an increase of 5 per cent. It is interesting to note that 
in US dollar terms our underlying profit before tax has grown 
by 33 per cent since 2001. 
We continued to generate strong free cash flows after 
investing £61.7 million in capital across the Group and after 
absorbing the cost of a significant restructuring programme 
in our engine repair and overhaul division. 
We also continued our record of investing in value-adding 
acquisitions, principally in our Aviation division. Last year we 
acquired in total nine new companies, increasing and enhancing 
our service and product offering across the world. These 
acquisitions are expected to contribute some £120 million 
of sales in 2005 (9 per cent of our 2004 total).  11

Aviation 
After the strong recovery we saw in the first half of 2004, 
demand continued at good levels in the second half. For the 
year, overall sales (at constant currency) increased 9 per cent to 
£800 million, on a continuing basis, with operating profits (before 
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items) increasing 
8 per cent to £80 million. 
Signature Flight Support continued to experience good 
growth with sales at £255.4 million up 10 per cent on 2003. 
Organic sales growth, excluding acquisition activity, was 8 per 
cent. We continued to improve and expand our existing locations, 
adding ramp space in Luton and Paris, and completing new FBO 
facilities at Toulon and Jacksonville. Perhaps more importantly, 
the year saw a significant increase in Signature’s international 
network of bases, particularly in Europe. We acquired a presence 
in Athens, Crete, Heathrow, Shannon, and with the Execair 
acquisition, a further 10 locations in Europe, including Dublin, 
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Birmingham and Charleroi. Collectively, 
in 2004 we have grown our European network from 5 to 19 FBOs. 
With the addition of New Orleans in November, we now have 
67 locations in the Signature network. We are not only the largest 
provider of FBO services but also the only truly global provider . 
At ASIG, our commercial aviation airport service provider, 
sales increased some 6 per cent on 2003 to £164 million. 
Here again, we enhanced our geographic presence with the 
acquisition of Airport Group International (AGI). This added  13 
another 6 new airport locations in the United States and 
strengthened our market position in a further 8. With the 
acquisition and integration of AGI now complete, ASIG’s 
worldwide network numbers 71 locations, including 46 of the 
world’s top 100 airports. The December acquisition of Boker 
Aeroclean, an aircraft cleaning company based at London 
Heathrow Airport, complements ASIG’s fuelling operations and 
positions the company to strengthen and expand its business 
with major carriers throughout Europe. 
In 2004, ASIG also implemented a number of creative 
programmes, including structured pre-pay agreements, 
to better manage risk and solidify long-term business 
relationships with its major airline customers. 
The contract to be the alternative provider of fuelling 
services on the new airport in Bangkok is proceeding through 
the start-up process and is expected to begin operations in the 
fourth quarter of 2005. 
Our aircraft engine repair and overhaul business, 
headquartered in Dallas, saw sales increase 4 per cent to £290 
million (at constant currency). Premier Turbines, acquired in 
2003, continues to perform well, with excellent growth in TFE731 
inputs during the year . The TFE731 is one of the most popular 
engines in the business aviation fleet and growth prospects 
remain strong. Dallas Airmotive secured significant new 
aftermarket engine support agreements with major airframe 
OEM’s Cessna and Raytheon. These collectively produced over

30 engine inputs in 2004 and are expected to continue to grow 
in 2005. Dallas Airmotive also added resources to improve its 
ability to successfully pursue select military engine programme 
opportunities and was awarded a 5 year, $7 million per annum 
US Army contract for the overhaul of aviation ground power units. 
During 2004 we were delighted to win full authorisations 
from Pratt & Whitney Canada for their PW300 and PW500 model 
engines. These engines are in the early stages of their product 
life cycle and power a wide range of current and new generation 
business and fractional programme aircraft including: PW300 – 
Citation Sovereign, Falcon 2000EX, Gulfstream 200, Hawker 
1000, Hawker Horizon and Learjet 60; PW500 – Citation Bravo, 
Citation Encore and Citation Excel. There are approximately 
2,800 PW300/PW500 engines currently in service. Start-up of 
these programmes will be effective from early 2005 and we 
expect good growth in volumes over the next three years. 
Late in 2004 we completed a major restructuring programme 
with the closure of our repair and overhaul facility in Millville, 
New Jersey, and the successful transfer of business programmes 
and production operations to other BBA facilities in the United 
States. The financial benefits of these actions will come through 
in 2005. 
H+S Aviation in the UK was adversely impacted by the 
weaker US dollar on revenues and the demise of the Dart engine 
programme. A number of actions have been taken to remedy the  15 
situation and better balance the engine programme portfolio, 
including the recent addition of Pratt & Whitney Canada 
authorisation to provide overhaul support for the JT15D model 
engine in Europe. 
Our speciality parts businesses, ITS and Barrett, again 
experienced a strong year in 2004, both benefiting from the 
continuing improvement in the pre-owned aircraft market which 
creates increased demand for serviceable engines and parts to 
support models such as the PT6, JT15D, TFE731 and Spey. 
In APPH, our hydraulics and landing gear business, original 
equipment demand was strong, offset by patchy demand for 
spare parts. During the year contracts were finalised for Airbus 
A320, NH90 helicopter and repair and overhaul of Hawk landing 
gears for Canada and Malaysia. 
Finally, at Oxford Airport, UK, in the second half of the year 
we saw a marked improvement in our pilot training business, 
as demand from the airlines returned. The airport itself has 
seen higher levels of business aviation activity and we have 
invested in more ramp and hangar space to further this 
growth in 2005. 
In summary, 2004 was another busy year for Aviation, 
with improving market conditions and significant activity in 
acquisitions, contract wins and productivity initiatives to 
strengthen our market positions and promote future growth.  16

Materials Technology 
Our Materials Technology division saw significant sales growth 
in 2004, up 16 per cent on the prior year (at constant currency). 
Of this increase, around 7 per cent was organically driven, and 
the majority of the balance due to two acquisitions, one made 
in 2003 and the other in September 2004. Despite the increase 
in sales, operating profits (before goodwill amortisation and 
exceptional items) at £60 million were held back by a continued and 
unprecedented increase in raw material input costs, particularly 
polypropylene, which rose by 45 per cent during the year to 
levels not seen for 20 years. 
Net cash inflow from operating activities at £70 million was 
again very strong, and we anticipate this to continue. 
In Industrial and Consumer Care products, Europe saw 
Tecnofibra in Milan, acquired in 2003, performing well, and 
strong demand for roofing products helped Berlin increase sales. 
In September, we acquired Tenotex for € 62 million (£42 million). 
Tenotex, with plants located in Alicante, Spain and Milan, Italy, 
is a provider of specialty nonwoven products for consumer wipes 
and a range of industrial and hygiene markets. North American 
Industrial and Consumer Care saw strong demand for Reemay 
products (fabric conditioner and filtration) and the new wipes line 
in Bethune, South Carolina, commissioned in the second half of 
2003, has moved to near full capacity. In addition, several new 
product launches towards the end of the year (Big Buff, Keeta
®
, 
Resolution
®
) will add new sales in 2005.  17 
In Healthcare, we experienced better utilisation in each of the 
three major geographic areas. In Europe the new line in Peine, 
Germany, commissioned last year, approached full-loading 
during the year . Sweden saw higher demand from a number of 
large customers and the S-Tex line in Alsace, France, won new 
orders which will increase output in 2005 from that plant. 
Our successful joint venture, Finotech in Germany, 
experienced another strong year, though slightly down on the 
exceptional level of 2003. In 2005, we expect Finotech’s profits to 
be lower as the venture transitions into a new product range 
focusing on printed films. North American demand was also up 
in most plants, particularly Simpsonville (South Carolina), 
Mexico and Green Bay (Wisconsin) due to increased market 
penetration in our healthcare business. In Asia-Pacific, our 
airlaid Femcare line in Tianjin, China, experienced a sales 
increase of 14 per cent to near full capacity and our joint venture 
in Thailand, CNC International, saw increased demand for its 
baby care and medical products. During the year we took action 
to close our loss-making Japanese sales office. 
Becorit, our rail friction business in Germany, saw sales flat 
at £19 million, and operating profits (before goodwill amortisation 
and exceptional items) remained at satisfactory levels. 
With acquisitions made in the last two years, new contracts, 
new product launches and investments, we have increased the 
Industrial and Consumer Care portion of our business from 
40 per cent two years ago to 48 per cent of total Materials

Technology sales. With the growth of Europe and Asia-Pacific, we 
have a good balance geographically, with 48 per cent sales in 
North America, 44 per cent Europe and 8 per cent 
Asia-Pacific/Rest of World. 
Looking at 2005, we expect another year of strong demand, 
the full year benefit of the Tenotex acquisition and again, good 
cash flows. The outlook for raw material prices remains uncertain; 
we will require a general reduction in worldwide commodity 
prices to provide a benefit to our Materials Technology earnings. 
Until that happens, we will continue to implement price increases 
across our product range, and work to drive through further 
productivity and process development programmes. 
Strategy 
Our strategy continues to be focused on growth primarily in the 
Aviation Services market. We have shown over recent years that 
there are plenty of opportunities to increase revenues – our 
underlying markets have long term growth prospects and there 
are assets available to acquire to supplement this market 
growth. As we saw in 2004, we can grow through increasing 
our geographic presence. In both businesses we have expanded 
in North America and Europe. We already have a significant 
presence in China and Asia-Pacific in Materials Technology and, 
as the business and commercial aviation market continues to 
build momentum in this region, we aim to establish ourselves 
as a major player in Aviation Services commensurate with our 
position elsewhere in the world.  19 
We will continue to look for assets which consolidate and 
improve our market positions and returns in geographic regions 
in which we already operate. Furthermore, there may be markets 
in which we do not currently participate but which fit with our 
existing competencies. 
Our Aviation revenues at constant currencies have grown 
26 per cent in the last three years and in Materials Technology 
27 per cent over the same period. Our cash flows and balance 
sheet give us the opportunity to continue to expand and that is 
what we intend to do, provided, of course, that our investments 
fit with our strategic criteria and provide financial returns that 
will add to the value of the Group overall. 
Looking Forward 
2004 was a year of good progress in top-line revenue growth 
in both divisions. We continued to improve the market positions 
of both Aviation and Materials Technology through investment 
in new business, acquisitions and productivity, all of which will 
benefit 2005. 
We expect demand to continue to be robust and free cash 
flow should see an improvement over 2004. We also expect to 
see further corporate development activity, particularly in the 
Aviation area. The future direction of the US dollar is difficult 
to predict and the outlook for raw material prices is unclear . 
However, with the actions we have taken and continue to take, 
we expect to make good progress in 2005.  20

Summary 
In 2004 the Group produced underlying pre-tax profits of £128 
million which were slightly lower than in 2003 (£130.5 million) 
and adjusted earnings per share were 19.9 pence, 1 per cent 
higher than the prior year . We continue to be impacted by the 
weakening of the average dollar exchange rate against sterling, 
which depreciated by 12 per cent during the period, reducing our 
underlying pre-tax profits by some £8 million. In our Materials 
Technology division significant increases in raw material costs 
impacted underlying pre-tax profits by circa £8 million. Despite 
these issues, in constant currency terms, underlying pre-tax 
profits advanced by 5 per cent. Our free cash flow, at £60 million, 
continues to be strong, and we invested £98 million in acquisitions 
for both of our businesses.

At the start of the year the Group had two syndicated facilities 
for £550 million and £300 million, which were due to expire 
in 2005 and 2007 respectively. During the year the Group took 
advantage of a strong banking market for borrowers and 
refinanced both of these facilities on 5-year terms. We 
also took the opportunity to increase the overall amount to 
£950 million from £850 million and improved terms both in 
relation to covenants and pricing. This new facility will ensure 
that we continue to have the headroom and flexibility to 
capitalise on investment opportunities as they arise. 
The Group policy with respect to cash deposits is to only 
have deposits with pre-approved banks with credit ratings 
of A1/P1 and with limits on the amount deposited with each 
institution dependent on their credit rating. Deposits are 
generally for short-term maturity (less than three months). 
Financial Risk Management and Treasury Policies 
The main financial risks of the Group relate to funding and 
liquidity, interest rate fluctuations and currency exposures. 
The management of these risks is performed by a central 
Treasury department that reports directly to me and operates 
according to objectives, policies and authorities approved by 
the Board. The overall policy objective is to use financial 
instruments to manage financial risks arising from the 
underlying business activities and therefore the Group does 
not undertake speculative transactions for which there is 
no underlying financial exposure. 
Funding and liquidity: The Group’s operations are 
financed by a combination of retained profits, equity and 
borrowings. Borrowings are generally raised at Group level 
from banks and then lent on to operating subsidiaries on 
commercial terms. The Group maintains sufficient available 
committed borrowing facilities to meet any forecasted 
funding requirements. At the end of 2004 the Group had 
committed bank facilities of £985 million of which £350 
million was undrawn. In addition, the Group maintains 
uncommitted facilities for daily working capital fluctuation 
purposes. At the end of 2004 the undrawn amount of these 
uncommitted facilities totalled £26 million. 
Interest rate risk management: The interest rate exposure 
arising from the Group’s borrowing and deposit activity is 
managed by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
instruments and interest rate swaps. The Group’s policy with 
respect to interest rate is to fix portions of debt for varying 
periods based upon our debt maturity profile and an assessment 
of interest rate trends. At the end of 2004 approximately 37 per 
cent of the Group’s borrowings were fixed at weighted average 
interest rates of 4.3 per cent for varying terms up to three years. 
Currency risk management: The Group’s policy is to 
hedge all significant transactional currency exposures 
through the use of forward currency contracts. It is also the 
Group’s policy to hedge overseas capital employed, including 
recognised goodwill, between 50 and 85 per cent by means 
of currency loans and currency swaps. 
International Accounting Standards 
During 2004, the Group finalised the restatement of its 
transition balance sheet from UK GAAP to comply with 
current International Accounting Standards (IFRS). In order 
to guarantee the completeness of this exercise, the Group’s 
internal finance manual was rewritten to revise the 
accounting policies to be used by all Group entities to comply 
with IFRS. Presentations and seminars were held with key 
finance personnel across the Group in which the major 
impacts of the changes were discussed and agreed. The final 
step in the process was for all entities to re-submit their 
2003 balance sheets using the revised finance manual.  24 
BBA GROUP 
FINANCIAL 
ANNUAL REPORT 
2004 REVIEW 
This process was completed in December 2004 and the results 
and accompanying notes are shown in the table below. 
The areas affected are broadly those described in last 
year’s Annual Report but the following points should be noted: 
Financial Assets & Liabilities: Due to the continuing debate 
around the final contents of IAS 39 and its acceptance by the 
EU, it is not mandatory for the Group to include all financial 
assets & liabilities on its transition Balance Sheet but 
instead to do so at 1 January 2005. It is the Group’s intention 
to achieve hedge accounting for those transactions which 
are entered into for that purpose. To this end, the necessary 
documentation of all hedges has been put in place as at 
31 December 2004. 
The 2005 Income Statement could be impacted by 
potential ineffectiveness of hedges, particularly cash flow 
hedges that are entered into based on forecast data. These 
forecasts will be reviewed regularly and the effect is not 
expected to be material to the Group’s earnings. 
IFRS RECONCILIATION (£M) 
Compound Financial Instruments: The annual preference 
dividend on the Group’s 6.75 per cent cumulative redeemable 
preference shares will be shown as part of Finance costs 
under IFRS rather than dividends under current UK GAAP. 
This will affect the 2005 and possibly 2006 Income Statement. 
Business Combinations: IFRS 3 requires the Group to 
identify certain intangible assets on the acquisition of a 
business which would, under UK GAAP, have been included 
within goodwill, and attribute a value to these assets, such 
as brands or customer lists. These assets will then be 
depreciated over their useful economic lives. The impact on 
Group earnings of this standard is currently being evaluated 
for acquisitions made during 2004. 
The first set of IFRS accounts to be produced by the Group 
will be the Interim Financial Statements to 30 June 2005. In 
order to have the necessary comparative figures for inclusion 
within these accounts, another re-submission process will 
take place during the second quarter of 2005, which will 
require all Group entities to restate their Income Statements 
and Balance Sheets for both June and December 2004.

Shareholders’ Funds – IFRS 640.8

(1) 	 IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation 
This standard requires that the Group splits its 6.75 per cent Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preference Shares into their debt and equity elements. The carrying values of both 
components were determined on the basis of the circumstances and conditions existing when the instrument was issued (1988). The debt element of the instrument at any point in time 
represents the expected future cash flows discounted at the discount rate appropriate at the date the instrument was issued. This adjustment resulted in an increase in Group net debt, 
and thus reduction in net assets, of £50.9m. 
(2) 	 IAS 19 Employee Benefits 
This standard states that the Group may recognise either the full net liability of its defined benefit schemes in the Balance Sheet or the proportion of this liability which is outside a 10 per 
cent corridor in relation to the schemes’ assets or liabilities. The Group has decided to adopt the first approach which is identical to the approach proposed under the UK GAAP standard 
FRS 17. This option avoided the need to determine the cumulative actuarial gains and losses from the inception of each pension plan and splitting this between recognised and 
unrecognised gains and losses at each subsequent balance sheet date. The adoption of this standard has resulted in a reduction in net assets of £27.6m. 
(3) 	 IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date 
Any proposed final dividends are no longer allowed to be recognised on the Balance Sheet until they have been declared which, for the Group, is at the AGM, usually in April or May of the 
following year . They therefore represent non-adjusting events after the balance sheet date. This adjustment resulted in an increase in net assets of £34.3m at the transition date. 
(4) IAS 12 Income Taxes 
A deferred tax asset is required to be booked relating to the temporary difference between tax generated goodwill with no book value and goodwill written off to reserves prior to FRS10 
(£10.5m). This is partially offset by the recognition of a deferred tax liability on temporary differences on fixed assets which were non qualifying items under UK GAAP £(5.6)m. 
(5)	 IFRS 2 Share Based Payments 
This standard states that the Group must recognise a charge in the Income Statement for the fair value of outstanding share options and share appreciation rights (SARS), including SAYE 
schemes granted after 7 November 2002. The charge has been calculated using an appropriate share option valuation  model and will be charged over the appropriate periods and 
adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of vesting. Under UK GAAP there is no similar charge in the Profit & Loss Account.  OUR PORTFOLIO

2004  CORPORATE 
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
Our Group CSR Steering Committee undertook a number of important 
initiatives during 2004 to broaden the reach of Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) within BBA’s family of businesses and their 
employees. These initiatives included increasing the visibility of 
CSR principles within BBA’s business operations through awareness 
communications and training, and the development and promotion of 
Group-wide policies that encourage responsible business and social 
conduct. We also examined metrics to measure the Group’s 
performance against various CSR performance standards and 
prepared questionnaires for our major suppliers regarding their own 
CSR practices. The Steering Committee also guided the development 
of BBA’s 2003 Annual CSR Report, the text of which can be found on the 
BBA Group web site. The Steering Committee regularly reports on its 
activities to Richard Stillwell, a member of the BBA Group Board of 
Directors who oversees CSR within the Group. 
The Group’s Executive Committee also embraced important CSR 
initiatives during 2004. Specifically, in May the Executive Committee 
reviewed and approved for release guidance notes on Product/Process 
Stewardship and Supply Chain Management. These notes, which are 
being implemented through the Group’s HS&E management function, 
emphasise responsibility in the creation, marketing and sales of our 
products and services while encouraging our suppliers to employ 
sound environmental practices. It is intended that the practices 
detailed in these guidance notes will become embedded in the way 
BBA Group companies conduct business. 
During 2004 the Group issued its Corporate Social Responsibility 
and Code of Business Ethics, consolidating CSR into a single 
comprehensive directive to all members of Group management. 
As an integral part of the mandatory practices of our management, 
this policy embraces social and ethical principles that promote the 
best interests of BBA employees as well as those of all persons who 
affect or are affected by our businesses. As a complement to this 
Policy, the Group also issued its Disclosure of Unethical Conduct 
Policy, encouraging all employees to report any conduct that may 
be incompatible with any Group policy. 
Health and safety remain integral components of the Group’s 
overall CSR strategy. During 2004 we recognised that Recordable 
Incident Rate (RIR) data gathered from each of our businesses reflects 
the frequency, but not the severity of workplace accidents. Although 
our businesses have shown significant improvements in their RIR 
performance, a single severe accident can result in lengthy employee 
absences as well as direct and indirect costs to the affected business. 
The Group now tracks accident severity alongside monthly RIR data. 
This information allows a sharper focus on our root-cause analysis 
and return-to-work programmes. 
We are engaged in a continuing effort to improve the 
environmental performance of all of our businesses. This is not just 
a matter of legal and regulatory compliance. It is a social obligation to 
the communities in which we work. All of our businesses must commit 
to annual environmental improvement objectives that move beyond 
compliance. Performance against these goals is scrutinised by our 
Group HS&E Managers. Performance results are reported to the 
Group’s senior management. 
In November, BBA Group submitted its response to Business 
in the Community’s (BitC) 2004 Corporate Responsibility Index. The 
Index has been expanded by BitC to measure corporate performance 
on a number of CSR issues. The Group’s response reflects material 
improvements in its performance over prior years. We look forward to 
the announcement of BitC’s survey results in early 2005 as a significant 
measure of the Group’s progress in this important topic.

1. Compliance 
The Board is committed to ensuring high standards of corporate 
governance are maintained at BBA. This is the first complete financial 
year in which BBA has been subject to the revised Combined Code 
issued in July 2003. 
The Company applies the principles of corporate governance 
set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code through its own behaviour, 
by monitoring corporate governance best practice and by adopting 
appropriate recommendations of relevant bodies. 
The directors can confirm compliance throughout the year 
with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code except 
that bonuses and benefits in kind of certain executive directors are 
historically pensionable. This is explained further in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 49. 
The auditors’ report concerning the Company’s compliance with 
the Combined Code appears on page 57. 
2. The Board’s Role 
The Board recognises its collective responsibility for the success of the 
Company. Its role includes providing effective leadership and setting 
the Group’s strategic aims. It assesses business opportunities and 
seeks to ensure that appropriate controls are in place to assess and 
manage risk. It is responsible for reviewing management’s performance 
and oversees senior level succession planning within the Group. The 
Board is responsible for setting the Company’s values and standards, 
ensuring the Company’s obligations to its shareholders are met. 
The full Board met on seven occasions during 2004 and these 
meetings were attended by all the directors, except that Bob Phillips 
and David Rough were absent from one meeting due to conflicting 
commitments. These meetings concentrate on strategy, financial and 
business performance. Additional meetings are called as required to 
deal with specific matters. The agenda is set by the Chairman in 
consultation with the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance 
Director and the Group Secretary. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision 
including approval of matters such as : 
• strategy and objectives 
• Group policies 
• annual budgets 
• dividends 
• acquisitions and disposals of businesses 
• expenditure over a certain limit 
• financial results 
• appointments to the Board. 
Matters outside the scope of this formal schedule are decided by 
management in accordance with delegated authorities approved by the 
Board and Audit Committee. 
The Board’s policies and procedures are set out in a Directors’ 
File which is provided to all directors on appointment and which is 
routinely updated. 
3. The Board and Independence 
The current Board comprises three executive and six non-executive 
directors who contribute a wide range of complementary skills and 
experience. A short biography of each current director is set out on 
pages 38 to 39. Biographical details of directors who also served 
during the year are as follows: Irv Yoskowitz was a senior partner at 
Global Technology Partners LLC, a senior counsel at the law firm of 
Crowell & Moring, a non-executive director of SIRVA, Inc and Equant 
N.V. Ross McMillan joined BBA in June 2001 as Chief Executive of 
the Materials Technology Division and was appointed to the Board in 
September 2002. He previously held posts at INEOS Acrylics Inc. and ICI. 
The Board is headed by Roberto Quarta, who has been Chairman 
since March 2001. He has reported no changes to his significant 
commitments during the year . 
The Group Chief Executive is Roy McGlone. The Board’s Senior 
Independent Director is David Rough. He is available to shareholders if 
they have concerns that normal channels of contact with the Chairman 
or Group Chief Executive would not resolve. 
During the year, the Board renewed the appointments of 
Roberto Quarta, Richard Stillwell and David Rough, each for a term of 
three years with effect from I March 2004. The re-appointments were 
fully reviewed in the light of the Board’s performance evaluation and 
additional discussions were held with each member of the Board. 
During the year there was one change to the composition of the Board, 
namely the retirement of Irv Yoskowitz on 1 March 2004 as non-executive 
director, a position he had held for nine years. 
With effect from 11 January 2005, John Roques’ appointment 
as a non-executive director was renewed for a further period of three 
years. His re-appointment was fully reviewed in the light of the Board’s 
performance evaluation and additional Board discussion took place. 
With effect from 23 February 2005, Michael Harper was appointed a 
non-executive director of the Board for a period of three years. He will 
be seeking election at the forthcoming AGM. We also announced that 
BBA GROUP 
ANNUAL REPORT 
43 
2004  DIRECTORS’ CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE REPORT 
Ross McMillan resigned from the Board with effect from 23 February 
2005. John Roques, David Rough and Bruce Van Allen retire by rotation 
and intend to seek re-appointment at the forthcoming AGM. 
The Board believes that John Roques and David Rough should 
be re-elected by shareholders as non-executive directors because 
each continues to be effective and demonstrates commitment to his 
role. The Board believes that each director will continue to do so. 
The Board has determined that all its non-executive directors 
are independent in character and judgment. As specified in the revised 
Combined Code, such assessment is not required for a serving Chairman. 
However, the Board believes that its Chairman, Roberto Quarta, 
should be considered independent although he was Group Chief 
Executive of the Company for a number of years until 2001. The Board 
considers that there are substantial benefits to having a Chairman who 
is familiar with the business and that the Chairman has, throughout his 
period of office, demonstrated his independence. 
During the year, the Chairman held a meeting at which only the 
non-executive directors were present. In addition, the non-executive 
directors met the Senior Independent Director without the Chairman 
present. There are several other opportunities during the year when 
discussions between various directors may be arranged or take 
place informally. 
Executive directors must obtain the prior consent of the Board 
before accepting a non-executive directorship in any other company. 
Executive directors may retain the fees from any such directorship. 
As stated on page 38, Roy McGlone is a non-executive director of 
Aggreko plc and during 2004 he was paid £30,350 in fees. 
4. Chairman and Group Chief Executive 
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and 
the Group Chief Executive and this is reinforced by a written statement 
of the division of responsibilities approved by the Board. The Chairman, 
a non-executive director, is primarily responsible for leading the Board 
and ensuring its effectiveness. He is responsible for setting the Board 
agenda and ensuring the directors receive information in an accurate, 
clear and timely manner . He is responsible for promoting effective 
decision-making, ensuring the performance of the Board, its 
committees and individual directors are evaluated on an annual basis 
and that appropriate Board training and development occurs. The 
Group Chief Executive is responsible for the development and 
implementation of Board strategy and policy, the running of the 
Group’s business, ensuring that the business activities are effectively 
communicated and promoted within and outside the business and for 
building positive relationships with the Company's stakeholders. 
5. Board Appointments 
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for planned and progressive 
refreshing of the Board. It believes that the necessary arrangements to 
manage succession issues promptly and effectively are in place. There 
is a formal and transparent procedure for the appointment of new 
directors to the Board, the prime responsibility for which is delegated 
to the Nomination Committee. The appointment process is initiated by 
the Board and a selection procedure established to identify suitable 
external search consultants for the vacancy. The process will differ in 
its detail depending on whether the appointment is for an executive or 
non-executive position, but the essentials will remain the same. 
Following the appointment of a suitable external consultant, details 
of the role and capabilities required for the appointment will be 
prepared. The consultant then draws up a list of potential candidates 
and a shortlist is created through consultation amongst Committee 
members. The Board as a whole is also regularly updated as to the 
status of the appointment process. Meetings as appropriate are 
arranged with Committee members and the Committee aims to ensure 
that each Board member is given the opportunity to meet the final 
candidates. The Nomination Committee will then meet to finalise a 
recommendation to the Board regarding the appointment. This process 
was followed during 2004 for the appointment of Michael Harper as a 
non-executive director which is referred to in paragraph 3 above. 
The Board has a written framework for the induction of new 
directors. This includes site visits, meetings with senior management 
and advisers and the provision of corporate documentation. A personal 
induction programme is prepared for each new director tailored to the 
experience and needs of the individual. Major shareholders will be 
offered the opportunity of meeting new directors. 
Appointments of non-executive directors are made by the Board 
for an initial term of three years. This term is subject to the usual 
regulatory provisions and continued satisfactory performance of duties 
following the Board's annual performance evaluation. Re-appointment 
for a further term is not automatic but may be made by mutual 
agreement. In addition, it is the Company’s practice that all directors 
are subject to re-election at least every three years. 
The fees of the non-executive directors, including the Chairman, 
are determined by the Board as a whole on the recommendation of the 
Group Chief Executive. No director is involved in deciding his own 
remuneration or fees. Letters of appointment for the non-executive 
directors are available to review on request. 
BBA GROUP 
ANNUAL REPORT

2004  6. Information and Professional Development 
The Chairman takes responsibility for ensuring the directors receive 
accurate, timely and clear information with Board and Committee 
papers being circulated in advance of the meeting. The Board and its 
Committees are kept informed of corporate governance developments 
as they arise and receive appropriate briefings. For example, the 
Remuneration Committee arranges an annual market review from its 
independent external advisers whilst the Audit Committee is routinely 
briefed on accounting and technical matters by senior management 
and the external auditors. 
In addition to formal Board meetings, the Chairman maintains 
regular contact with the Group Chief Executive and other directors to 
discuss specific issues. Senior management from the Group’s 
Divisions present to the Board on a regular basis and opportunities 
exist during the year for informal contact. Board site visits are 
arranged, collectively and individually, and non-executive directors 
are free to meet members of the senior management team. 
The Board believes that, given the experience and skills of its 
current directors, the identification of individual development needs 
is best left to the individual director’s discretion. If any such needs 
became evident through the annual performance evaluation, the 
director would be encouraged to pursue the necessary development. 
The Company will provide the necessary resources for developing and 
updating the directors’ knowledge and skills. 
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Group 
Secretary and the Board has established a procedure whereby directors 
wishing to do so in furtherance of their duties may take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. 
The Company arranges appropriate insurance cover in respect 
of legal actions against its directors. 
7. Performance Evaluation 
The Board held its first performance evaluation in 2003 and reported 
the outcome in its last shareholders’ report. The actions agreed 
following the evaluation have been implemented to the Board’s 
satisfaction. During 2004, the Board carried out its second annual 
performance evaluation. The procedure established for the first 
evaluation worked well and a similar process was therefore adopted 
for 2004. The Board intends to carry out this evaluation annually. 
The evaluation was conducted internally on a confidential basis 
and was led by the Senior Independent Director in conjunction with the 
Chairman. As in 2003, the main body of the evaluation centred on a 
review of the conduct of, and processes for, Board and Committee 
meetings, corporate governance issues, overall performance and an 
assessment of the contribution of individual directors. This year the 
Board decided to add as a particular focus information provided to the 
Board and its Committees, including strategic, financial, operational, 
corporate governance and CSR information. 
The Senior Independent Director reported the Board and Committee 
evaluation outcomes to the Board, whilst directors were individually 
briefed regarding their own performance. Overall, the Board was 
satisfied with its performance and that of its Committees. Individual 
director’s performance was also agreed to be acceptable with each 
actively contributing to the effective performance of the Board and 
its Committees. 
Overall, directors were satisfied with the level and quality of 
information provided to them, with certain adjustments being made to 
reflect individual comments. Specific actions with which management 
has been tasked from this year’s evaluation include improvements in 
presentations made to the directors. 
8. Board Committees 
The Board operates a Remuneration Committee, a Nomination 
Committee and an Audit Committee. Written terms of reference for 
each Committee are available on request. 
(a) Remuneration Committee 
Composition 
During 2004, the Remuneration Committee comprised the following 
independent non-executive directors: Richard Stillwell, Chairman, 
Bob Phillips, David Rough, John Roques and Irv Yoskowitz (retired 
1 March 2004). These directors were in place at the time of determining 
remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2004. During 2004, the 
Remuneration Committee met on three occasions and meetings were 
attended by all Committee members, except that Bob Phillips and 
David Rough were unable to attend one meeting. The Chairman and 
the executive directors may attend these meetings by invitation. 
Role 
The Committee has two principal functions: first, making recommendations 
to the Board on the framework and broad policy on executive directors’ 
remuneration; and second, determining on behalf of the Board the 
specific remuneration package for each of the executive directors, 
including pension rights and any compensation payments. 
The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for developing 
and monitoring a compensation framework for senior executives in 
conjunction with the Group Chief Executive. The detailed implementation 
of this framework, except as regards the executive directors, is the 
responsibility of the Group Chief Executive. 
Further details of the work of the Remuneration Committee 
appear in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
(b) Nomination Committee 
Composition 
The Nomination Committee comprises three non-executive directors 
and two executive directors as follows: Roberto Quarta, Chairman, 
Roy McGlone, David Rough, Andrew Wood and Richard Stillwell. Other 
directors may attend by invitation. 
BBA GROUP 
ANNUAL REPORT 
45 
2004  DIRECTORS’ CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE REPORT 
Role 
The Nomination Committee meets as required. During 2004 the 
Committee or its sub-committee met on five occasions and meetings 
were attended by all Committee members. This was supplemented 
with individual briefings and meetings as required. The principal role 
of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the 
appointment of the Company’s executive and non-executive directors. 
It is responsible for identifying and nominating candidates to fill Board 
vacancies. In making appointments, the Committee evaluates the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and in the 
light of this evaluation considers the capabilities required for the role 
and, in the case of a non-executive appointment, the time available to 
fulfil the role. Use is made of independent recruitment consultants and 
the final appointment rests with the full Board. More information on 
the role of the Nomination Committee is set out in ‘Board 
Appointments’ above. 
Details regarding the Audit Committee are set out in paragraph 
9(b) below. 
9. Audit and Accountability 
(a) Financial Reporting 
Directors’ responsibilities for the preparation of 
financial statements 
The directors are required to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of 
the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. In preparing the financial statements the 
directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and 
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group, and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
1985. They are also responsible for the system of internal control and 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group, and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. 
Going Concern 
In compliance with corporate governance requirements, the directors 
consider that after a critical review of the Group’s 2004 budget and 
medium-term plans the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared 
on a going concern basis. 
(b) Audit Committee 
Composition 
During 2004, the Audit Committee comprised the five independent 
non-executive directors as follows: John Roques, Chairman, 
Bob Phillips, Richard Stillwell, David Rough and Irv Yoskowitz (retired 
1 March 2004). 
The Chairman has relevant and recent financial experience and 
a professional accountancy qualification as required by the Smith 
Guidance. In addition the other Committee members all have 
experience of corporate financial matters. 
During 2004, the Audit Committee met on four occasions, 
generally coinciding with key dates in the financial reporting and audit 
cycle. There was full attendance by all the Committee members except 
that Bob Phillips and David Rough were unable to attend one meeting. 
The external auditors and Head of Group Internal Audit regularly 
attend these meetings. The Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group 
Finance Director and Group Financial Controller also generally join at 
least part of Audit Committee meetings by invitation. The Committee 
Chairman may call a meeting at the request of any director or the 
Company’s external auditors. 
Role 
The Committee may consider any matter that might have a financial 
impact on the Group. However, its primary role is: first, reviewing the 
scope and results of the external audit and the internal audit work 
programme; and second, reviewing the annual and interim reports 
before they are presented to the Board. In addition, the Committee 
reviews the work of the Risk Committee as described and assesses 
compliance with the directors’ responsibility statement. The Committee 
also reviews the Group’s Disclosure of Unethical Conduct Policy 
under which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters. 
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to 
the Board regarding the remuneration and appointment of its external 
auditors. It is the policy of the Audit Committee to review such 
appointment at least every five years. It discharges its responsibilities 
through the review of written reports circulated in advance of meetings 
and by discussing these reports and any other matters with the 
relevant auditors and management. At least once a year the Audit 
Committee holds a confidential session without management present 
with each of the external auditors and the Head of Group Internal Audit. 
BBA GROUP 
ANNUAL REPORT 
46 
2004  Auditor Independence and Audit Effectiveness 
Central to the Audit Committee’s work is the review and monitoring of 
the external auditors’ independence and objectivity and the effectiveness 
of the audit process. During the year the Audit Committee carried out a 
formal audit service assessment including a review of audit plans, the 
qualifications, expertise, resources, effectiveness and independence 
of the external auditors. The Audit Committee has also carried out a 
detailed performance evaluation and believes that it has satisfied the 
requirements of the Combined Code and the Smith best practice 
guidelines. The Audit Committee has confirmed that during the year 
it had formal and transparent arrangements for considering financial 
reporting and internal control principles and maintaining an appropriate 
relationship with the external auditors. 
A key safeguard to ensure auditor objectivity and independence 
is the Committee’s policy on the provision of non-audit services by 
its external auditors. This policy is reviewed annually. It prohibits the 
Group’s external auditors from carrying out certain additional services 
for the Group including bookkeeping, internal audit, valuations, 
actuarial services and financial systems design and implementation. 
Services which the external auditors may be permitted to carry out 
include assurance services such as reporting accountant work and 
tax services. The Committee is satisfied that the majority of the tax 
services supplied by Deloitte & Touche LLP are compliance-related 
and represent a small proportion of Group tax fees. 
As a matter of principle, the Group’s policy is not to use the 
external auditors for acquisition and due diligence work. However, where 
the Group considers it appropriate or conflicts arise, suppliers other 
than the preferred supplier may be asked to tender . Only in exceptional 
and unusual circumstances will this include the external auditors. 
The Committee Chairman is required to pre-approve certain 
permitted services, which may exceed set financial limits. Non-audit 
fees paid or due to the external auditors are regularly reviewed by 
the Committee. 
The Committee is satisfied that the non-audit services currently 
provided by its external auditors Deloitte & Touche LLP does not impair 
their independence or objectivity. 
(c) Systems of Internal Control 
Overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness rests with the directors. Management is 
accountable to the directors for monitoring this system and for providing 
assurance to the directors that it has done so. The system of internal 
control is essentially an ongoing process embedded in the Group’s 
businesses for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the Group, including social, environmental and ethical 
risks. The Group considers that it has adequate information to identify 
and assess significant risks and opportunities affecting its long and 
short-term value. 
This process has been in place for the year ended 31 December 2004 
and up to 23 February 2005 and the directors can therefore confirm that 
they have reviewed the effectiveness in accordance with the internal 
control requirements of the Combined Code throughout that period. 
The Group’s internal system of control is reviewed annually by 
the directors and accords with the Turnbull Guidance. The system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives. It can provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss, to the extent that is 
appropriate, taking account of costs and benefits. 
The key features of the Group’s internal control system are 
listed below. 
1. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Group Finance Director 
and comprising senior executives, meets at least twice a year to review 
and analyse how business risks are being managed. These reviews 
assess the following categories of risk: 
• business

• financial

• compliance

• operational and other including health, safety and environmental.

Central to this process is a detailed written self-assessment of 
risks by company and division, which is reviewed by the internal audit 
department. Functional risk assessments are also carried out by the 
responsible executive. If significant control issues arise between 
meetings, these can be brought to the attention of senior executives at 
regularly scheduled meetings of the Executive Management Committee. 
The outcome of the work of the Risk Committee is reported to the Audit 
Committee, which in turn reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control on behalf of the Board. The Audit Committee 
receives a report at least twice a year from the Group Finance Director 
detailing the work undertaken by the Risk Committee. Based on these 
reviews, the Board recommends action to be taken by the Group at 
both divisional and company levels to mitigate identified risks and 
seize opportunities that may add value to the Group. 
2. An organisation structure is in place at both head office and 
divisional level which clearly defines responsibilities for operational, 
accounting, taxation, treasury, legal, company secretarial and 
insurance functions. 
3. An internal audit function undertakes a programme of reviews 
aligned to the risks existing in the Group’s businesses of controls, risks 
and business processes. The role of internal audit is defined in a ‘Group 
Internal Audit Charter’ and this includes its terms of reference, the 
standards which it adheres to, the scope and coverage of its work and 
its reporting processes. The Audit Committee receives a report from 
internal audit at least four times a year which includes opinions on the 
adequacy and effectiveness of controls by site, a summary of key issues, 
work schedules and details of any action required. In accordance with 
recent revisions to the Combined Code, the Audit Committee regularly 
monitors and reviews the effectiveness of internal audit utilising 
outside specialists and self-assessment techniques.

2004  DIRECTORS’ CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE REPORT 
4. A Group Finance Manual details accounting policies, financial 
controls and reporting procedures applicable to all reporting units. 
During 2004 this manual was reviewed and updated to ensure that 
during 2005 Group accounting policies align with the latest International 
Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards. 
5. An annual budgeting exercise is carried out to set targets for 
each of the Group’s reporting units. 
6. Detailed management accounts are submitted monthly to 
management which measure actual performance against budget, 
together with forecasts of sales, profits and operating cash for the next 
three months and to the end of the year . A monthly report is provided to 
the Board highlighting key issues and summarising the detailed 
financial information provided by the operating units. 
7. Capital expenditure is controlled by means of budgets, 
authorisation levels requiring the approval of major projects by the 
Group directors and by post-investment appraisals. 
8. Defined procedures are laid down for investments, currency and 
commodity hedging, granting of guarantees and use of treasury products. 
9. A detailed matrix defines the levels of authority for the Group’s 
senior executives and their direct reports in relation to acquisitions, 
capital expenditure, commercial and employee contracts and treasury 
matters. This matrix is authorised by the Audit Committee on behalf of 
the Board and is reviewed on an annual basis. Compliance with the 
authority matrix is reviewed as part of the internal audit process. 
10. All significant acquisitions and disposals of companies or 
businesses are approved by the Board. 
11. A Group policies manual sets out policies and procedures 
regarding the following: business ethics, business gifts and gratuities, 
equal opportunities, competition law, legal policy, external 
communications and share dealing. A bi-annual review of compliance 
with such policies by Group companies is carried out and the results 
communicated to the Risk Committee and the Board. Senior executives 
are also required to confirm annual compliance with certain policies. 
These Group policies are complemented by divisional and company-led 
initiatives, including community policies. These policies were 
supplemented in 2004 by the introduction of a ‘Disclosure of Unethical 
Conduct’ policy which includes a 24 hour ‘hotline’ available to all 
employees which is supported by a formal investigation protocol and 
regular reporting to the Audit Committee. 
12. A Group Health, Safety and Environmental Manual details 
policies, standards and procedures which are applicable throughout 
the Group. Further details are set out on page 42 under ‘Corporate 
Social Responsibility’ and on our website. Annual self-assessments 
are carried out at company level against Group standards. A monthly 
report is prepared and circulated to the Executive Management 
Committee on environmental and safety matters within all Group 
companies from the internal Group HSE function and external 
specialists. In addition to a formal annual review, the Board receives 
regular reports on HSE matters. Senior managers’ performance and 
related financial incentives are tied in part to their success against 
selected annual HSE improvement objectives. 
10. Shareholder Relations 
The Board as a whole is routinely kept up to date on corporate governance 
developments and the views of BBA’s major shareholders. This is 
achieved through regular meetings during the year between the Group 
Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and major shareholders, 
which are then reported to the Board as a whole. The Board also 
receives formal written reports from its brokers regarding the views of 
its principal shareholders following its preliminary and interim results 
announcements and at other times as appropriate. During 2004 major 
shareholders were invited to meet with the Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director to discuss concerns they might have regarding 
the Company's corporate governance practices. No such concerns 
were identified at that time or have been communicated subsequently. 
All non-executive directors have been offered the opportunity 
to attend meetings with major shareholders. The Board considers 
that its non-executive directors, including its Senior Independent 
Director, David Rough, have a good level of understanding of the 
issues and concerns of major shareholders, as required by the revised 
Combined Code. 
A programme of meetings with institutional shareholders, fund 
managers and analysts takes place each year . The directors seek to 
encourage a continuing dialogue. The Company maintains contact as 
required with its principal shareholders about directors’ remuneration 
in the same way as for other matters. The Company’s AGM is used as 
an opportunity to communicate with private investors. It is intended 
that notice of the AGM and related papers are sent to shareholders at 
least 20 working days before the meeting. Roberto Quarta, as 
Chairman of the Board and Nomination Committee, John Roques as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, and Richard Stillwell as Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee will answer questions, as appropriate, 
at the AGM. The Senior Independent Director, David Rough will also be 
available. Shareholders are given the opportunity of voting separately 
on each proposal. The Company counts all proxy votes cast in respect 
of the AGM and makes available the voting figures (for and against and 
abstentions) on each resolution.

2004  DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT 
This report covers the remuneration policy for directors and includes 
specific disclosures relating to directors’ emoluments, their shares and 
other interests. This remuneration report is being put to shareholders 
at the forthcoming annual general meeting for an advisory vote. 
Throughout 2004 the Company complied with the provisions of 
the July 2003 Combined Code (the “Code”) annexed to the Listing Rules 
of the UK Listing Authority, except in respect of the historical 
pensionability of bonuses and benefits in kind, which is referred to in 
paragraph 3d below. This report includes information which is 
required to be audited and this information is stated as such in the 
relevant table. 
1. REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
Although the Board considers itself ultimately responsible for both the 
framework and the cost of executive remuneration, it has delegated 
prime responsibility for executive remuneration to the Remuneration 
Committee. 
The Remuneration Committee is a Committee of the Board 
consisting exclusively of independent non-executive directors, details 
of which are set out on page 45. It is responsible for determining 
executive directors’ remuneration and reviewing proposals in respect 
of other senior executives. The Committee also determines targets for 
performance related share schemes operated by the Company and 
oversees any major changes in employee benefit structures 
throughout the Group. Further details of the work of the Remuneration 
Committee are set out on page 45. 
Inbucon Consulting, an independent remuneration consulting 
firm, is consulted by the Remuneration Committee and management in 
respect of executive remuneration and share schemes. Inbucon 
Consulting provides no other services to the Company other than the 
calculation of total shareholder return for the 2004 Share Plan. During 
the year management also consulted Mellon, an independent human 
resource consulting firm, in respect of its executive bonus schemes. 
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Remuneration Committee 
is independently advised by Sean O’Hare, Head of Executive 
Compensation at KPMG LLP . 
The Committee also consults with the Chairman (who is not a 
member of the Remuneration Committee), the Group Chief Executive 
and the Group Secretary in connection with its work. 
2. REMUNERATION POLICY 
The Group’s remuneration policy is to ensure that executive directors’ 
remuneration properly reflects their duties and responsibilities and is 
sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high calibre senior 
management collectively capable of delivering the goals of the 
Company. The Committee recognises the need to remain competitive 
in the different geographic areas in which the Company operates. 
Furthermore, the Committee aims to ensure that incentive schemes 
are in line with best practice and promote the interests of 
shareholders. Executive directors’ remuneration is reviewed at least 
annually whilst the Committee reviews its remuneration policy on 
an ongoing basis. 
The main components of executive directors’ remuneration are set out below. 
The Committee believes that the executive directors’ remuneration packages 
contain a suitable balance of directly performance related remuneration 
which links both the short-term financial performance of the Group and the 
long-term shareholder return with the executive’s total remuneration. 
a. Salary and Service Contract 
The policy of the Committee is to provide salaries that are positioned 
between the median and upper quartile when compared to salary data. 
While salary is reviewed by reference to market conditions, financial and 
individual performance, the Committee would not regard this element 
of remuneration as directly performance related. In addition to basic 
salary, Executive directors receive traditional benefits in kind, principally 
a company car or car allowance and private medical insurance. 
The policy of the Committee is to make new executive director 
appointments with a rolling service agreement which can be 
terminated by the Company on giving 12 months’ notice. 
b. Bonus 
Annual cash bonuses for executive directors and senior management 
are based on financial performance and personal objectives which are 
set annually. Currently, approximately 75 per cent of the maximum 
bonus is based on financial objectives. More details of the bonus 
arrangements are set out below. 
c. Long-Term Incentives 
The Remuneration Committee believes that a significant element of 
executive directors’ remuneration should be linked to performance 
related long-term incentives. The Company’s schemes have been 
developed to reflect market practice and provide long-term 
management focus and motivation. The Committee has also 
recognised the need for flexibility in this area to allow them to respond 
to changing market practices and different geographic norms. 
As part of its strategy to align shareholders’ and directors’ 
interests, the Remuneration Committee will expect all executive 
directors to build and maintain a holding of shares with a value at least 
equal to their base salary. 
d. Pension Provision 
Pension provision for the executive directors varies and reflects 
differing UK and US practice. Further details are set out on page 55. 
The Company is reviewing the implications of the proposed 
changes to UK pension legislation. The Remuneration Committee will 
be developing its policy in this area during 2005 and will include details 
in next year’s report. 
3. POLICY IMPLEMENTATION: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
a. Salary and Service Contracts 
Base salaries are reviewed annually by reference to comparator 
groups selected on the basis of comparable size, geographic spread 
and business focus. Individual salary decisions take into account 
personal contribution, business performance and the level of pay 
awards elsewhere in the Group. 
BBA GROUP 
ANNUAL REPORT 
49 
2004  DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT 
Each executive director who served during the year has a 12 month 
notice period under his contract of employment. 
R V McGlone contract dated 21 February 1996 
A R Wood contract dated 13 February 2001 
B Van Allen contract dated 1 June 2000 
R H McMillan contract dated 1 June 2001 
In the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee will, within 
legal constraints, determine the approach to be taken according to the 
circumstances of each individual case, taking account of the departing 
director’s obligation to mitigate his loss. In certain circumstances, and 
except for termination for non-performance, the executive directors 
may receive compensation upon early termination of a contract which 
could amount to up to one year’s remuneration based on basic salary, 
bonus, benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period. 
Mr McGlone and Mr Van Allen are required to give 12 months’ 
notice and the other executive directors 6 months’ notice of termination 
of their service agreements. 
Table 1 (page 53) sets out details of the executive directors’ salary and 
non-executive directors’ fees. 
b. Bonus 
Bonus payments made in respect of 2004 for Mr McGlone and Mr Wood 
were calculated on the basis of the Group’s adjusted earnings per share, 
Group free cash flow and the achievement of measurable personal 
objectives. Mr Van Allen’s and Mr McMillan’s bonuses reflect their 
operational responsibility for the Aviation Services and Materials 
Technology businesses respectively. Their bonus arrangements for 2004 
were based on the achievement of budgeted operating profit, return on 
net operating assets, operating cashflow for the relevant division, 
together with Group adjusted earnings per share and the achievement of 
measurable personal objectives. For all executive directors, appropriate 
performance targets and personal objectives were approved by the 
Committee at the start of the financial year for which the bonus was 
payable. The performance measures were chosen by the Committee 
because each measure was a factor over which the individual had a direct 
impact and each of the measures are collectively good indicators of 
corporate performance that should link to long-term shareholder reward. 
The bonus was expressed as a percentage of salary and the 
potential payout ranged from zero to a maximum of 65 per cent of salary. 
In a year where budgeted financial targets are met this would typically 
result in a payment of 27.5 per cent of basic salary. Approximately 
75 per cent of the bonus is based on financial objectives, the remainder 
on measurable personal objectives. The Committee retains discretion 
to reflect exceptional circumstances by varying bonuses. Bonus 
payments for 2005 are intended to be calculated on a similar basis to 
2004, except that for executive directors with operational responsibility 
return on net operating assets will be removed as one of the financial 
elements so as to give greater clarity in the financial targets. 
Table 1 (page 53) includes details of annual bonus payments made 
in respect of 2004. 
c. Share Scheme Incentives 
In April 2004, shareholders approved the BBA Group 2004 Long-Term 
Incentive Plan which replaces the previous BBA Group Long-Term 
Incentive Plan and the BBA Group 1994 Executive Share Option 
Scheme. Details of these plans are set out below. 
BBA Group 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
The BBA Group 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the ‘2004 Plan’) allows 
the awards of options, conditional shares and matching shares. The 
maximum number of options which an executive may be granted in any 
year is limited to three times basic salary, or four times basic salary if 
the Remuneration Committee determines that an executive will not 
receive a conditional share award in that year . Conditional awards of 
shares are limited to one times the executive’s basic salary or two 
times basic salary if the Remuneration Committee determines that the 
executive will not be granted options in that year . For awards to be 
made in 2005, the maximum number of shares in respect of which an 
executive may be made a matching award will be limited to 50 per cent 
of the number of shares purchased by the executive using his or her 
net bonus. Each executive may purchase shares to a value not 
exceeding his or her gross annual bonus, subject to a minimum of 
25 per cent of net amount. The Plan rules also permit matching on 
a net to gross basis. 
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the maximum 
award levels are not excessive and are in line with current market 
practice. When making awards, the Remuneration Committee will take 
prevailing remuneration practice into account. 
Options granted in 2005 under the 2004 Plan will be subject to 
the following performance conditions, which will be measured from the 
financial year ending just prior to the grant over a three year period: 
Average EPS growth Proportion of options 
above inflation exercisable 
7% or more per annum 100% 
3 to 7% per annum Pro rata between 33% and 100% 
3% per annum 33% 
Less than 3% per annum Nil 
Options will lapse if performance conditions are not satisfied and there 
will be no retesting. In line with performance conditions under earlier 
Company share option schemes, the earnings per share calculation 
will be verified by the external auditors. 
Conditional shares will vest and be released to executives at the 
end of a three year period if the Company’s total shareholder return 
against a comparator group of companies consisting of all of the FTSE 
350 listed companies in the transport, chemicals and aerospace and 
defence sectors is met. Awards made in 2005 will be subject to the 
following performance conditions: 
BBA GROUP 
ANNUAL REPORT 
50 
2004  TSR ranking in Proportion of shares vesting 
comparator group 
Upper quartile 100% 
Median to upper quartile Pro rata between 25% and 100% 
Median 25% 
Below Median Nil 
If median position is not achieved, the whole award will lapse and there 
will be no retesting. In line with performance conditions under previous 
conditional awards, total shareholder return will be calculated by an 
independent remuneration consulting firm. The vesting of matching 
awards is not dependent on performance conditions. 
The Committee believes that the two performance measures 
chosen for its incentive schemes – adjusted earnings per share growth 
and comparative total shareholder return – each represent a 
reasonable long-term indication of the financial success of the 
Company. They are also measures that are acceptable to the majority 
of the investors in the Company. It is the current intention of the 
Committee that its schemes retain these measures. 
No awards were made under the 2004 Plan during the year . 
BBA Group 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
The BBA Group Long-Term Incentive Plan, approved by shareholders in 
1997, was replaced by the 2004 Plan during 2004. There are no 
outstanding awards under this Long-Term Incentive Plan. Contingent 
awards of restricted shares were made with further awards of matched 
shares being made pro rata to investment shares acquired by 
participants using their annual bonus. The interest in shares awarded 
could only vest if the Company’s targeted total shareholder return 
measured over a period of three years was achieved. Above that 
minimum, the interest would vest in whole or in part depending on the 
level of achievement of the performance conditions. 
For awards made in 2001, the Company’s TSR was measured 
against a comparator group of selected companies within the FTSE 350 
with a market capitalisation of between approximately £600 million and 
£10 billion, excluding certain sectors. In addition, adjusted earnings per 
share had to exceed the rate of inflation by 3 per cent per annum. The 
vesting of restricted shares was nil below the median, 15 per cent at the 
median, 100 per cent at the upper quartile and 118 per cent at the top 
20th percentile. Vesting of matched shares is nil below the median, 
15 per cent at the median and 100 per cent at the upper quartile. 
Awards made in 2001 resulted in a nil vesting in March 2004 
as the Company’s TSR ranking was below the median at the end of the 
performance period. As a result no restricted shares were released to 
the relevant directors. The comparator group in respect of the 2001 
award at the end of the vesting period is set out at the top of this page.

Share Option Schemes 
All executive options recently awarded by the Company have been 
made under the BBA Group 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme, 
which expired in April 2004. All outstanding options granted under 
the scheme are subject to performance conditions. 
Between 1997 and 2000, the executive directors did not receive 
options under the Company’s executive share option schemes. 
Executive directors were granted options under the scheme between 
2001 and 2004 when shareholder approved amendments facilitated 
grants of a combination of options and awards under the 1997 Long-

is a constituent. Graph 1 shows the annual change in total shareholder 
return for the Company and the index, while Graph 2 shows the

Under the 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme, in any financial 
year a participant could be granted options with an exercise price not 
exceeding two times annual earnings. Such options are only exercisable 
if the growth in the Company’s earnings per share, as adjusted, for any 
period of three consecutive years is at least 9 per cent and is greater 
than the growth in inflation. 
Super options granted under the 1994 executive share option plan 
are only exercisable if the growth in the Company’s earnings per share,

2004  d. Pension 
UK 
The executive directors participate in the Company’s UK defined 
benefit plans. For Mr McGlone, who joined the plan prior to April 2000, 
pensionable earnings are basic salary plus an average of three years’ 
annual bonus together with the taxable value of benefits in kind. 
As from April 2000, the bonus element of pensionable earnings for 
existing directors such as Mr McGlone was capped at 45 per cent of 
salary. Pensionable earnings for Mr Wood and other new participants 
comprise basic salary only. It is the Committee’s policy that the bonus 
of any new director joining the Company’s UK pension plans from April 
2000 will not be pensionable. 
Under the Defined Benefit Scheme Rules, the normal retirement 
age is 62. In the case of death before retirement, a contingent widow’s 
pension equal to two thirds of the member’s prospective pension is 
payable. Other dependents’ pensions may also be paid. The Scheme 
Rules guarantee pension increases in retirement by RPI up to 5 per cent. 
Further discretionary increases are possible if RPI is above 5 per cent. 
Mr McGlone and Mr Wood are restricted in the level of benefits 
they can earn under the Group’s pension plan by the state defined 
earnings cap (£102,000 for the tax year 2004/2005). The Company 
therefore provides a funded unapproved retirement benefits scheme 
(‘FURBS’) at its discretion for these directors. The Company’s FURBS 
are closely related to the contribution the Company makes to the 
approved defined benefits scheme less expenses and any special 
funding. The rate of contribution for both Mr McGlone and Mr Wood 
was 36% per annum of pensionable earnings in excess of the earnings 
cap, although Mr McGlone has elected to receive a proportion of his 
entitlement as salary (see Table 1).

Mr McMillan and Mr Van Allen are participants in the Group’s Senior 
Executive Pension Plan for North America (‘SEPP’). Under the Plan, 
at age 62, they are entitled to receive a lump sum retirement benefit. 
The Plan also provides for a reduced benefit in the event of early 
retirement. That benefit is based upon a five-year averaging of 
compensation, including bonus, less amounts received under 
certain other employer pension plans which include 401k plans. 
From 1 January 2004 the Company funded the SEPP. 
In the case of death before retirement, the accrued benefit 
reverts to the participant’s widow, and is paid in a lump sum. At the 
Company’s discretion, a reduced early retirement benefit is available 
once the participant’s age plus credited service exceeds 59. Increases 
in pension are not guaranteed under the Plan. 
Mr McMillan and Mr Van Allen also participate in the Group’s 
401k plan. Details of the contributions made to the 401k plan are set 
out in Table 7 below. 
Mr Quarta, whilst an executive director, participated in a United 
States executive retirement plan. He retains benefits which accrued 
whilst he was an executive director . The main features of this plan 
included a normal retirement age of 60, no individual contributions 
and an annual benefit upon retirement equivalent to 50 per cent of the 
average of his highest three years’ compensation, inclusive of bonus 
and taxable benefits in kind less amounts received under certain other 
employer pension plans.

Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
The non-executive directors each have a letter of appointment which is 
available on request. No compensation would be payable for the early 
termination of the appointment of any non-executive director . 
The level of fees is determined by the Board as a whole on the 
recommendation of the Group Chief Executive using independent 
market surveys. Fees are in line with current market practice of 
comparable organisations. During the year the annual base fee for 
non-executive directors increased to £30,000 and the annual supplement 
payable to the chairman of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee increased to £7,500. It was also agreed that the Senior 
Independent Director should receive an annual supplement of £5,000. 
These increases reflect the increased commitments and demands 
placed upon each of the non-executive directors in performing their 
duties on the Board and its principal committees. 
Details of the non-executive directors’ fees for 2004 are set out 
in Table 1 (page 53). 
At 23 February 2005, the unexpired terms of the non-executive 
directors were as follows: 
R Quarta 24 months D J S Roques 35 months 
J M Harper 36 months D Rough 24 months 
R M Phillips 14 months R N Stillwell 24 months 
I B Yoskowitz retired from the Board on 1 March 2004. 
The non-executive directors do not participate in the Company’s share 
option schemes, long-term incentive plan or pension arrangements. 
As disclosed in this report Mr Quarta retains an entitlement to a 
pension which accrued whilst he was an executive director . Mr Quarta’s 
rights to exercise certain share options granted whilst he was an 
executive director lapsed on 31 December 2004.

2004  INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 
Independent auditors’ report to the members of BBA Group plc 
We have audited the financial statements of BBA Group plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2004 which comprise the profit and loss account, 
the Group and Company balance sheets, the cash flow statement, the 
statement of total recognised gains and losses, the reconciliation of 
movements in shareholders’ funds, the statement of accounting 
policies and the related notes 1 to 25. These financial statements have 
been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have 
also audited the information in the part of the directors’ remuneration 
report that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as 
a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As described in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, 
the Company’s directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
law and accounting standards. They are also responsible for the 
preparation of the other information contained in the annual report 
including the directors’ remuneration report. Our responsibility 
is to audit the financial statements and the part of the directors’ 
remuneration report described as having been audited in accordance 
with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and 
auditing standards. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial 
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report 
described as having been audited have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in 
our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial 
statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if 
we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ 
remuneration and transactions with the Company and other members 
of the Group is not disclosed. 
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects 
the Company's compliance with the nine provisions of the July 2003 
FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are 
not required to consider whether the Board's statements on internal 
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group's corporate governance procedures or 
its risk and control procedures. 
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained 
in the annual report for the above year as described in the contents 
section including the unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration 
report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware 
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
financial statements. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing 
standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes 
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the directors’ 
remuneration report described as having been audited. It also includes 
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by 
the directors in the preparation of the financial statements and of 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances 
of the Company and the Group, consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order 
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration 
report described as having been audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error . 
In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the 
presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of 
the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 December 2004 
and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended and the financial 
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described 
as having been audited have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985.

2004  ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Accounting Policies 
The principal Group accounting policies are set out below and have 
been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding year 
with the exception of turnover arising from engine repair & overhauls 
(see “Turnover” below). The impact of this policy change is immaterial 
in the context of the Group’s turnover and operating profit in both the 
current and prior year . 
Basis of Accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost 
convention adjusted for the revaluation of certain fixed assets and in 
accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. 
Certain amounts included in the Group balance sheet at 
31 December 2003 have been reclassified to provide a more 
appropriate presentation as follows: 
1. Tangible fixed assets (2004: £1.1m, 2003: £0.9m) and debtors 
(2004: £10.7m, 2003: £7.2m) have been reclassified as licences. 
2. Foreign currency assets previously reported in borrowings 
(2004: £62.0m, 2003: £53.4m) have been reclassified as other debtors. 
Basis of Consolidation 
The Group profit and loss account, balance sheet and cash flow 
statement incorporate the financial statements of all subsidiary 
undertakings for the year ended 31 December under the acquisition 
method of accounting. 
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or sold are 
consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control 
passed. Goodwill on acquisitions, being the excess of the fair value of 
the consideration for new interests over the fair value of net assets 
acquired, is capitalised and written off on a straight line basis over its 
useful economic life, with a maximum life of 20 years. Provision is 
made for any impairment. Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year 
ended 31 December 1997 and earlier periods was written off to 
reserves in accordance with the accounting standards then in force. 
As permitted by current accounting standards, the goodwill previously 
written off to reserves has not been reinstated in the balance sheet. 
On disposal of a previously acquired business, the attributable amount 
of goodwill previously written off to reserves is included in determining 
the profit or loss on disposal. 
Associated undertakings are those investments other than 
subsidiary undertakings where the Group exercises a significant 
influence, typically through representation on the Board of Directors. 
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share 
of the post-acquisition reserves of all such companies. 
Investments 
In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiary 
and associated undertakings are stated at cost less provision for 
impairment. In the Group’s financial statements, investments in 
associated undertakings are stated at cost plus the Group’s share of 
post-acquisition reserves less provision for impairment. Other fixed 
asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment. 
Treasury 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange 
at the date of the transaction unless matched by a forward contract. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 
the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing 
at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate. Any gain or 
loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of 
the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and 
loss account. 
The results and cash flows of overseas operations are translated 
at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance 
sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange 
differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results 
of overseas operations and on foreign currency borrowings or other 
currency instruments, to the extent that they hedge the Group’s 
investment in such operations, are dealt with through reserves. 
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge the 
instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable 
commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate by 
converting a fixed rate to a variable rate or vice versa. Interest 
differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net 
interest payable over the periods of the contracts. 
Turnover 
Turnover comprises the invoiced value of sales for goods supplied and 
services provided by the Group excluding intercompany transactions, 
sales by associated undertakings and sales taxes. 
Within the engine overhauls business, turnover and associated 
profit are recognised on a percentage completion basis once the terms 
of the contract have been agreed with the customer and the ultimate 
profitability of the contract can be determined with reasonable certainty. 
The change has been adopted to more accurately reflect the right to 
consideration. All current contracts are reviewed each period to ensure 
that there are no indications of a reduction in expected profitability. 
In our pilot training business, turnover is recognised evenly over 
the duration of each course. 
Research and Development 
Research and development expenditure is charged against income in 
the year in which it is incurred. 
Pensions and other Post-Retirement Benefits 
The costs of pension plans and other post-retirement benefits are 
charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the costs over 
employees’ working lives within the Group. The contribution levels 
are determined by valuations undertaken by independent qualified 
actuaries. In certain overseas subsidiary undertakings, to comply 
with local legislation and to obtain taxation advantages, provision is 
made for the total actuarial liability less the current surrender value 
of the supporting investment. The FRS17 transitional disclosures have 
been provided.

2004  Scrip Dividends 
The option to receive dividends in the form of ordinary shares was 
replaced by a Dividend Reinvestment Programme in the second half 
of 2003. Prior to this change, ordinary dividends in lieu of which 
shareholders elected to receive ordinary shares were credited 
to reserves and the nominal value of such ordinary shares was 
capitalised out of the share premium account. 
Tangible Fixed Assets 
Plant and machinery, with the exception of tooling and motor vehicles, 
was professionally valued at 31 December 1988 on an existing use 
basis. Additions after that date are stated in the balance sheet at cost. 
Land and buildings are stated at cost or valuation (performed in 1988). 
Other tangible fixed assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost. 
Depreciation is provided on the cost or valuation of tangible fixed 
assets less estimated residual value and is calculated on a straight 
line basis over the following estimated useful lives of the assets: 
Land not depreciated 
Buildings 40 years maximum 
Plant and machinery (including 
essential commissioning costs) 3 – 18 years 
Tooling, vehicles, computer and office equipment are categorised 
within Plant and Machinery in Note 10 of the accounts. 
The revaluation reserve consists of the surpluses on the 
revaluation of land and buildings to their market value for existing 
use and on the revaluation of plant and machinery to net current 
replacement cost. 
Finance costs which are directly attributable to the construction 
of major tangible fixed assets are capitalised as part of those assets. 
The commencement of capitalisation begins when both finance costs 
and expenditures for the asset are being incurred and activities that 
are necessary to get the asset ready for use are in progress. 
Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities that are 
necessary to get the asset ready for use are complete. 
Leases 
Where assets are financed by lease agreements that give rights 
similar to ownership (finance leases), the assets are treated as if 
they had been purchased and the leasing commitments are shown as 
obligations to the lessors. The capitalisation values of the assets are 
written off on a straight line basis over the shorter of the periods 
of the leases or the useful lives of the assets concerned. The capital 
elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while 
the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over 
the period of the leases to produce a constant rate of charge on the 
balance of capital payments outstanding. 
For all other leases (operating leases) the rental payments are 
charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the 
lives of the leases. 
Stocks 
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost comprises the cost of raw materials and an appropriate 
proportion of labour and overheads in the case of work in progress 
and finished goods. Provision is made for slow moving or obsolete 
stock as appropriate. 
Taxation 
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes 
into account taxation deferred due to timing differences between the 
treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. 
Deferred tax is provided in full on all liabilities. In accordance with FRS 19, 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is regarded that it is 
more likely than not that they will be recovered.  Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities have not been discounted. 
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from 
the sale or revaluation of fixed assets unless, at the balance sheet date, 
a binding commitment to sell the asset has been entered into and it is 
unlikely that any gain will qualify for rollover relief.

73  NOTES ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
17 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Page 23 of the Group Finance Director’s Review provides an explanation of the role that financial instruments have had during the year in creating 
or changing the risks the Group faces in its activities. The explanation summarises the objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial 
instruments and similar contracts, and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the year . The numerical 
disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and liabilities as defined in Financial Reporting Standard 13 - Derivatives and Other Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures (FRS 13). For this purpose non-equity shares issued by the Company are dealt with in the disclosures in the same way 
as the Group’s financial liabilities but separately disclosed. Certain financial assets such as investments in subsidiary and associated companies 
are also excluded from the scope of these disclosures. As permitted by FRS 13, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the 
disclosures, other than the currency disclosures. 
Interest rate profile 
After taking into account interest rate swaps and currency swaps entered into by the Group, the interest rate profile of the Group’s financial 
liabilities at 31 December 2004 was as follows:

The fixed rate on the sterling assets is in relation to interest rate swaps with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1% (2003: 4.1%), which are due 
to mature during the second half of 2005. 
Cash at bank and short-term deposits earn interest determined with reference to the relevant money market deposit rates. Vendor notes 
relate to disposals made in previous years and earn interest determined with reference to the relevant LIBOR. 
Currency exposures 
The extent to which the Group’s operating entities hold monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than in their local currency has been 
reviewed. Taking into account the impact of forward currency contracts and other derivative instruments, the Group had no material profit and 
loss exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at 31 December 2004. 
Gains and losses on hedges 
The Group enters into forward currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposures that arise on sales denominated in foreign currencies 
immediately those sales are transacted. It also uses interest rate swaps and currency swaps to manage its interest rate profile and translation 
exposures. Gains and losses on hedges are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.

The fair value of the non-equity capital, interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts have been determined by 
reference to prices available from the markets on which the instruments involved are traded. All the other fair values shown above have been 
calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates. 
The interest rates on currency swaps are based upon short-term floating rates and therefore the difference between the book value and 
fair value is immaterial.

The pension and post-retirement benefit provisions arise from unfunded pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations to former 
employees and are expected to be payable over the remaining average service lives of employees. 
The charges to the provision for discontinued operations relate principally to the closure of our repair and overhaul facility at Millville, USA. 
The spend represents costs relating to prior year disposals. The provision of £24.2m is partially offset by expected recoveries from third parties of 
£13.3m (2003: £13.3m), which are included within debtors due after one year in note 13. It is expected that the majority of this expenditure will not 
be incurred within the next five years.

2004  23 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS 
The Group operates a number of plans worldwide. The main plans, which cover the majority of employees, are of the funded defined benefit type. 
The normal pension cost for the Group, including early retirement costs, was £12.2m (2003: £11.6m) of which £8.8m (2003: £7.5m) was in respect 
of foreign schemes. This includes £5.8m (2003: £5.9m) relating to defined contribution schemes. The pension costs are assessed in accordance 
with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, where practicable, using a variety of methods and assumptions and otherwise, in respect of 
certain foreign schemes, in accordance with local regulations. 
The Group’s main UK pension commitments are contained within a defined benefit scheme with assets held in a separate trustee 
administered fund. Contributions to the scheme are made and the pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method. The latest actuarial 
valuation of the scheme was as at 31 March 2004. The principal assumptions used in the valuation of the liabilities were an average investment 
return of 6.7% per annum before retirement and 4.9% after retirement, pay inflation of 4.4% (after promotional increases) per annum and pension 
increases of 2.8% per annum. The market value of the assets of the scheme at the date of the actuarial valuation was £370.5m. The actuarial 
value of the scheme assets represented 91% of the liabilities for benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future 
increases in earnings, but excluding the costs of early retirement which are dealt with on a pay as you go basis. The excess of liabilities over 
assets will be spread over the average remaining service lives of employees to ensure that the scheme liabilities are met as they fall due. 
The Group's foreign pension schemes mainly relate to a number of funded defined benefit pension arrangements in North America. 
Pension costs have been calculated by independent qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method and assumptions appropriate to the 
arrangements in place. The principal assumptions used for the main schemes in North America were that the discount rate used to determine 
the pension liabilities was 6.0% per annum, and that future salary increases will be 3.75% per annum. 
The total market value of the assets of the North American defined benefit pension schemes as at 31 December 2004 was £52.3m (2003: 
£50.1m). The aggregate value of the schemes' assets represented 64% of the liabilities for benefits that had accrued to members (2003: 63%). 
Included in the balance sheet (note 18) is a provision of £6.7m (2003: £7.9m) in relation to overseas pension schemes. 
The Group also operates a plan in North America which principally covers healthcare and life assurance benefits for its retirees. The 
costs of these other post-retirement benefits are assessed by independent qualified actuaries and accounted for on an accruals basis. The main 
assumptions used to determine these costs were a discount rate of 6.0% per annum, and an allowance for the inflation in healthcare costs of 
2.7% per annum. 
In accordance with FRS 17, and subject to materiality, the latest actuarial valuations of the group's defined benefit pension schemes 
and healthcare plan have been reviewed and updated as at 31 December 2004. The following weighted average financial assumptions have 
been adopted:

24 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
The Group is party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business, including specific product liability and 
environmental claims in BBA Nonwovens North America and BBA Aviation respectively. Any liabilities are likely to be mitigated by legal defences, 
insurance, reserves and third party indemnities. 
Additionally, the Group has previously owned businesses that manufactured products containing asbestos. No BBA company has 
manufactured or sold any products or materials containing asbestos for many years. A small number of former BBA companies have been 
named as defendants to asbestos related claims. When these companies were sold, BBA retained certain obligations to indemnify the purchasers 
against such claims. Notwithstanding such indemnity arrangements, the costs incurred by BBA in dealing with claims made against these former 
BBA companies have been immaterial to BBA. During the period 1989 to 31 December 2004, BBA's costs of defending and disposing of all asbestos 
related claims, net of insurance coverage, were approximately £3.2m. BBA maintains a portfolio of insurance coverage in respect of the majority 
of such claims, including legal defence costs and liability cover . State operated compensation programmes have also provided coverage. On the 
basis of its past claims experience, BBA does not anticipate any material increase in the cost to it of resolving such claims. 
The directors do not currently anticipate that the outcome of the proceedings and claims set out above either individually, or in aggregate, 
will have a material adverse effect upon the Group’s financial position. 
25 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
During the year a subsidiary provided services to a company controlled by a person who is a close family member of Roberto Quarta, a director 
of BBA Group plc. These were provided in the ordinary course of business and on an arms’ length basis and amounted to £12,572 (2003: £5,318). 
At 31 December 2004 £538 remained unpaid (2003: £5,318).

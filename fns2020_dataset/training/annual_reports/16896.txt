Building on the substantial growth 
potential in the North American, 
European and Rest of World markets.
Q: How big an opportunity are international markets?
JOHN: International markets offer a huge opportunity. Our 
products are already sold in 75 countries but only in recent 
years has Walker Greenbank been in a ﬁnancial position to fully 
focus on these growth opportunities. We now have the balance 
sheet strength to achieve our ambitions in international markets, 
at a time when our products continue to grow in popularity 
globally. The heritage and design excellence of our brands 
combined with our UK manufacturing capability are all of 
considerable appeal to both emerging and established 
international markets.
Q: How does Walker Greenbank achieve 
international sales?
JOHN: We have an extensive network of agents and 
distributors around the world and work closely with them. 
Recently, in China we were very closely involved in helping 
our distribution partner open a major showroom in Shenzhen 
to showcase our wallpapers, fabrics and lifestyle products. 
We also have our own showrooms in New York and Paris. 
The licensing of our brands for lifestyle products is another 
important means to grow overseas income. Last year our 
licensees in Japan were highly successful, beneﬁting from 
Morris & Co.’s 150th anniversary.
Q: Which international markets offer the most 
exciting growth opportunities?
JOHN: Established markets offer us considerable potential, in 
part dependent on the economic cycle. The US is of particular 
interest to us, in that we already have a presence there and it’s 
a natural market for our products, but perhaps the most exciting 
opportunities for us lie in the emerging markets for luxury interior 
goods where we have seen rapid growth in Eastern Europe, the 
Far East, the Middle East and South America.

STRETCHING 
OUR
BRANDS 05
WALKER GREENBANK PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Q: T ell us more about your collaborations with 
leading independent designers.
DAVID: We have superb in-house designers but the strong 
identities of all of our brands mean that they are also ideally 
positioned for collaborations with leading independent 
designers. In the past year, Harlequin’s Kallianthi collection by 
Clarissa Hulse and Melissa White’s Arden collection for Zoffany 
have both enjoyed considerable acclaim from customers and 
commentators alike.
Q: Harlequin’ s Momentum collection has been a huge 
success. What does it mean for Walker Greenbank?
DAVID: The launch of Momentum was one of the most 
exciting developments at Harlequin during 201 1. It’s a 
stunning compilation of contemporary weaves and special 
effect wallpapers in a boutique hotel style that works extremely 
well in both home and commercial interiors. The strength of the 
appeal of Momentum is such that it has set new sales records 
for Walker Greenbank, in the UK and overseas. 
Q: The Scion brand was launched in February 2012. 
What’s its target market?
DAVID: Scion is a young, contemporary brand that combines 
fresh new styling with a particular focus on value. Scion is in a 
completely new part of the market for Walker Greenbank, so is 
highly complementary to the Company’s other brands. We’ve 
been really pleased with the success of the Scion launch and 
the high level of interest from potential customers.
Q: Licensing your brands has created a wide range 
of products but are you increasing your own product 
lines too?
DAVID: Alongside our ever-expanding licensing arrangements 
for the Sanderson, Morris & Co. and Harlequin brands we have 
also extended our own product range to include cushions and 
will be launching a trimmings range for Harlequin in the summer 
of 2012.

Q: T ableware is a key part of any interior. T ell us 
about Sanderson’s tableware collections.
VICTORIA: We signed a licensing deal last year with 
Portmeirion, a market leader in innovative tableware. So far, 
they have launched two delightful tableware ranges based on 
contrasting Sanderson designs. Fiﬁ is a 1950s-inspired retro 
collection whereas Porcelain Garden is classically inspired 
featuring delicate ﬂowers, birds and butterﬂies.
Q: T ell us more about Harlequin’s licensing 
arrangement in rugs.
ALISON: This licensing arrangement is with Brink & Campman, 
a prestige rug maker in the Netherlands. We were really pleased 
with their launch in February of a stunning collection of 20 
Harlequin rugs in nine different designs. They are currently 
developing ranges for the Sanderson and Scion brands. 
Rugs are just one of a wide range of lifestyle products that 
we’re developing through licensing arrangements to 
complement our wallpapers and fabrics. 
Q: How did Morris & Co. come to work with Barbour?
VICTORIA: Barbour and Morris & Co. are both quintessential UK 
brands so they make a perfect partnership. It’s also really exciting 
because in addition to Morris & Co.’s Strawberry Thief and 
Marigold fabrics being used for the linings of Barbour jackets, the 
fabrics will also be used to create a range of Barbour handbags.
Q: Lighting is a new area of licensing for Harlequin. 
T ell us more. 
ALISON: Harlequin’s established identity as a successful 
contemporary brand brings huge potential for its use in lifestyle 
products. Our licensing partnership with Elstead Lighting, a UK 
company with worldwide distribution, was a particularly exciting 
development. The introduction of a stylish collection of modern 
table and ﬂoor lamps, wall lights and chandeliers, designed by 
Harlequin and incorporating the brands fabric in its shades, 
reﬂects both the strength and breadth of the brand. 07

the investment in digital printing for both 
fabrics and wallpapers. 09
WALKER GREENBANK PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
INCREASING
OUR
CAPABILITY
Q: Investment in the wallpaper factory has included 
a scatter machine. What new effects does it bring?
BARRY: The scatter machine at the wallpaper factory in 
Loughborough adds glass beads and other particles to 
wallpaper and by combining this process with our different 
printing techniques we can create some highly individual 
textural effects. Harlequin’s highly successful Momentum 
collection features wallpapers produced on the scatter 
machine, which has also been used to create some superb 
wallpapers for many of our third party customers.
Q: T ell us more about the investment in digital printing.
BARRY: We’ve been building our digital printing capacity 
over the last four years, initially at the fabric printing factory 
in Lancaster and more recently at the wallpaper factory in 
Loughborough. We now have four digital printers in Lancaster 
and one in Loughborough.
Digital printing allows very large image sizes to be created 
and very short runs to be printed economically. We’ve 
produced some stunningly vibrant fabric prints in Clarissa 
Hulse’s Kallianthi collection for Harlequin using digital printing 
as well as for both existing and new third party customers at 
home and overseas. We also recently launched our ﬁrst digitally 
printed wallpaper for Zoffany’s Arden collection, which features 
a stylised Elizabethan country scene in a huge repeat size. 
Q: Screen printing is a traditional technique. 
Are you still investing in it? 
BARRY: Conventional ﬂatbed and rotary screen remain very 
attractive methods for fabric printing and during the past year 
we have substantially extended our ﬂatbed capability at our 
Lancaster factory to allow us to print a wider range of products. 
By continuing to invest in both factories, we aim to offer all our 
customers the broadest possible range of traditional and 
innovative printing techniques and design opportunities.

WALKER GREENBANK PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Overview
The year to 31 January 2012 was an excellent year during which 
we continued to exploit the potential of our brands, both in the UK 
and internationally. 
Sales for the year grew by 7 .6% to £7 4.0 million with all segments of the 
Group achieving year on year growth leading to an increase of 24% in 
operating proﬁt before exceptional items at £5.56 million.
Our Brand sales grew by 7 .3% to £57 .4 million with international sales 
growing strongly by 1 1% to £22.0 million. In our largest market, the UK, 
sales grew by 4.6% to £33.8 million. Our global licence income grew 
1 1%, led by Japan and our UK bed linen licensee.
Our UK manufacturing operations had another successful year with 
third party sales growing by 8.8% helped by international sales growth 
of 32% as existing customers developed their ranges and new 
customers were attracted by our innovative printing techniques. 
These results demonstrate further progress towards our vision of 
creating a highly proﬁtable international luxury brands group. We have 
built strong market positions in our core sectors of wallpaper and fabrics 
and our brands have stretched into lifestyle categories such as rugs, 
tableware and lighting through our worldwide licence partners.
Financials
Overall sales increased 7 .6% to £7 4.0 million (201 1: £68.8 million). The 
operating proﬁt for the year was up 24% to £5.56 million (201 1: £4.47 
million before an exceptional gain of £0.50 million from a loss of proﬁts 
claim). Proﬁt before tax grew 9.7% to £4.89 million (201 1: £4.46 million). 
The proﬁt after tax increased 26% to £3.83 million (201 1: £3.03 million).
Earnings per share were 6.76p (201 1: 5.36p) a growth of 26%.
The cash inﬂow from operating activities was £4.28 million (201 1: £4.26 
million), reﬂecting strong operating proﬁts partially offset by a continued 
signiﬁcant investment in new product. The Group’s net indebtedness at 
the year end reduced to £0.67 million (201 1: £1.82 million). 
Dividend
During the year, the Group has paid a ﬁnal dividend for the year to 
31 January 201 1 of 0.80p per share and an interim dividend of 0.20p 
per share. The Directors recommend the payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 
1.00p per share (201 1: 0.80p) which will be payable on 10 August 2012 
to shareholders on the register on 13 July 2012. This brings the total 
dividend for the year to 1.20p per share (201 1: 0.95p) an increase of 26%. 
People
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our management and 
employees for their contribution to an extremely successful year. 
Outlook
We remain focused on opportunities to develop our international 
business, where our brand assets and UK manufacturing base bring 
signiﬁcant potential to build on our strong position in established markets.
After three months of the current year Brand sales are 5% ahead of the 
same period last year. We are conﬁdent of delivering a positive outcome 
for the year.

Strategy
I am pleased to report that the Group continues to make signiﬁcant 
progress with the implementation of its strategy, which comprises:
 – International expansion – to focus on the distribution and marketing 
of our brands in the European and North American markets where 
we see signiﬁcant potential to grow our market share and to invest in 
the exciting growth opportunities in other international markets;
 – Market penetration – to continue to grow our brands in the UK and 
internationally through extension of market positions;
 – Lifestyle product extension – to proﬁt from the global recognition 
of the Group’s heritage brands, Sanderson and Morris & Co., and 
the contemporary design excellence of the Harlequin brand, by 
extending the product range and exploiting the product licensing 
opportunities; 
 – Extending manufacturing capability – to continue to invest in the 
latest printing techniques and to promote the considerable 
opportunities of being a quality UK manufacturer; and
 – Acquisitions – to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that 
ﬁt with our current brand portfolio with the objective of further 
advancing our earnings growth.
Overview
I am extremely pleased to report that we have continued to make 
progress on our record year last year with further growth in sales 
and proﬁts.
Our Brands have beneﬁted from the continued investment in design, 
marketing and product launch and have increased sales 4.6% to 
£33.8 million in what has been a challenging UK market. Internationally 
the Brands sales have grown 1 1% to £22.0 million. 
Europe as a whole has grown 10%, led by strong growth of 22% in 
Eastern Europe and 15% in Scandinavia particularly driven by Russia 
and Sweden. Despite the Euro zone difﬁculties trading was resilient with 
sales growth of 6.2% in Western Europe and encouragingly our own 
business in France has grown 23% following showroom investment 
and increased management focus.
Our business in the US is showing signs of improvement and is slightly 
up for the year as a whole in reportable currency and up 4.4% in local 
currency having been ﬂat at the half year.
Following a number of business initiatives, our other international 
markets have grown 28% to £5.64 million. This was led by growth in 
the Middle East of 105%, helped by a signiﬁcant hotel contract in Dubai, 
and growth of 22% in the Far East with the signiﬁcant Morris & Co. 
launch in the year helping Japan grow sales 46% and growth of 13% 
in China where our distributor has recently opened a showroom in 
Shenzhen predominately dedicated to our brands.
Global Licensing income has grown 1 1 % to £1.59 million with both UK 
and overseas growing strongly. In the UK our established bed linen 
licensee, Bedeck, achieved signiﬁcant growth. Amongst our overseas 
licensees, our Japanese licensees did particularly well beneﬁting from the 
Morris & Co. 150th anniversary and products being launched into China. 
The luxury and heritage nature of the Group’s brands has led to the 
signing of new licence arrangements such as Portmeirion tableware, 
Blueprint stationery, Elstead Lighting and Brink & Campman rugs.
Manufacturing has had another successful year. The activity levels in 
the second half of the year reduced from the high levels seen in the ﬁrst 
half, when manufacturing beneﬁted from customers restocking in the 
early months. Annual sales were ﬂat at £28.7 million with a small 
improvement in proﬁtability. 
The Brands
Our commitment to invest in the strength and depth of our product 
range and our attention to customer service has ensured another 
successful year for our four interior furnishings brands that make up 
the Brands segment.
In March 2012 a new brand, Scion, was launched which is a young, 
contemporary brand aimed at aspirational and fashion aware customers 
and stretches the reach of our brands into new market areas. 
The Brands achieved growth in sales of 7 .3% over last year to 
£57 .4 million. The Brands’ operating proﬁts before exceptional items 
grew 14% to £5.37 million with continued substantial investment in 
product and marketing. 
Brands UK
Harlequin
Harlequin has grown its overall sales 9.2% over the same period last 
year to £22.4 million, maintaining its position as the UK’s leading 
mid-market contemporary brand. The growth has been driven by 
strong international sales led by particularly strong growth in the Far 
East, Middle East and Sweden. Harlequin launched an innovative 
collection with Clarissa Hulse during the year and revenues exceeded 
expectations. Harlequin continues to develop its licensing income and 
launched a range of lighting in conjunction with Elstead Lighting. 
We were particularly pleased with the performance of Harlequin’s 
Momentum collection, which has become the brand’s biggest selling 
range in recent years.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Arthur Sanderson & Sons incorporating the 
Morris & Co. brand
There has been particular investment both in product and marketing 
during the 150th anniversary year of Morris & Co. which was marked 
by special UK exhibitions at several key Morris houses including 
Wightwick Manor, Standen and Red House and unique events in over 
20 international markets including major seminars as far aﬁeld as Tokyo 
and Los Angeles. These, and other activities, have raised the proﬁle of 
Morris & Co. and, combined with the global recognition of the Sanderson 
brand, have helped increase sales by 8.2% to £19.0 million. The growth 
has been driven by international sales with particularly strong growth in 
Sweden, Russia and Japan, an important market for Morris & Co.
Zoffany
Zoffany is positioned at the upper end of the premium market and sales 
have been much more challenging in the second half. Overall sales 
grew by 3.3% to £9. 10 million, this has been supported by strong 
international performance up 14.9% over last year with particularly 
strong performances in Scandinavia, Russia, the Far East and the 
Middle East where there were speciﬁc contract wins.
Brands Overseas
Our Overseas segment comprises our two wholly-owned subsidiaries 
in New York and Paris.
Following two extremely challenging years in the US market, the 
second half of the year has shown signs of recovery helping grow 
revenues for the full year by 4.4% in local currency, but ﬂat in reportable 
currency. This performance has been helped by key changes to our 
showroom partners in certain states and investment in a new back 
ofﬁce in New Jersey. We are committed to this market where we 
remain conﬁdent about the medium-term potential.
Despite challenging conditions in Western Europe, our French 
distribution business has grown 23% greatly helped by increased 
management focus and investment in remodelling our Paris showroom. 
Manufacturing
Following an extremely strong performance last year it is pleasing 
to report that our manufacturing segment has maintained both 
overall revenues and proﬁtability helped by strong third party and 
international growth. 
The striking Folia collection 
was produced by the Harlequin 
Design Studio and was launched 
in January 2012. 19
WALKER GREENBANK PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Anstey
Anstey, our wallpaper printing business, grew overall sales by 3.5% to 
£13.5 million. Third party sales in the UK were up 1 1% and third party 
export sales were up 32%. Internal sales to our own brands were down 
due to the timing and volume of product launches. 
The investment made in a scatter machine in the ﬁrst half of the year 
has given us the capability to add glass beads and other particles to 
wallpaper offering our customers a wider range of exciting new textured 
effects. This was commissioned in the second half and Harlequin led the 
way with the recent launch of the Momentum collection utilising this 
technique. Third party customers are also progressing with design 
developments. We continue to invest and to innovate our manufacturing 
capability and commissioned our ﬁrst digital printer early this year.
Standfast
Standfast, our fabric printing factory, had a small decline in overall 
annual sales of 3.7% to £15.2 million. Third party sales grew 5.8% with 
export sales growing strongly, by 32%, and UK sales growing 1.9%. 
Sales to our own brands declined 16% following a very strong launch 
of new print collections last year.
Standfast continues to invest in digital printing due to increasing 
demand and commissioned its fourth machine during the year. Digital 
printers allow customers the ﬂexibility of high value, short print runs and 
large scale designs. Further signiﬁcant investment in digital printing will 
continue to be made in order to satisfy the demand for this type of 
product. There was a signiﬁcant investment in the capacity and 
extension of the ﬂatbed printing capability during the year.
Summary
Our ongoing investment in product design, marketing, customer 
service and manufacturing capability has helped us deliver excellent 
results during the year and it is particularly pleasing that 39% of our 
brand sales are now international.
We intend to continue to exploit our brand assets internationally and 
remain conﬁdent of continued progress during the current year 
and beyond.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Income Statement and Exceptional Items
The Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review provide an 
analysis of the key factors impacting the revenue and operating proﬁt. 
In addition to the information on our brands and production facilities 
included in these reports, the Group has included in note 4 of these 
Consolidated Financial Statements further information on our segments. 
Exceptional items are both material and their nature is sufﬁcient 
to warrant separate disclosure and identiﬁcation. There were no 
exceptional items in the year but during the previous year a full and ﬁnal 
payment of £500,000 was received for an insurance settlement ‘loss of 
proﬁts claim’ which arose from the disruption to collection launches in 
2009 as a consequence of the loss of marketing material products 
held at a third party’s premises which were destroyed in a ﬁre in 
January 2009.
Interest
The net interest charge for the year was £254,000 (201 1: £146,000) 
including amortisation of debt issue costs capitalised. Included in the 
previous year was an interest receipt of £86,000 as a consequence of 
a successful Fleming claim for the recovery of VAT.
Net Deﬁned Beneﬁt Pension
The charge during the year was £407 ,000 (201 1: £364,000). There was 
a net settlement gain last year arising from the two remaining deferred 
members of the Walker Greenbank Senior Management Scheme 
accepting enhanced transfer values and the effective closure of 
that scheme. 
Current Taxation
There is a small corporation tax charge of £15,000 arising from 
withholding tax suffered on overseas licence income and a prior year 
adjustment for overseas tax of £36,000. 
Deferred Taxation
Due to the substantial brought forward UK corporation tax losses 
(£12.6 million), the Group does not anticipate paying UK corporation tax 
in the immediate future. However, as the majority of the corporation tax 
losses have now been recognised as a deferred tax asset, in the current 
and future years there will be a deferred tax charge in the Income 
Statement until such time as the losses have been fully utilised at 
which point the Group will incur and pay UK corporation tax.
The Group also continues to recognise the deferred tax asset arising 
from the pension deﬁcit. Although the pension deﬁcit has increased 
during the year there has been a small decrease in the associated 
deferred tax asset due to the reduction in the tax rate to 25% which 
has been recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Earnings per share (‘EPS’)
The basic and diluted EPS was 6.76p (2011: 5.36p). 
Operating Cash Flow and Net Debt
The Group generated net cash inﬂow from operating activities during 
the year of £4,282,000 (201 1: £4,260,000) reﬂecting the increased 
revenues, operating proﬁts and continued investment in product. 
The Group paid net interest of £230,000 (201 1: £121,000), last year 
beneﬁted from interest on a VAT refund by HMRC in respect of expenses 
incurred on the issue of shares in earlier years. Capital expenditure was 
£2,538,000 (201 1: £2,453,000). The depreciation and amortisation 
charge during the period was £1,853,000 (201 1: £1,738,000). The Group 
will continue to invest in the Manufacturing facilities and is part way 
through a major investment in a new IT system for the Brands. Capital 
expenditure will remain high during the next 12 months.

GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR 21
WALKER GREENBANK PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
The Group made additional payments to the Pension schemes of 
£1,022,000 (201 1: £1,038,000) to reduce the deﬁcit, part of the ongoing 
planned reduction, along with £436,000 (201 1: £322,000) of regular 
contributions to fund scheme expenses. 
Income tax and NI of £348,000 that arose on the vesting of an LTIP 
award was paid during the year.
Net debt in the Group has reduced by £1, 150,000 to £667 ,000 (201 1: 
£1,817 ,000) representing gearing of 2.9% (201 1: 8.5%). The average 
level of debt during the year is higher due to the timing and seasonality 
of revenues and investment in product.
The Group utilises facilities provided by Barclays Bank Plc. There is a 
term property facility of £2,200,000 (201 1: £2,600,000) at the year end 
expiring in July 201 7 . There is also a facility linked to working capital which 
allows the Group to more effectively manage seasonal ﬂuctuations in 
working capital. This facility was renewed in March 2010 for a further 
three year term expiring in July 2013. The borrowings at the end of the 
year under the working capital facility were £680,000 (201 1: £1, 161,000), 
representing headroom of £1 1,257 ,000 (201 1: £10,559,000). The 
headroom is set out below:
Utilisation
£000
Availability
£000
Property 2,184 2,200
Inventory – 2,500
Receivables 680 7,224
2,864 11,924
Less: Cash and cash equivalents (2,197)
Net Debt 667 (667) 
Headroom 11,257
The total facilities have a current limit of £16.50 million (201 1: 
£16.50 million).
All of the Group bank facilities remain secured by ﬁrst ﬁxed and ﬂoating 
charges over the Group’s assets. 
Pension Deﬁcit
The pension deﬁcit has increased this year. The key factors affecting the 
movement in the deﬁcit have been: contributions from the Company to 
reduce the deﬁcit; an increase in the liabilities of the scheme arising from 
lower discount rates but an increase in scheme assets reﬂecting the 
improvement in bond values. The impact of these factors is shown 
as follows:
2012 
£000
Deﬁcit at beginning of period (6,742)
Scheme expenses (488)
Interest cost (2,565)
Expected return on plan assets 2,646
Contributions 1,458
Actuarial gain on scheme assets 5,460
Actuarial losses from the change in discount factor (6,864)
Gross deﬁcit at the end of the year (7,095)
Long-Term Incentive Plan
There has been a new award of shares during the year under the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) with vesting conditions based on Total 
Shareholder Return with an adjusted Proﬁt before Tax ﬂoor. There has 
been a charge of £414,000 (201 1: £697 ,000) in the Income Statement 
relating to LTIP awards. The charge last year was high as the award 
made in May 2007 fully vested in May 201 1 as the top range of the 
ﬁnancial target of proﬁt before tax had been met. Accruals made up to 
January 2010 were based on achievement of the lowest range of the 
ﬁnancial target which reﬂected internal projections at that time.
Dividends
During the year, the Group has paid a ﬁnal dividend for the year to 
31 January 201 1 of 0.80p per share and an interim dividend of 0.20p 
per share. The Directors recommend the payment of a ﬁnal dividend 
of 1.00p per share (201 1: 0.80p) which will be payable on 10 August 
2012 to shareholders on the register on 13 July 2012. This brings the 
total dividend for the year to 1.20p per share (201 1: 0.95p) an increase 
of 26%. 
Disposals
There were no major disposals during the year. 
Going Concern
The Directors are conﬁdent, after having made appropriate enquiries 
that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue 
trading for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
Foreign Currency Risk
All foreign currencies are bought and sold centrally on behalf of the 
Group. Regular reviews take place of the foreign currency cash ﬂows 
and unmatched exposures are covered by forward contracts wherever 
economically practical. Working capital exposures are hedged using 
currency swaps.
The Group does not trade in ﬁnancial instruments and hedges are 
used for highly probable future cash ﬂows and to hedge working 
capital exposures. There is a hedging liability of £50,000 (201 1: £63,000 
asset) at the end of the year in relation to US dollar and Japanese yen 
forward contracts.
There is an asset of £54,000 arising from US dollar swaps used to 
hedge working capital exposures. 
Credit Risk
The Group no longer seeks credit insurance as this is not a commercial 
solution to reducing credit risk. The Board reviews the internal credit 
limits of all major customers and reviews the credit risk regularly. The 
aging proﬁle of trade debtors shows that payments from customers 
are close to terms however there have been speciﬁc expenses during 
the year. The current economic environment creates a signiﬁcant level 
of risk and in addition to speciﬁc provisioning, a provision has been 
required of £314,000 (201 1: £253,000) which is a collective 
assessment of the risk.

DIRECTORS AND ADVISERS 23
WALKER GREENBANK PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
The Directors submit their Annual Report together with the 
audited ﬁnancial statements of the Company and its subsidiary 
undertakings (‘the Group’) for the year ended 31 January 2012.
Principal activities, Business Review and future 
developments
The principal activities of the Group are the design, manufacture, 
marketing and distribution of wallcoverings, furnishing fabrics and 
associated products for the consumer market.
A review of activities and the future developments of the Group are 
given in the Chief Executive’s Review on page 16, which, taken with 
the Chairman’s Statement on page 14, the Financial Review on 
page 20 and the other information in the Report of the Directors, 
represents the Group’s Business Review and are incorporated into 
this report by reference. 
The Directors do not expect there to be any signiﬁcant change in 
the principal activities of the Group in the foreseeable future.
Group result
The proﬁt before taxation amounted to £4,894,000 (201 1: 
£4,462,000). 
The Directors recommend payment of a ﬁnal ordinary dividend 
of 1.0p per share, amounting to £570,000 (excluding dividends 
on treasury shares and shares held by the employee beneﬁt trust) 
which will be recognised in the ﬁnancial statements for the following 
year (201 1: 0.80p per share). An interim dividend of 0.20p per share 
was paid during the year.
Key Performance Indicators (‘KPI’s’)
The KPI’s for the business are primarily ﬁnancial.
2012 2011
Sales growth/(decline) 7.6% 14%
Operating proﬁt margin before  
exceptional items 7.5% 6.5%
Gearing 2.9% 8.5%
Pension deﬁcit as a percentage  
of shareholders’ funds 31% 32%
Earnings per share 6.76p 5.36p
Additional commentary and analysis of strategic objectives of the 
Group are contained in the Chief Executive’s Review and note 4 of 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
Business risks
There is an ongoing process to identify, evaluate and manage the 
risks faced by the Group.
The Directors have identiﬁed a number of ﬁnancial risks for the 
Group and these are explained and the degree of risk highlighted 
in note 2 of the ﬁnancial statements and in the Financial Review. 
Two signiﬁcant business risks are the potential loss of the core IT 
system used by the Brands and the potential loss of the central 
warehousing facility in Milton Keynes. The phased implementation 
of an established third party replacement IT system is underway 
and will be concluded by the end of the coming ﬁnancial year.  
The Group has mitigated some of the risks associated with a 
warehouse by improving physical security and working practices 
during the year.
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
Where commercially appropriate the Group insures against 
ﬁnancial loss caused by unforeseen events by the means of 
insurance policies. 
Risks outside of the control of the Directors would be the impact 
of an event of a global nature or a signiﬁcant downturn in the UK 
market. Whilst the trading conditions in North America remain 
difﬁcult, this will affect trading of our business in North America 
but this business is not currently a signiﬁcant proﬁt contributor to 
the overall Group.
The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management and 
no signiﬁcant failings in control were found.
Pensions
The Group operates deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution 
schemes in the UK and overseas for all qualifying employees. 
Further information on the schemes and details of the valuations 
are given in note 23 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Employees
The Group keeps its employees informed on matters affecting 
them and on the progress of the Group by way of informal 
meetings and consultation with employees’ representatives. 
All Group businesses apply the principles of equal opportunity 
in recruitment, career progression and remuneration. Disabled 
persons are given full and fair consideration for employment where 
an appropriate vacancy occurs, having regard to their particular 
aptitudes and abilities. Whenever possible, arrangements are 
made for the continuing employment of persons who have become 
disabled during service and for appropriate training of all disabled 
employees, who are given equal consideration with all other 
employees in promotion and career development.
Payments to suppliers
The Group agrees terms and conditions for its business transactions 
with suppliers and makes payment in accordance with those terms 
and conditions subject to the supplier meeting its obligations. The 
amount of trade creditors shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
at 31 January 2012 represents 82 days (201 1: 102 days) of average 
purchases during the year for the Group. 
The Company is a holding company and has no meaningful 
equivalent of creditor days.
Market value of interests in land including buildings
The Directors do not believe there is a signiﬁcant difference 
between the current market value of the Group’s interests in 
land, including buildings, and their carrying values in the 
ﬁnancial statements.
Political and charitable donations
The Group has not made any political donations (201 1: nil). During 
the year the Group made no charitable donations (201 1: nil).
Directors
The Board of Directors as at the date of this report and during the 
year ended 31 January 2012 is set out on page 22, together with 
biographical details. Details of the Directors’ Service Contracts are 
set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 26.
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) F C Goldsmith 
and J D Sach will retire by rotation and being eligible will offer 
themselves for re-election. 24

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS CONTINUED 25
WALKER GREENBANK PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial 
statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as 
adopted by the European Union, and have elected to prepare the 
parent Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under 
Company law the Directors must not approve the ﬁnancial 
statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of 
the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing those ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to:
(i) select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
(ii) make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
(iii) state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Group and parent Company ﬁnancial statements 
respectively; and
(iv) prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

WALKER GREENBANK PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Introduction
As a company listed on the Alternative Investment Market (‘AIM’), 
the Company is not required to comply with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report requirements set out in Schedule 8 of the 
‘Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations 2008’ (‘the Regulations’). Whilst the 
Company is not required to comply with the Regulations, it has 
used the Regulations as guidance and voluntarily presented 
selected disclosures that reﬂect the extent of the Company’s 
application of the Regulations. 
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the 
ﬁnancial year were T Stannard (Non-executive Chairman) and 
F Goldsmith (Non-executive Director). T Stannard is Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee. There have been no changes in 
the composition or chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee 
during the year. The Chief Executive is invited to attend meetings of 
the Committee but no Director is involved in any decisions relating 
to their own remuneration.
None of the Committee has any personal ﬁnancial interest (other 
than as shareholders), conﬂicts of interests arising from cross 
directorships, or day to day involvement in running the business. 
The Committee is responsible for setting the framework and policy 
for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and designated 
senior managers. It determines speciﬁc elements of their 
remuneration, their contractual terms and, where necessary, 
compensation arrangements.
The Committee keeps itself informed of all relevant developments 
and best practice in the ﬁeld of remuneration and seeks advice 
from external advisers when it considers it is appropriate. In 
determining the Directors’ remuneration for the year, including 
the structure of long-term incentive plans for management, the 
Committee consulted BDO Stoy Hayward about its proposals. 
BDO Stoy Hayward also provide taxation advice and consultancy 
services to the Group. 
Remuneration policy
The Group’s remuneration policy is designed to ensure that 
the remuneration packages attract, motivate and retain directors 
and senior managers of high calibre and to reward them for 
enhancing value to shareholders. The Company’s policy is that 
a substantial proportion of the total potential remuneration of the 
Executive Directors should be performance related and aligned 
to performance measures that beneﬁt all shareholders and 
promotes the long-term success of the Company. The 
performance measurement of the Executive Directors and the 
determination of their annual remuneration package, including 
performance targets, are undertaken by the Remuneration 
Committee. There are four main elements of the remuneration 
package for Executive Directors and other senior management:
 – basic annual salary and beneﬁts;
 – annual bonus payments;
 – long-term incentives; and
 – pension arrangements.
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors comprises only 
Directors’ fees and is determined by the Executive Directors.
Basic salary and beneﬁts in kind
Salary is normally reviewed annually in February, or when 
responsibilities change. In deciding the appropriate levels, the 
Committee takes into account factors which it considers necessary 
including industry standard executive remuneration and relative pay 
levels within the Group. Each Executive Director is provided with 
health care beneﬁts. 
Annual performance related bonus
Each Executive Director’s remuneration package includes a 
performance related bonus. For the year ended 31 January 2012, the 
maximum bonus payable was 70% of basic salary. Annual ﬁnancial 
performance targets are set along with individual objectives.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
All equity based awards are subject to an overall limitation on the 
number of new shares issued to 10% within any 10 year period. 
The LTIP was approved by shareholders in 2006 and is valid for 
a 10 year period.
The LTIP seeks to motivate and retain Executive Directors and other 
senior management within the Group, to enable them to potentially 
beneﬁt from improved total shareholder return (‘TSR’) performance 
of the Group. The Committee administers the LTIP and the grant of 
nil cost options under the LTIP . The maximum annual value of nil 
cost options that can be made to an individual is equivalent to 
150% of basic salary at the date of grant. The options granted 
during the year will only become exercisable (vest) if the 
performance conditions are met, which includes continued 
employment of the individual by the Group.
A full summary of the performance conditions attaching to 
outstanding awards can be found on page 62. To the extent that 
these performance conditions are not met at the end of the vesting 
period, the options will lapse. 
Pensions
J Sach is a member of the deﬁned beneﬁt section of the 
Walker Greenbank Pension scheme and the Abaris Holdings 
Pension Scheme. Both schemes were closed to new entrants 
from April 1997 and April 1998 respectively. Both schemes 
were closed to future accrual of beneﬁts on 30 June 2002 
and 30 June 2005 respectively.
 
J Sach, D Smallridge and A Dix are members of a Group 
Personal Pension Plan sponsored by the Group. For the purposes 
of determining employer contributions to that scheme, annual 
performance related bonuses are not included in the pensionable

COMPANY SECRETARY
15 MAY 2012
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED 29
WALKER GREENBANK PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
As a Company listed on the Alternative Investment Market (‘AIM’) 
the Company is not required to issue a statement of compliance 
with the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (‘the Code’). Whilst the Company is not required to comply 
with the Code, it has used the Code as best practice guidance and 
voluntarily presented disclosures that reﬂect the extent of the 
Company’s application of the Code. 
The Board
The Company is supervised by the Board of Directors. The Board 
comprises three Executive and two Non-executive Directors.
The Board considers, after careful review, that the Non-executive 
Directors bring an independent judgement to bear. All Non-executive 
Directors have contracts which contain six month notice clauses. 
These are available for inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce 
and at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). All Directors retire by 
rotation at regular intervals in accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association and the principles of the Code. The Non-
executive Directors continue to retire for re-election at least every third 
year. All Directors undergo a performance evaluation before being 
proposed for re-election to ensure their performance continues to be 
effective, that where appropriate they maintain their independence 
and that they are demonstrating continued commitment to the role.
The Board meets at least nine times each year and has a formal 
schedule of matters reserved to it. It is responsible for overall Group 
strategy; approval of major capital expenditure projects; approval of 
the annual and interim results; annual budgets; dividend policy; and 
Board structure. It monitors the exposure to key business risks and 
reviews the strategic direction of all trading subsidiaries, their annual 
budgets, their performance in relation to those budgets and their 
capital expenditure.
All Directors receive regular and timely information on the Group’s 
operational and ﬁnancial performance. Relevant information is 
circulated to the Directors in advance of meetings. All Directors 
have direct access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary and are able to take independent professional advice in the 
furtherance of their duties, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
Board Committees
The Board has Remuneration, Audit and Nomination Committees, 
each of which has written terms of reference which are available on 
the Company’s website. The Company Secretary acts as secretary 
to the committees. The Board is satisﬁed that the committees 
discharged their responsibilities appropriately.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by T Stannard, the 
Non-executive Chairman and comprises F Goldsmith, the other 
Non-executive Director and J Sach, the Chief Executive. It makes 
recommendations to the Board on all new Board appointments. 
The Company’s Articles of Association stipulate that one third of the 
Directors or the nearest whole number below one third shall retire 
each year. The Company requires all Directors to submit themselves 
for re-election at least every three years. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by T Stannard and  
F Goldsmith. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for 
making recommendations to the Board in relation to all aspects 
of remuneration for Executive Directors and designated senior 
managers. The Remuneration Committee believes that the 
presence of the Chief Executive is important when determining 
the remuneration of the other Executive Directors.
In framing its policy the Remuneration Committee takes into 
account any factors which it deems necessary, including industry 
standard executive remuneration, differentials between executive 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
and employee remuneration and differentials between executives. 
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined by 
the Executive Directors.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by F Goldsmith and comprises 
T Stannard. Although all the Committee members are considered 
to be appropriately experienced to fulﬁll their role, F Goldsmith is 
considered as having signiﬁcant, recent and relevant experience 
in line with the Code. Further details of each of the independent 
Directors are set out on page 22. The Audit Committee meets at 
least three times each year. It considers any matter relating to the 
ﬁnancial affairs of the Group and to the Group’s external audit that it 
determines to be relevant. In particular the Committee overviews 
the monitoring of the adequacy of the Group’s internal controls, 
accounting policies and ﬁnancial reporting, and provides a forum 
through which the Group’s external auditors report to the 
Non-executive Directors.
Auditor independence
The Audit Committee regularly monitors the non-audit services 
provided by the external Auditors and fees relating to non-audit 
services are detailed in the Annual Report and Accounts (note 7). 
The Committee conﬁrms it is satisﬁed with the independence, 
objectivity and effectiveness of the external Auditor, PwC, and 
accordingly a resolution to reappoint PwC as Auditor will be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Internal control
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The Board keeps its risk control procedures under constant review 
particularly with regard to the need to embed internal control and risk 
management procedures further into the operations of business, 
both in the UK and overseas, and to deal with areas of improvement 
which come to management’s and the Board’s attention.
As might be expected in a group of this size, a key control 
procedure is the day to day supervision of the business by the 
Executive Directors, supported by the senior managers with 
responsibility for key operations.
The Executive Directors are involved in the budget setting 
process, regularly monitor key performance indicators and review 
management accounts on a monthly basis, noting and investigating 
any major variances. All signiﬁcant capital expenditure decisions 
are approved by the Board as a whole.
The Group’s signiﬁcant risks, together with the relevant control and 
monitoring procedures, are subject to regular review to enable the 
Board to assess the effectiveness of the system of internal control. 
During the course of its reviews the Board has not identiﬁed nor 
been advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has determined 
to be signiﬁcant other than disclosed in the Report of the Directors.
The Group’s system of internal control is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has considered the need for an internal audit function, 
but because of the size and nature of its operations does not 
consider it necessary at the current time.
Relations with shareholders
The Group encourages two way communications with both its 
institutional and private investors and responds in a timely fashion to all 
queries received. All shareholders receive notice of the AGM at which 
all Committee chairs will be available for questions. 30

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF WALKER GREENBANK PLC
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of Walker

the Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated 
Cash Flow Statement, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, 
the Accounting Policies and the related notes. The ﬁnancial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted 
by the European Union.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom 
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of 
the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and 
non-ﬁnancial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements 
In our opinion the Group ﬁnancial statements: 
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 January 2012 and of its proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year 
then ended;
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and 
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
ﬁnancial year for which the Group ﬁnancial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Group ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
 – certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law 
are not made; or 
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent Company 
ﬁnancial statements of Walker Greenbank PLC for the year 
ended 31 January 2012.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT  
OF CHANGES IN EQUITY
YEAR ENDED 31 JANUARY 2012 36
WALKER GREENBANK PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
1. Accounting policies and general information
General information
Walker Greenbank PLC (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’) is a luxury interior furnishings group whose brands 
include Harlequin, Sanderson, Morris & Co. and Zoffany. The brands are targeted at the mid to upper end of the premium market. They 
have worldwide distribution including prestigious showrooms at Chelsea Harbour, London and the D&D building, Manhattan, New York. 
Half of the brand’s turnover is sourced in-house from the Group’s own specialist manufacturing facilities of Standfast & Barracks, the 
fabric printing business situated in Lancaster, and Anstey Wallpaper Company situated in Loughborough. The manufacturing businesses 
produce for other interior furnishing businesses both in the UK and throughout the world. The Company is a public limited company which 
is listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange and is registered and domiciled in the UK. 
Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union (‘IFRSs as adopted by the EU’) and International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations 
and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention, as modiﬁed by the valuation of derivative ﬁnancial instruments at fair value, and with the accounting 
policies set out below which have been consistently applied to all periods presented unless otherwise indicated. 
The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through its banking facilities. The Groups forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance show that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its current 
facilities as disclosed in note 22.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Therefore the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In preparing these ﬁnancial statements the Group has applied the IFRSs adopted by the European Union and the IFRIC interpretations 
where the effective date is relevant to the ﬁnancial year commencing on 1 February 201 1 or ending 31 January 2012. 
Since the Group’s previous annual ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 January 201 1 the following pronouncements are now 
effective and have been adopted by the Group:
 – IFRS 1 (revised) ‘First time adoption’ – effective 1 July 2010
 – Amendment to IFRS 1 ‘First time adoption on ﬁnancial instrument disclosures’ – effective 1 July 2010
 – IAS 24 (revised) ‘Related Party Disclosures’ – effective 1 January 201 1
 – Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instrument Presentation on Classiﬁcation of Rights Issues’ – effective 1 February 2010
 – IFRS Annual improvements (2010) – effective 1 January 201 1
 – Amendment to IFRIC14 ‘Prepayments of minimum funding requirement’ – effective 1 January 201 1
 – IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing ﬁnancial liabilities with equity instruments’ – effective 1 July 2010
There has been no material effect on the Group’s ﬁnancial statements following the introduction of the above.
The Group has not applied the following new standards, amendments and interpretations for which adoption is not mandatory for the year 
ending 31 January 2012 and/or which have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Group has not concluded its evaluation of the impact of 
these pronouncements but at this stage does not expect there to be any material impact on the ﬁnancial statements.

In addition, a number of exposure drafts of new or amended standards and interpretations have been announced by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (‘IASB’). These include exposure drafts on revenue recognition and leases, until ﬁnal details of these and other exposure drafts 
have been concluded by the IASB the Group is not able to evaluate the potential impact on the Group of these pronouncements.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or 
complexity , or areas where assumptions and estimates are signiﬁcant to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are disclosed in note 3.
The ﬁnancial statements of the Company as an entity continue to be prepared under United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice and are presented separately from the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (pages 66 to 73).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 37

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
1. Accounting policies and general information continued
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial information incorporates the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings made up to 
31 January each year. Subsidiaries are entities where the Company has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently 
exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement from the effective date on which 
control is transferred to or from the Group, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to bring accounting policies used into line with those 
used by the Group.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured as the aggregate of 
the fair values, at the date of exchange, of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group, 
in exchange for control of the acquiree. The identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classiﬁed as held for 
sale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, which are recognised and measured at 
fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset in accordance with the policy described below.
All inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. Proﬁts and losses resulting from inter-company transactions 
that are recognised in assets, such as inventory, are eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides 
evidence of an impairment of the assets transferred.
Employee Share Ownership Plans (‘ESOPs’) controlled by the Group are also included by consolidation. Until shares held by the ESOP vest 
unconditionally in and are transferred to employees, the consideration paid for those shares is deducted from consolidated equity. No gain 
or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of shares, including transfers to 
and from treasury shares. Dividends receivable on shares held by the ESOP are excluded from the Income Statement, and are excluded 
from amounts recognised as dividends payable by the Group. 
Foreign currencies
For the purpose of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the results and ﬁnancial position are expressed in sterling, which is the functional 
currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Transactions in foreign currencies, which are those other than the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rate ruling at the Balance Sheet date. All 
unhedged exchange differences are recognised in the Income Statement for the period and classiﬁed as other operating income or charges.
The assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas subsidiaries on consolidation are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the 
Balance Sheet date. The income and expenses are translated at the weighted average rate during the period. Differences on translation are 
recognised in a separate foreign currency translation reserve within equity. On disposal of an overseas subsidiary, the cumulative exchange 
differences for that subsidiary are recognised in the Income Statement as part of the proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Intangible Assets – Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the fair value of the consideration for the acquisition, 
which includes the amount of any non-controlling interest recognised, over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquired entity’s 
identiﬁable assets and liabilities and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised, but 
reviewed for impairment annually, any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units 
that are expected to beneﬁt from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
On disposal of a subsidiary or cash generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the proﬁt or loss 
on disposal.
Intangible Assets – Archive 
The Arthur Sanderson and William Morris archive comprises an historical record of unique designs that are used to generate a signiﬁcant 
royalty income in the business. The archive is valued at historical cost. The Directors believe that the archive has an indeﬁnite useful life and 
is therefore not subject to amortisation. The carrying value of this asset is reviewed annually and provision made for any impairment in the 
carrying value if required.
Intangible Assets – Software 
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised at the cost incurred to bring the asset into use, including where relevant directly 
attributable internal costs incurred in preparing the software for operation. The costs are amortised to their estimated residual value over 
their estimated useful life which range from three to six years. Software amortisation commences when the asset goes into operational use 
by the business. 38

Intangible Assets – Collection design
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred on development projects relating to the design of new 
collections are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are fulﬁlled:
 – It is technically feasible to complete the new collection so that it will be available for use or sale.
 – Management intends to complete the new collection and use it or sell it.
 – There is an ability to use or sell the new collection.
 – It can be demonstrated how the new collection will generate probable future economic beneﬁts.
 – Adequate technical, ﬁnancial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the new collection are available. 
 – The expenditure attributable to the new collection during its development can be reliably measured.
Any costs relating to design of new collections that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Any such costs 
recognised as an expense in previous periods are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Capitalised collection design costs 
are recognised as intangible assets and are amortised to their estimated residual value at 25% on a straight line basis over the life of the 
asset, and are tested for impairment if any impairment trigger events are identiﬁed in accordance with IAS 36.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Historical 
cost comprises the purchase price and costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are 
reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate, at each Balance Sheet date.
Depreciation is charged on a straight line basis on the original costs (excluding freehold land) after deduction of any estimated residual 
value. The principal annual rates are:
Freehold buildings 2%
Leasehold improvements Over the length of the lease
Plant, equipment and vehicles Between 5% and 33%
Computer hardware 33%
Government grants received for property, plant and equipment are classiﬁed within the cost of property, plant and equipment and released 
to the Income Statement over the life of the asset. 
 
Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets
Intangible assets with ﬁnite useful lives and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairments if events or changes in circumstances 
(assessed at each reporting date) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When an impairment test is conducted, the 
recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the value in use (net present value of expected future cash ﬂows of the 
relevant cash generating unit), or the fair value less cost to sell.
Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indeﬁnite useful life are tested for impairment at least annually. 
If a cash generating unit is impaired, provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the related assets to their estimated recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are allocated ﬁrstly against goodwill, and secondly on a pro rata basis against intangible and other assets.
Non-ﬁnancial assets other than goodwill that suffer impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials, on a ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out basis, and direct 
labour, plus attributable production overheads based on a normal level of activity. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling prices 
less anticipated costs of disposal. Provision is made for any slow moving and obsolete inventory.
Marketing materials
Marketing materials consist of patterning books and other saleable marketing assets used to support the sale of the Group’s products. 
They are recognised at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials plus costs of production. 
Net realisable value is based on estimated recoveries from customers and distributors for those pattern books expected to be sold, less the 
anticipated cost of disposal. 
As books are sold or otherwise utilised and are no longer within the control of the Group, their cost is charged to the Income Statement as 
an expense. An impairment allowance is made for any slow moving and obsolete marketing materials including those expected to be given 
away free of charge. The Group’s policy is to classify marketing materials on the Balance Sheet within trade and other receivables.
Non-saleable marketing materials are expensed to the Income Statement once the collection that these marketing materials relate to has 
been launched. Any subsequent costs or development expenditure are expensed as incurred.
Financial assets and liabilities – measurement basis
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the date on which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument giving rise to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Any 
impairment of a ﬁnancial asset is charged to the Income Statement when incurred. Financial assets are derecognised when the Group’s 
rights to cash inﬂows from the asset expire: ﬁnancial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled 
or expire.

1. Accounting policies and general information continued
Financial assets and liabilities – measurement basis continued
Non-derivative ﬁnancial assets are classiﬁed according to the purpose for which the asset was acquired. The Group’s ﬁnancial assets are 
classiﬁed as either:
 – ‘trade and other receivables’ – these are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. They arise when the Group provides goods directly to a customer, or advances money, with no intention of trading the 
loan or receivable. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are included in the Balance Sheet at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method less any amounts written off to reﬂect impairment, with changes in the carrying amount recognised in the 
Income Statement within administration expenses; and
 – ‘cash and cash equivalents’ – these comprise deposits with an original maturity of three months or less with banks and ﬁnancial 
institutions, bank balances, bank overdrafts and cash in hand.
A provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to 
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculties of the debtor, probability that the 
debtor will enter bankruptcy or ﬁnancial reorganisation, default or delinquency in payments, and the unavailability of credit insurance at 
commercial rates for debtors are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired. The amount of the provision is the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the net present value of estimated future cash ﬂows, discounted at the original 
effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a provision account, and the amount of the loss is 
recognised in the Income Statement within administrative expenses. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the 
provision account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against administration 
expenses in the Income Statement.
The Group’s non-derivative ﬁnancial liabilities are classiﬁed as ‘Other liabilities’. Other liabilities are ﬁnancial liabilities with ﬁxed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Group receives goods or services directly from a 
creditor or supplier, or borrows money, with no intention of trading the liability. This category includes:
 – ‘trade and other payables’ – these are typically non-interest bearing and following initial recognition are included in the Balance Sheet at 
amortised cost;
 – ‘bank loans and overdrafts’ – these are initially recorded at fair value based on proceeds received net of issue costs. Finance charges 
are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method; and
 – ‘borrowings’ – these are recorded initially at the fair value, net of direct issue costs, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. 
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement, or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals 
basis in the Income Statement, using the effective interest method, and are included within the carrying amount of the instrument to the 
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Borrowing costs are capitalised as an increase to the carrying value of software or property, plant and equipment on major projects where 
their impact is material. 
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedge accounting – measurement basis 
The Group’s activities expose it to the ﬁnancial risks of changes in exchange rates, and the Group uses forward exchange rate contracts 
and swap exchange rate contracts to manage these exposures. The use of derivative ﬁnancial instruments is governed by the Group’s 
policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of derivative ﬁnancial instruments.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions 
are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash ﬂows of hedged items. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of 
derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges is recognised in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement within ‘Other operating income/
(expense)’. Amounts accumulated in equity are released to the Income Statement when the hedged item affects the Income Statement, 
and are also classiﬁed in the Income Statement within ‘Other operating income/(expense)’. 
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 are classiﬁed as ‘ﬁnancial assets or liabilities at fair value through proﬁt 
or loss’. They are initially recognised at fair value, with fair value being remeasured at each reporting date. The fair value of the derivative is 
based on market price of comparable instruments at the Balance Sheet date. Changes in fair value are included in the Income Statement 
within ﬁnance costs. 
The Group has no embedded derivatives that are not closely related to the host instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent only liquid assets with original maturity of 90 days or less. Cash and cash equivalents include cash in 
hand, deposits held at call with banks and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts that cannot be offset against other cash balances are shown 
within borrowings in current liabilities on the Balance Sheet.
For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement it is the Group’s policy to classify interest income and expense, and other ﬁnance costs, 
within ‘cash ﬂows from operating activities’. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation 
at the Balance Sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is considered material. 40

Leases
Leases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
Group. All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases.
Assets used by the Group which have been funded through ﬁnance leases are capitalised in property, plant and equipment and the 
resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities. The assets are depreciated over their useful lives and the interest element of the rental 
obligations is charged to the Income Statement over the period of the lease, and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital 
repayments outstanding.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Rent free periods 
receivable on entering an operating lease are released on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Employee beneﬁts – pension obligations 
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
For deﬁned beneﬁt retirement schemes, the funding of beneﬁts is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with full actuarial 
valuations being carried out triennially.
The retirement beneﬁt obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation as adjusted 
for unrecognised service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to 
past service cost, plus present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is calculated annually by qualiﬁed independent actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit Method. The present 
value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is determined by discounting the future cash outﬂows using interest rates of high quality corporate 
bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. 
Scheme expenses met by the Group, expected returns on plan assets, and interest on pension scheme liabilities are classiﬁed within ‘Net 
deﬁned beneﬁt pension charge’ within the Income Statement as the scheme is now closed to future accruals. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in 
which they occur. They are recognised outside the Income Statement and presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Past service costs are recognised immediately to the extent that the beneﬁts are already vested, and otherwise are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the average period until the beneﬁts become vested.
Employee beneﬁts – share-based payments under long-term incentive plans (‘LTIP’)
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees which must be measured at fair value and recognised as an 
expense in the Income Statement with a corresponding increase in equity. 
The fair values of these payments are measured at the date of grant, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards 
are granted. The fair value is recognised over the period during which employees become conditionally entitled to the awards, subject to 
the Group’s estimate of the number of awards which will lapse, either due to employees leaving the Group prior to vesting or due to 
non-market based performance conditions not being met. 
The total amount recognised in the Income Statement as an expense is adjusted to reﬂect the actual number of awards that vest. National 
insurance contributions related to the awards are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement with a corresponding liability on the 
Balance Sheet.
Employee beneﬁts – short-term bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created 
a constructive obligation. 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are shown in equity as a deduction, 
net of tax, from the proceeds.
Treasury shares
Consideration paid including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) on the purchase of the Company’s equity 
share capital (treasury shares) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or 
reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction 
costs and the related income tax effects is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity shareholders.
Revenue
The Group revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts recoverable by the Group 
for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes. Revenue comprises:
 – Sale of goods – sales of goods are recognised when the Group has transferred to the buyer the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of 
ownership, which is usually at the point of delivery of the goods.
 – Royalty revenue – royalties are received from licence holders under the terms of various agreements, and are recognised on an accruals 
basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 41

1. Accounting policies and general information continued
Revenue continued
Deposits received from customers in advance of the delivery of goods or services are recognised as deferred income. Amounts receivable 
from customers representing the recovery of expenses incurred by the Group for design and set-up costs, delivery, and marketing 
materials are not considered to be revenue, and are credited to the relevant expense within the Income Statement.
Exceptional items
Items that are both material and whose nature is sufﬁcient to warrant separate disclosure and identiﬁcation are disclosed within the ﬁnancial 
statements and classiﬁed within their relevant category in the Income Statement. 
Taxation including deferred tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax charges or credits. 
Current tax is based on the taxable proﬁt for the year. Taxable proﬁts differs from the net proﬁt as reported in the Income Statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the Balance Sheet date. Current tax includes withholding taxes from sales and licensing income in overseas territories. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax proﬁt nor the accounting proﬁt.
IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ requires that the measurement of deferred tax should have regard to the tax consequences that would follow from 
the manner of expected recovery or settlement at the Balance Sheet date of the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. In calculating its 
deferred tax liability the Group’s policy is to regard the depreciable amount of the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment to be 
recovered through continuing use in the business, unless included within assets held for resale, where the policy is to regard the carrying 
amount as being recoverable through sale.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able 
to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax relating to retirement beneﬁt obligations is also recognised in equity where the 
tax relief arises from contributions paid to fund deﬁcits arising in previous periods that were recognised in equity. 
Segmental reporting
The Group is a designer, manufacturer and distributor of furnishings, fabrics and wallpaper and manages its operations as three reportable 
segments which are brands, manufacturing and overseas. 
Reportable segments consist of one or more operating segments. Aggregation of operating segments into reportable segments occurs 
when aggregation criteria, as laid down in IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ are satisﬁed, including similar economic characteristics or when 
operating segments are less than the quantitative limits as laid down in IFRS 8. After applying aggregation, segmental information is 
disclosed in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to the chief operating decision maker (‘CODM’). 
The Group considers its CODM to be the Board of Directors, who are responsible for the allocation of resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments. 
Interest received
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
2. Financial risk management 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit 
risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of ﬁnancial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s ﬁnancial performance. The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge certain 
risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out at Board level under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Executive Directors identify, evaluate and 
where appropriate hedge ﬁnancial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. 
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect 
to the US dollar and the euro. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are 
denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. 42
WALKER GREENBANK PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
2. Financial risk management continued
Foreign exchange risk continued
The Group’s policy is, where possible, to allow the Group’s entities to settle liabilities in their functional currency with the cash generated 
from their operations in that currency. Where the Group’s entities have liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional 
currency (and have insufﬁcient reserves of that currency to settle them) cash already denominated in that currency will, where possible 
be transferred from elsewhere in the Group.
To manage the foreign exchange risk arising on future transactions, it is the Group’s policy to enter into forward currency contracts to hedge 
the exposure.
For the year ended 31 January 2012, the average sterling to US dollar translation rate applied by the Group including the impact of hedging 
contracts was £1 : US$1.55. If the rate had been £1 : US$1.45 with all other variables held constant, proﬁt before tax would have been 
higher by £160,000. If the rate had been £1 : US$1.65 with all other variables held constant, proﬁt before tax would have been lower 
by £140,000. 
For the year ended 31 January 2012, the average sterling to euro translation rate applied by the Group including the impact of hedging 
contracts was £1 : euro1. 15. If the rate had been £1 : euro1.05 with all other variables held constant, proﬁt before tax would have been lower 
by £273,000. If the rate had been £1 : euro1.25 with all other variables held constant, proﬁt before tax would have been higher by £229,000.
The sensitivity of movements in other currencies is not considered material to the performance of the Group. 
 
Interest rate risk
As the Group has no signiﬁcant interest bearing assets its revenue and cash generated from operations are substantially independent of 
changes in market interest rates. 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash ﬂow interest rate risk. 
The Group’s borrowings at variable rate are denominated in either UK pounds or euros. The Group regularly analyses its interest rate 
exposure calculating the impact on proﬁt and loss of a deﬁned interest rate shift. Based on the calculations the Board consider reﬁnancing, 
renewal of existing positions, alternative ﬁnancing and hedging. The Group has not felt there has been a requirement during the current or 
previous ﬁnancial year to enter into any of these options.
In July 2007 the Group entered into a ﬁnancing contract with Barclays Bank PLC of which the working capital facilities were renewed in 
March 2010, variable interest rates were negotiated on all the loans. These working capital facilities are due for review in July 2013. The 
Board continues to monitor the interest rates monthly.
For the year ended 31 January 2012, had the benchmark interest rate levels been 0.5% higher/(lower) than the actual experience, with all 
other variables held constant, the proﬁt before tax of the Group would have been (lower)/higher by £42,000 due to the change in interest 
rate expense on variable rate borrowings. The 0.5% sensitivity is deemed a reasonable sensitivity analysis based on expected movements 
in the base rate for the next ﬁnancial year.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the Group’s trade receivables, cash held with banks, and derivative ﬁnancial instruments. It is the risk that 
the counterparty fails to discharge its obligation in respect of the instrument. Cash at bank and derivative ﬁnancial instruments are 
predominantly held with the Group’s major relationship bank, Barclays Bank PLC, and the Group considers this credit risk to be minimal.
The Group does not have any signiﬁcant credit risk exposure to any single company or group of companies within trade receivables, as the 
nature of the Group’s operations mean that trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries and 
geographical areas. 
Prior to accepting new customers an independent credit check is obtained. Based on this information individual credit limits and payment 
terms are established. If no independent credit ratings are available, customers are asked to pay on a proforma basis until creditworthiness 
can be established. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored. Credit limits may only be exceeded with the authorisation from key 
management, this is dependent on the amount expected to exceed the limit and the Group’s trading history with that customer.
There is no difference between the carrying amount and the maximum credit risk exposure.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the ﬁnance charges and principal repayments on its debt 
instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difﬁculty in meeting its ﬁnancial obligations as they fall due. The maturity proﬁle of the 
Group’s debt and other ﬁnancial liabilities is disclosed in note 22.
During the year the Group had facilities with Barclays Bank PLC. A signiﬁcant element of the facility is linked to working capital, which allows 
the Group to manage its cash more effectively during the seasonal ﬂuctuations in working capital associated with the industry. This element 
of the facility is due to expire in July 2013 having been renewed in March 2010.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash and loan facility utilisation on a monthly basis. The Group ensures that it has 
adequate facilities available to cover both its short-term and medium-term commitments. In addition, the Group’s liquidity management 
policy is to project cash ﬂows in major currencies and consider the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these liabilities as they fall due.

2. Financial risk management continued
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
 – to safeguard the entities ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can provide returns for shareholders and beneﬁts for other 
stakeholders; and
 – to provide an adequate return for shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of 
changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the 
Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, buy back issued shares, 
or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the average net debt to adjusted capital ratio (or ‘gearing ratio’). The ratio is calculated as 
average net debt divided by adjusted capital. Average net debt is calculated as the total debt less cash and cash equivalents during the 
year. Adjusted capital comprises all components of equity (i.e. share capital, share premium, retained earnings, and other reserves) other 
than amounts recognised in equity relating to cash ﬂow hedges and forward currency contracts.
During the year to 31 January 2012, the Group’s strategy, which was unchanged from the previous year, was to reduce the average gearing 
ratio. The average gearing ratios for 2012 and 201 1 were as follows:
Year ended 31 January
2012
£000
2011
£000
Average net debt 6,682 5,871
Total equity 23,052 21,393
Less: amounts recognised directly in equity relating to currency contracts 50 (63)
Adjusted capital 23,102 21,330
Average net debt to adjusted capital ratio 29% 28%
Year end net debt to adjusted capital ratio 2.9% 8.5%
The Group considers the average debt to adjusted equity ratio to be appropriate at this time, but it will continue to reduce the pension 
deﬁcit by cash generated from operations and will also invest within the Group through capital expenditure and working capital.
The gearing ratio at the year end is lower than the average gearing ratio as the level of trade debtors is lower at the year end than the 
average during the year due to the seasonal nature of trading in the months of December and January.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the Balance Sheet date 
provided by relationship banks. Under the revisions to IFRS 7 these amounts are classiﬁed within level two of the fair value hierarchy. 
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables and cash and cash equivalents are assumed to 
approximate their fair values. 
3. Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning future events. The resulting accounting estimates will seldom precisely equal 
the related actual results. The Group applies its best endeavours in setting accounting estimates, and uses historical experience and other 
factors, including input from experienced and specialist management. Estimates and assumptions are periodically re-evaluated and the 
resulting accounting balances updated as new information including actual outcomes become apparent. 
The estimates and assumptions that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next ﬁnancial year are discussed below. 
a) Retirement beneﬁt obligations
The Group recognises in obligations to employee retirement beneﬁts. The quantiﬁcation of these obligations is subject to signiﬁcant 
estimates and assumptions regarding life expectancy, discount and inﬂation rates, wage and salary changes, the rate of increase in pension 
payments, and the market values of equities, bonds and other pension assets. In making these assumptions the Group takes advice from a 
qualiﬁed actuary about which assumptions reﬂect the nature of the Group’s obligations to employee retirement beneﬁts. The assumptions 
are regularly reviewed to ensure their appropriateness. 
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine 
the present value of estimated future cash outﬂows expected to be required to settle pension obligations. In determining the appropriate 
discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the 
beneﬁts will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. Details of the estimates and 
assumptions applied and carrying amounts of retirement beneﬁt obligations and pension assets, are set out in note 23. 44

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
3. Critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued
b) Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets
The Group tests annually whether goodwill or its indeﬁnite life intangible asset has suffered any impairment, in accordance with its 
accounting policy. Other intangibles and property, plant and equipment are reviewed whenever impairment triggers are apparent. The 
recoverable amounts of cash generating units have been determined based on value in use (‘VIU’) calculations. These calculations require 
use of estimates of future sales margins and other operating and administrative expenses and of discount rates. Further disclosures relating 
to the estimates and assumptions applied and carrying amounts of the non-ﬁnancial assets, are set out in note 14 and 15.
The Group makes provision for impairment in the carrying amount of its inventories and marketing materials. The nature of the Group’s 
products are exposed to changes in taste and attitudes from time to time, which can affect the demand for those products. The Group has 
skilled and experienced management who utilise historical sales information and exercise their judgement, in making estimates about the 
extent of provisions necessary based on the realisable value of inventory and expected future beneﬁt to the Group of marketing materials 
taking into account the estimated price and volume of future sales or usage less the further costs of sale and holding costs. Further 
disclosures relating to the effect on the Income Statement of the establishment and reversal of such provisions against inventory are 
included in note 7 . Details of the carrying amount of inventories are disclosed in note 17 and of marketing materials in note 18. 
c) Deferred tax recognition
Following the completion of the Group’s recovery programme and return to sustained proﬁtability over recent years, the Group has 
considered it appropriate to recognise at the Balance Sheet date deferred tax assets resulting from historical trading losses and other 
temporary differences including pension deﬁcits. The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on estimates of the timing and amount 
of future taxable proﬁts of companies within the Group, which in turn relies upon estimates of future operating proﬁts and the occurrence, 
timing and tax treatment of signiﬁcant items of income and expenditure including contributions to pension schemes and the vesting of 
share-based payment awards. Further disclosures relating to the effect on the Income Statement of the recognition of deferred tax assets 
are included in note 12 and the amount of deferred tax asset recognised and other relevant disclosures are included in note 16. 
d) Share-based payment awards
The Group has granted awards to Executive Directors and senior management which include vesting conditions relating to the future 
ﬁnancial performance of the Group as measured by adjusted proﬁt before tax (‘PBT’) and the relative performance of the Group’s Total 
shareholder return (‘TSR’) against comparator companies. The fair value of the awards granted is charged against the Income Statement 
over the vesting period; the amount of that charge including the national insurance component of the charge, is dependent upon the 
Group’s estimates of how many awards will ultimately vest, which is linked directly to its estimates regarding future PBT and TSR 
achievement. Further disclosures relating to performance targets are included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 26 to 28 
and the effect on the ﬁnancial statements of share awards is included in note 25. 
4. Segmental analysis
The Group is a designer, manufacturer and distributor of luxury interior furnishings, fabrics and wallpaper. The reportable segments of the 
Group are as follows:
 – Brands UK – comprising the design, marketing, sales and distribution and licensing activities of Harlequin, Sanderson, Zoffany and 
Morris & Co. brands operated from the UK.
 – Brands Overseas – comprising the marketing, sales and distribution operations of the Group’s foreign based subsidiaries in France and 
the United States.
 – Brands Total has been added to the segmental reporting to better reﬂect the decisions made by the CODM on resource allocation.
 – Manufacturing – comprising the wall covering and printed fabric manufacturing businesses operated by Anstey and Standfast 
respectively.
This is the basis on which the Group presents its operating results to the Board of Directors, which is considered to be the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (‘CODM’) for the purposes of IFRS 8. Additional revenue-only data is also reported to the CODM and is disclosed on the 
basis explained below. Other group wide activities and expenses, predominantly related to corporate head ofﬁce costs, deﬁned beneﬁt 
pension costs, long-term incentive plans expenses, taxation and eliminations of intersegment items, are presented within ‘Eliminations 
and unallocated’.

Factors affecting current and future tax charges
No UK corporation tax is anticipated to become payable within the immediate future due to the availability of gross tax losses of 
approximately £12.6 million (201 1: £16.2 million).
No overseas taxation is anticipated to become payable within the immediate future due to the availability of gross tax losses of 
approximately £1.7 million (201 1: £1.5 million). 
Legislation has now been substantively enacted to reduce the main corporation tax rate to 25% from 1 April 2012.
However included within the recent Budget statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer were various changes to corporation tax and 
in particular to the rates to be applied from 1 April 2012. A further reduction of 1% to 24% has been proposed from 1 April 2012. The main 
corporation tax rate from that date will be 24%. In addition, it was announced that the rate will be reduced by 1% per annum to attain a rate 
of 22% by 1 April 2014.
Accordingly, the deferred tax balance at 31 January 2012, included within these ﬁnancial statements, which was calculated at a rate 
of 25%, being the rate enacted in the Finance Act (201 1), would be reduced by £43,000 assuming that the proposed rate of 24% from 
1 April 2012 is enacted. This reduction will be recognised in the ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 January 2013.
The further reductions to a rate of 22%, assuming that these are formally enacted, would result in a decrease in the deferred tax balance at 
31 January 2012 of £129,000. The deferred tax asset balance will be adjusted, in the ﬁnancial year that the change in the corporation tax 
rate is substantively enacted by Parliament. 52

13. Earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee beneﬁt trust (‘EBT’) and those held in treasury 
(note 25), which are treated as cancelled.

Impairment tests for Goodwill and Arthur Sanderson and William Morris Archive 
The carrying value of Goodwill at the year end of £559,000 (201 1: £559,000) is attributable to the manufacturing segment. The Archive is 
attributable to the Brands. 
The Group tests Goodwill and the Archive for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired.
There was no impairment charge recognised in the year (201 1: £nil). 
In assessing whether an impairment of goodwill is required the carrying value of the cash generative unit (‘CGU’) or group of CGUs is 
compared with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amounts for each CGU and collectively for groups of CGUs that make up the 
segments of the Group’s business have been based on the value in use (‘VIU’). 
The Group estimates the VIU using a discounted cash ﬂow model (‘DCF’), where the projected cash ﬂows for separate or collective groups 
of CGUs are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 6.57% (201 1: 7 .35%). The discount rate used is the same across all segments.
The Group has used formally approved budgets for the ﬁrst two years (201 1: two years) of its VIU calculation, with extrapolation beyond the last 
explicit year using an assumption of growth for future years ranging from 1 % to 2% (201 1: 1 % to 2%) depending upon the CGU being tested. 
The cash ﬂows used in the calculation of the VIU are derived from past experience and are based on operating proﬁt forecasts, which in 
turn rely upon assumptions relating to sales growth, margins and operating and administrative expenses. The cash ﬂows have not included 
the beneﬁts arising from any future asset enhancement expenditure, as this is not permitted by IAS 36. The VIU calculations therefore 
exclude signiﬁcant beneﬁts anticipated from future capital expenditure. The growth rates included within the assumptions supporting the 
VIU calculations do not therefore represent the Group’s anticipated total forecast growth, but rather only the growth deriving from capital 
expenditure completed at the Balance Sheet date.
The recoverable amount of the Archive intangible asset is estimated based on VIU, and comprises estimated future cash ﬂows from royalty 
income relating to the Archive. A discount rate of 6.57% (201 1: 7 .35%) is applied.
The Group does not consider it reasonably probable that any signiﬁcant changes to the key assumptions will arise that would result in 
impairment of either Goodwill or the Archive as at 31 January 2012.

A deferred tax asset of £2,850,000 (201 1: £3,982,000) is recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences and 
£1,086,000 (201 1: £1,421,000) has been charged to the Income Statement during the year as some of the tax losses have been utilised.

The movements in the deferred tax asset on retirement beneﬁt obligations are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
At the Balance Sheet date the Group has gross unused UK tax losses of £12.6 million (201 1: £16.2 million) available for offset against future 
proﬁts. A deferred tax asset of £2.0 million (201 1: £3. 1 million) is recognised in respect of £8.0 million (201 1: £1 1.3 million) of such losses as 
the Group believes that realisation of the related tax beneﬁt through future taxable proﬁt is probable and can be readily accessed under 
existing tax legislation. 
Note 12 details the impact of the changes to the main rates of corporation tax announced in the recent Budget on the deferred tax asset 
set out above.
 
Potential deferred tax assets at 31 January 2012 of £1,939,000 (201 1: £2,329,000) relating to tax losses and deductible temporary 
differences have not been recognised as it is not considered probable that recovery of the potential deferred tax asset will arise under 
existing tax legislation. These are summarised in the table below and comprise the following: 
 – No deferred tax has been recognised on £4.6 million (201 1: £4.9 million) of gross UK losses as these are not readily available for offset 
against the Group’s future proﬁts under existing tax legislation and therefore the realisation of these losses is not considered probable. 
 – In addition, there are gross tax losses in Overseas subsidiaries of £1,757 ,000 (201 1: £1,482,000) which are available for offset against 
future taxable proﬁts by those subsidiaries. However, the realisation of these losses is not considered probable in the foreseeable future. 
 – Other deductible temporary differences which predominantly arise on share-based payments reserves.

Unutilised tax losses – Overseas 611 519

As detailed in note 12 the main rate of corporation tax is to reduce to 22% by 1 April 2014. If these changes are enacted then the 
unrecognised deferred tax asset noted above would reduce by £159,000.
There are also unutilised capital tax losses at 31 January 2012 of £2,485,000 (201 1: £2,485,000) but no deferred tax asset has been 
recognised as it is not considered probable that these losses will be utilised.

The value of trade receivables providing funding under the Barclays facility was £7 ,224,000 (201 1: £7 ,276,000).
There is no material difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the trade and other receivables. 
Credit quality of ﬁnancial assets
(i) Neither past due nor impaired
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balances are debtors with a carrying value of £5,615,000 (201 1: £5,538,000) which are neither past 
due nor impaired at the reporting date. The nature of the Group’s business means that it has a long standing relationship with the majority 
of its customers, who either have no experience of historical default or only temporary late payments with full recovery of balances due. 
For the Group’s cash at bank, and the receivable component of derivative ﬁnancial instruments, the counterparty to the ﬁnancial 
instruments is a major UK bank and the Group does not consider there to be any signiﬁcant credit risk from holding these ﬁnancial assets. 
(ii) Past due – not individually impaired
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balances are debtors with a carrying value of £3,721,000 (201 1: £4, 1 17 ,000) which are past due at 
the reporting date for which the Group does not consider the need to create a speciﬁc impairment provision against individually identiﬁed 
debtor. The table below shows the aging analysis of the receivables:
2012 
£000
2011 
£000
1–30 days past due 1,816 1,931

61–90 days past due 370 347
91+ days past due 27 147
3,721 4,117
The Directors believe however, that in the current economic environment there is objective evidence of credit deterioration and an 
impairment of £314,000 (201 1: £253,000) representing a collective assessment of risk against debtors that are yet to be speciﬁcally 
identiﬁed. Due to the nature of the Group’s products, there is a limited amount of inventory left in the possession of customers that could 
act as collateral under terms of trade. As the value of this inventory is immaterial, it has not been disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements. 
(iii) Past due – individually impaired
As at 31 January 2012, trade receivables of £238,000 (201 1: £420,000) were individually determined to be impaired and provided for. 
The amount of the provision was £173,000 (201 1: £262,000). The main factors used to assess the impairment of trade receivables is the 
age of the balance and circumstances of the individual customer. It has been assessed that a proportion of the receivables is expected to 
be recovered.  56

Forward foreign exchange contracts
The Group’s US based subsidiary, Walker Greenbank Inc., sells products to local customers with sales invoiced in US dollars. As the 
Group’s presentation currency is sterling it is exposed to changes in the reported sterling value of these sales. The Group considers that it is 
highly probable that future sales of this nature will continue to arise over at least the next 12 months. 
During the year the Company has entered into monthly forward foreign exchange contracts up to June 2013, with a third party, to buy 
sterling and sell dollars. The Group has designated these contracts as cash ﬂow hedges of the foreign currency risk arising from the highly 
probable future forecast sales transactions. As at the reporting date the fair value of the forward foreign contracts relating to the beneﬁt on 
these anticipated future transactions is a liability of £50,000 (201 1: asset of £63,000). 
The amounts deferred in equity will be released into the Income Statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast 
transactions impact the Income Statement, which is expected to be within 15 months of the Balance Sheet date.
The Brands make more purchases from the euro zone than sales made to the euro zone. As the Group’s presentation currency is sterling it 
is exposed to changes in the reported sterling value of the purchases. The Group considers that the level of this exposure will reduce over 
the next 12 months. As at the reporting date there were no forward foreign currency contracts. 
Swap foreign exchange contracts
The Group uses swap contracts to manage its working capital exchange risk from both the foreign subsidiaries and the balances on 
debtors, creditors and cash held in foreign currency. These swap contracts are designated as Fair Value through the Income Statement.

In March 2010, the Group agreed terms to renew the Receivables and Inventory facilities from Barclays Bank PLC. The total facilities 
from Barclays Bank PLC comprises: a variable rate Term Loan secured on the Group’s freehold property which is being repaid on a 10 year 
proﬁle and Receivables and Inventory Financing Agreements which provide three year variable rate ﬂoating loans secured on the eligible 
trade receivables and eligible inventories at any point in time (the working capital facilities). The working capital facilities may be drawn down 
in either sterling or euro. 
The total Barclays Bank PLC facilities are capped at £16.5 million (201 1: £16.5 million); the utilisation of the facilities at the year end was 
£2,864,000 (201 1: £3,7 44,000). The term loan bears interest at variable rates based on a margin above the Bank of England base rate. 
The working capital facilities bear ﬁnance costs in the form of discount charges which are calculated periodically and vary at margins 
above the base rate published by Bank of England (for sterling loans) or the European Central Bank (for euro loans).
Under the Barclays Bank PLC facilities, the Group is subject to ﬁnancial covenants which apply to the term loan, being interest cover 
and debt service. The receivables and inventory ﬁnancing agreements require compliance with a number of operational covenants. Any 
non-compliance with covenants could, if not remedied or waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements. 
The Group has reported to Barclays Bank PLC that it was in full compliance with its ﬁnancial and operational covenants throughout each 
of the periods presented.  58

Deﬁned contribution schemes
The Group contributes to the deﬁned contribution section of the Abaris Holdings Limited Pension Scheme and to a Group Personal 
Pension Plan which is also a deﬁned contribution scheme. Contributions are charged to the Income Statement as incurred and amounted 
to £451,000 (201 1: £365,000). Active members of the schemes are also able to make contributions. 
Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
The Group operates the following funded deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes in the UK which offer pensions on retirement and death 
beneﬁts to members: the Walker Greenbank Pension Plan and the Abaris Holdings Limited Pension Scheme. The WG Senior Management 
Pension Scheme was effectively closed during the year. Pension beneﬁts are related to the members’ salary at retirement and their length 
of service. The schemes are closed to new members and the future accrual of beneﬁts. 
The most recent ﬁnalised triennial funding valuation for the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes was April 2009 with an updated funding valuation 
performed as at April 2010. An updated valuation for IAS 19 ﬁnancial reporting purposes has been completed at the Balance Sheet date. 
The Group’s contributions to the schemes for the year beginning 1 February 2012 are expected to be £1,583,000.

Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes continued
The principal assumptions applied when valuing the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes were:
Members are assumed to commute 25% of their pension (201 1: 25%). 
The assumptions used in determining the overall expected return on assets of the scheme have been set with reference to yields available 
on government bonds and appropriate risk margins for equities and other classes of assets. 
The mortality assumptions applied, in both years, are based on the Self Administered Pension Scheme with medium cohort effect and a 
ﬂoor of 1% p.a. on future mortality improvements. The mortality assumptions imply the expected future lifetime from age 65 as follows:
2012 2011
Non-pensioner male currently 45 23.4 23.2
Pensioner male currently 65 21.5 21.3

The Group no longer has any remaining obligations in respect of The Walker Greenbank Senior Management Pension Scheme as the two 
remaining deferred members accepted enhanced transfer values during prior year. A net settlement gain of £66,000 was included within 
net deﬁned beneﬁt costs of the prior year.
 
The actual return on assets over the period was a gain of £8, 106,000 (201 1: gain of £4, 152,000).

Long-Term Incentive Plans (‘LTIPs’)
The Group operates a Long-Term Incentive Plan. There have been ﬁve awards under this plan, in which Executive Directors and senior 
management of the Group participate. The ﬁrst award vested during 2009 and the second vested during 201 1. The LTIP has previously 
been approved by the shareholders at an Annual General Meeting. 
Awards under the scheme are granted in the form of nil-priced share options, and are to be satisﬁed either using market-purchased shares 
or by the issuing of new shares. The awards vest in full or in part dependent on the satisfaction of speciﬁed performance targets at the end 
of the vesting period applying to each plan. The number of awards that vest is dependent upon both the adjusted proﬁt before tax (‘PBT’) 
achieved for the relevant year or the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) during the vesting period within a comparator group.

Further details of vesting conditions are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 26 to 28.
The fair value at grant date of Award Two was estimated based on the share price of the Group at grant date. Award’s Three and Four 
include vesting conditions that are market based and allowance for these are included within the fair value at grant date. The weighted 
average fair value of options granted during the period (Award Five) determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model was 25.22p per 
option. The signiﬁcant inputs into the model were weighted average share price of 49.0p at the grant date, exercise price shown above, 
dividend yield of 1.94%, an expected option life of three years and an annual risk-free interest rate of 1.52%. The volatility measured at the 
standard deviation of continuously compounded share returns is based on statistical analysis of daily share prices over the last three years. 
See note 1 1 for the total expense recognised in the Income Statement for share options granted to Directors and employees.

The Group will continue to invest in the future growth of the business and to continue to pay dividends.
The Directors recommend the payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 1.00p per share (201 1: 0.80p per share) which will be payable on 10 August 
2012 to shareholders on the register at 13 July 2012. This brings the total dividend for the year to 1.20p (201 1: 0.95p).

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF WALKER GREENBANK PLC
We have audited the parent Company ﬁnancial statements of Walker 
Greenbank PLC for the year ended 31 January 2012 which comprise 
the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes. The ﬁnancial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the parent Company ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the parent Company ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom 
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all 
the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the annual report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements 
In our opinion the parent Company ﬁnancial statements: 
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs 
as at 31 January 2012;
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for 
the ﬁnancial year for which the parent Company ﬁnancial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the parent 
Company ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
 – the parent Company ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
 – certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law 
are not made; or 
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁnancial statements 
of Walker Greenbank plc for the year ended 31 January 2012

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Accounting policies
Accounting convention
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention. They have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable accounting standards and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, with the Companies Act 
2006 and with the accounting policies set out below which have been consistently applied to all periods presented unless otherwise indicated. 
Going concern
The Company meets its day to day working capital requirements through its banking facilities. The Company’s forecasts and projections, 
taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance show that the Company will be able to operate within the level of its 
current facilities as disclosed in note 9.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Therefore the Company continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its ﬁnancial statements.
Proﬁt and loss account
No Proﬁt and loss account is presented for Walker Greenbank PLC (‘the Company’) as it has applied the exemption provided by Section 
408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
A proﬁt of £733,000 (201 1: loss of £7 45,000) has been dealt with in the ﬁnancial statements of the Company.
Consolidation
These ﬁnancial statements present information relating to the entity Walker Greenbank PLC and are not consolidated. The consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements of Walker Greenbank PLC and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’) of which the Company is the parent are separately 
presented within this Annual Report and Financial Statements and are prepared in accordance with IFRS. 
Tangible ﬁxed assets
Depreciation is charged on tangible ﬁxed assets (excluding freehold land) on a straight-line basis on the original cost after deduction of any 
estimated residual value. The principal annual rates are:
Freehold buildings 2% 
Short leasehold improvements Over the unexpired period of the lease
Plant, equipment and vehicles Between 5% and 33%
Computer assets Between 12.5% and 33% 
Land and buildings were stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Impairment of tangible ﬁxed assets and investments
Fixed assets and investments are subject to review for impairment in accordance with FRS 1 1. Where impairment triggers are identiﬁed 
the recoverable amount of the relevant asset, or group of assets within an income generating unit, is determined, being the higher of value 
in use and net realisable value. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount an impairment loss is calculated. Any 
impairment is recognised in the Proﬁt and loss account in the year in which it occurs. Where impairments have been identiﬁed in prior years 
and recoverable amount was based on value in use, an updated discounted cash ﬂow is prepared annually to assess whether the previous 
impairment in value has reversed. When all conditions are met, the impairment is reversed and recognised in the proﬁt and loss in the year 
in which the reversal occurs.
Financial instruments
The Company is listed on the Alternative Investment Market regulated by The London Stock Exchange. It is not required to adopt FRS 26 
‘Financial Instruments: Measurement’ or FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ in these ﬁnancial statements and has not elected to 
voluntarily do so. 
The Company continues to adopt the amortised cost basis of accounting for ﬁnancial instruments and had not elected to voluntarily apply 
fair value measurements of ﬁnancial instruments, including derivative ﬁnancial instruments. 
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date. 
T ransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates ruling at the date of transaction. All differences are taken to the Proﬁt and loss account.
Further disclosure of the Group’s ﬁnancial risk management policies is included in note 2 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the 
Group which are separately presented from this Company’s ﬁnancial statements. 
Employee share ownership plan (‘ESOP’)
Where the Company’s issued share capital is acquired by an ESOP trust sponsored by the Company the cost of acquisition is deducted 
from the Proﬁt and loss reserve in accordance with UITF Abstract 38.  68
WALKER GREENBANK PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
1. Accounting policies continued
Employee beneﬁts – share-based payments under long-term incentive plans (‘LTIPs’)
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees of the Group which are measured at fair value and are 
recognised as an expense in the Proﬁt and loss account with a corresponding increase in equity. 
The fair values of these payments are measured at the dates of grant, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards 
are granted. The fair value is recognised over the period during which employees become conditionally entitled to the awards, subject to 
the Group’s estimate of the number of awards which will lapse, either due to employees leaving the Group prior to vesting or due to 
non-market based performance conditions not being met. The total amount recognised in the Proﬁt and loss account as an expense is 
adjusted to reﬂect the actual number of awards that vest.
National insurance contributions, related to the awards are recognised as an expense in the Proﬁt and loss account with a corresponding 
liability being recorded on the Balance Sheet.
The Company has applied the amendment to FRS 20 ‘Share-based payments – Group and treasury shares’. This is consistent with the 
requirements of UITF 44 which the Company adopted in previous years.
Under these requirements a portion of the fair value of awards granted to employees providing services to the Company’s subsidiary 
companies are recognised as an additional investment in those subsidiaries, and not as an expense of the Company. 
Employee beneﬁts – pensions
The Walker Greenbank Group operates both deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution pension schemes for the beneﬁt of its employees. 
Further details of these schemes are included in note 23 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group presented within their Annual 
Report and Financial Statements. 
Deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes are accounted for within the separate ﬁnancial statements of the Company’s trading subsidiary, Abaris Holdings 
Limited. The Company recognises contributions to deﬁned contribution schemes in respect of its employees as expenses when incurred. 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are shown in equity as a deduction, 
net of tax, from the proceeds.
Treasury shares
Consideration paid including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) on the purchase of the Company’s equity share 
capital (treasury shares) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs 
and the related income tax effects and is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity shareholders.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date and that give 
rise to an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future. Deferred tax is calculated using the average rates that are expected 
to apply when the timing differences reverse, based on tax rates that have been substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. 
No provision has been made for any liability arising from the distribution of past earnings of subsidiary undertakings. 
Deferred tax assets are only recognised when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered in the foreseeable future. 
Leases
Leases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
Company. All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases.
Assets used by the Company which have been funded through ﬁnance leases are capitalised in tangible ﬁxed assets and the resulting 
lease obligations are included in liabilities. The assets are depreciated over their useful lives and the interest element of the rental obligations 
is charged to the Proﬁt and loss account over the period of the lease, and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital 
repayments outstanding.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Proﬁt and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Rent free periods 
receivable on entering an operating lease are released on a straight line basis to the next break point in the lease. 
Cash ﬂow statement and related party transactions
The Company has applied the exemption available in FRS 8 and has decided not to disclose transactions with wholly owned 
subsidiary undertakings.
In addition, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash ﬂow statement under the terms of FRS 1.
For details of other related party transactions see note 16.

5. Investments continued
Additions in both years relate to the application of the Company’s accounting policy on share-based payments under FRS 20.
Walker Greenbank PLC is registered and domiciled in the United Kingdom. It is the parent Company of the Walker Greenbank Group.  
The principal operating companies that traded during the year, all of which are wholly owned, are as follows:
Abaris Holdings Limited – registered in England and Wales
Walker Greenbank Inc* – incorporated in the USA
Arthur Sanderson & Sons Inc* – incorporated in the USA 
Arthur Sanderson & Sons SARL * – incorporated in France
* Shares held by subsidiary company.
Investments in Group companies are Ordinary shares.
The principal activities of the Group are design, manufacture, marketing and distribution of wallcoverings, furnishing fabrics and associated 
products for the consumer market.
The carrying value of the investment in Abaris Holdings Limited is reviewed annually by reference to its value in use to the Company. The 
value in use was calculated using future expected cash ﬂow projections, discounted at 6.57% (201 1: 7 .35%) on a pre tax basis and is not 
intended to reﬂect a realisable value on disposal.
A full list of subsidiaries will be included with the next Annual Return of the Company.

Forward foreign exchange contracts
The Group’s US based subsidiary, Walker Greenbank Inc., sells products to local customers with sales invoiced in US dollars. As the 
Group’s presentation currency is sterling it is exposed to changes in the reported sterling value of these sales. The Group considers that it 
is highly probable that future sales of this nature will continue to arise over at least the next 12 months. During the year the Company has 
entered into monthly forward foreign exchange contracts up to June 2013, with a third party, to buy sterling and sell US dollars. 
The Group has designated these contracts as cash ﬂow hedges of the foreign currency risk arising from the highly probable future forecast 
sales transactions. 
As at the reporting date forward exchange contracts with a notional principal of US$4.8 million (201 1: US$4.5 million) are outstanding. 
The fair value of the forward foreign contracts relating to the beneﬁt on these anticipated future transactions is a liability of £50,000 
(201 1: asset of £63,000). 
Swap foreign exchange contracts
The Group uses swap contracts to manage its working capital exchange risk from both the foreign subsidiaries and the balances on 
debtors, creditors and cash held in foreign currency.
The use of swaps are reviewed monthly and renewed when necessary.
The swap contract held at the Balance Sheet date was reversed on 13 February 2012. There were no swap contracts held at the year 
ended 31 January 201 1.

Chairman’s 
Letter
Consort Medical has 
delivered another 
year of continued and 
consistent organic 
growth in the Bespak 
business, whilst 
expanding its future 
growth opportunities 
from both its 
development portfolio 
and its innovation 
pipeline.
Dr Peter Fellner
Consort Medical has delivered another  
year of continued and consistent organic 
growth in the Bespak business, whilst 
expanding its future growth opportunities 
from both its development portfolio and its 
innovation pipeline. In addition, the Group 
successfully completed the acquisition of 
Aesica Holdco Limited, providing significant 
additional strategic opportunities for the 
Group going forwards.
Trading
1
The Group’s revenue for the year was 
£184.8m, with EBIT of £25.1m. Bespak 
revenue grew by 5.8% to £105.8m (FY2014: 
£100.0m) with good operating leverage, as 
EBIT grew by 11.3% to £20.9m (FY2014: 
£18.8m). Aesica was part of the Group 
from mid-November, and their performance 
met our expectations from the time of the 
acquisition, with revenue of £79.0m and EBIT 
of £4.2m. Overall EPS for the period was 
47.8p (FY2014: 42.3p
2
).
EBITDA for the combined businesses, before 
special items, increased by £8.8m (36.0%) 
to £33.2m (FY2014: £24.4m). With ongoing 
major investment programmes to support 
our organic growth in Bespak, capital 
expenditure increased to £16.9m (FY2014: 
£16.3m), with £3.7m spent in Aesica. 
The Group balance sheet closed with net 
debt of £99.2m (FY2014: net cash £25.8m), 
and has significant cash resources available 
to comfortably satisfy its future growth and 
capital commitments. 
Acquisition of Aesica
When we redefined our strategy in 2008, 
we identified the opportunity to be realised 
in diversifying our business both horizontally 
to harness more of the value chain, and 
vertically into other dosage forms. Since then 
we have delivered that organically, and also 
inorganically, initially with the acquisition of 
The Medical House Limited to access auto-
injector technology. The acquisition of Aesica 
takes that strategy further forward, in a major 
step which harnesses more of the value 
chain, and adds oral dosage forms.
In recent years we have added commercial 
drug handling to Bespak’s service 
competencies. The acquisition of Aesica 
enables the Group to widen this competence 
further, by enabling combined formulation, 
device development and manufacturing, thus 
expanding our offering to pharma customers. 
This has the potential to accelerate their 
product development cycles and also to 
streamline their supply chains.
The integration programme for Aesica has 
been completed, and a number of value 
generating programmes have been initiated 
to realise the combined opportunities.
Development and Innovation 
We saw a number of important milestones 
in our product development pipeline during 
the year. Voke
®
 (DEV200, our innovative non-
electronic nicotine delivery device) received 
marketing authorisation from the Medicines 
and Healthcare Products Regulatory 
Authority (MHRA), and British American 
Tobacco have announced their expectation 
of launch later in 2015. 
We added three new development contracts 
to the pipeline during the year: two were 
for injectables, as we further strengthen our 
growing position in this sector, and another 
significant opportunity for an oral form of our 
integrated dose counter (IDC). 
We generated significant further progress 
and potential opportunities with our Syrina 
and Lila platforms, and unveiled a further 
Vapoursoft
®
 powered innovation in our 
Lapas
®
 bolus injector. These and other 
innovations have catalysed the further 
expansion of our Innovation centre, and 
we are delighted to have opened their new 
premises earlier this year in Cambridge.
Aesica has successfully implemented new 
process innovations, with the completed 
development of a semi-continuous 
formulation processing capability, and 
brought on stream the new high capacity 
plant at our Queenborough facility.

Board Changes
During the year we made two new 
appointments to the Consort Medical Board: 
Andrew Hosty and Charlotta Ginman.
Andrew joins the Nomination, Audit and 
Remuneration Committees. Andrew is Chief 
Operating Officer at Morgan Advanced 
Materials plc, an appointment he has held 
since February 2013. Andrew is also a 
Non-executive Director of British Ceramic 
Research Limited. Andrew brings significant 
operations management experience to our 
Board, and we welcome his contributions to 
the Board.
Charlotta joins the Nomination and Audit 
Committees. Charlotta qualified as a 
Chartered Accountant at Ernst & Young before 
spending a career in investment banking 
and commercial organisations, principally in 
technology-related businesses. We welcome 
Charlotta’s experience and insight.
People
I wish to thank our employees for their 
outstanding contributions over the past year, 
which have been crucial in strengthening 
the Company’s position. I also thank our 
shareholders for their continued support of 
the Company during a period encompassing 
substantial expansion and change.
Outlook
Consort has continued to deliver consistent 
organic growth from its portfolio of products 
in volume manufacturing. At the same time 
it has continued to progress and add to 
its expanding product development and 
innovation pipelines with new projects,  
know-how and platform development in 
device development to enable this broad 
growth to continue.
The acquisition of Aesica brings significant 
further know-how and process technology 
to Consort’s range of pharma services. This 
will enable further organic growth within both 
Bespak and Aesica individually, and jointly as 
the two businesses combine their expertise 
to provide joined up development and supply 
chain solutions to satisfy customers’ needs.
The Board is confident that this enlarged 
pipeline of opportunities and capabilities 
will underpin its growth ambitions, and is 
confident of meeting its expectations for the 
coming financial year. 
Dividend
The Board has reviewed the dividend, and 
is proposing an unchanged final dividend of 
11.68p (FY2014: 11.68p restated for rights 
issue), making a total dividend for the year of 
18.11p (FY2014: 18.11p). Before adjusting 
for the effect of the rights issue made in 
the year, this equates to a final dividend of 
13.35p (FY2014: 13.35p), and a full year 
dividend of 20.7p (FY2014: 20.7p). The 
dividend will be paid on 23 October 2015 to 
shareholders on the register at 25 September 
2015, following our AGM on 3 September 
2015.

Why Invest?
Consort Medical is a 
leading global contract 
development and 
manufacturing organisation 
(CDMO), providing 
advanced delivery 
technologies, formulation 
and manufacturing 
solutions for drugs. The 
Group’s customers include 
some of the world’s 
largest pharmaceutical 
companies.
The Group comprises two integrated 
operating divisions:
Bespak — a global market leader in the 
development and manufacture of drug 
delivery devices, serving pharmaceutical 
companies with inhaler and auto-injector 
technologies and development and 
manufacturing services.
Aesica — a leading pharmaceutical CDMO 
serving pharmaceutical companies with 
active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and 
finished dose formulation development and 
manufacturing services.
Optimising world-class drug delivery device 
development and manufacture, together with 
drug API and finished dose formulation and 
manufacture, within the Group streamlines 
and accelerates our pharmaceutical 
customers’ drug route to market.
Here are some of the key motivations for 
investment in Consort Medical plc:
1
 Long-term Contracts
Consort Medical serves pharmaceutical and 
Life Science customers with drug/device 
development, formulation and manufacturing 
services, all of which, typically, have long 
life cycles. Devices and drug manufacturing 
sites are defined and licensed as part of 
the drug master file, and hence sourcing is 
protected. Pharmaceutical customers invest 
significant resources in launching, marketing 
and building the treatment franchises which 
often have high rates of repeat prescription. 
Accordingly, the core business demand 
is typically stable, predictable and often 
recurring, thereby providing relatively high 
visibility of future revenues.
2
 Premium Quality and 
Regulatory Expertise
Consort Medical operates in a highly 
regulated environment and the quality 
standards required are world class. Aesica 
has made significant investments in facilities 
and technology with the aim of ensuring 
“best in class” quality and reliability. Aesica’s 
manufacturing capabilities include high 
capacity, high potency and innovative semi-
continuous manufacturing. Bespak is one 
of only a handful of operators globally who 
have the process know-how and expertise to 
consistently deliver Six Sigma quality on such 
a high volume of medical components and 
devices.
The Group leverages this significant process 
and production know-how, operating a dual 
strategy of the contract manufacturing of 
customer products and, through Bespak, the 
supply of its own proprietary delivery device 
technologies, the IP for which is heavily 
protected. This value delivery to the customer 
yields attractive margins, whilst affording 
protection from potential new market 
entrants. In many cases Consort Medical is 
heavily embedded within the supply chains of 
its customers.
Core business demand 
is typically stable, 
predictable and often 
recurring, thereby 
providing relatively 
high visibility of future 
revenues.

 Diversified Pharma 
Services Offering and Product 
Development Portfolio
A key feature of Consort Medical’s strategy 
is the diversification of its pharmaceutical 
services offering. In Bespak’s devices 
arena, this diversification strategy has 
taken the business from respiratory into 
injectables, nasal, ocular and point-of-
care (POC) diagnostics (horizontal). The 
acquisition of Aesica has extended the 
Group’s pharmaceutical services offering 
into the highly complementary areas of drug 
formulation, manufacture, handling and 
packaging (vertical). This deeper, integrated, 
single source pharmaceutical services offering 
will allow the Group to capture greater value 
from the supply chain in a market where 
customers are increasing outsourcing. 
Such an offering is highly differentiated from 
Consort Medical’s competitors.
4
 High Level of Innovation
The Group remains at the leading edge of 
innovation and is committed to investing in 
patient and customer driven innovation with 
the potential to create new treatments, new 
markets and new opportunities.
FY2015 saw Aesica’s new High Capacity 
Manufacturing Facility at Queenborough 
commence production; development of the 
semi-continuous manufacturing process; 
and, in Pianezza, serialisation services were 
successfully introduced.
Bespak’s Innovation team in Cambridge 
continues to develop novel drug delivery 
device offerings which are expected to 
evolve into specific commercial opportunities. 
Following on from the unveiling of the first 
liquid gas powered auto-injector (Syrina
®
) 
and the first dual product injector (Lila
®
) in 
2013, Bespak saw the approval and launch 
of its first auto-injector; the first development 
contract award for an Innovation Centre-
developed product; and a new bolus injector 
platform (Lapas
®
) unveiled during this 
financial year.
The Innovation Centre’s novel IP-protected 
product offerings are proceeding through 
commercialisation and present significant 
organic growth opportunities for the Group. 
The innovation pipeline contains several other 
candidates with the potential to create further 
shareholder value in the future.
5
 Inorganic Growth 
Opportunities
Following the acquisition and successful 
integration of Aesica during this financial 
year, the Group is a leading global contract 
development and manufacturing organisation 
(CDMO), providing advanced delivery 
technologies, formulation development and 
manufacturing solutions for drugs. Consort 
Medical has a clear strategy for growth and 
whilst this will be mostly organic in focus, 
the Group can also develop in its chosen 
strategy through further selective, relevant 
and value-enhancing acquisitions.
The management team regularly evaluates 
acquisition and investment opportunities 
in complementary adjacent markets and 
technologies which have the potential to 
leverage the Group’s core competencies in 
drug formulation, manufacturing and delivery 
and capture additional value in the drug/
device supply chain.
The Aesica acquisition has increased the 
scale of the Group, expanding its capabilities 
and providing further opportunities to 
facilitate growth, both organically and through 
further acquisitions, in the future. With a 
conservative capital structure, the Group has 
financial resources available to realise this.
6
 Strong Management Team
Consort Medical’s management team has 
executed successfully the chosen strategy 
of sustained/diversified organic growth, 
selective investments and acquisitions, 
and operating leverage. Consort Medical 
has been transformed under this strategy, 
with the Group strengthening its base of 
core competencies and leveraging them in 
strategic growth initiatives.
The management team has significant M&A 
experience, acquiring and successfully 
integrating Aesica into the Group during this 
financial year; realising 19.0× EBITDA for the 
King Systems disposal in 2013; making key 
equity investments into Atlas Genetics; and 
acquiring, and subsequently commercialising, 
injectables technology through the acquisition 
of The Medical House.

Bespak Division
Bespak’s business model is built to support 
two principal goals: 
1. Helping our customers succeed in 
commercialising their own designs of drug 
delivery devices; and
2. Developing proprietary designs of drug 
delivery devices for sale to blue-chip 
pharmaceutical and Life Sciences 
customers.
To this aim, Bespak has, and will, continue its 
diversification of the drug delivery segments 
in which it operates, as well as increasing 
its share of the value-added content in the 
supply chain. 
To date, Bespak has evolved the range 
of drug delivery opportunities from its 
origins in the respiratory segment to that 
of injectables, nasal, ocular and point-of-
care diagnostics. Bespak has also further 
enhanced its share of the value added in 
the supply chain beyond that of product 
design, development, industrialisation and 
commercial manufacturing operations, and 
into the handling of drugs for the purposes of 
clinical trials and commercial market release 
on behalf of its customers.
Bespak has developed significant core 
capabilities, competencies and processes 
developed through strategic investments in 
skills, technologies and infrastructure that 
provide for the best long-term growth and 
profitability prospects based on the value 
they deliver to our customers, whether based 
on either customer-owned or Bespak-owned 
Intellectual Property.
Aesica Division
Aesica’s business model has, historically, 
been built on four key pillars:
1. Strategic partners;
2. Geography;
3. Technology; and 
4. Organic growth.
The combination of 
Bespak and Aesica 
allows the Group to 
provide a broad, clear 
and integrated drug/
device service offering 
to pharmaceutical 
customers.

Aesica considers strategic partners to be 
those where there is potential to create 
significant revenues across the Aesica 
network. As the industry is shifting towards 
supply chain consolidation, Aesica focuses 
on the retention and formation of strong 
partnerships with global pharmaceutical 
companies, generics companies and regional 
players through new business development 
and key account management.
Aesica’s goal is to broaden its technology 
offering through both acquisition and 
innovation and, in 2012, the Aesica 
Innovation Board was established to identify 
and commercialise technologies. Aesica’s 
intention is to continue to achieve organic 
growth by building on Aesica’s foundations 
of new business development, key account 
management, project management and 
continuous improvement.
Group
Both Aesica and Bespak are pharmaceutical 
services businesses with virtually identical 
target customer bases. Whilst the divisions 
have several customers in common, 
currently, a number are exclusive to either 
Aesica or Bespak. The combination of 
two such complementary pharmaceutical 
services providers allows the Group to 
provide a significantly broader, deeper 
and more integrated drug/device contract 
manufacturing and supply chain solution to 
its customers.
As well as driving the individual Aesica and 
Bespak divisions, as a larger pharmaceutical 
services company, the Group’s business 
model is to offer existing and prospective 
new customers a single source supply 
chain solution for drug and delivery device 
development, formulation, manufacturing 
and packaging. Optimising drug and device 
services in a single group will streamline 
and accelerate the route of drugs to market 
and reduce the cost and complexity of 
drug/device development for the Group’s 
pharmaceutical partners. 
Consort Medical’s Core

Future Development
The global pharmaceutical contract 
manufacturing market is estimated to have 
generated approximately US$13.4bn in 
revenue in 2012. The market is forecast to 
grow to approximately US$18.5bn in 2017, 
a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 
6.6% over this period. If the trend towards 
outsourcing in the pharmaceutical market 
continues as expected, we believe that the 
demand for an integrated service offering 
from a single provider will increase. 
Bringing Aesica’s drug formulation, 
manufacturing and packaging capabilities 
into the same group as Bespak’s delivery 
device development and manufacturing has 
created a leading, global, single source drug 
and device contract manufacturing partner 
for pharmaceutical customers.
The Group can now provide a significantly 
broader, deeper and more integrated drug/
device contract manufacturing and supply 
chain solution to our customers in this 
growing market. The Group’s strategy is to 
continue building on, and strengthening, our 
core Aesica and Bespak divisions through 
increased market reach; innovation in new 
products, processes and technologies; and 
by capturing more of the drug/device value 
chain. In addition, as a larger pharmaceutical 
services company, we will offer existing 
and prospective new customers a single 
source supply chain solution for drug and 
delivery device development, formulation, 
manufacturing and packaging. 
Optimising drug and device services in a 
single group will streamline and accelerate 
the route of drugs to market and reduce 
the cost and complexity of drug/device 
development for the Group’s pharmaceutical 
partners. We believe that such an offering is 
highly differentiated from Consort Medical’s 
current competitors.

Our Strategy by Market
Inhaled
The respiratory sector is estimated at 
US$24bn drug sales and £272m of device 
sales in 2013 with the device revenues 
predicted to deliver a CAGR of 3% to 2016. 
The respiratory sector is one of the most 
highly regulated, resulting in high barriers 
to entry. A number of key drugs are shortly 
coming “off patent”, resulting in a number 
of new generic entrants and associated 
opportunities for Bespak to supply both 
metered dose inhaler (MDI) and dry powder 
inhaler (DPI) devices. Although sales remain 
relatively flat in the traditional Western 
economies, significant volume growth is 
being seen in emerging markets, with the 
Brazilian, Russian, Indian and Chinese 
(BRIC) markets becoming more important to 
Bespak.
Strategy
The Group intends to increase its share of the 
respiratory market through the development 
of new drug delivery devices; selling into 
new and developing geographical markets; 
and offering customers finished dose 
formulation and manufacturing services as 
well as integrated drug/device development, 
formulation and manufacturing services. The 
Group intends to maintain its competitive 
position by continuing to leverage continuous 
improvement activities as products move into 
the mature stage of their product life cycle.
Injectable
The auto-injector sector is a relatively high 
growth market, the end drug market of which 
is estimated at US$175bn in 2013 with a 
CAGR of 5% to 2016. Growth is being driven 
by a large number of new drugs coming to the 
market for the first time that require delivery 
by injection. Whilst Bespak currently has a 
negligible share of this market, it is estimated 
that circa 40% of all new drugs in development 
will be delivered parenterally and may, 
therefore, require some form of auto-injector. 
Many of these new “large molecule” biologic 
drugs are highly viscous and require specialist 
devices to enable them to be effectively 
administered, often by patients themselves 
in a non-clinical environment. The continued 
drive to greater self-administration with 
the associated improvements to patient 
compliance, patient outcomes and healthcare 
economics will create significant opportunities 
for the Group to develop and manufacture 
auto-injectors to meet these needs. 
In 2013 Consort Medical commercially 
unveiled the Syrina
®
, Vapoursoft
®
 and 
Lila
®
 injection technology ranges. In 2014 
we commercially unveiled Lapas
®
, a new 
range of innovative wearable bolus injection 
devices powered by Vapoursoft
®
. All of 
these technologies leverage Bespak’s 
expertise and IP in gas propulsion and, 
using IP acquired through the acquisition of 
The Medical House, combine them into a 
family of innovative next-generation auto-
injectors. These innovative drug delivery 
devices demonstrate Bespak’s capabilities 
from device feasibility, concept and initial 
design through device development and 
also demonstrate the ability of the Innovation 
Team to deliver product diversification 
opportunities in the drug delivery sector.
Strategy
Consort Medical’s Syrina
®
, Lila
®
 and Lapas
®
 
range of auto-injectors positions the Group 
well to participate in this growing market. Our 
strategy is focused on the commercialisation 
of the existing pipeline in conjunction with the 
development of further IP and the exploitation 
of “innovation on demand” opportunities 
through the growing Innovation Team in 
Cambridge. Consort Medical intends to 
continue to move up the value chain by 
offering assembly and drug handling and 
will continue to look for additional, selective 
acquisitions in this area.
Nasal
The nasal drug market was estimated to 
be worth circa £8.9bn in 2013 with the 
associated device sales being £310m. The 
CAGR is estimated at 2.4% through to 
2016 with growth being delivered from two 
main areas. Firstly, a number of existing 
branded drugs are coming off patent 
leading to generic entrants all requiring their 
own delivery system as the original device 
associated with the branded drug is normally 
unavailable to them. Secondly, the nasal 
drug delivery route is extremely effective 
and a number of existing and new drugs 
are being reformulated to enable delivery in 
this way, increasing demand for this type 
of drug delivery product. This is now a 
strategic market for Consort Medical and it 
currently has two firm development pipeline 
opportunities. 
Strategy
Our strategy for the nasal market is 
focused on the delivery of Bespak’s existing 
development programmes plus further 
exploitation of the Group’s growing IP 
portfolio via a number of “innovation on 
demand” opportunities. In addition, the 
Group intends to offer customers finished 
dose formulation and manufacturing 
services as well as an integrated drug/device 
development, formulation and manufacturing 
services.
Ocular
The global ophthalmic drugs market was 
estimated to be worth approximately US$16 
billion in 2012 with an estimated CAGR 
of 5.2% to 2018. The global ophthalmic 
drugs market is driven by key factors such 
as rising prevalence of ocular disorders 
such as diabetic retinopathy and macular 
degeneration, largely driven by the rising 
percentage of ageing population in the world.
Strategy
Consort Medical believes that there are 
market opportunities in the ocular segment 
for a device offering low dispensed volumes 
consistently and repeatedly. Bespak has 
been evaluating, and continues to evaluate, 
conceptual designs and early stage devices 
to better understand the dynamics of delivery 
mechanisms for such minute doses.
Our Strategy

Oral
Aesica’s oral delivery capabilities and drug 
formulation and manufacturing services are 
highly complementary to Bespak’s business. 
The oral drug delivery market was valued 
at US$49 billion in 2010 with an estimated 
CAGR of 10.3% to 2017, reflecting an 
increase in demand for innovative oral drugs. 
The implementation of different technologies 
for oral drug delivery is changing the market 
scenario, with this area receiving high levels 
of attention from pharmaceutical companies 
due to the advantages that research can 
provide, such as reformulations, which can 
reposition drugs and delay patent expiry.
Strategy
The Group’s strategy is to continue to drive 
organic growth in oral drug formulation 
and manufacture by building on Aesica’s 
foundations of new business development, 
key account management, project 
management and continuous improvement.
Nicotine Delivery
Although the non-tobacco nicotine delivery 
market is relatively new and fragmented 
and, therefore, difficult to analyse in terms 
of market size and market value, there is a 
consensus that it is a rapidly growing and 
dynamic market. The key drivers for this 
growth are the consumer and regulatory 
appetite for safer alternatives to tobacco 
smoking, coupled with the associated public 
health and healthcare economic benefits.
Strategy
Consort Medical’s approach to the nicotine 
delivery sector is to successfully industrialise 
and commercialise Nicovations’ Voke
®
 
device, and then to increase the value 
add content, and exploit wider geographic 
opportunities as the business and market 
develop.
Point of Care (POC) Diagnostics
The global market for POC diagnostics 
is estimated to have been approximately 
US$15.5 billion in 2013. The market is 
forecast to grow to approximately US$19.3 
billion in 2018, a CAGR of 4.5% over the 
period from 2013 to 2018. Market growth 
is being driven by the combined benefits 
of increased patient compliance, improved 
patient outcomes and lower cost of provision. 
Pharmaceutical companies are looking to 
exploit POC systems as part of a companion 
diagnostics strategy where drugs and 
tests are sold as combined “test and treat” 
packages.
Strategy
The Company’s POC Diagnostics strategy is 
focused on the commercialisation of the Atlas 
Genetics device as a first stage penetration of 
the market. Following a successful outcome 
to this programme, Consort Medical intends 
to leverage the Group’s development, 
manufacturing and regulatory know-how 
in order to grow its market share, possibly 
in conjunction with additional selective 
investments or acquisitions.

Summary of Financial 
Performance
Revenue increased by £84.8m (84.8%) 
to £184.8m (FY2014: £100.0m); Bespak 
delivered continuing growth of 5.8% to 
£105.8m (FY2014: £100.0m), notably 
from continuing market penetration from 
the Chiesi NEXThaler
®
 and Dr. Reddy’s 
Sumatriptan auto-injector. Aesica contributed 
£79.0m of revenue in the 5.5 months since 
its acquisition in November 2014. Using 
exchange rates assumed in the acquisition, 
Aesica’s revenues would have been £83.3m 
and EBIT before special items £4.7m, 
reflecting Euro exchange rate headwinds 
since the acquisition (from €1.2:£1 to 
€1.33:£1).
Operating profit before special items 
increased by 33.5% to £25.1m (FY2014: 
£18.8m); this included 11.3% growth from 
Bespak to £20.9m (FY2014: £18.8m), which 
continues to deliver strong operating leverage 
from higher revenues. The Bespak EBIT 
includes a reduced central cost allocation 
of £0.8m, without which its EBIT growth 
would have been £1.4m or 7.3% at £20.1m. 
Aesica contributed £4.2m to EBIT in the 
5.5 month period since acquisition, after an 
allocation of central costs of £0.8m. Group 
operating margin reduced to 13.6% as 
expected following the acquisition of Aesica; 
the Bespak operating margin grew to 19.8% 
(FY2014: 18.8%), and the Aesica operating 
margin in the period was 5.2%, including 
the central cost allocation of £0.8m. Using 
exchange rates assumed in the acquisition, 
Aesica’s revenue would have been £83.3m 
and EBIT before special items £4.7m, 
reflecting Euro exchange rate headwinds 
since the acquisition (from €1.2:£1 to 
€1.33:£1)
Special items amount to £17.2m in the 
year (FY2014: £1.4m). This comprises: 
Aesica acquisition costs of £5.4m; Aesica 
integration costs of £1.9m; amortisation of 
intangible assets of £6.8m (FY2014: £0.8m), 
being £0.8m relating to The Medical House, 
and £6.0m relating to Aesica; accelerated 
amortisation of upfront facility fees of £0.3m; 
and other costs of £2.8m which include the 
unwinding of the uplift in the book value of 
inventory held by Aesica on acquisition, as 
required by accounting standards.

 (excluding contingent consideration 
payable and receivables) increased £21.2m 
to £34.1m (FY2014: £12.9m) which 
represents 12.3% of sales (FY2014: 12.9%). 
Capital expenditure of £20.7m (FY2014: 
£16.3m) included £16.9m from Bespak as 
the business continued to make significant 
planned investments in facilities and 
production capacity to fulfil its development 
pipeline contracts.
The Group balance sheet closed with a 
net debt position of £99.2m (FY2014: net 
cash £25.8m), representing gearing of 2.3x 
Net Debt: EBITDA, comfortably within the 
banking facility covenant (maximum 3.25x), 
and in line with our expectations at the time 
of the Aesica acquisition. Interest cover was 
19.8x against a covenant minimum of 3.0x. 
The Group has comfortable cash resource 
availability.
The Board is proposing an unchanged 
final dividend of 11.68p (FY2014: 11.68p), 
making a total dividend for the year of 18.11p 
(FY2014: 18.11p). Before adjusting for the 
effect of the rights issue made in the year, 
this equates to a final dividend of 13.35p 
(FY2014: 13.35p), and a full year dividend of 
20.7p (FY2014: 20.7p). Further commentary 
on the financial results is contained in the 
Bespak and Aesica business reviews below, 
and within the Financial Review.
Acquisition of Aesica 
Consort Medical acquired Aesica Holdco 
Limited on 12 November 2014 for a total 
consideration of £226.6m, following approval 
at an EGM on 16 October 2014. Aesica 
is highly complementary to Bespak, and 
the combination provides clear strategic, 
competitive and value enhancing benefits, 
as well as a number of opportunities for the 
enlarged Group consistent with Consort’s 
diversification strategy:
•	 It diversifies the Group into adjacent 
markets and technologies, to capture 
additional value in the drug/device supply 
chain: horizontally into oral delivery, 
and vertically into drug formulation and 
manufacturing.
•	 Strengthens strategic market position: 
together Bespak and Aesica provide a 
broader, deeper and more integrated 
pharma services offering. It optimises drug 
and delivery devices in a single group to 
streamline, accelerate and reduce the 
cost of drug/device development and 
manufacturing for pharma customers. 
•	 Captures greater value from the supply 
chain: big pharma are seeking fewer, 
yet deeper, CDMO partnerships. The 
acquisition increases the depth of 
customer relationships by embedding the 
enlarged Group at multiple levels in the 
drug and delivery device supply chain.
•	 Geographic expansion: this expands the 
Group’s production facilities into mainland 
Europe. We envisage establishing Bespak 
production lines in Aesica’s overseas 
regulated facilities. The combination 
also increases our sales presence and 
customer access globally.
•	 Operational benefits: the acquisition 
provides development, manufacturing and 
operational efficiencies.
•	 Revenue benefits: future revenue synergies 
are expected from new drug/device 
combinations, as well as cross selling 
between Bespak and Aesica’s highly 
complementary pharma customer bases.
•	 Increases scale and critical mass: 
the acquisition creates a much larger 
pharmaceutical services business, in 
breadth, depth and geographies. This 
scale will facilitate further growth, both 
organically, and through additional 
acquisitions.
Integration and Future Roadmap
Following completion of the acquisition, the 
Group initiated a rapid (three month) but 
comprehensive integration programme in 
order to achieve the following:
•	 Commercial orientation: bring the 
commercial teams together to fully 
understand each other’s service offerings, 
to identify cross selling and integrated 
commercial offerings opportunities, and to 
plan their realisation.
•	 Reorganisation/Initiatives: further validate 
and realise the potential synergies and 
opportunities identified in due diligence 
from combining the two businesses. 
Make appropriate reorganisation actions 
to realise the identified synergies and 
opportunities, and initiate processes to 
realise longer-term benefits.
•	 Alignment: align the Aesica business 
with the Consort Medical controls and 
management systems.
The following has been implemented as a 
result of this integration process:
Alignment
A number of initiatives have been completed 
to align Aesica’s controls, policies and 
reporting with the Group. These are 
described in more detail in the Financial 
Review.

Reorganisation/Initiatives
•	 Newcastle: this has been changed from 
a corporate head office to a shared 
services centre for certain Aesica-wide 
key business processes and UK financial 
accounting. The Newcastle office will be 
closed and the shared services centre 
migrated to alternative premises locally, at 
a cash cost of c.£1.2m.
•	 Monheim restructuring: this process 
was already planned at the time of the 
acquisition, and is a major restructuring of 
Operations to improve productivity of the 
site. This will result in the reconfiguration of 
the activities, and headcount reductions, at 
a cash cost of £3.0m.
•	 Nottingham site relocation: the 
Formulation development activities from 
the Nottingham site are to be moved to 
existing facilities (that will be refurbished) 
at Queenborough. This progressive move 
is expected to be completed over the next 
six months, at a cash cost of c.£3.5m.
•	 Leadership: the leadership of the 
Aesica business has been reorganised, 
consolidating a number of duplicate 
corporate activities, and reconfigured as a 
divisional structure under the direction of 
Ian Muir as divisional MD. 
 The majority of the divisional team will 
be co-located at the existing Consort 
corporate offices in Hemel Hempstead.
•	 Procurement: whilst the direct materials 
of the Bespak and Aesica business are 
dissimilar, their combined overhead 
spends provide opportunities to 
leverage procurement benefits to the 
enlarged group, and a Procurement 
Forum comprising the two businesses’ 
Purchasing teams has been created to 
realise these benefits.
Commercial
A core aspect of the acquisition rationale was 
to harness cross-selling opportunities, and 
to secure development and manufacturing 
opportunities for combined formulation and 
device services.
Following the acquisition, the Bespak and 
Aesica commercial teams have worked 
closely together to better understand each 
other’s capabilities and strengths. They now 
have the joint mission to support their core 
divisional activities, to facilitate introductions 
for their sister division’s commercial teams to 
access their core customer relationships, and 
to work together jointly to secure combined 
formulation and device contracts.
Since the acquisition, a number of meetings 
have been held with customers, from senior 
executive level collaborative meetings 
between commercial and technical teams 
working on specific business opportunities. 
Customers’ reaction to the combination of 
the businesses has been positive, reinforcing 
our strong belief in the attractiveness and 
strategic relevance of the combination to 
Pharma partners.
Both Bespak and Aesica have gained 
meaningful access to customers whom they 
had previously not been acquainted with for 
their respective discrete service offerings.
A significant number of joint meetings have 
also been held looking at joint service offering 
to customers, with good traction on live 
opportunities. Whilst it is still early days in a 
long business development cycle, we are 
encouraged by the speed of access and 
progress on live opportunities.

Funding
The £226.6m consideration for the acquisition was financed through a rights issue, drawn down under a new debt facility, existing cash and the 
issue of new ordinary shares to Aesica management. The sources and uses were as follows:
Sources £m Uses £m
Rights issue (gross proceeds) £98.9m Cash consideration £214.2m
New debt £115.9m Shares to Aesica management £10.8m
New shares £10.8m Transaction costs £11.8m
Existing cash £11.2m
Total £236.8m Total £236.8m
The rights issue was structured as 5 for 8 
shares, priced at 540p, representing a 34% 
discount to the Theoretical Ex Rights Price 
(TERP). It was strongly subscribed to by 
shareholders — 96%, with the 4% rump 
placed very swiftly following closure. All 
Consort directors who were shareholders 
took up their rights in full.
A new debt package was established with 
Barclays, Lloyds, RBS and Santander as 
participants: a £160m, multi-currency, 
revolving facility over five years, replacing the 
existing facilities. A further £65m accordion 
facility was included.
Financials
Aesica has a consistent track record of 
revenue and EBITDA growth and is cash 
generative — the significant majority of 
revenues are contracted and recurring, 
resulting in strong visibility of future revenues. 
Aesica’s 2013 revenue was £179.0m 
and EBITDA of £20.0m. The acquisition 
generates enlarged Group FY2014 pro forma 
revenues of £279.0m and pro forma EBITDA 
of £44.4m.
The acquisition is expected, pre synergies, 
to be materially EPS enhancing in FY2016 
and materially EPS enhancing in subsequent 
financial years.
The pro forma opening leverage was 2.3x 
enlarged Group underlying EBITDA, with 
leverage reduction to <2.0x net debt/
underlying EBITDA within the first full financial 
year.
Revenue synergies are expected from 
the integration of the Bespak and Aesica 
businesses, with significant opportunities for 
cross selling between highly complementary 
pharma customer bases.

Background on Aesica
Aesica is a leading, full service provider 
of contract research, development and 
manufacturing services for finished dose 
forms and APIs to the global pharmaceutical 
industry.
Revenues in 2013 were £179.0m, 84% of 
which was in Finished Dose Manufacturing, 
4% in Finished Dose Development, 12% 
in API development and manufacturing 
services.
Aesica has a number of strengths and  
key attractions: 
•	 Strong technology base and enhanced 
capabilities: significant investment has 
already been made in facilities and 
technologies with the aim of ensuring 
“best in class” quality and reliability. Aesica 
has developed an innovative continuous 
manufacturing process, and has dedicated 
high capacity and high potency drug 
manufacturing units at Queenborough.
•	 Broad geographic footprint: c.1,250 
employees across six manufacturing and 
development facilities in the UK, Germany 
and Italy, supplying products globally. 
Aesica has a sales reach into the key 
pharma markets of US, Europe, Japan  
and China.
•	 Complementary blue-chip customer 
base: deep relationships with a number 
of blue-chip, global pharma companies 
including GSK, J&J (Noramco), Merck and 
UCB. Aesica’s customer base is highly 
complementary to Consort’s.
•	 Heavily embedded customer relationships: 
Aesica has a strong competitive position 
due to deep, long-term customer 
relationships, technological know-how, 
and local regulatory environments. It is 
heavily embedded in the supply chains of 
its customers.
•	 Strong financial performance: Aesica has 
a consistent track record of revenue and 
EBITDA growth and is cash generative. 
The significant majority of revenues are 
contracted and recurring resulting in strong 
visibility of future revenues.
Strategy update
The strategy for the Group following the 
integration of Aesica remains unchanged. 
Core principles of strategy articulated and 
executed since 2008 are constant. However, 
we have refreshed our articulation of these 
strategic priorities for the enlarged Group:
Old
Operating leverage
Organic growth: New product portfolio
Organic growth: Diversify to adjacent markets
Organic growth: Higher value models
Enhancement/Acquisition
New
Organic growth: Leverage core strengths
Organic growth: Broaden services offering
Organic growth: Capture more of value chain
Operating leverage: Margin expansion
Drive Innovation
Enhancement/Acquisition
Organic Growth: Leverage Core 
Strengths/Business With Existing 
and New Customers
Both Bespak and Aesica have core strengths, 
capabilities, and customer relationships 
in both drug delivery devices and drug 
formulation development and manufacturing. 
Our strategy is to leverage these strengths, 
capabilities and relationships within each of 
the devices and formulation businesses to 
win new devices and formulation business 
from existing and new customers.
Organic Growth: Broaden Group 
Services Offering to Capture 
Adjacent Markets and Territories
The acquisition of Aesica provides a 
significant broadening of the Group’s services 
offering to customers. The Group will 
continue to broaden its capabilities in different 
devices and formulation technologies to 
capture adjacent markets.
Organic Growth: Capturing More 
of the Value Chain
Bespak’s organic move into commercial 
drug handling already accessed more value 
in device-related services. The acquisition 
of Aesica allows the Group to extend this to 
capture more of the value chain in specific 
customer/drug opportunities, enabling a 
single integrated supply chain model of  
drug API, formulation and device 
development and manufacturing.
Operating Leverage: Margin 
Expansion from Volume Growth 
and On-Going Cost Efficiency
We have strong business infrastructures 
which provide our competence offerings to 
customers. We will continue to harness the 
operating leverage which comes from driving 
greater volumes through our businesses, 
whilst continuing to deliver cost efficiencies 
and continuous improvement.
Innovation: Drive Innovation 
to Develop New Device and 
Formulation Technologies
Bespak has developed a dynamic and 
successful innovation model, generating  
new device platforms and capabilities.  
Aesica has also been successful in 
developing new formulations, and new 
formulation process technologies. We will 
continue to invest to organically develop 
innovative device and formulation offerings to 
existing and adjacent markets.
Enhancement: Selective 
Acquisitions and Investments
The core of our strategy continues to be 
the development and enhancement of 
organic growth. Our investments in Atlas 
Genetics, and the acquisitions of The Medical 
House and Aesica, are consistent with this 
enhancement. With this in mind, we will 
continue to evaluate suitable opportunities 
to further enhance our core capabilities with 
further investments/acquisitions to increase 
our customer offerings.

Sales of the Chiesi NEXThaler
®
 continued 
to grow strongly, with device sales up 36%. 
Further territory launches took place during 
the year, further underpinning these sales, 
and we continue with the extension to the 
manufacturing capacity at King’s Lynn to 
support the customer’s growth ambitions 
for this product. Sales of DPI (Dry Powder 
Inhaler) devices were also lifted by significant 
sales of pre-production development devices 
on the DEV610 programme.
The Dr. Reddy’s Sumatriptan auto-injector 
has sold strongly since its launch in February 
2014, and during this year, performing ahead 
of our expectations.
With the Bespak development pipeline now 
boasting 12 programmes, service revenue 
has continued to grow, up 19% in the year as 
we expand our industrialisation activities to 
progress these opportunities.
Bespak continued to perform strongly in 
operating margin and EBITDA margin, with 
the incremental volumes dropping through 
strongly to the bottom line, improving 
operating margin from 18.8% to 19.8%. With 
revenues increasing 5.8%, EBITDA grew 
7.3% and operating profit increased 11.3% 
to £20.9m.
Capital expenditure continued at higher 
levels than historic norms, as expected, 
as investments continued to support the 
major programmes advancing through the 
Development pipeline towards launch. Capital 
expenditure was therefore similar to the prior 
year at £16.9m (FY2014: £16.3m).
We have continued to develop our people 
and working environment on a number of 
fronts. Growing our skills and management/
leadership capabilities are core elements in 
delivering our planned growth. Training and 
development has continued in the year with 
the delivery of a management development 
programme which is mid-way through 
its scheduled roll-out, with good results. 
We have also continued the expansion of 
our apprenticeship programme, with the 
recruitment of four additional apprentices, 
and expect to add further recruits over the 
next year. We have continued to deliver on 
initiatives commenced following employee 
survey feedback, and have continued 
the Values communication and training 
programme. These values are Customer 
Focus, Integrity, Respect, Team Work and 
Results Driven and will be the focus of how 
we manage the business.
Significant investment has continued in 
development of the facilities at Kings Lynn 
and Milton Keynes, to accommodate our 
growth in production volumes both for 
currently launched products and for products 
currently in development. Most notably, 
the facilities for the expansion of the Chiesi 
NEXThaler
®
 are well advanced, DEV200 
(Nicovations) in Kings Lynn and Milton 
Keynes are complete and equipped, and 
construction of DEV610 was completed in 
May 2015 and equipping has commenced. 
In January 2015, we announced Consort’s 
subscription for a further investment of 
£2.2m in Atlas Genetics Ltd (“Atlas”) as part 
of a £12.7m Series C funding. Consort’s 
subscription was proportionate to its existing 
17.3% shareholding in Atlas (15.2% on a 
fully diluted basis). Consort has invested a 
total to date of £6.3m in the company, which 
develops ultra-rapid point-of-care diagnostic 
tests for infectious diseases. Atlas’ io
®
 system 
is at an advanced stage of development and 
is expected to be launched in Europe with a 
test for chlamydia later this year. The Series 
C investment is being used to accelerate the 
launch of the io
®
 system, initiate US clinical 
trials, and expand the menu of tests available 
initially in the sexually transmitted infections 
(STI) and hospital acquired infections (HAI) 
markets. Bespak has a multi-year exclusive 
development and supply agreement with 
Atlas for the diagnostic test cartridges, and 
in June 2014 announced the completion 
of the manufacturing line for Atlas. 
Qualification processes on the cartridge and 
manufacturing line are at an advanced stage.
Product Development
We have a strong and diverse core business 
of products in volume manufacturing. In line 
with our strategy we have assembled a full 
and broad product development pipeline 
of organic growth opportunities which will 
add to the strength of this core business 
going forwards. Successful conversion of 
these opportunities will provide progressive 
revenue and profit growth, in both contract 
manufacturing and products with our 
own proprietary IP and across a range of 
therapeutic areas including commercial drug 
handling.
Our published development portfolio provides 
an update on the key business development 
projects in the business. We guide that for 
inclusion in the published portfolio, projects 
must have a reasonable expectation of 
success — though timescales are difficult to 
predict — and be expected to produce peak 
annual sales of at least £3m per annum. 
In the period, we successfully added three 
new projects to our development pipeline. 
These include two Injectables projects, and 
one respiratory:
•	 INJ650 is for our ASI
®
 (Auto Safety Injector) 
auto-injector technology, and follows the 
successful launch of this technology into 
the market of the Dr. Reddy’s Sumatriptan 
autoinjector in February 2014.
•	 INJ700 is a project for our Lila Mix
™
, 
recently developed by our Innovation 
Centre in Cambridge. The product enables 
two drugs to be stored in the same syringe 
and mixed immediately before injection. It 
accompanies the Lila Duo
™
 and Lila Bio
™
 
products unveiled last year.

Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2015
18 23962.04    16 July 2015 12:23 PM   Proof 10
•	 IDC300 is a multi-year development and 
supply agreement covering supply of both 
the IDC actuator and the pressurised 
metered dose inhaler (pMDI) valve. This 
IDC programme represents the first 
commercial oral variant of the device, 
which is already approved and marketed 
for a nasally delivered product. Dose-
counting devices fulfil an important patient 
and compliance need to let patients know 
if their device contains sufficient drug 
and to indicate when they need to seek 
a further prescription. It provides patients 
with a reliable, easy to read indication of 
how many doses are left inside the canister 
in line with FDA guidance.
With the addition of the three new 
programmes, the portfolio has grown to 12 
live programmes. The status of the major 
programmes currently in our development 
pipeline is listed below.
On existing programmes in the pipeline, the 
following are the most notable updates:
•	 DEV200/“Voke
®
”: As previously 
announced, MHRA granted a Marketing 
Authorisation for Voke
®
 in September 
2014. In February 2015 Kind Consumer 
was granted Marketing Authorisation 
for the variation to Voke
®
 from the 
MHRA incorporating refinements into 
the products. BAT have indicated their 
expectation of product launch later in 
2015.
Production facilities to support product 
launch are already in place at the Bespak 
King’s Lynn facility. Production readiness of 
the expanded facilities in King’s Lynn and 
Milton Keynes to support the full contracted 
volumes is well advanced.
•	 DEV610: Good progress has been made 
with the product development and with 
the building of the new facility. Following 
changes in the customer’s launch strategy, 
the expected launch date has moved to 
the second half of 2016.
•	 INJ600/Steadymed: Good progress 
has been made on this programme. 
The customer has filed for orphan drug 
designation and been granted patents and 
patent extensions. Steadymed completed 
an IPO on Nasdaq in March 2015. The 
programme is aiming for device validation 
and verification H1 2016.
Development and Industrialisation 
Process
Bespak operates in every phase of a device’s 
development life cycle, from early to late 
stage clinical trials, as well as post-launch 
where the business may become a second 
source of supply. Device suppliers who 
partner with customers whilst a product is 
in development invariably become the sole 
supplier at launch. Bespak’s preference is  
for early involvement where it is possible 
to apply greatest influence on the product 
design, not just to assure functional 
robustness but to ensure the device is 
suitable for high volume manufacture. 
Whilst the overall approval timescales for drug 
delivery devices are long, the development 
lead times can be very aggressive in order to 
achieve clinical and launch deadlines. Bespak 
recognises that product development is an 
iterative process and it aspires to reduce the 
number of iterations required for a product, 
whilst progressing through each iteration as 
quickly as possible. In order to achieve this, 
the business has developed capabilities and 
competencies internally as well as having 
established a network of third party specialist 
suppliers. Internal capabilities include 3D CAD 
platforms, mouldflow simulation, 3D printing 
(suitable for early stage functional evaluation), 
CT Scanning and an extensive laboratory 
capable of analytical and physical testing 
with both placebo and active ingredients. 
Bespak was an early investor in CT Scanning 
technology and it has proved pivotal in 
the diagnosis of discovery during product 
development. Rapid identification of root cause 
significantly reduces development iteration and 
reduces the associated lead times.

In order to meet its customers’ new product 
industrialisation needs, Bespak has evolved 
a framework which is tailored to meet the 
individual requirements of each programme. 
A programme manager navigates the journey 
from entry into the business, through product 
and process development, to handover into 
commercial manufacturing. The process is 
risk based and whilst stages exist in series, 
they are often run in parallel to compress  
lead times. All activities are undertaken in  
full compliance with applicable guidelines  
and regulations.
Innovation
The Innovation team has continued to be 
highly active on a number of fronts over 
the past year. The team has now grown to 
21 (16 at 30 June 2014), and in December 
2014 moved into its own dedicated facilities 
in Cambridge. These became operational 
in January 2015 and provide laboratory 
and development scale facilities as well as 
enlarged accommodation for the current 
research and design/development operations.
The Innovation pipeline has progressed 
broadly during the period across a number of 
therapeutic areas and technologies.

Bespak has a proven track record in 
developing both proprietary products and 
products owned by others. The Easifill
®
 
primeless valve is a proprietary product 
currently pending FDA approval via a lead 
customer. This product was designed 
to meet an unmet need in the market. 
Development increased the breadth of the 
organisation’s Intellectual Property portfolio 
whilst challenging and helping to evolve 
internal capabilities and competencies. 
Development progressed through pilot tooling 
and hand assembly with extensive laboratory 
product verification testing to determine 
iterative requirements to achieve robustness 
suitable for volume manufacture. The product 
is currently manufactured using multi-
cavitation tooling and automated assembly 
with capacity in the millions. Variants of the 
Easifill valve are currently being sampled and 
evaluated by a range of other customers. 
On the Nicovations programme, Bespak’s 
role is to support the “Design Authority” not 
only to achieve the functional specification 
but to influence design such that the product 
is suitable for high volume manufacture. 
Bespak’s experience of drug/device interaction 
is critical to analysis of the root cause and 
solution generation from discovery to device 
approval. The product leverages Bespak’s 
metered dose inhaler valve technology and 
medical device product expertise, making 
Bespak the ideal partner of choice.
Syrina

 Update
Following the commercial unveiling of  
Syrina
®
 and Lila
®
 at the PDA exhibition in 
November 2013, we continue to generate 
widespread interest from several pharma 
companies with injectable drug portfolios. 
Within this, we are in discussions on a 
growing number of specific opportunities  
and product evaluations. 
The closure of our first development 
agreement for the Lila Mix
®
 is the most 
advanced of these opportunities. On Syrina
®
 
we initiated a programme for a major biotech 
company to develop a product demonstrator; 
this was successfully delivered, and we are 
evaluating next steps with the customer.
Our presence at the PDA exhibition in 
October 2014 generated further interest  
in the opportunities available through  
these innovations. 
Lapas
®
 Commercial Unveiling
In addition to the commercialisation work 
on Syrina
®
 and Lila
®
, the Innovation team 
has developed and unveiled another new 
significant platform at the PDA exhibition in 
October 2014. Lapas
®
 is a bolus injector 
platform which enables large volumes 
(greater than 2.25ml) of injectable drug to be 
delivered constantly over an extended period 
of time (up to several hours). 
The target drug market includes biologics, 
where the viscosity and volume of some 
drugs means that there is significant benefit 
from powered injection. The platform 
incorporates our proprietary Vapoursoft
®
 
technology to “power” the injection for up  
to several hours. It is noteworthy that a 
number of chronic conditions include 
treatment with biologics.
Advantages of Lapas
®
 include the following: 
•	 Self-administration — this reduces the 
treatment cost to the health system as the 
patient does not need to attend a clinic; 
•	 Mobility and independence whilst being 
injected — the patient can continue with 
relatively normal activities whilst receiving 
their medication; and
•	 Simple adaptability of dose size/power 
source dependent on drug and viscosity 
providing lower configurability/adaptability 
risk and a simple delivery mechanism for 
pharma clients.

the needle is safely shielded. Our Vapoursoft
®
 
gas propulsion system powers the injector 
with soft steady pressure, replacing the use 
of springs and overcoming the shortcomings 
of spring-powered injection in patient 
outcomes — such as physical impact, pain 
from force of injection, and glass breakage.
Innovation on Demand uses our increasing 
range of basic building blocks to solve the 
very specific challenges encountered by the 
client. This requires working closely with our 
clients to find solutions to those “difficult-to-
solve” challenges. As an example, a client 
has a drug that consists of two viscous liquid 
components that need mixing moments 
before injection but must be kept separate 
prior to this. The aim was to find a single 
device solution that was both easy to use and 
convenient for the clinician and patient alike. 
Armed with this brief and within four weeks of 
discussing the problem, the Innovation team 
was able to produce a working demonstrator 
of a potential device. This was a combination 
of proven functional elements and novel 
elements, and satisfied the basic requirements 
of our client. This has progressed to the award 
of a development contract for the Lila Mix
™
 
commercial device, INJ700.
Innovation Process
We have developed a range of “service” 
offerings and business models that are 
focused on meeting the needs of the market. 
This has involved building a team, drawn 
from a variety of backgrounds, and providing 
appropriate facilities in Cambridge.
With a larger team now in place we are 
making good progress in identifying unmet 
or unsatisfied market needs and generating 
viable concepts that meet the expectations 
of all parties involved with a drug device, 
including the patient, clinician and our Life 
Sciences partner. We are also looking at 
aspects of the supply chain and the drug as 
opportunities to innovate further. Through this 
effort, we have a full pipeline of development 
projects from simple functional elements 
through to full product developments and 
clearly identified opportunities that exist 
for both our “opportunity discovery” and 
“Innovation on Demand” offerings. 
The innovation process starts by investigating 
potential opportunities and using our four 
stage-gate process, and results in robust 
concepts that we know meet unsatisfied 
need and equally importantly will be 
reproducible in high volume manufacture. 
The primary objective of the process is to 
minimise the overall risk (commercial, user, 
pharmaceutical and technical) through 
early targeted mitigation activities, thereby 
maximising the chances of success once the 
product is in the market. 
We do not offer a one size fits all process: 
we listen to our clients and have taken the 
approach of creating a series of proven 
functional building blocks rather than 
developing a fixed device that solves a given 
specific problem. This approach provides 
the flexibility to meet the needs of our clients 
in two ways: opportunity discovery and 
Innovation on Demand.
Opportunity discovery allows us to build 
device solutions that will satisfy the needs 
of our clients and identify new needs as 
well as those that are not met in the current 
market. For instance, there is a trend 
towards larger volume delivery of more 
viscous drugs. In response to this we have 
developed drug delivery techniques that 
enable these challenges to be overcome.

Demand from existing key customers has been stable, and revenues have been lifted by a 
number of new market launches which have taken place as a result of the cross licensing of 
products in our current portfolio.
In API, Aesica continues its strong position in the global Flurbiprofen market. Additionally, a 
number of API development projects are entering the validation stage which are expected to 
give rise to future revenues.
Capex in the period has been consistent with our expectations at £3.7m.
Following the acquisition of Aesica, a number of alignment, reorganisation and commercial

Chief  
Executive’s  
Review 
continued
This business development cycle differs in 
some respects to that of Bespak; Bespak’s 
offering is a specific device-based service 
offering from innovation/development typically 
through to volume manufacturing.
The Aesica commercial team is focused 
on a growing pipeline of API/formulation 
development and manufacturing 
opportunities. In common with Bespak,  
there is significant contractual and 
commercial confidentiality as to the identity  
of specific projects and contracts.
A specific case study which illustrates 
Aesica’s ongoing business development is 
S+Flurbiprofen:
•	 Aesica is working with a leading  
Japanese pharmaceutical company 
to provide the active ingredient for an 
anti-inflammatory formulation containing 
S+flurbiprofen. The patch obtained good 
results in phase 3 clinical trials and in 
October 2014 a submission was filed 
for market approval with the Ministry of 
Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan for 
the indication of osteoarthritis. 
•	 Osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative 
disease of the joints. The number of 
patients in Japan is estimated to be 24 
million for osteoarthritis of the knee joint 
and 35 million for lumbar spondylosis, 
with approximately 30% of these patients 
showing symptoms of pain. Considering 
that pain is a major cause of reduced 
quality of life, there are high hopes for the 
development of formulations that possess a 
powerful anti-inflammatory analgesic action.
•	 Aesica is a leading supplier of the active 
ingredient flurbiprofen and the modified 
S+flurbiprofen, and has supplied the 
product into the Japanese market for many 
years. Demand for the new formulation is 
expected to grow steadily from 2016.

Business Development and 
Innovation
Pipeline
Aesica has broadly two pools of business 
development: development services and 
manufacturing services, with some overlap. 
•	 In development services, it applies know-
how in API/formulation development to a 
wide range of project opportunities for a 
wide range of customers at different stages 
of the clinical trial cycle. 
•	 The bulk of its revenue today comes 
from the application of its process 
technology and know-how to specific 
drug manufacturing opportunities, many 
of which may be different from those API/
formulation development opportunities.

Semi-Continuous Manufacturing
In collaboration with a key strategic 
customer, Aesica has brought 
to market readiness a product 
manufactured using the first semi-
continuous processing line and 
technology installed at a CDMO. 
The line delivers continuous flow, 
from the wet granulation stage, 
through to tablet compression. 
Unlike the more traditional batch-
based methods used for tablet 
manufacture, which take days with 
this process, after initial blending, 
the production of uncoated tablets 
is carried out in 40 minutes.
Aesica can offer semi-continuous 
manufacturing capacity to other 
customers and provides this service 
from its Queenborough, UK finished 
dose manufacturing facility.
Semi-continuous manufacturing 
meets the market demand for 
shortened drug development 
times, a reduction in the quantity 
of API required in development, 
and a reduction in clean down 
and batch transfer loss during the 
manufacturing process.
In addition, it enables process 
development, clinical scale 
manufacture and commercial 
manufacture to be carried out on 
the same piece of equipment. This 
results in rapid collection of data 
to demonstrate the robustness 
and quality of the manufacturing 
process using QbD (Quality by 
Design) principles.
In addition to API/formulation development 
and manufacturing in current areas of know-
how and production capabilities, Aesica 
is actively developing new areas of know-
how and process technology. Recently it 
has developed its capability in potent drug 
manufacture, and in its High Capacity plant. In 
FY2015, it concluded a process development 
project in semi-continuous processing:

Financial 
Review
Financial Review
1
This year has been significant for the Group 
from a financial point of view. Bespak 
continued its consistent and steady growth 
in revenue and earnings, whilst continuing 
to invest and prepare for the future growth 
opportunities afforded by its growing 
development and innovation pipelines. The 
acquisition of Aesica has transformed the 
capabilities of the Group, the breadth of the 
customer offering, and scale of operations, 
propelling proforma FY2014 revenue and 
EBITDA to £279.0m and £44.4m respectively. 
To facilitate the acquisition, the balance sheet 
has been transformed, with an equity raise of 
£94.4m net of fees and the addition of a new 
five-year debt facility of £160.0m.
Bespak and Aesica are well placed to 
continue to grow individually and in 
collaboration, and the Group has a well-
structured balance sheet to facilitate this.
Income Statement
Group revenue grew by £84.8m (84.8%) 
to £184.8m (FY2014: £100.0m), from 
organic growth in Bespak and a 5.5 month 
contribution from Aesica. Operating profit 
before special items increased by £6.3m 
(33.5%) to £25.1m (FY2014: £18.8m). Profit 
before tax before special items increased 
by £5.2m (29.7%) to £22.7m (FY2014: 
£17.5m). Profit before tax after special items 
decreased by £10.6m (65.8%) to £5.5m 
(FY2014: £16.1m). Profit after tax before 
special items increased by £5.5m (39.6%) to 
£19.4m (FY2014: £13.9m).
Adjusted EPS increased by 12.9% to 47.8p 
per share (FY2014: 42.3p
2
). Basic unadjusted 
EPS reduced by 62.9% to 15.4p per share 
(FY2014: 41.5p
2
). See note 11.
Taxation
The tax charge before special items was 
£3.3m resulting in an effective rate of 14.4% 
(FY2014: 20.6%). The tax credit on special 
items was £4.0m (FY2014: tax credit £1.1m). 
The total tax credit was £0.7m (FY2014: tax 
charge £2.5m). See note 10.
Following the introduction in 2013 of the 
Research and Development Expenditure 
Credit (RDEC), the Group has realised 
an R&D tax credit of £0.9m which was 
recognised through EBIT in the period.

Box regime and its potential applicability to 
the Bespak business. As a result of this, the 
Bespak business has been able to benefit 
from a reduction in its cash tax of £1.1m in 
FY2015, and £1.3m in relation to FY2013 
and FY2014 (the latter being treated as a 
special item in the accounts). 
The Patent Box benefit has contributed 
significantly to the reduction in the Group’s 
effective tax rate (ETR) from 20.6% to 14.4%.
Dividend
The Board is proposing an unchanged 
final dividend of 11.68p (FY2014: 11.68p), 
making a total dividend for the year of 18.11p 
(FY2014: 18.11p). Before adjusting for the 
effect of the rights issue made in the year, this 
equates to a final dividend of 13.35p (FY2014: 
13.35p), and a full year dividend of 20.7p 
(FY2014: 20.7p). Dividend cover, based on 
earnings before special items, was 2.64 times 
(FY2014: 2.35 times). See note 12.
Special Items from Continuing 
Operations
Special items amount to £17.2m in the 
year (FY2014: £1.4m). This comprises: 
Aesica acquisition costs of £5.4m; Aesica 
integration costs of £1.9m; amortisation of 
intangible assets of £6.8m (FY2014: £0.8m), 
being £0.8m relating to The Medical House, 
and £6.0m relating to Aesica; accelerated 
amortisation of upfront arrangement fees of 
£0.3m and other costs of £2.8m. See note 6.
Discontinued Operations
On 15 February 2013, Consort Medical 
completed the sale of King Systems to Ambu 
A/S, the results of which are reported within 
discontinued operations. At the time of sale, 
contingent consideration mechanisms were 
agreed as a central element of the value 
realisation from the disposal. The first of 
these was a £5.9m (US$10.0m) lump sum 
payment upon the launch of the King Vision 
next generation blade. This was received in 
May 2014 following a successful product 
launch. A further US$2.3m was received on 
4 June 2014 representing the amount due in 
respect of the FY2014 King Vision sales. 
Following the contingent consideration 
receipts received to date, and noting the 
recent sales trend of the King Vision by King 
Systems, the fair value of the contingent 
consideration has been reassessed by £1.3m 
from £3.8m to £2.5m and the difference 
has been charged to the income statement 
through special items within Discontinued 
Operations. US$2.5m was received on  
18 June 2015 in respect of the FY2015  
King Vision sales. See notes 26 and 29.

Acquisition of Aesica
On 12 November 2014, the Group acquired 
100% of the issued share capital of Aesica 
Holdco Ltd for £226.6m. The transaction was 
approved by shareholders on 16 October 
2014.
The consideration of £226.6m was satisfied 
by £10.8m of new Consort Medical ordinary 
shares and the balance in cash; the cash was 
raised by means of a rights issue, new debt, 
and existing cash resources:
The rights issue was structured as 5 for 8 
shares, priced at 540p, representing a 34% 
discount to the Theoretical Ex Rights Price 
(TERP). The new shares were admitted to the 
Consort listing on 17 October 2014.
A new £160m, multi-currency revolving facility 
over five years was established with Barclays, 
Lloyds, RBS and Santander as participants 
replacing the existing facilities. A further 
£65m accordion facility was included.
Transaction costs associated with the 
acquisition of £5.4m were incurred. These 
have been charged through special items. 
In addition to this, debt facility fees of £1.9m 
were incurred which have been capitalised, 
and will be amortised over the life of the 
new facility to 2019 and £4.5m of costs 
associated with the equity raise were incurred 
recorded in equity.
An exercise to assess the fair value of the 
acquired assets and liabilities has been 
conducted, resulting in the identification 
of Intangible assets (£82.3m), and the 
determination of Goodwill (£101.1m). See 
note 28. 
Following the acquisition, an integration 
programme was initiated. The costs of  
this programme were £1.9m and include 
people-related costs, consultancy support, 
project management, tax advice, and 
marketing costs. These have been charged 
as Special Items in the year. The anticipated 
cash costs of c.£7.7m identified above 
in relation to the Newcastle, Monheim 
and Nottingham sites relates to actions 
announced since 30 April 2015, and hence 
they are not recorded in these financial 
statements.

Strategic Report 23962.04    16 July 2015 12:23 PM   Proof 10
A number of initiatives have been completed 
to align Aesica’s Controls, Policies and 
Reporting with the Consort Medical Group.
•	 Controls: Consort controls have been 
implemented within the Aesica group, 
including the management of cash 
and debt, delegated authority limits, 
harmonisation of reporting periods to  
30 April and HR controls.
•	 Financial Reporting and business planning: 
Aesica has been successfully migrated 
onto Consort’s financial reporting systems; 
this complex workstream was completed 
efficiently within a short timescale. 
Quarterly Group forecasting and budgeting 
processes have also been implemented.
•	 IT infrastructure: a single IT organisation 
has been created to execute an ongoing 
programme of integration actions in 
desktop and ERP systems to support 
communications and wider integration of 
business processes across the Group.
•	 Policies and Branding: policies on a 
range of matters have been aligned, 
including Environment, Health and Safety, 
Commercial conduct, and Whistleblowing. 
A review of the Group’s branding has 
been undertaken to develop future market 
branding evolution.
Other special costs of £2.8m have been 
charged in relation to the acquisition. 
Following the uplift in the book value of 
inventory held by Aesica on acquisition, 
as required by accounting standards, 
this charge represents the unwinding of 
this increase as inventory has been sold 
subsequent to the acquisition date.
Corporate Reorganisation
Following the acquisition of Aesica Holdco 
Ltd., a corporate reorganisation of the Aesica 
European subsidiaries was conducted for 
commercial purposes. This was not possible 
to complete before the acquisition due to 
the transaction structure proposed by the 
Vendor. 
This included the establishment of new 
Consort holding companies in Italy and 
Germany which acquired the German and 
Italian subsidiaries from Aesica Holdco Ltd. 
These transactions were completed on  
30 April 2015; to facilitate the completion of 
these intercompany transactions,  
it was necessary to make a short-term 
borrowing of £37.6m on the Group’s  
banking facilities, which was repaid on  
5 May 2015. This borrowing has no impact 
on the Group’s Net Debt at 30 April 2015, 
as it was represented by cash within Group 
subsidiaries. This explains the inflated cash 
position at 30 April 2015.
Investment in Atlas Genetics Ltd
On 29 January 2015, the Group subscribed 
for a further investment of £2.2m in Atlas 
Genetics Ltd (“Atlas”). The investment formed 
part of the total £12.7m Series C funding 
raised by Atlas. Consort’s subscription 
was proportionate to its existing 17.3% 
shareholding in Atlas (15.2% on a fully diluted 
basis). The Group previously invested £1.2m 
in February 2011, £1.4m in July 2011, 
£1.1m in July 2013 and £0.4m in April 2014. 
Following the Series C funding, Consort has 
invested a total of £6.3m in Atlas, as set out 
in note 16 to the financial statements. The 
other equity partners include Novartis Venture 
Funds, Johnson & Johnson Development 
Corporation, Life Science Partners and BB 
Biotech Ventures, and new subscriber RMI 
Partners. See note 16.
Substantial progress has been made in 
the last year in the Point-of-Care card 
development — in conjunction with Bespak 
— and with the development of the card 
reader and assay tests.
The Group will continue to account for Atlas 
as an equity investment in the accounts of 
Consort Medical.
Balance Sheet
The Group has net debt of £99.2m at the 
year end (FY2014: net cash £25.8m) and a 
further £65.0m available under the accordion 
facility. Gross assets were £471.8m (FY2014: 
£143.7m). The pension deficit increased to 
£21.1m (FY2014: £2.1m) and is reviewed 
separately below. Provisions at 30 April 
2015 were £6.1m (30 April 2014: £2.4m); 
the movement was attributable to provisions 
acquired with Aesica (£4.2m) partially offset 
by subsequent utilisation (£0.7m) and foreign 
exchange (£0.1m)

Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2015
26 23962.04    16 July 2015 12:23 PM   Proof 10
As part of the acquisition of Aesica Holdco 
Limited, the Group created new bank facility 
and cancelled the previous facility with Royal 
Bank of Scotland (RBS) and HSBC. The new 
facility is a £160m five-year multi-currency 
revolving credit facility with Barclays, Lloyds, 
RBS and Santander. The facility expires in 
September 2019. Margins are between  
1.25 and 2.2% over LIBOR depending  
upon the ratio of net debt to EBITDA 
prevailing at the time. A non-utilisation  
fee of 40% of the interest margin on the 
undrawn balance applies. 
The facility has two covenants: Net Debt to 
EBITDA less than 3.25 times (falling to 3.00x 
in April 2016; and Interest Cover over EBITDA 
being greater than three times. The Group 
remains comfortably within both its headroom 
and its covenants at 30 April 2015: Net Debt 
to EBITDA was at 2.30, and Interest Cover 
was at 19.8 times. 
Under the terms of the refinancing, the Group 
also has a £65m “accordion” facility, by which 
further facilities may be made available by 
the participating banks under the current 
terms to support significant investment or 
acquisition opportunities which may arise. 
The Group maintains levels of Sterling cash 
sufficient to meet imminent obligations and 
to be a reserve in case of an adverse event. 
These funds are invested with a range of 
reputable financial institutions approved by 
the Board. 
The debt within this multi-year revolving 
committed credit facility is disclosed as less 
than one year, as it is drawn for one-month 
periods, and then redrawn as appropriate to 
minimise the amount of debt drawn relative 
to the Group’s needs and to minimise the 
LIBOR interest paid. See note 23.
Foreign Currency Exposure
The Group monitors its foreign currency 
exposures carefully and seeks to mitigate 
all material transactional exposures. Bespak 
currently has low exposure to movements in 
the Euro and US dollar movements. Aesica 
has wider exposure to the Euro. Where 
appropriate we buy or sell forward currency 
to protect transaction margin exposure. 
Following the acquisition of Aesica, foreign 
currency translation sensitivity for the Euro is 
such that a change in the €0.01 : £1 impacts 
revenue by £0.7m and EBIT by £0.1m. 
Pensions
Bespak operates a defined benefit pension 
scheme in the UK that is closed to new 
employees, who are eligible to join a defined 
contribution pension scheme (see note 21). 
As at 30 April 2015, the IAS 19 deficit was 
£17.8m compared with £2.1m as at  
30 April 2014. The movement was primarily 
as a result of unfavourable movements in 
discount rates and a review of other actuarial 
assumptions. 
The last triennial actuarial valuation of the 
pension scheme was at 30 April 2014; the 
Company is in discussion with the scheme 
Trustees to finalise this. Since the last triennial 
valuation in 2011, prevailing discount rates 
have worsened, and it is expected that this in 
particular may have a material effect on the 
updated valuation.
Aesica operates a number of different 
pension schemes, which are outlined in note 
21 to the accounts including defined benefit 
schemes in Italy and Germany with a net  
IAS 19 deficit of £3.3m. See note 21.
Risk Management
The Group considers effective risk 
management to be a high priority. We are 
pleased to report that the Group incurred no 
material financial or business losses.

The Aesica acquisition allows the Group to capture more of the value in the drug/device supply chain. Aesica has 
been working with a leading Japanese pharma company to provide the active ingredient for an anti-inflammatory 
formulation containing S
+
flurbiprofen. Aesica is a leading supplier of the active ingredient flurbiprofen and the 
modified S+flurbiprofen and demand for the new formulation is expected to grow steadily from 2016.

In the current year the Group's conversion of operating profit into cash inflows has improved to 41.5% reflecting 
the additional contribution from Aesica in the year.

In collaboration with a key strategic customer, Aesica has brought to market readiness a product manufactured 
using the first semi-continuous processing line and technology installed at a CDMO. The line delivers continuous 
flow from the wet granulation stage through to tablet compression. Semi-continuous manufacturing meets 
the market demand for shortened drug development times, a reduction in the quantity of API required in 
development and a reduction in clean down and batch transfer loss during the manufacturing process.

Our Performance
Strategic Report 23962.04    16 July 2015 12:23 PM   Proof 10
Principal 
Risks & 
Uncertainties
Risk Controls and Mitigating Actions Trend
Product quality failure: The Group operates 
in highly regulated markets with strict quality 
requirements. Any quality failure involving the 
Group’s products could lead to loss of reputation, 
reduction in revenues, recall costs or sanction by 
the regulators.
The Group has rigorous quality management and assurance systems and processes. 
Incoming raw materials are analysed, production processes are controlled and products 
are sampled for testing prior to release. 
Reliance upon key customers/products: Both 
the Aesica and Bespak divisions have a degree 
of reliance on a relatively small number of key 
customers/products and the loss of one such 
customer/product could lead to a significant 
reduction in revenues.
The Group has significant Intellectual Property and there are significant barriers to 
entry. Regulation restricts customers’ ability to transfer business elsewhere so a loss 
of business once approved on a customer programme is unusual. We maintain a 
close dialogue with all of our customers. Our strategy of diversification has opened up 
a broader range of products and customers, and is progressively diluting customer/
product concentration.
Regulatory risk: The operations of the Group are 
subject to various regulatory requirements which 
confer a degree of protection as well as an element 
of compliance risk, in particular to delivering growth.
A strong compliance regime is in place and regular reviews and audits take place, not 
only by regulatory bodies such as the FDA and MHRA but also by customers. Bespak 
is ISO 13485 accredited and operates SAP in all its main processes, and has recently 
expanded its externally recognised regulatory competence in acquiring commercial 
and clinical trials licences for drug handling. Aesica’s API facilities are inspected and 
approved by the FDA and all manufacturing sites are approved by the MHRA and 
comply with cGMP manufacturing standards and requirements. Aesica has consistently 
invested in facilities and technology ensuring “best in class” quality and reliability. 
Development risk: Bespak is developing a 
range of medical device products. Aesica is 
providing pharmaceutical product formulation 
development, analytics and manufacturing services 
to pharmaceutical and biotech companies. At any 
time, any of the products may fail in clinical trials, 
be stopped by the customer or may not become 
commercially successful once launched.   
The Group follows rigorous processes for the development of new products. 
Bespak, where possible, is developing its device technology as a platform for 
multiple programmes to reduce the exposure to any individual trial. Development 
and industrialisation of medical devices is considered a core competence of Bespak. 
Aesica’s development services are on a fee per project basis, with the core of its 
revenues coming from manufacturing services. 
Growth risk: The Aesica acquisition, together with 
Bespak’s success in acquiring an extensive product 
development portfolio, places significantly increased 
demands for resources on the business.
The Group has well-honed programme planning and management systems and 
processes. These provide good visibility of resource requirements, whether capital, 
space, equipment or people, and enable timely fulfilment on multiple parallel 
programmes. 
Cyber risk: Cyber crime is increasing in 
sophistication, consequences and incidence, 
with risks including virus “infection”, unauthorised 
access (hacking), and phishing email-based frauds.
The Group has conducted a cyber security risk assessment and identified mitigating 
actions and training to reduce the risks. Continual vigilance and training are required 
to mitigate risks, as perpetrators are creative and dynamic on a wide spectrum of 
strategies. These risk assessments have been extended to the Aesica business since 
acquisition.
The Group’s performance and prospects may be affected by risks and 
uncertainties relating to our business and operating environment.
Consort Medical plc  
Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2015
30 23962.04    16 July 2015 12:23 PM   Proof 10
Our internal controls include risk management processes to identify key risks and, where possible, to manage those risks through systems and 
processes and by implementing specific mitigation strategies. The most significant risks identified through our progressive review of the risk 
register that could materially affect the Group’s ability to achieve its financial and operating objectives are summarised in this section. Other risks 
are either unknown or deemed less material.
Risk Controls and Mitigating Actions Trend
Credit risk The Group has implemented policies and processes that require appropriate credit 
checks to be made on potential customers before sales over certain limits are agreed. 
Credit limits and outstanding receivables are reviewed monthly and action taken if a 
new risk is identified. The Group has an excellent record on collection of receivables. 
The Group monitors the levels of cash held with financial institutions and the credit 
rating of those institutions in order to manage the credit risk on cash balances.
Interest rate risk The Group is subject to interest rate risk on its revolving bank facility, the terms of 
which are reviewed by the Board on a regular basis. In the current low interest rate 
environment, the Group has decided not to hedge its floating rate debt into fixed 
rate for the time being. However, the Group actively monitors interest rates and debt 
markets and will manage any floating rate interest rate exposure, as appropriate.
Currency risk Currency exposures are reviewed regularly on a monthly basis. The Group has a 
currency hedging strategy in place to cover known currency exposures. Since the 
acquisition, the Group has been analysing Aesica’s business to understand the 
nature and timing of the business’ currency flows to enable the Group to hedge those 
exposures appropriately. Bespak’s currency exposures remain broadly constant and 
transactional hedges are executed routinely. 
Liquidity and leverage risk The Aesica acquisition has increased the overall leverage of the Group. This will result 
in increased borrowing costs and more restrictive covenants than the Group has 
previously operated under, which could limit the Group’s commercial and financial 
flexibility. The Group has strong cash flows, and good earnings visibility ensures that 
its margins are sufficient to exceed normal operating costs. Its business is cash-
generative, and there are well-embedded cash and working capital management 
processes. Current borrowing levels and financial covenants can be supported 
comfortably by forecast profit and cash flows. Facilities are in place until 2019. 
Pension risk The Group works closely with the Pension Trustees to ensure that the Defined Benefit 
Scheme is adequately funded and that the assets are invested appropriately to meet 
future liabilities as they fall due. The Scheme was closed to new members in 2002. As 
at 30 April 2015, the IAS 19 deficit was £17.9m compared with £2.1m as at 30 April 
2014. The movement was primarily as a result of unfavourable movements in discount 
rates and a review of other actuarial assumptions. The last triennial actuarial valuation 
of the pension scheme was at 30 April 2014; the Company is in discussion with the 
scheme Trustees to finalise this. Since the last triennial valuation in 2011, prevailing 
discount rates have worsened and it is expected that this, in particular, may have a 
material effect on the revaluation.

Bespak continues to focus on the prevention 
of accidents and incidents through the 
proactive reporting of potential hazards. This 
has been achieved via our Near Miss system 
which gives all employees the ability to 
raise potential hazards before they have the 
opportunity to cause an injury. We recorded 
a total of 1,847 near misses in FY2015 (an 
average of 154 per month (up from 115 per 
month in FY2014)). 
Aesica’s focus is to continue improving 
process safety management for its 
API plants, including safety aspects of 
maintenance tasks and the improvement 
of the inspection regime for bulk tanks and 
pipework. The API sites undergo inspections 
under the CoMAH Regulations from the 
Competent Authority. Inspections across 
FY2015 received positive feedback from 
the regulators regarding improvement in the 
management systems. 
Over the past 12 months Aesica has also 
initiated a “4 A safety campaign” across 
the Group, focusing on slips, trips and falls 
through a campaign covering Awareness, 
Attitude, Accountability and Auditing. This 
included training and awareness sessions 
for all employees, marketing materials 
for individuals and the sites and the 
implementation of executive leadership team 
audits during site visits.
In addition, Aesica developed a new 
Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) 
strategy for 2014-2016 and is working 
across a variety of fronts to improve the 
effectiveness of systems and engagement 
of the workforce. Aesica’s Environment, 
Health and Safety management systems are 
audited across the year by key stakeholders, 
including audits against Aesica Corporate 
Standards, Insurance Inspections and our 
customers. Opportunities identified for 
improvement are tracked and managed 
to close-out to ensure our business has 
efficient, effective systems to protect the 
workforce and the environment.
Environment
Activity to reduce our environmental impact 
is focused on environmental management, 
energy reduction, minimisation of waste, 
diversion of waste from landfill and water 
conservation.

In FY2015 Aesica initiated an energy 
saving review of two of its most significant 
energy consuming sites in Cramlington and 
Queenborough. This detailed review identified 
a range of proposed focus areas for energy 
saving opportunities which would deliver a 
circa 35% reduction in energy consumption 
across the two sites. Work to address some 
of these opportunities will begin in FY2016, 
covering such areas as boiler efficiency/steam 
loss prevention, condensate heat reduction, 
voltage reduction and chiller redesign. 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The table below shows the greenhouse gas 
emissions from all sources required under the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013, over 
which we have operational control. Emissions 
outside of our responsibility including shared 
office locations have not been included.
To incorporate the FY2015 acquisition of 
Aesica we have recalculated our base year to 
include the full FY2015 year emissions from 
Bespak and Aesica’s UK, Italian and German 
sites. This base year will be used next year to 
monitor our year-to-year performance.
Environmental Management  
(ISO 14001)
Bespak sites are certified to the 
Environmental Management System  
ISO 14001. Aesica’s two UK manufacturing 
sites, Cramlington and Queenborough, are 
also both certified to ISO 14001 along with 
the plant in Pianezza, Italy. The key focus 
of activity under ISO 14001 for all sites is to 
reduce the generation of waste materials, 
reduce energy use and the consumption of 
water in the spirit of continuous improvement, 
whilst maintaining compliance with the 
appropriate environmental legislation. 
Energy
Bespak’s energy consumption as measured 
in KWh/£’000 sales has increased from 380 
in FY2014 to 403 in FY2015. This increase in 
the KPI is a direct result of plant expansion 
for new customer programmes supporting 
growth and delayed energy reduction 
projects which will positively impact the 
metric in FY16.
Specific energy reduction activities include:
•	 Improvements to existing Building 
Management Systems including advanced 
control strategies and retrofit inverters
•	 Replacement of inefficient transformers
•	 Improved compressed air management 
•	 Replacement and optimisation of steam 
generation and distribution at the Nelson 
facility
•	 Improved factory heating at the Nelson 
facility

Change in Emissions — Our reported 
emissions have increased this year because 
of the Aesica acquisition, shown in the table 
above when compared to FY2014, which 
was calculated for only the Bespak business. 
FY2015 Group emissions will be used next 
year as our base year.
The scope and methodology is based on 
the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard (revised edition). 
Data has been sourced from Company 
records, contractors’ reports and supplier 
invoices. The emissions factors for all sources 
are taken from DEFRA’s GHG Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2014.
Waste
Bespak continues to increase the quantity 
of waste diverted from landfill/incineration, 
and from the FY2011 baseline has increased 
the amount to more than 95% of total 
waste generated, which is ahead of target. 
This has come about through a focus on 
waste segregation at source and waste 
minimisation activities delivered through a 
number of quality management initiatives.
Activities to reduce Bespak’s waste include 
investment in new tooling and a specific 
focus on moulding activities.
The following chart illustrates Bespak’s waste 
management performance. The bar chart 
illustrates the increase in the reuse/recycling 
of the waste generated at Bespak since

Aesica’s Queenborough site engaged 
with a local waste management company 
during FY2015 in order to optimise waste 
management and subsequent treatment.  
The site will work with this specialist company 
to ensure the best waste management 
and recovery solutions are identified whilst 
ensuring compliance in this complex area. 
The Cramlington site has a dedicated waste 
manager to ensure effective waste solutions 
are identified. By identifying potential users 
and reprocessors of our waste streams, the 
site aims to make waste cost neutral for the 
business.
Water
Bespak’s water reduction activities are 
focused on the opportunities at our Nelson 
site, which accounts for approximately 90% 
of all water consumed within Bespak. Since 
initiating a programme of water reduction in 
FY2012 the Nelson facilities have reduced 
consumption by more than 33% in terms 
of cubic metres per £’000 sales vs. the 
FY2011 baseline. Improved performance 
has come through process improvements 
in anodisation. The following chart illustrates 
performance in water consumption reduction 
from the FY2011 baseline year.

are planned for FY2016 to more accurately 
measure water use, treatment and disposal 
to ensure sustainable water management 
at the sites consuming the most water 
(Cramlington and Queenborough).
Employees
The Group remains focused on supporting 
and developing people through 
training, communications and two-way 
engagement channels. 
Bespak
•	 The Bespak Information & Consultation 
Committee (with representatives from all 
business areas) meets bimonthly to share 
key business updates/changes and to 
make sure information is flowing freely. 
•	 Team briefs are carried out bimonthly (by 
relevant line managers) right across the 
business — again with updates provided 
by all key departments — to keep people 
abreast of what’s going on in the business. 
•	 The annual Performance Development 
Review process commenced in May 2015; 
the HR team ran a series of workshops 
for managers, stressing the importance 
of careers conversations as part of the 
PDR process. By end of August 2015 the 
expectation is that we will have a training 
plan in place (by department and across 
the business as a whole), with a training 
schedule/calendar which will be visible to 
all thereafter. 
Following on from the staff survey in 2014 
Bespak provided an update to all employees 
at a special Town Hall event in March 2015. 
The session was to recap progress made 
by the business (in response to comments 
made in the last staff survey) in five key areas: 
i) management visibility; ii) greater Company-
wide engagement; iii) training, development & 
career progression; iv) pay & benefits, and v) 
values.
Aesica
•	 The Aesica Information & Consultation 
Committees — which consist of a 
European Works Council (with one 
representative per site); German Works 
Council; UK Staff Council and site specific 
works councils (with representatives 
from all business areas and Union 
representatives) — meet regularly to share 
key business updates and to ensure two-
way communication. 
•	 Team briefs are carried out regularly within 
Aesica; the frequency of meetings varies 
across individual sites. A communication 
plan will be agreed in FY2016 to ensure 
consistency across the Group and to 
provide a framework to ensure employees 
are fully briefed and updated with business 
matters.

Aesica Academy 
Paul Goodyear — Technical Support Engineer
I was very pleased to be accepted into the 2015 Aesica Academy. I joined 
Aesica as an Engineering Apprentice 13 years ago and moved into an 
Engineering Technical Role in May 2015. I am keen to learn about other 
business functions covered by the Academy programme and gain the 
Award in Leadership and Management. 
To date I have attended the business strategy and environment, health and 
safety modules. As an engineer I have had no exposure to setting business 
strategies so it was really interesting to learn about the theory and how 
Aesica formulates their strategy. I am currently completing my homework for 
the EHS module, which includes self-study on EHS legislation.
When I graduate in December and gain my management qualification I 
hope to be able to transfer my knowledge of other business functions to 
my day to day activities — in particular having a better appreciation of 
non-operational areas (Finance, HR).
As an outcome of the annual talent review 
process, 13 individuals were invited 
to participate in the annual leadership 
programme. The programme focuses 
on improving understanding of Aesica’s 
vision, strategy and organisation and helps 
individuals increase their self-awareness and 
how they see themselves as a leader and role 
model in the business.
The “Aesica Academy” is an internal 
employee development programme. Every 
year employees can apply to participate 
in the nine-month programme and this is 
open to all disciplines and levels. There 
are nine business modules that are a core 
part of the learning programme and the 
purpose is to enhance business awareness 
and understanding of how each discipline 
functions within the business. The scheme 
runs from January to September, with 35 
employees completing the 2014 programme, 
and a further 37 currently enrolled on the 
2015 programme.
What Next 
Bespak
•	 A further staff survey will take place in 2016;
•	 A Bespak staff engagement event is 
planned for July 2015 (for employees plus 
partners and their respective families) to 
celebrate recent business growth and 
success; and
•	 Initiation of “Team” Development Training. 
Aesica
•	 Employee engagement—The focus in 
Aesica during FY2016 will be on rolling 
out the Company values, implementation 
of a communications plan and running an 
employee survey; and 
•	 Development of the performance 
management approach across Aesica.
Training and Development
We continue to recognise the importance of 
investing in our people and nurturing their 
talents to the benefit of the business. Over 
FY2015 a total of 2,097 training days have 
been delivered by Bespak.
We want to build the capability of our 
managers to develop their teams, create 
a values-based culture and enhance their 
management skills. Bespak commenced 
its Management Development Programme, 
equipping all managers with the skills, 
knowledge and behaviours that will enable 
successful delivery of the business strategy 
and goals. In FY2015 47 Bespak managers 
commenced the management development 
programme. 
The programme consists of 15 half-day 
workshops to be delivered in-house over 
a 15 to 18 month period. The programme 
includes pre-course work, a post-course 
practical activity and Action Learning with the 
opportunity to gain an Institute of Leadership 
and Management (ILM) level 3 qualification.
Aesica operates an annual talent review 
process to: identify top talent and retention 
strategies; assess leadership competencies; 
identify specific skills gaps and risks; identify 
future potential and opportunities; assess 
mobility within the business in key areas; 
and to provide training and development 
opportunities such as the Leadership 
Programme or personal development plans.

Pathway: Engineering Technical Support 
Start Date:  Aug 2005 
Completion Date: Aug 2009
Engineering – It’s for Girls Too!
I started my apprenticeship at Bespak 10 years ago at the age of 17 
after completing a year at King’s Lynn College. The technical support 
route meant that I was unsure of where I would end up, so I moved 
around different areas of the business to get stuck in with diverse tasks. 
I completed all sorts of tasks: injection mould tool changes, running an 
assembly machine, drawing up a new production floor layout, and even 
getting contractors in to paint the car park lines.
The apprenticeship is set up to give a real insight into what everyone 
does and where I could fit into that. I spent my specialisation six months 
in the metrology department, where I was taken on permanently. Now I 
program, validate, and support various measuring equipment and fixtures 
across the site.
The experience and knowledge I gained from the apprenticeship is 
priceless. I use this knowledge every day, an example being a simple 
thing like knowing who I need to contact to get required information for 
component specifications. The hands-on experience is great, because 
things like “righty tighty, lefty loosey” when undoing a bolt stay with you 
forever. The banter that goes along with working in any of the shop floor or 
tool room environments is a brilliant initiation into life!
Apprenticeship Scheme
At the start of FY2015 Bespak recruited a 
further eight apprentices bringing the number 
of apprentices at Bespak to 15, as one 
apprentice completed the programme during 
the year.
In FY2016 our aim is to recruit a further two 
apprentices, increasing our total number of 
apprentices to 17.
External recognition of the very high quality 
of Bespak’s Apprenticeship Training Scheme 
has come through Cambridge Regional 
College’s “Employer of the Year” award for 
2014 to Bespak. The award very much 
confirmed the high standards that Bespak’s 
scheme operates at and the high level 
of support it provides to its apprentices. 
Bespak’s objective is to develop high quality, 
well trained and motivated individuals with 
externally recognised qualifications and 
Bespak specific knowledge, skills and 
competencies. Bespak currently supports 
apprenticeship training programmes in the 
following career pathways: Warehousing 
and Storage, Customer Service, Information 
Technology, and in Engineering, Technical 
Support, Toolmaking, Maintenance and 
Plastic Injection Moulding.
Aesica actively encourages apprenticeship 
training, with decisions made at a local 
level to address any skills gaps. In FY2015 
the business had a total of 13 apprentices 
working across the business, predominantly 
within engineering.
Human Rights
We are committed to supporting human 
rights through our compliance with the laws 
and regulations of the UK and through our 
internal policies. Our Code of Business Ethics 
and associated policies require respect and 
equal and fair treatment of all persons we 
come into contact with.

We are committed to supporting the patient 
population we serve and the communities 
in which we operate. Both local and 
national charities are considered important 
stakeholders for our business and we 
continue to discuss how we direct our 
support to make the biggest difference.
Grand East Anglia Run
Bespak continues to offer long-term support 
for the annual Grand East Anglia Run (GEAR) 
for the tenth year running, committing to 
a three-year GEAR sponsorship contract 
from 2015–2017. Both direct sponsorship 
support and participation of our people in a 
three-month pre-race training programme 
help build our reputation and brand within the 
local community, whilst also supporting our 
own employee well-being programme. 
Schools, Colleges and 
Universities
Both Bespak and Aesica have active 
engagement programmes with local schools, 
colleges and universities. This helps to attract 
top talent and raise the profile of our business 
within the graduate labour market. 
Over the past 12 months Aesica has offered 
a number of placement opportunities, 
including a recently launched 18 month 
graduate scheme; a graduate commenced 
in February and a recruitment process is 
under way for a second graduate and four 
undergraduate industrial placements.
Bespak continues to support a number 
of career events, including the facilitation 
of mock interviews at a local High School 
and hosting a visit of 28 students from The 
Institute of Industrial Manufacturing and 
Management of the University of Stuttgart. 
Four work placements totalling 75 days 
of work experience have been offered by 
the business. These placements included 
experience within the Laboratory, Health 
and Safety, Development, Programme 
Management and Engineering departments. 
Bespak also encourages junior participation 
in the Grand East Anglia Run, including 
150 free school places in the Mini Gear Fun 
Run and presenting prizes of educational 
equipment to three primary schools.
Charitable Support
Consort Medical’s charitable policy aims 
to promote education and opportunity and 
encourage the involvement of employees 
in community and charitable activities and 
organisations. Consort Medical has supported 
Changing Faces and Friends of Chums, its 
two selected corporate charities during the 
year, providing help, advice, business skills 
and financial assistance, with a donation of 
£15,000 each in FY2015. The National Autistic 
Society (Hertfordshire branch) which supports 
people with autism throughout their lives, has 
been selected as the corporate charity for the 
forthcoming year with a donation of £30,000.
Bespak’s Charity Steering Group continues 
to raise the profile of fundraising events 
within the business. Bespak’s chosen charity, 
EACH (East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices), 
has benefited from funding and employee 
involvement during the year. The total amount 
raised through charity support for FY2015 
was £17,500. 
Charities that have been supported by 
Bespak during FY2015 were:
•	 East Anglia Children’s Hospice (EACH)
•	 Marie Curie
•	 Children in Need
•	 Comic Relief
•	 Breast Cancer
•	 Movember
Bespak’s chosen Charity of the Year for 
FY2016 is Nelson’s Journey — a charity 
dedicated to supporting bereaved children 
and young people throughout Norfolk. 
Based in Norwich, it was founded in 1997, 
since which time it has helped hundreds of 
children between the ages of 0 and 17 who 
have experienced the death of a significant 
person in their life, e.g. parent or sibling.
Aesica’s Group charity is Bravehearts, 
a not-for-profit charity which recognises 
courage and bravery of children of the North 
East of England. The Group ran a number 
of fundraising events throughout the year, 
including a number of individuals participating 
in the Bupa Great North Run in September 
2014, and each site contributed £500 to a 
local charity as part of celebrating Aesica’s  
10 Year Anniversary.

Ethical Standards
We emphasise the importance of operating a business in both a responsible and ethical 
manner. Bespak and Aesica have set appropriate standards and policies to uphold all laws 
relevant to prevention of bribery and corruption in all jurisdictions in which we operate. The 
Group has in place policies and procedures covering Anti-Corruption and Bribery; Gifts and 
Hospitality; Business Ethics and Whistleblowing.
Bespak has finalised a supplier code of ethical standards and has rolled this out to suppliers 
through the Supply Chain Team. New suppliers are also being incorporated into the codes 
of conduct for “Ethical, Health, Safety and Environmental” standards through the tendering 
process.
Group Values
Bespak rolled out the Group Core Values across the King’s Lynn and Cambridge sites with 
workshops led by the project team and managers. We are now entering the ongoing activities 
to embed the Values throughout the organisation.
As part of the embedding phase, Bespak has started a 360 feedback within the Management

Aesica’s Cramlington site takes a 
proactive stance in enhancing local 
biodiversity. Although located in a 
semi-rural area of Northumberland, 
the site has for a number of years 
worked with employees, local 
schools and volunteers on a number 
of flora and fauna enhancing 
projects. A large proportion of the 
site is covered by grass or trees, 
but with the help of a local wildlife 
organisation, the site diversified some 
areas to create new habitat for wildlife 
— a wild flower meadow, nest boxes, 
a butterfly area, apple tree orchard, a 
wetlands area, reed bed and marshy 
ground — all of which support 
greater insect, amphibian, animal and 
bird populations. 
The latest additions to the site’s 
biodiversity are two hives of honey 
bees. It is believed that bees are 
responsible for pollinating one 
third of the food we eat, and are 
currently under threat. Over time, 
bees improve the habitat of an area 
by increasing pollination which leads 
to plants producing more seeds 
for birds and animals to feed on. 
Supporting honey bees adds to 
Cramlington site’s rich history of 
habitat improvement and biodiversity.

granted, by the Medicines and Healthcare 
Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”),

Change of Control

agreements containing provisions that 
take effect (including provisions permitting 
counterparties to terminate agreements) 
upon a change of control of the Company. 
These include both commercial and bank 
loan facilities agreements. Maintaining strong 
relationships with all counterparties is an

Company’s interests to help mitigate against 
any impact resulting from any change of 
control of the Company should it occur.

capital are set out on page 112. All of the

part of the consideration for such acquisition.

ordinary shares, in addition to those conferred

of ordinary shares are entitled to receive 
the Company’s reports and accounts, to 
attend and speak at general meetings of the 
Company, to appoint proxies and to exercise 
voting rights, and to participation in any 
distribution of income or capital.
Transfers of Shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of 
ordinary shares or on the exercise of voting 
rights attached to them save where the 
Company has exercised its rights to suspend 
their voting rights or to prohibit their transfer 
following the omission of their holder or any 
person interested in them to provide the 
Company with information requested by it in 
accordance with Part 22 of the Companies 
Act 2006 or where their holder is precluded 
from exercising voting rights by the Financial 
Services Authority Listing Rules or the City 
Code on Takeovers and Mergers. None of the 
shares carry any special rights with regard to 
the control of the Company.
The directors may refuse to register a transfer

Statement of 
Directors’ 
Responsibilities
The directors are 
responsible for 
preparing the Annual 
Report, the Directors’ 
Remuneration 
Report and the 
financial statements 
in accordance with 
applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law the directors have 
prepared the Group and parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
“IFRSs” as adopted by the European Union. 
Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Group for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
•	 make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements 
and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the Annual Report 
and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Each of the directors, whose names and 
functions are listed on pages 44 and 45, 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
•	 the Group financial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group; and
•	 the Directors’ Report contained on pages 
39 to 42 includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Chairman’s Introduction
As mentioned in my Chairman’s 
statement earlier in this report, this has 
been a year of significant change with the 
acquisition of Aesica Holdco Limited. The 
Board and the Executive Committee have 
been supporting the enlarged business 
to ensure that an appropriate and robust 
framework is in place throughout the 
new Group as a whole, to ensure that 
high quality corporate governance is 
maintained.
The Board is committed to ensuring that it retains a relevant balance 
of skills and expertise to enable it to fully discharge its duties and 
responsibilities. During the year we have therefore recruited two Non-
executive Directors with diverse backgrounds who have both settled 
in well, and bring fresh experience and perspectives. Andrew Hosty 
brings considerable operational expertise and Charlotta Ginman 
possesses substantial financial knowledge.
The Board of Consort Medical considers strong corporate governance 
to be a key element to the success of the business and I am pleased 
to report that we have complied with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (2012) throughout the year.
We will continue to fully adhere to the Code, monitor ongoing 
developments and implement improvements in our governance in the 
year ahead.
Dr Peter Fellner 
Chairman
The uK Corporate Governance Code
The Group is committed to practising good corporate governance 
of its affairs as part of its management of relationships with its 
shareholders and other stakeholders. The Group seeks to uphold and 
to report on compliance in accordance with best practice in corporate 
governance.
Compliance Statement
The directors are satisfied that the Group has complied with the 
principles and provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the “Code”) which was published in September 2012 (available 
from www.frc.org.uk) as updated and was compliant throughout the 
financial year under review.
The principles of the Code cover five areas: leadership, effectiveness, 
accountability, remuneration and relations with shareholders. With 
the exception of the directors’ remuneration (which is dealt with 
separately under the Remuneration Report), the following sets out 
how the Board has applied the principles.
The Board is committed to establishing and maintaining high 
standards of corporate governance. Its policy is to appoint directors 
with appropriate skills who have sufficient time to carry out their duties 
adequately. The Board provides opportunities through site visits and 
regular access to senior management to permit directors to familiarise 
themselves with the Company and the markets in which it operates.
Leadership
The Role of the Board
The Board is responsible for the long-term success of the Company. 
Individual members of the Board have equal responsibility for the 
overall stewardship, management and performance of the Group and 
for the approval of its long-term objectives and strategic plans.
Division of Responsibilities
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the role of the 
Chairman and that of the Chief Executive of the Company and the 
roles are clearly set out in writing and reviewed by the Board. The 
primary responsibility of the Chairman is to lead and manage the 
Board and to promote high standards of corporate governance, and 
that of the Chief Executive is to manage the business of the Group.
The Chairman
Peter Fellner was appointed non-executive Chairman of the Company 
with effect from 1 May 2009. The Chairman is responsible for leading 
and managing the Board and ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects 
of its role. He works closely with the Chief Executive on developing 
Group strategy, and provides general advice and support as well as 
participating in the dialogue between the Company and its major 
shareholders. Dr Fellner has attended all of the Board meetings held 
during the year and continues to commit substantial time to fulfilling 
his role. His other significant commitments are listed in his biography 
on page 44.
The Chairman was considered to be independent on his appointment.

The Chief Executive
Jonathan Glenn is the Company’s Chief Executive. His principal 
responsibility is to manage the Group’s business and to lead the 
senior management team in delivering the Company’s strategic and 
operational objectives.
The Senior Independent Director
Dr William Jenkins was appointed the Senior Independent Director 
with effect from 1 September 2011 and is responsible for the chairing 
of meetings of Non-executive Directors if and when required. Where 
the Chairman is not present, the Senior Independent Director chairs 
meetings of the Board. He is available to meet with shareholders.
The Non-executive Directors
Independence
Each of the Non-executive Directors (other than Ian Nicholson, who 
acts as a consultant in addition to his role as a Non-executive Director 
but including Peter Fellner, who has now served on the Board for  
9 years) are free from any relationship with the executive management 
of the Company and are free from any business or other relationship 
that could affect or appear to affect the exercise of their independent 
judgement. The Board considers that all of the Company’s Non-
executive Directors including Peter Fellner and Ian Nicholson 
are independent directors, in both character and judgement, in 
accordance with the recommendations of the Code.
The Operation of the Board
Reserved Matters and Delegated Authorities
The Board has the authority for ensuring that the Group is 
appropriately managed and achieves the strategic objectives it 
sets. To achieve this, the Board reserves certain matters for its own 
determination including matters relating to Group strategy, approval 
of interim and annual financial results, dividend policy, major capital 
expenditure, treasury policy, risk management, the effectiveness of 
the systems of internal control and amendments to the structure and 
capital of the Group. The full schedule of matters reserved to the 
Board is published on the Company’s website.
The Board performs its responsibilities through an annual programme 
of meetings, and by continuous monitoring of the performance of the 
Group as a whole.
Matters considered by the Board in FY2015 include:
•	 Finance and operations review
•	 Annual budget
•	 Risk review
•	 Strategic plans

•	 Monthly broker reports
•	 Group insurance review
•	 Receiving reports from the Board Committees
•	 Board evaluation

The Board also delegates a number of its responsibilities to 
committees and management as described below.

Effectiveness
The Board’s Composition
As of 30 April 2015 the Board of the Company consisted of the non-
executive Chairman, two executive directors and five Non-executive 
Directors. The profiles of the Board members are set out on pages 44 
and 45. No individual or group of individuals dominates the Board’s 
decision-making process. The Non-executive Directors occupy, or 
have occupied, senior positions in industry. Together they constitute a 
valuable body of relevant industry experience and expertise.
Board Diversity
The Board believes in the importance of diversity (including but not 
limited to gender) and the benefits that it can bring to the operation 
of an effective Board. The female representation on the Board 
constitutes 12.5%.
Appointments to the Board continue to be made on merit.

Appointment of Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors are appointed to the Board following 
a formal, rigorous and transparent process, involving external 
recruitment agencies, to select individuals who have a depth and 
breadth of relevant experience, thus ensuring that the selected 
candidates will be capable of making an effective and relevant 
contribution to the Board. The process for the appointment of Non-
executive Directors is managed by the Nomination Committee, whose 
responsibilities are outlined on page 50.
Terms of Appointment and Time Commitment
All Non-executive Directors are appointed for an initial term of three 
years subject to satisfactory performance. After this time they may 
serve additional three-year terms following review by the Board. All 
Non-executive Directors are expected to devote such time as is 
necessary for the proper performance of their duties. Directors are 
expected to attend all Board meetings and committee meetings of 
which they are members and any additional meetings as required. 
Further details of their terms and conditions are summarised in 
the Remuneration Report on pages 54 to 74 and the terms and 
conditions of appointment of the Non-executive Directors are available 
at the Company’s Registered Office.

Induction and Professional Development
Upon joining the Board, newly appointed directors receive a tailored 
induction comprising site visits, background information on the 
operation and activities of the Group, the role of the Board and its 
committees and those matters reserved for the Board’s decision, 
and the latest financial information on the Group. Training and 
development needs of directors are reviewed regularly. The directors 
are kept appraised of developments in legal, regulatory and financial 
matters affecting the Group from the Chief Financial Officer, the 
Company Secretary, the Group’s external auditors and advisers.
Information and Support
Board members are provided with all relevant documentation in 
advance of each Board and committee meeting. Senior executives 
are invited to attend Board meetings periodically for the purpose 
of making presentations on their areas of responsibility. In addition 
to formal Board meetings, the Chairman and Chief Executive meet 
frequently and make regular contact with other Board members. The 
Board and the senior executives meet formally once during each 
financial year to discuss corporate strategy.
Independent Professional Advice
The Board has approved a procedure whereby directors may 
consult the Company’s advisers and, if necessary, take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense, although not in 
respect of a director’s personal interests. Before seeking advice, the 
director concerned must notify the Chairman, or in his absence, the 
Senior Independent Director. No such advice was sought by any 
director during the year.
Company Secretary
Board members have access to the Company Secretary, who attends 
all Board meetings. The appointment and removal of the Company 
Secretary is subject to the approval of the Board.
The General Counsel and Company Secretary, Iain Ward, joined the 
Company on 14 July 2014.
Board Evaluation
An evaluation of the Board is carried out each year. As for previous 
years, a Board evaluation was carried out during the year ended 
30 April 2015. A rigorous and formal review required completion 
of a questionnaire relating to the performance of the Board and 
its committees and with regard to compliance with the Code. The 
evaluation was wide ranging and focused on the various aspects 
of the Code. The results of the questionnaire were reported to the 
Board in a manner that did not identify any individual responses. The 
evaluation concluded that there were no areas of significant weakness 
and that overall the Board and its Committees were operating 
effectively.
The 2014 evaluation identified a number of recommendations which 
the Board has acted on during the year. For the year ahead the 
Board is committed to the continued training and development of its 
directors and a review of the Board evaluation process.

Election and Re-election of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require all directors to 
retire and submit themselves for re-election at the first AGM after 
appointment and thereafter at least every three years. The Notice of 
AGM will give details of those directors seeking re-election.
Meetings of Non-executive Directors
Led by the Senior Independent Director, the Non-executive Directors 
meet informally, without the Chairman being present, principally to 
appraise the Chairman’s performance and to review his remuneration. 
The Chairman holds meetings at least annually with the Non-executive 
Directors without the executive directors present.
Board Committees
The Board has the three main committees listed below. The current 
terms of reference of each committee may be obtained from the 
Company’s website.
Remuneration Committee
During the year members of this Committee were William Jenkins 
(Chairman), Steve Crummett and Andrew Hosty from his appointment 
on 14 July 2014. The Chairman is invited to attend all meetings, but 
does not attend any part of any meeting at which his own terms of 
appointment are discussed. The Chief Executive attends by invitation 
where appropriate except where his own remuneration is being 
considered.
The Remuneration Committee is primarily responsible for determining 
the structure, components (including pension rights and compensation 
payments) and level of the remuneration packages of the Chairman, 
the executive directors and designated members of the senior 
management team. Details of the role of the Remuneration Committee 
and attendance of Committee members are set out on page 74. The 
Remuneration Committee met five times during the year.
The activities of the Committee during the year are set out in the 
separate Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 68 to 74.
Nomination Committee
Members during the year were Peter Fellner (Chairman), William 
Jenkins, Lynn Drummond until her resignation on 14 July 2014, Steve 
Crummett, Ian Nicholson, Andrew Hosty from his appointment on  
14 July 2014, Charlotta Ginman from her appointment on 11 February 
2015 and Jonathan Glenn.
The Nomination Committee is primarily responsible for reviewing 
the membership of the Board and identifying suitable candidates 
for appointment and reappointment as directors. In addition, the 
Board has delegated responsibility to the Nomination Committee for 
succession planning both at Board and senior management level. The 
inclusion of the Chief Executive in the membership of the Nomination 
Committee ensures that a balanced view is taken regarding the needs 
of the Group as a whole. The Committee ensures that the search for 
Board members is undertaken against objective criteria and with due 
regard to the benefits of diversity, including gender. Appointments are 
made on merit, taking into account the importance of maintaining a 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge.
During the year Ridgeway Partners assisted with the search for both 
of the new Non-executive Directors.
Ridgeway Partners has no other connection with the Company.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is comprised entirely of independent Non-
executive Directors. Members during the year have been Steve 
Crummett as Chairman, Lynn Drummond until her resignation on  
14 July 2014, Andrew Hosty from his appointment on 14 July 2014 
and Charlotta Ginman from her appointment on 11 February 2015. 
Steve Crummett is considered by the Board to have recent and 
relevant financial experience and is also a chartered accountant.
The external auditors’ lead partner and the Chief Financial Officer 
attend each meeting as requested by the Committee. The Chief 
Executive Officer attends the interim and year end meetings.
The Audit Committee met three times during the year. The meetings 
were attended by all members. At each meeting the members of 
the Committee took the opportunity of meeting the external auditors 
without management being present.

Key Developments in Accounting, Corporate 
Reporting and Taxation
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing on behalf of the 
Board the Group’s financial and reporting practices and disclosures, 
reviewing the integrity of the financial statements, the Group’s system 
of internal controls, the work of the external auditors and Group 
compliance with financial policies, laws and regulations. The Audit 
Committee terms of reference may be obtained from the Company’s 
website.
The annual and half-yearly financial reports are reviewed by the 
Committee through a process which includes discussion with the 
Chief Financial Officer and the external auditors. The external auditors 
prepare reports to the Committee on significant accounting policies 
and issues and judgements applied in the preparation of the financial 
reports. The Audit Committee gives its recommendation to the Board 
concerning the adoption and publication of all financial reports to 
shareholders.
In addition to the Board, the Audit Committee has conducted its 
annual review of the system of internal controls based on a review of 
significant risks identified, internal reviews, external audits and reports 
from management.
Financial Reporting and Significant Financial 
Matters
In carrying out its duties, the Committee is required to assess whether 
suitable accounting policies have been adopted and to challenge 
the robustness of significant management judgements reflected in 
the financial results. This process involves reviewing relevant papers 
prepared by management in support of the policies adopted and 
judgements made. These papers are discussed with management 
and the external auditors. In addition, the Committee reviews the year 
end report to the Audit Committee from the external auditors based 
upon its work performed and findings from the annual audit.
The significant accounting issues considered by the Committee during 
the year were areas where management is required to use significant 
judgement. These issues are listed below:
Goodwill Impairment
The value of goodwill is supported by a value in use model prepared 
by management. This is based on cash flows extracted from the 
Group’s budget and strategic plan, which have both been approved 
by the Board. The Committee debated the performance of the 
businesses, including the acquired Aesica business post acquisition, 
considered the cash flow models in the Group’s strategic plan, and 
evaluated sensitivities in relation to that plan.
Contingent Consideration on the Disposal of King 
Systems
The contingent consideration due on the disposal of King Systems is 
recorded at fair value, a calculation which requires judgement around 
the level of expected sales of the King Vision product for three years 
post disposal. The Committee has reviewed the fair value calculation 
and assessed the assumptions used by management in discussion 
with management and the external auditors.
The Treatment of Special Items and their 
Presentation in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Special items have been separately disclosed within the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements. The Committee has reviewed 
papers prepared by management showing how these costs have 
been identified and calculated. It has challenged both the quantum of 
the charge and its presentation in the consolidated income statement 
and is satisfied that these costs have been treated appropriately. The 
Committee specifically evaluated the appropriateness of the treatment 
of those items relating to the Aesica acquisition and considered the 
adequacy of the related disclosures.
Revenue Recognition
The Group’s policy for revenue recognition is set out in note 1 to 
the financial statements. Management prepares a paper for the 
Committee setting out any key judgements applied in respect of 
revenue recognition and in the accounting for major manufacturing 
contracts. The Committee has reviewed the papers presented and 
challenged management on the judgements applied ensuring they are 
in line with the Group policy.
Acquisition Accounting
Accounting standards require that all assets and liabilities acquired in 
a business combination are recorded at fair values on acquisition. The 
key judgements in accounting for the acquisition of Aesica on  
12 November 2014 were:
•	 identification and fair value of intangible assets, determination of 
their useful lives and the methodology for subsequent amortisation; 
and
•	 basis for determination of the fair value of other acquired assets 
and liabilities including the recognition of any provisions to fulfil 
customer obligations and other costs.
Management prepared a paper for the Committee setting out the 
key judgements applied in respect of the acquisition of Aesica. The 
paper specifically addressed the key judgements above and included 
detailed reports from external valuers on the valuation of the intangible 
assets. The Committee reviewed these papers and the papers 
prepared by the external auditors, understood the basis for the 
valuation and discussed the key judgements with management and 
the external auditors. 
The Committee has additionally discussed each issue with the 
external auditor and sought its opinion based upon the work 
they have performed during the audit. Based upon its review and 
discussions with both management and the Group’s external 
and internal auditors, the Committee is satisfied that, after raising 
appropriate challenge, the judgements outlined above are reasonable 
and that the appropriate disclosures have been included in the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements.

Non-Audit Services
In accordance with its policy on non-audit services provided by 
the Company’s auditors, the Committee reviews and approves the 
award of any such work. The Audit Committee refers to the Board for 
approval of any non-audit services where the fees for such work may 
represent a significant proportion of the annual audit fee.
Ernst & Young LLP have handled the Group’s tax compliance 
programme and specifically advised on the Patent Box regime and 
Above the Line R&D claims. Deloitte LLP have provided remuneration 
advice and valuation services in respect of Long-Term Incentive Plan 
grants. KPMG LLP have provided risk assurance audit services.
Details of non-audit services provided to the Company by the external 
auditors are shown in note 3 to the financial statements.
Auditor Independence
The current lead audit partner is due to rotate at the end of this 
audit cycle. The Audit Committee has considered the reappointment 
of the auditors of the Group, and has determined to conduct a 
formal Audit Services tender process including the incumbent, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , in the coming year to select the 
Group’s Auditor.
Reappointment of External Auditor
The Audit Committee is continuing to monitor developments at the 
European Union level regarding mandatory audit rotation and will 
factor any legislative requirements into its future plans around audit 
tendering.
Internal Audit
The Audit Committee has from time to time considered the need 
for a separate dedicated internal audit function. Having previously 
determined that this was not required, the Group has now 
determined that the scale and nature of the Group’s operations 
are now sufficiently large and complex that additional internal audit 
resource would be appropriate going forwards. Therefore, in addition 
to its previous practice of the deployment of independent Group 
employees, and the engagement of internal audit services from 
suitable qualified external providers, further internal resource will be 
permanently assigned to delivering internal audit activities. The Audit 
Committee keeps this under review.
Whistle-blowing
The Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the internal 
procedures whereby employees can raise concerns about possible 
financial or other irregularities. The policy gives guidance on the 
type of matters that staff may wish to disclose, and a means of 
doing so via an independent organisation in the event that any staff 
member feels that he or she cannot make a disclosure via the usual 
management channels.
The Group is committed to the highest standards of openness, 
integrity and accountability and the prevention of bribery and 
corruption. As noted above, the Group operates a whistle-blowing 
policy so that employees can report confidentially any matter giving 
rise to concerns about the operation of the Group’s business.
Other Committees
The Executive Committee
This Committee is responsible for the executive management of the 
Group. It comprises the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, 
the Company Secretary/General Counsel, the Bespak General 
Manager, the Managing Director of Aesica and the Director of Human 
Resources. This Committee meets monthly to review and make 
decisions on operational matters not reserved for Board decisions.
The Corporate Responsibility Committee
The Corporate Responsibility Committee is responsible for reviewing 
and prioritising the Group’s corporate responsibility activities, further 
details of which can be found in the Corporate Responsibility Review 
on pages 32 to 38 of this report. The Committee is chaired by Non-
executive Director Ian Nicholson. Other members include the Chief 
Executive Officer, the Managing Director of Bespak, the Managing 
Director of Aesica, the Director of Human Resources and the Bespak 
Continuous Improvement Director. The Company Secretary acts as 
secretary to the Committee.
Risk Committee
The role and responsibilities of the Risk Committee are outlined under 
the Risk Management section.
Accountability
Internal Controls Review
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Group’s system 
of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system 
is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, but not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board 
has received regular reports on areas of any significant risk and on the 
related internal controls. The Board reviews the framework of internal 
controls annually and has reviewed the effectiveness of its internal 
systems of control as they have been operated within the year in 
accordance with the Turnbull Guidance, updated by the FRC in 2005. 
This system has been in place for the year under review and up to the 
date of approval of the Annual Report and accounts.
The review covers all material controls including financial and financial 
reporting processes, operational, compliance and risk management 
systems.
Controls over the financial reporting process and preparation of the 
consolidated accounts consist of extensive reviews by qualified and 
experienced individuals that ensure that all elements of the financial 
statements and appropriate disclosure are considered and accurately 
stated.

Risk Management
The Board accepts responsibility for determining the nature and 
extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving its 
strategic objectives.
There is an ongoing internal process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing significant risks faced by the Company that is regularly 
reviewed by the Risk Committee, the Executive Committee and then 
by the Board. This process has been in place throughout the year and 
up to the date of this report.
The Risk Committee is responsible for advising the Executive 
Committee on the co-ordination and prioritisation of risk management 
issues throughout the Group and developing a risk management 
strategy; ensuring that the Board’s risk policy is implemented 
throughout the Group through effective development and review of 
risk registers, mitigation plans and insurance policies; and promoting 
risk awareness at all levels.
A risk management strategy encompassing risk assessment and risk 
treatment has been adopted with the key objective to ensure that 
risk management is an integral part of the strategic and operational 
management decision-making, planning and implementation process. 
Risk appetite and tolerance has been reviewed and agreed by the 
Board and will be considered annually and monitored as appropriate.
The Company’s strategic plan is reviewed annually at an off-site 
meeting involving the Board and the Executive Committee. An annual 
budget is prepared by each of the operating divisions of the Company 
and this is consolidated into a Group Plan, which is reviewed and 
approved by the Board.
Further information on how we manage our business risks is set out 
in the Risk section on pages 30 and 31, which contains a list of the 
principal risks and uncertainties.
Control Procedures
Progress against budget is monitored at operating business and 
Group levels throughout the Company via monthly reporting of actual 
financial performance against budget and prior period actual results. 
The Executive Committee also reviews monthly the key measures of 
operating performance.
The Group has clear authority limits deriving from the list of matters 
reserved for decision by the Board, including capital expenditure 
approval procedures.
Financial Reporting
The directors’ responsibility for preparing the accounts is set out in 
the Directors’ Report on page 43.
Going Concern
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and 
the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future as the Group has net debt 
of £99.2m at 30 April 2015 and total banking facilities (including 
available overdrafts and using year end exchange rates) of £161.5m 
of which £15.4m is undrawn as at 30 April 2015 and available up 
to September 2019. As part of a corporate reorganisation, it was 
necessary to make short-term borrowing of £37.6m on the Group’s 
banking facilities, which was repaid on 5 May 2015. This borrowing 
had no impact on the Group’s net debt at 30 April 2015, as it was 
represented by cash within Group subsidiaries. Undrawn facilities 
would have been £53.0m at 30 April 2015 without this borrowing. The 
Company has therefore adopted the going concern basis in preparing 
the accounts.
Remuneration
Our Remuneration Report, which describes the level and components 
of the remuneration of the directors, is set out on pages 54 to 74.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board regards relationships with shareholders as very important 
and it aims to encourage open dialogue with them through regular 
meetings with the Group’s institutional shareholders, including regular 
meetings following the announcement of the Company’s interim and 
annual results. Meetings are also held at other times with institutional 
investors and other shareholders at their request. Shareholders may 
meet with any new Non-executive Director if they wish. The Chairman 
ensures that views expressed at these meetings are reported to 
the Board as a whole. The Company’s brokers also attend Board 
meetings at the request of the Chairman to provide feedback on 
shareholder opinion.
The Senior Independent Director is available to meet with 
shareholders as required.
The Annual General Meeting
All shareholders have the opportunity of discussing the Group’s 
performance and development at its AGM, which provides a forum 
for shareholders to raise issues with the Board. Members of the 
Remuneration, Nomination, Audit and Corporate Responsibility 
Committees will also be available at the AGM so that shareholders 
may discuss any queries they may have.
Our previous AGM was held in Hemel Hempstead on 4 September 
2014 and the full voting results on each of the resolutions are 
published on our website. Our 2015 AGM will be held on  
3 September 2015 at the offices of FTI Consulting, 200 Aldersgate, 
Aldersgate Street, London EC1A 4HD. The Notice of the Meeting  
sets out each of the resolutions to be proposed and a copy of the

Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present Consort Medical’s 
FY2015 Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
This report is split into two sections. The first outlines our 
remuneration policy which, subject to shareholders’ approval, will 
apply from the date of the 2015 AGM. The second part outlines how 
we have applied the remuneration policy approved at the 2014 AGM 
during FY2015 and how we plan to apply the new remuneration policy 
in FY2016. 
Key Decisions Made During the Year
Acquisition of Aesica
As you are aware, during the financial year the Company successfully 
completed a rights issue to fund the acquisition of Aesica, a 
leading European pharmaceutical contract and development 
organisation. The acquisition represents a very strong fit with the 
Company’s existing strategy of diversifying into adjacent markets and 
technologies to capture additional value in the drug/device supply 
chain.
Given the transformational nature of this transaction, the Committee 
reviewed the impact on the current remuneration arrangements.
In relation to the share plans, two adjustments were required:
•	 EPS targets for outstanding LTIP awards were adjusted to reflect 
the enlarged Group. The Committee have looked to ensure that the 
adjusted targets retain the stretch of the original targets. 
•	 In order to ensure that participants were unaffected by the rights 
issue, outstanding awards were adjusted to reflect the rights issue. 
As the exact circumstances could not have been envisaged when 
the previous policy was approved at the 2014 AGM, shareholder 
approval will be sought for the proposed adjustments to vested 
awards. 
Further details of these adjustments are set out in the main body of 
the report. 
Following the acquisition, the executive directors’ salaries were also 
reviewed. In particular, the Committee noted the significant increase in 
the financial size of the business, the Group’s expanded international 
footprint, and the increased complexity in the operations of the 
Group as a whole. All of these factors have increased the scale and 
complexity of the CEO and CFO roles, which justified a review of 
salary levels. 
At the time of the transaction, the Committee determined that any 
repositioning of salary should be considered on a phased basis in line 
with best practice guidelines. Subsequently, the Committee initially 
approved an increase of 5%, effective 1 December 2014. Following 
the year end, the Committee have determined that the salaries for 
executive directors should be increased by 3.5% (effective 1 August 
2015) in line with the wider employee population.
Renewal of Long-Term Incentives and Shareholding 
The current LTIP was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2005. 
This plan is due to expire in 2015 and therefore the Committee is 
presenting a replacement plan to shareholders for approval. 
The overall structure of the plan remains broadly the same as the 
previous plan, with amendments made to incorporate evolving best 
practice, including introduction of a clawback provision. 
Although the new plan has headroom to grant awards of up to 
150% of salary, the Committee intends to keep awards to executive 
directors unchanged, at 100% of salary.
To further increase alignment with shareholders, the Committee has 
also increased the shareholding requirement for the CEO to 200% of 
base salary.
FY2015 Incentive Payouts
The business has performed well during the year. Profit performance 
was strong with profit before tax and special items of £22.7m being 
delivered. The Company has also delivered on a number of key 
strategic objectives which are outlined in more detail on pages 10 
to 13. Taking into account performance against the targets set, the 
Committee determined that outcomes under the annual incentive 
scheme for the executive directors would be close to the maximum.
TSR performance over the last three years has been very strong and 
the Company has outperformed the market. The expectation is that 
the 2012 LTIP award will vest at around 90% of the maximum.
In the context of both Company and share price performance, the 
Committee is satisfied that the outcomes are fully deserved.
Shareholder Consultation and AGM
During the year, the Committee consulted with major shareholders 
regarding the key remuneration decisions, and in particular the points 
relating to the acquisition of Aesica and the terms of the new long-
term share plan. 
The Committee recognises that there are a range of views amongst 
shareholders, and valued the opportunity to listen to these prior to 
making decisions. Having reflected on the feedback provided, the 
Committee is comfortable that the decisions set out in this report are 
in the best interests of the Company and shareholders. 
Shareholder approval will be sought for the following at the AGM:
i. The new Policy Report;
ii. The Annual Report on Remuneration;
iii. The 2015 Performance Share Scheme (PSP); and
iv.  Proposed adjustments to selected vested awards as a result of the 
rights issue.
I trust you will find this report informative, and I look forward to 
receiving your support.

The following sets out our Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the 
“Policy”). This Policy will be put forward for shareholder approval at 
the 2015 AGM in accordance with section 439A of the Companies 
Act 2006. This Policy will apply to payments made from the AGM on 
3 September 2015. 
The Annual Remuneration Report (pages 66 to 74) includes further 
details on how this Policy will be operated for FY2016.
Changes Implemented since the Previous Policy
The previous remuneration policy was approved by shareholders 
at the AGM in 2014. As outlined in the Chairman’s statement, the 
Company is seeking approval for a new policy report at the 2015 
AGM. The new policy report has been drafted to incorporate the 
following changes:
•	 2015 Performance Share Plan – the previous long-term incentive 
plan approved by shareholders in 2005 is due to expire in 2015. 
The Company is therefore seeking separate approval for a 
replacement plan at the 2015 AGM. The revised policy incorporates 
the terms of the new plan. 
•	 Malus and clawback – in line with evolving best practice, the 
Committee has taken the opportunity to implement malus and 
clawback provisions in both the annual incentive scheme and the 
new long-term incentive plan.
•	 Adjustments to share awards – certain adjustments are required to 
ensure participants are unaffected by the rights issue which was 
undertaken in 2014. The revised policy enables such adjustments 
to be made.
Consort Medical’s Executive Remuneration 
Principles 
Our key principle remains to provide remuneration packages for 
executive directors which:
•	 are sufficiently attractive to enable the Company to recruit and 
retain talented individuals with the necessary skills and expertise to 
support the development of Consort Medical and grow long-term 
value for our shareholders; 
•	 contain levels of performance-related variable pay such that they 
are aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders; and
•	 provide appropriate motivation for executives to execute the 
strategy agreed by the Board and to develop and grow the 
Company and shareholder value, whilst taking account of internal 
and external risks.
The following outlines the Company’s remuneration policy, which the 
Committee believes achieves this objective. The key features are:
•	 providing a remuneration opportunity that is market competitive 
compared to relevant peers reflecting individuals’ experience, 
performance and responsibilities;
•	 operating an annual bonus, with a long-term deferred share 
element to align interests with shareholders over the longer term, 
where annual performance targets are aligned with business 
strategy and financial performance;
•	 offering participation in a long-term incentive plan which 
rewards executives for delivering shareholder value creation and 
achievement of long-term objectives; and
•	 expecting executive directors to build up and maintain a holding of 
Company shares, thus promoting alignment of directors’ interests 
with those of shareholders.

Base salary The core element 
of a competitive 
remuneration 
package.
The Committee sets base salary taking into 
account:
•	 the individual’s experience, responsibility 
and performance;
•	 salary levels at relevant comparators 
and at companies of a similar size and 
complexity;
•	 remuneration of different groups of 
employees within the Company.
Where appropriate, it is the policy of the 
Committee to pay upper quartile base 
salaries where the incumbent is of a proven 
calibre, along with demonstrable and 
sustained success in the role.
Base salary is normally reviewed annually 
with changes effective from 1 August 
although salaries may be reviewed more 
frequently or at different times of the 
year if the Committee determines this is 
appropriate.
In determining salary increases 
the Committee considers 
the factors outlined in the 
“operation” column. While 
there is no maximum salary 
level, salary increases will 
normally be in-line with the 
typical level of increase 
awarded to other employees 
in the Group. 
However, the Committee 
retains the discretion to make 
increases above this level in 
certain circumstances, for 
example, but not limited to: 
an increase in the individual’s 
scope of responsibilities; in 
the case of new executive 
directors who are positioned 
on a lower initial salary whilst 
they gain experience in the 
role; where the Company 
has significantly increased in 
size; or where the Committee 
considers that the current 
salary does not reflect the 
Company’s policy of upper 
quartile salary positioning for 
experienced executives.
Salaries with effect from  
1 August 2015 are:
CEO (Jonathan Glenn) — 
£472,450
CFO (Richard Cotton) — 
£307,000

Annual 
Incentive 
Scheme
To motivate and 
reward superior 
performance 
measured against 
annual financial, 
strategic and 
operational goals of 
the Company which 
reflect critical success 
factors.
The deferred share 
award element of the 
annual bonus ensures 
that part of the value 
of payments earned 
remains tied to the 
Company’s share price 
for a three year period, 
thus embedding long-
term alignment with 
the interests of our 
shareholders within 
the annual bonus plan.
The Committee 
considers that when 
taken together, the 
cash and deferred 
share elements 
strengthen the 
alignment between 
shareholders’ 
and executive 
directors’ interests 
and encourages a 
longer-term focus on 
shareholder value.
The Committee determines the maximum 
incentive opportunity taking into account 
the responsibilities of the role and market 
practice at comparable companies.
Performance is assessed over a financial 
year.
The Committee determines the level of 
bonus paid at its discretion taking into 
account performance against targets, the 
underlying performance of the business and 
executive directors’ management of, and 
performance in, all of the business issues 
that arose during the year.
The Annual Incentive Scheme incorporates 
malus and clawback provisions. Further 
details are set out below.
Deferred share element:
The deferred share element may be 
structured as a nil-cost option or a 
conditional award of shares. Awards 
structured as nil-cost options may normally 
be exercised within 40 days of vesting.
The deferred share awards will normally 
vest three years from award (unless the 
Committee determines an alternative 
vesting period is appropriate).
The vesting of deferred share awards 
will normally be subject to continued 
employment.
Dividend equivalents may be awarded 
during the vesting period. Dividend 
equivalents may be determined by the 
Committee on a cumulative basis and may 
assume reinvestment of dividends in the 
Company’s shares. 
CEO — Maximum opportunity 
of up to 150% of base salary 
(100% cash, 50% deferred 
into shares)
CFO — Maximum opportunity 
of up to 110% of base salary 
(75% cash, 35% deferred into 
shares)
For the cash element of 
the bonus, payments start 
being earned for entry level 
performance from 25% of 
maximum if targeted levels of 
performance are delivered, 
with the full incentive being 
paid for delivering maximum 
levels of performance.
For the deferred share 
element, the Committee 
determines the level of 
pay taking into account 
performance in the round.
Cash element:
The cash element of the 
bonus is determined based on 
performance against financial 
performance metrics and 
personal objectives.
Currently 80% of the bonus is 
based on financial measures 
with 20% based on individual 
personal objectives. The 
Committee may adjust this 
weighting in future years 
to ensure executives are 
appropriately incentivised to 
deliver key strategic goals. In 
any year financial performance 
metrics will always account for 
at least 70% of the bonus.
The Committee sets targets 
each year to ensure that they 
are appropriately stretching 
in the context of the business 
plan.
Deferred share element:
The award of the deferred 
shares is subject to the 
Committee’s assessment 
of performance against the 
strategic goals of the Group. 
The deferred share element 
will not be awarded unless the 
Committee is satisfied that 
a minimum level of financial 
performance has been 
achieved. 
The strategic measures for 
the bonus are assessed each 
year and represent areas that 
are important for the long-term 
success of the Company, 
including but not limited to 
matters such as growth, new 
value creation, broadening the 
depth and range of products 
portfolios, innovation and 
diversification into adjacent 
markets while keeping a tight 
control on costs.

Performance 
Share Plan 
(PSP)
To reinforce the 
alignment of the 
interests of executive 
directors and 
shareholders.
To motivate long-term 
business performance 
and shareholder value 
creation. 
To help retain our 
critical executive 
talent.
Award of shares which normally vest based 
on performance over a period of three years 
or such other period as the Committee may 
determine. 
Under the PSP rules awards may be 
granted in the form of a nil-cost option 
(or economic equivalent) subject to 
performance conditions as determined by 
the Committee.
The Committee may grant awards as 
“Approved PSP” awards (granting a PSP 
award in conjunction with a tax advantaged 
Company Share Option Plan award) to 
enable the director and the Company to 
benefit from HMRC-approved tax treatment 
on part of their award without increasing 
the pre-tax value delivered to participants. 
When a director has been granted an 
option under the Company Share Option 
Plan 2010, a director may at the same time 
receive an award of a set value of shares 
to fund the exercise price for that option or 
the value of an award on vesting may be 
reduced if the HMRC tax advantaged option 
is exercised.
The Committee shall determine the extent 
to which the performance measures have 
been met, which may include making 
adjustments to the metrics used to assess 
the performance conditions to reflect any 
relevant factors. 
Dividend equivalents may be awarded. 
Dividend equivalents may be determined by 
the Committee on a cumulative basis and 
may assume reinvestment of dividends in 
the Company’s shares. 
The Performance Share Plan incorporates 
malus and clawback provisions. Further 
details are set out below. 
As set out in the recruitment policy below, 
the 2015 PSP may be used to grant buyout 
awards.
Long-term share awards prior to the 2015 
AGM are granted under the 2005 Long-
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Awards after the 
2015 AGM will be made under the 2015 
Performance Share Plan.
Under the plan rules, awards 
can be made up to 150% of 
salary.
For 2015, awards for the CEO 
and CFO will continue to be 
up to 100% of salary.
In future years, where the 
Committee determines there 
are circumstances which 
merit varying current award 
levels, the Committee would 
appropriately consult with 
shareholders.
Any shares subject to an 
HMRC-approved option do 
not count towards these limits.
Awards currently vest based 
on relative total shareholder 
return and earnings 
performance measures. 
These measures will normally 
be equally weighted but the 
Committee may determine 
that an alternative weighting 
is appropriate. It is currently 
envisaged that either measure 
will have no less than a 25% 
weighting.
For threshold levels of 
performance up to 25% of 
the award vests, increasing 
to 100% of the award for 
maximum performance. There 
is straight-line vest of awards 
between these points.
The Committee determines 
targets each year to ensure 
that targets are stretching and 
represent value creation for 
shareholders while remaining 
motivational for management. 
Where appropriate, alternative 
metrics may be used for future 
awards to ensure they remain 
aligned with the corporate 
strategy.
If events happen which 
cause the Committee to 
consider that a performance 
condition has become unfair 
or impractical, it may amend 
that performance condition 
provided that the amended 
performance condition is 
not materially less difficult to 
satisfy.

Pension Part of a competitive 
package by providing 
a retirement benefit.
The Company provides executive directors 
with a Group Personal Pension Plan. To the 
extent that the aggregate of the employee 
and employer contributions exceed 
the annual allowance, a taxable cash 
supplement is provided.
The Committee may determine that 
alternative pension provisions will operate 
for new appointments to the Board. When 
determining pension arrangements for new 
appointments the Board will give regard 
to the cost of the arrangements, market 
practice and the pension arrangements 
received elsewhere in the Group.
The Company’s maximum 
contribution/cash supplement 
for the executive directors is 
as follows:
CEO — 20% of base salary
CFO — 17.5% of base salary
None
Benefits Part of a competitive 
package.
Benefit policy is to provide an appropriate 
level of benefit taking into account market 
practice at similar sized companies and 
the level of benefits provided for other 
employees in the Group.
Core benefits — Benefits currently include 
car allowance, fuel card, life assurance, 
private medical insurance (for the executive 
and his family) and personal permanent 
health insurance.
All-employee share plans — Executives 
are eligible to participate in the Company’s 
all-employee share schemes on the same 
terms as UK colleagues up to HMRC-
approved limits. The Company currently 
operates the Savings Related Share Option 
Plan and Share Incentive Plan.
Relocation policy — In the event that an 
executive were required to relocate from 
their home location to undertake their role, 
the Committee may provide an additional 
reasonable level of benefits to reflect the 
relevant circumstances (on a one-off or 
ongoing basis).
Benefits are reviewed by the Committee in 
the context of market practice from time to 
time and the Committee may introduce or 
remove particular benefits if it is considered 
appropriate to do so.
The cost of benefit provision 
will depend on the cost to 
the Company of providing 
individual items and the 
individual’s circumstances and 
therefore there is no maximum 
value.

Policy Report

Further Detail
The Company also operates a shareholding guideline — details of this 
policy can be found on page 70 of the Annual Remuneration Report.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set 
out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without 
obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment. Awards granted 
under the Company’s share plans will be operated in accordance 
with the relevant plan rules. The Committee may adjust awards only 
in accordance with the provisions of the relevant plan rules. This 
includes making adjustments to awards to reflect one-off corporate 
events, such as a change in the Group’s capital structure. Where 
possible under the plan rules, awards may be settled in cash rather 
than shares, where the Committee considers this appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make any 
remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including 
exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such 
payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set 
out above where the terms of the payment were agreed: (i) before  
4 September 2014 (the date the Company’s first directors’ 
remuneration policy approved by shareholders came into effect);  
(ii) before the policy set out above came into effect, provided that the 
terms of the payment were consistent with the directors’ remuneration 
policy in force at the time they were agreed; or (iii) at a time when 
the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in 
the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the payment was 
not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the 
Company. For these purposes “payments” includes the Remuneration 
Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation 
to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are “agreed” at the 
time the award is granted.
Malus and Clawback
The Annual Incentive Scheme and Performance Share Plan 
incorporate malus and clawback provisions. 
For Deferred Share awards granted since 1 June 2013, in the event 
of a material misstatement in Consort Medical’s financial results 
the Committee may, at its discretion, apply malus to outstanding 
awards. The Committee may reduce the number of outstanding 
shares to reflect the number of shares that would have vested if the 
misstatement had not occurred. 
For Annual Incentive Scheme awards granted in respect of FY2016 
and subsequent years, in the event of (i) a material misstatement in 
Consort Medical’s financial results; or (ii) serious reputational damage 
to the Company, the Committee may:
•	 apply malus to reduce an award before the award is paid to the 
participant; or
•	 clawback payments for up to two years following the end of the 
relevant performance period.
For LTIP awards granted since 1 June 2013, in the event of a material 
misstatement in Consort Medical’s financial results, the Committee 
may, at its discretion, apply malus to outstanding share awards. The 
Committee may reduce the number of outstanding shares to reflect 
the number of shares that would have vested if the misstatement had 
not occurred. 
For long-term incentive awards granted from FY2016 onwards, in 
the event of (i) a material misstatement in Consort Medical’s financial 
results; or (ii) serious reputational damage to the Company, the 
Committee may:
•	 apply malus to an unvested award; or
•	 clawback a vested or exercised award or equivalent value at any 
time prior to the fifth anniversary of grant.
Information Supporting the Policy Table
Selection of Performance Measures
The annual bonus contains two elements — the cash element and 
the deferred share element. The cash portion is based on financial 
performance and personal objectives for the individual executive 
directors. The Committee selected these measures to ensure 
continued focus on delivery of financial performance compared 
to budget and the achievement of key personal goals which are 
considered important to drive the performance of the business in 
the long-term. The level of a deferred share award is based on the 
achievement of key strategic milestones. In a business such as ours it 
is important that there is a constant focus on innovation, development 
and meeting strategic objectives today which will deliver value for 
shareholders in the future. 
The Committee considers that the combination of measures used for 
the cash and deferred share element provides an appropriate balance 
of focus on financial and wider business and strategic goals.
Since 2013, the LTIP has been based on total shareholder return 
and earnings performance and 2015 awards under the PSP will also 
be based on these metrics. Total shareholder return measures share 
price improvement and dividend returns and therefore is a direct 
measure of the value we have returned to shareholders compared to 
the wider market. The earnings measures incentivise management to 
grow earnings for shareholders over the long-term.
Remuneration Arrangements throughout the Group
When assessing remuneration, the Committee takes care to 
ensure that individuals are not overpaid in relation to their roles 
and responsibilities, and that packages for senior individuals are 
appropriate in comparison to the remuneration of other employees 
within the Company. Remuneration policy throughout the organisation 
is based on the same principles — that reward should be sufficient 
to retain and motivate individuals of a sufficient calibre without paying 
more than is necessary and should encourage individuals to deliver 
their own objectives and ultimately create value for shareholders. At 
Consort Medical our employees have a variety of different roles and 
responsibilities and therefore the reward opportunity and structure of 
reward necessarily is different to reflect this.
Senior executives who are members of the Group Executive Committee 
participate in the same reward structure as the executive directors.

Managers across the Group participate in the bonus plan with the 
most senior and key employees participating in the same PSP as the 
executive directors. The majority of employees are eligible to earn a 
bonus each year based on their site specific performance. We also 
offer employees the opportunity to save and buy shares through the 
Sharesave Plan, thus giving them the opportunity to be shareholders. 
Long-term Incentive Awards to be granted in 2015
It is expected that long-term share awards will be granted to executive 
directors in June 2015 under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 
current intention is that following approval of the 2015 Performance 
Share Plan at the 2015 AGM, participants will waive this LTIP award 
in exchange for an equivalent award under the new 2015 plan. The 
replacement award under the new 2015 plan will be over the same 
number of shares (irrespective of the face value at that date) and 
subject to the same performance criteria, but will be subject to the 
terms approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM (including relevant 
malus and clawback provisions).
Adjustment to Share Awards following the Rights Issue
The 2012, 2013 and 2014 LTIP and DBP awards have been adjusted 
by a factor of 1.21 based on the theoretical ex-rights price disclosed 
in the prospectus published on 30 September 2014 in relation to the 
acquisition of Aesica. The adjustments are to ensure that participants 
are unaffected by the rights issue. These adjustments are within the 
scope of the remuneration policy approved by shareholders in 2014.
As a result of the transaction, the exercise of the 2011 LTIP award 
was delayed. Similarly, the potential sale of shares from the vested 
and exercised 2011 Deferred Bonus award was also delayed. It 
is proposed that the adjustment to increase the number of vested 
shares for these awards will be on the same basis as for the unvested 
awards. As the exact circumstances were not envisaged when the 
previous remuneration policy was presented to shareholders in 2014, 
a resolution seeking approval for this adjustment to awards held by 
relevant participants, including the CEO, will be sought at the 2015 
AGM.
Remuneration Policy for Non-executive Directors
The Board is responsible for determining the policy on remuneration of Non-executive Directors. The Company aims to attract Non-executive 
Directors who, through their experience, can further the interests of the Company and make an effective contribution to its strategic development.
Approach to setting fees Basis of fees Other items
The fees of the Non-executive Directors are agreed 
by the Board. 
The fee for the Chairman is agreed by the 
Committee.
Fees are normally reviewed every two years but 
may be reviewed more or less frequently if it is 
considered appropriate.
Fees are set taking into account the level of 
responsibility, relevant experience and specialist 
knowledge of each Non-executive Director and 
fees at other companies of a similar size and 
complexity. 
Non-executive Directors are paid a basic fee for 
membership of the Board with additional fees 
being paid for being the Senior Independent 
Director or Chairman of a Board committee to 
take into account the additional responsibilities 
and workload. Additional fees may also be paid 
for other Board responsibilities or roles if this is 
considered appropriate.
•	 The non-executive Chairman receives an all-
inclusive fee for the role.
•	 Fees are paid in cash.
•	 Current fees are as follows:
 — Chairman’s fees – £130,000
 — Basic Non-executive Director fees – £38,500
Supplements:
 — Senior Independent Director – £7,500

Annual bonuses or share-based incentives are not 
awarded to Non-executive Directors, but they are 
encouraged to hold shares in the Company.
Non-executive Directors do not currently receive 
any benefits. However, benefits may be provided 
in the future if, in the view of the Board (for Non-
executive Directors, or the Committee for the 
Chairman), this is considered appropriate.
Travel and other reasonable expenses (including 
fees incurred in obtaining professional advice in 
the furtherance of their duties and any associated 
taxes) incurred in the course of performing their 
duties are reimbursed to Non-executive Directors.
Non-executive Directors are included on the 
directors’ and officers’ indemnity insurance. 
The Non-executive Directors have appointment letters, the terms of which recognise that their appointments are subject to the Company’s 
Articles of Association and their services are at the direction of the shareholders.
All Non-executive Directors submit themselves for election at the AGM following their appointment and at subsequent intervals of no more than 
three years.
Non-executive Directors are not entitled to any payment in lieu of notice.
The letters of appointment are available for shareholders to view from the Company Secretary upon request.

Remuneration  
Policy Report

Remuneration Policy for New Hires
When determining the remuneration package for a newly-appointed 
executive director, the Committee would seek to apply the following 
principles: 
•	 The package should be market competitive to facilitate the 
recruitment of individuals of sufficient calibre to lead the business. 
At the same time, the Committee would intend to pay no more than 
it believes is necessary to secure the required talent. 
•	 The structure of the ongoing remuneration package would normally 
include the components set out in the policy table for executive 
directors.
•	 In addition, the Committee has discretion to include any other 
remuneration component or award which it feels is appropriate 
taking into account the specific commercial circumstances, 
and subject to the limit on variable remuneration set out below. 
The key terms and rationale for any such component would be 
appropriately disclosed.
•	 Where an individual forfeits outstanding variable pay opportunities 
or contractual rights at a previous employer as a result of 
appointment, the Committee may offer compensatory payments 
or awards, in such form as the Committee considers appropriate 
taking into account all relevant factors including the form of awards, 
expected value and vesting timeframe of forfeited opportunities. 
When determining such “buy-out” the guiding principle would be 
that awards would generally be on a “like for like” basis unless not 
appropriate.
•	 Consistent with the policy table, the maximum level of variable 
remuneration which may be awarded (excluding any compensatory 
payments or awards referred to above) is 300% of salary (this 
reflects the current maximum opportunity for the CEO i.e. a bonus 
of 150% of base salary and a PSP award of 150% of base salary). 
This maximum level of variable remuneration includes awards made 
as part of the ongoing package. As noted in the policy table, the 
current intention is to grant PSP awards of 100% of salary.
•	 Where an executive director is required to relocate from their 
home location to take up their role the Committee may provide 
reasonable assistance with relocation (either via one-off or ongoing 
payments or benefits).
•	 In the event that an internal candidate was promoted to the Board, 
legacy terms and conditions would normally be honoured, including 
pension entitlements and any outstanding incentive awards. 
To facilitate buy-out awards outlined above, in the event of 
recruitment, the Committee may grant awards to a new executive 
director under Listing Rule 9.4.2 which allows for the granting of 
awards, to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of 
an executive director, without seeking prior shareholder approval or 
under any other appropriate Company incentive plan (including the 
2015 Performance Share Plan).
The remuneration package for a newly appointed Non-executive 
Director would normally be in line with the structure set out in the 
policy table for Non-executive Directors. Remuneration for newly 
appointed Non-executive Directors may be paid in the form of cash 
or shares. 
Remuneration Outcomes in Different Performance 
Scenarios
The remuneration package at Consort Medical is structured so that 
the majority of the package is related to the delivery of performance 
over the short and long-term to ensure that reward is aligned with 
shareholder value creation.

package for executive directors under three assumed performance

Executive Director Service Contracts and Policy on Payment for Loss of Office
When determining leaving arrangements for an executive director, the Committee takes into account any contractual agreements including the 
provisions of any incentive arrangements, typical market practice and the performance and conduct of the individual.
The service agreements are available to shareholders to view on request from the Company Secretary. 
Notice period Executive directors have service contracts with the Company which can be terminated on 12 months’ notice by the Company and 6 months’ 
notice by the executive directors. 
Jonathan Glenn was appointed on 26 July 2006 and Richard Cotton was appointed on 25 June 2012.
Payment in lieu of 
notice
The Company may at its discretion terminate any executive director’s contract by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to the base 
salary, and benefits which would have been received during the notice period. The current executive directors are also entitled to an amount 
in respect of bonus for their notice period (or remainder of the notice period). The Committee has the discretion to determine the level of 
such bonus. Recently when directors left the business the Committee determined that no bonus should be due for the notice period. The 
Committee’s policy going forward is that when new contracts are agreed with new executive directors that any entitlement to bonus as part of 
any payment in lieu of notice will be removed. Executive directors are also entitled to a payment in respect of any accrued but untaken holiday 
at the time of termination of employment. If such a payment were to be made to Mr Cotton, it may be made in instalments over the notice 
period. 
Annual incentives The executive director may, at the discretion of the Committee, remain eligible to receive an annual bonus for the financial year in which they 
ceased employment. Such Annual Incentive Scheme awards will be determined by the Committee taking into account time in employment 
and performance. 
2010 Deferred 
Bonus Plan
Death
Awards shall vest at the time of death and where awards are in the form of options they may be exercised for a period of 12 months from 
death.
“Good leaver” by reason of injury, ill-health or disability, redundancy, retirement, or the Company for which the participant works leaves the 
Group and any other reasons determined by the Committee
Awards shall vest in full on the normal vesting date unless the Committee determines that awards should vest on the individual’s cessation 
of employment. Where awards are in the form of nil-cost options they may be exercised during the normal exercise window or, where the 
Committee has determined that awards should vest on the participant’s date of cessation of employment, for a period of six months from 
cessation of employment. 
“Good leaver” by reason of the participant’s employing business leaving the Group
Awards will vest in full at the time of the business leaving the Group. Awards in the form of options may be exercised for up to six months 
from the relevant business leaving the Group.
Leavers in other circumstances
Awards will normally lapse.
2005 Long-Term 
Incentive Plan
Death
Performance share awards shall vest at the date of death or at the normal vesting date (at the choice of the personal representatives of a 
deceased participant). Awards will be prorated to the date of death and to the extent to which the performance condition has been met. 
For awards in the form of stock appreciation rights, personal representatives shall have 12 months from vesting to exercise awards.
“Good leaver” by reason of injury, ill-health or disability, redundancy, retirement, the sale of the participant’s employing company and business 
out of the Group and any other reason determined by the Committee
Performance share awards shall vest on the normal vesting date and shall be pro-rated for the period of time elapsed up to the participant’s 
cessation of employment and the extent to which the performance condition has been met. For awards made to Executive Directors in 2015, 
leavers for redundancy and retirement may not automatically be treated as good leavers.
For awards in the form of share appreciation rights, participants shall have six months from the normal vesting date to exercise awards which 
vest as a result of the individual’s cessation of employment. Any share appreciation rights which have already vested may be exercised within 
six months of the individual’s cessation of employment.
Leavers in other circumstances
Awards will normally lapse.

Share Plan
Death
Awards shall vest to the extent to which any performance condition has been met, and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, shall be 
prorated for the period of time that has elapsed since the award was granted until the date of death.
A participant’s personal representatives have until 12 months from the date of death to exercise any vested awards. 
“Good leaver” by reason of injury, ill-health or disability, the sale of the participant’s employing company and business out of the Group and 
any other reason determined by the Committee
Awards will usually continue until the usual vesting date unless the Committee determines that the award will vest as soon as reasonably 
practicable following the date on which the participant ceases to be an employee or officer of the Group.
The Committee shall determine the extent to which awards vest in these circumstances, taking into account the extent to which any 
performance condition has been satisfied. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, the period of time that has elapsed since the award 
was granted will also be taken into account. Participants will have six months following vesting to exercise awards.
Leavers in other circumstances
Awards will normally lapse.
2010 CSOP Where options vest before the end of any relevant performance period, the Committee may assess any relevant performance condition on 
such modified basis as the Committee may determine.
Death
Options will become exercisable to the extent that the performance conditions have been met for a period of 12 months following death. 
“Good leaver” by reason of injury, ill-health or disability, redundancy, retirement, the Company for which the participant works leaving the 
Group or any other reasons determined by the Committee
Options which have not vested at the time of cessation vest on the normal vesting date to the extent that the performance conditions have 
been met and can be exercised within six months. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, the period of time that has elapsed since 
the award was granted will also be taken into account. Options which have already vested at the time of cessation may be exercised for six 
months following cessation of employment. 
“Good leaver” by reason of the participant’s employing business leaving the Group
The Committee may notify participants when it becomes aware that a relevant business may be leaving the Group. If participants are given 
at least 14 days’ notice of the transfer, options vest to the extent that the performance conditions have been met and may be exercised 
until the completion of the transfer. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, awards shall be prorated for the period of time that has 
elapsed since the award was granted. If such notice is not given, options vest on the normal vesting date to the extent that the performance 
conditions have been met and may be exercised for a period of 12 months thereafter. 
Leavers in other circumstances
Options will normally lapse.

Change of Control
In the event of a change of control or a voluntary winding-up of the 
Company: 
•	 Awards granted under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan will vest 
subject to the achievement of any relevant performance conditions 
(which may be adjusted to reflect the reduced performance period)

However, in an internal reorganisation of the Group share awards 
may be “rolled over” into awards over shares in the acquiring 
company.
•	 Awards granted under the 2015 Performance Share Plan will vest 
subject to the achievement of any relevant performance conditions 
(which may be adjusted to reflect the reduced performance 
period), any other factors the Committee determines relevant and, 
if the Committee determines it appropriate, time prorating. In an 
internal reorganisation of the Group, share awards will “roll over” 
into awards over shares in the acquiring company, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise. 
•	 Awards granted under the 2010 Deferred Bonus Plan will vest. 
•	 Options granted under the 2010 Company Share Option Plan 
will vest and may be exercised within six months of the takeover 
taking place or the relevant resolution being passed. However, in an 
internal reorganisation of the Group, options may be “rolled over” 
into options over shares in the acquiring company.
•	 In the event of a demerger, the Committee may determine 
that awards under the 2010 Deferred Bonus Plan and 2015 
Performance Share Plan vest, and options granted under the 2010 
Company Share Option Plan may be exercised early. 
Considering Employee Views
The Committee generally considers pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group when considering pay for executive directors 
and senior management. When considering base salary increases, 
the Committee reviews overall levels of base pay increases offered to 
other employees in the Group.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees regarding 
executive directors’ remuneration. However, the Company has 
conducted a survey of the views of employees in respect of their 
experience of working at Consort Medical, including their own reward. 
Consulting with Shareholders
The Committee believes that it is very important to maintain open 
dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters. Where significant 
changes are proposed to the executive directors’ reward framework, 
the Committee’s policy is to consult with major shareholders (unless 
not practical). 
During the year, the Committee consulted with major shareholders 
regarding the changes proposed to the policy. Their feedback was 
taken on board by the Committee and proposals were adapted before 
finalising the policy outlined above.

Notes to the Table
The following paragraphs set out details of how the numbers included in the single figure table above have been prepared.
Base Salary
The CEO and CFO’s salaries (with effect from 1 August 2014) were £434,700 and £282,500 respectively. As explained in the Chairman’s 
statement, following the acquisition of Aesica the base salaries for the CEO and CFO were increased with effect from 1 December 2014 by 5% 
to £456,450 and £296,625 respectively.
Benefits
Benefits include a car allowance, life assurance, private medical insurance and personal health insurance. The CEO also received a fuel card. 
Annual Bonus 
The following section summarises the annual bonuses paid to the CEO and CFO based on performance delivered in FY2015. 
In determining the actual bonus awarded, the Committee also made an assessment of individual performance against strategically important 
goals at a corporate and personal level to ensure that the overall level of bonus paid is appropriate. 
The table below shows the annual and deferred bonus opportunity for the executive directors in FY2015, and the required level of performance 
against budgeted PBT.

As noted above, the award of deferred shares depends on achievement against strategic objectives. In addition, the PBT hurdles outlined 
above must be met before the relevant portion of deferred shares can be awarded. If less than 90% of budgeted PBT is delivered, no deferred 
shares can be earned. If PBT is less than budget then the maximum amount of deferred shares that can be awarded is 29% of salary to the 
CEO and 20% of salary to the CFO.

PBT Targets — 80% of Cash Element
Actual profit before tax and special items performance for FY2015 was 
£22.7m. This was just below the maximum hurdle and therefore the 
cash element relating to PBT performance was 95.6% of maximum.
Strategic Measures — 20% of Cash Element and 
Deferred Share Element
For FY2015 the CEO’s objectives were to continue the development 
of the innovation pipeline, drive the strategy of diversification into 
adjacent markets and move up the value chain whilst controlling 
costs to create value. The CFO’s objectives were focused on financial 
management including treasury, cash and working capital. Improving 
risk management and pensions were other areas of focus. During the 
year the Group achieved the following strategic goals: award of three 
new development contracts; progress in delivery of development 
and innovation pipelines; organic diversified growth in revenue 
and earnings; new innovation in devices and formulation process 
technology; and acquisition and integration of Aesica. The Committee 
assessed performance against these metrics and determined that 
maximum vesting of 125% should be awarded for the personal 
portion of the cash element as objectives had been exceeded. The 
deferred share element paid out at 95% of the maximum opportunity.
Overall, the Committee determined that 100% of the maximum cash 
bonus opportunity would be paid to the CEO and CFO.
The granular detail of annual incentive targets have not been 
disclosed in full as they are considered by the Board to be 
commercially sensitive on the basis that they could give away details 
of our budgeting and our strategic goals to competitors.
The total bonuses awarded to executive directors were therefore as 
follows:
Role Total bonus
Cash 
element — 
100% of max
Deferred 
share element 
(deferred until 
June 2018) — 
95% of max
CEO £649,128 £440,087 £209,041
CFO £309,595 £214,500 £95,095
LTIP Awards – 2012 Awards Vesting based on 
Performance to FY2015
LTIP awards granted in 2012 were subject to TSR performance 
compared to the FTSE SmallCap, excluding investment trusts and 
finance, property and insurance companies. 25% of the award vested 
for TSR equal to the mean annualised TSR of the comparator group, 
with 100% vesting if TSR was greater than the lower of the mean 
annualised TSR comparator TSR group +7% and the upper quartile of 
the TSR group. 
For the CEO, TSR performance is assessed over the three-year 
period to 19 June 2015. Consort Medical’s TSR increased by 23% 
per annum over this period. The performance exceeded the mean 
annualised TSR of the comparator group by just over 6% per annum 
and therefore 92% of this award will vest in due course.
For the CFO, TSR performance is assessed over the three-year 
period to 24 June 2015. Consort Medical’s TSR increased by 23% 
per annum over this period. The performance exceeded the mean 
annualised TSR of the comparator by just under 6% and therefore 
89% of this award will vest in due course.
For the purpose of the single figure table, the value of the awards 
have been estimated based on the three-month average share price 
during the final quarter of the financial year (£8.77).

Adjustments to Share Awards following the Rights 
Issue
In October 2014, the Company undertook a successful rights issue to 
fund the acquisition of Aesica. Share awards have been adjusted to 
ensure participants are unaffected by the rights issue. 
At the date of the rights issue, the 2012, 2013 and 2014 LTIP and 
DBP awards were unvested. These have been adjusted by a factor 
of 1.21 based on the theoretical ex-rights price disclosed in the 
prospectus. Full details of these adjustments are set out in the table 
showing outstanding share awards set out on page 71. 
The Committee also proposes to make the same adjustment in 
respect of the 2011 Deferred Bonus and 2011 Long-Term Incentive 
Plan awards that were impacted by the rights issue. As a result of the 
transaction, the exercise of this LTIP award was delayed. Similarly, 
the potential sale of shares from the vested 2011 Deferred Bonus 
award was also delayed. The Committee therefore proposes to 
increase the number of vested shares on a similar basis to replicate 
the adjustment factor based on the theoretical ex-rights price 
disclosed in the prospectus. At the time of vesting, share awards 
were only partially adjusted. Subject to shareholder approval, a 
further balancing adjustment will be made following the AGM to all 
participants including the CEO. The CFO did not have any awards 
under these plans, and therefore no adjustment is required. Full details 
of outstanding share awards are set out in the table on page 71. 
How the Remuneration Policy will be Applied to 
Executive Directors in FY2016 (unaudited)
Salary and Benefits
•	 As explained in the Chairman’s statement, following the acquisition 
of Aesica, the Committee determined that base salaries for the 
CEO and CFO should be repositioned to reflect the size and 
complexity of the role. In line with best practice, the Committee 
have opted to reposition salaries on a phased basis. 
•	 It is expected that with effect from 1 August 2015, salaries will be 
increased by 3.5%, which is in line with the increases awarded 
to other employees within the Group. Salaries will be as follows: 
CEO (Jonathan Glenn) - £472,450 and CFO (Richard Cotton) - 
£307,000.
•	 In line with the policy, salary increases in future years are expected 
to be in line with the typical level of increase awarded to other 
employees in the Group.
•	 Benefits (including retirement benefits) for FY2016 will remain 
unchanged.

  The face value of LTIP awards is calculated using the average price of the three days prior to the date of grant of £8.973 (17 June (£8.72), 18 June (£9.10) and 19 
June (£9.10)).

  Subject to performance, 2014 LTIP awards will vest in June 2017. Awards continue to be subject 50% to TSR performance compared to the FTSE SmallCap, 
excluding investment trusts, finance, property and insurance companies; and 50% subject to earnings per share performance. The specific performance targets 
for these awards are disclosed on page 68. For threshold performance, 25% of the LTIP award may vest. Deferred Share awards are not subject to any further 
performance conditions and vest in June 2017.

•	 For the cash portion of the bonus, 80% will continue to be based 
on underlying PBT (before special items) and 20% will be based on 
the Committee’s assessment of success against personal strategic 
objectives. Awards under the deferred share element will continue 
to be subject to the Committee’s assessment of performance 
against the Group’s strategic goals, but subject to underlying PBT 
(before special items) performance hurdles being met. 
•	 The strategic measures for the bonus have been selected on the 
basis that they represent areas that are important for the long-term 
success of the Company.
•	 The Committee considers that this combination of measures 
provides an appropriate balance of focus on improving financial 
performance and wider business strategic goals. The Committee 
considers that when taken together, the cash and deferred 
elements strengthen the alignment between shareholders and 
executive directors’ interests, and encourage a longer-term focus 
on shareholder value, by requiring a three-year deferral of a portion 
of the annual bonus which is payable in shares.
Note: The performance targets for the FY2016 annual bonus have 
not been disclosed as they are considered by the Board to be 
commercially sensitive on the basis that they could give away details 
of our budgeting and our strategic goals to competitors. 
Long-term Incentives
•	 Awards to executive directors will remain unchanged at 100% of 
salary. The awards will continue to be subject to total shareholder 
return performance (50%) and earnings per share performance 
(50%).
•	 TSR will be measured against the TSR performance compared to 
the FTSE SmallCap, excluding investment trusts, finance, property 
and insurance companies. The targets for 2015 awards will remain 
unchanged.
Relative TSR performance —

TSR less than mean annualised comparator TSR 0%
TSR equal to mean annualised comparator TSR 25%
TSR greater than the lower of: (i) mean annualised comparator 
TSR +7%; or (ii) upper quartile annualised comparator TSR 100%
•	 Earnings per share will continue to be measured on a cumulative 
basis. The targets for 2015 awards are:

Vesting 
(% of 
element)
Less than 153p 0%
153p 25%
177p 100%
•	 The Committee believes this combination of measures continues to 
provide an appropriate balance between measuring performance 
against the Company’s peers and incentivising management to 
grow earnings for shareholders over the long-term.
•	 The Committee may make adjustments to the calculation of 
performance measures (e.g. following a transaction or for currency) 
to ensure performance is measured on a fair and consistent basis.
•	 The Committee has granted 2015 awards under the 2005 LTIP . 
On the approval of the 2015 PSP at the AGM in September 2015, 
these awards will be replaced by equivalent awards under the new 
plan and will therefore be subject to the latest terms approved by 
shareholders. 
Clawback
In line with best practice, the Committee has also determined that 
FY2016 incentives will be subject to malus and clawback provisions, 
as described in the Policy Report.
External Appointments
With the specific approval of the Board in each case, executive 
directors may accept external appointments as Non-executive 
Directors of other companies. The directors are entitled to keep the 
fees from external appointments. Neither of the executive directors 
currently holds any external appointments.

Statement of Directors’ Shareholding and Share Interests (audited section)
Executive directors are expected to accumulate and maintain a significant shareholding. The vesting of awards from the Company’s various 
equity related incentive arrangements can provide a means to develop this shareholding. Only ordinary shares that are beneficially held by the 
executive director (or their spouses, civil partners, children and step children) count towards the shareholding guideline.
Previously, the expected shareholding was equivalent to one times basic salary, to be built up over a five-year period. Following the AGM, the 
Committee intends to increase the shareholding requirement for the CEO to two times base salary.

  Calculated based on the share price on 30 April 2015 of £9.40. Following the AGM, the guideline will be increased to two times salary for the CEO. The 
expectation is that this increased holding be met within five years of the introduction of this guideline.

  Directors have five years from appointment to build the required level of shareholding. Richard Cotton joined the Company in 2012 and therefore has until 2017 to 
reach the guideline of 100% of salary.

  These awards were only partially adjusted for the rights issue prior to delivery to all participants (including to the CEO). In order to achieve an adjustment factor of 
1.21, a further adjustment will be made following the AGM, equating to 1,654 shares in respect of the 2011 Deferred Bonus and 5,226 shares in respect of the 
vested 2011 LTIP for the CEO.

 LTIP award made to partially fund the exercise price of the linked CSOP granted on the same date.

 Exercise price adjusted following the rights issue in line with HMRC requirements to £5.7117.
As noted above, the 2012, 2013 and 2014 LTIP and DBP awards 
have been adjusted by a factor of 1.21 based on the theoretical 
ex-rights price disclosed in the prospectus to ensure participants are 
unaffected by the impact of the rights issue. These adjustments have 
been made to ensure that awards are unaffected by the rights issue. 
The targets for outstanding LTIP awards have been adjusted to reflect 
the rights issue. In relation to the EPS performance condition applying 
to 2013 and 2014 LTIP awards, in line with the plan documentation 
the cumulative EPS targets have also been adjusted to reflect both 
the accretive earnings arising from the Aesica transaction plus the 
new number of shares in issue. The Committee has ensured that the 
stretch of the original threshold and maximum targets originally set are 
maintained.
The adjusted cumulative EPS targets for the outstanding 2013 and 
2014 LTIP awards are as follows:
EPS (aggregate over the three year 
performance period)
2013 award 2014 award Vesting (% of element)

Total employee pay includes wages and salaries, social security costs, 
pension costs and share-based payments for employees in continuing 
operations. Further details are provided in note 4 to the accounts on 
page 92. The increase primarily reflects the enlarged Group following 
the acquisition of Aesica. Staff costs increased by £26.3m to £54.6m 
in FY2015 (FY2014: £28.3m). 
During FY2014, distributions to shareholders included an aggregate 
dividend of £3,659,271 paid on 25 October 2013 and £2,120,434 
paid on 14 February 2014. For FY2015, distributions to shareholders 
included an aggregate dividend of £3,880,980 paid on 24 October 
2014 and £3,128,592 paid on 13 February 2015. It is proposed that 
a dividend of 11.68p per share be paid on 23 October 2015. Further 
details are provided in note 12 to the accounts on page 98.

Report

The Remuneration Committee
Role
The Remuneration Committee’s principal role is to determine and 
make recommendations to the Board regarding the policy for the 
remuneration of the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the executive 
directors, the Company Secretary and other members of the senior 
executive management of the Company. It also determines the policy 
for, and scope of, pension arrangements and approves the design 
of performance-related pay schemes, sets the targets for such 
schemes, and approves payments under such schemes.
The Committee reviews the design of all share incentive plans for the 
approval of the Board and the shareholders. It determines each year 
whether awards will be made and, if so, the overall amount of such 
awards, the individual awards to be made to executive directors and 
other senior executives, and the performance targets to be used. The 
terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee were reviewed 
during the year and are published on the Company’s website.
Activities during the Year
The Remuneration Committee met five times during the year. Details 
of attendance at the meetings are shown in the table on page 48. The 
key matters discussed at these meetings included:
•	 Remuneration of executive directors and senior executives;
•	 Determining bonus payouts and setting bonus targets;
•	 Determining LTIP award vesting and consideration of LTIP 
performance criteria;
•	 Granting of share awards and setting performance targets for 
awards;
•	 Adjustments to share awards following the rights issue and 
acquisition of Aesica;
•	 Terms of the 2015 Performance Share Plan;
•	 Committee terms of reference; and
•	 Directors’ Remuneration Report.
In discussing the above matters, the Remuneration Committee 
considered the remuneration policies of the Company as a whole.
Members
The Remuneration Committee comprises the following independent 
Non-executive Directors:
Name Remuneration Committee position
Dr William Jenkins Chairman (since 1 March 2013)
Steve Crummett Member (since 6 November 2012)
Andrew Hosty Member (since 14 July 2014)
Advisers
The Chairman, the Chief Executive, the HR Director, and the 
Company Secretary were invited to attend some or all of the meetings 
to provide advice to the Committee. They did not attend when any 
matter related to their own remuneration was discussed.
During the period the Committee has received advice from its 
independent remuneration advisers, Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”). Deloitte 
were appointed by the Committee. The Remuneration Committee 
considers that the advice provided by Deloitte is objective and 
independent. Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and adheres to its Code in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee is comfortable 
that the Deloitte LLP engagement partner and team that provide 
remuneration advice to the Committee do not have connections with 
Consort Medical that may impair their independence. 
Separate teams within Deloitte also provided the Company with 
advice on the valuation of share awards for IFRS2 purposes and 
in connection with the Company’s risks and controls. Total fees for 
advice provided to the Committee during the year under review 
amounted to £34,550.
The Committee also received advice in relation to its share schemes 
from the Company’s lawyers, Eversheds LLP .

General information
Consort Medical plc is a public limited company listed on the London 
Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled under the laws 
of England and Wales, registered number 406711. The address 
of the registered office is given on page 134. The nature of the 
Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Chief 
Executive’s Review on pages 14 to 23.
1. Presentation of the financial statements and 
accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to those companies reporting under 
IFRS, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and International Accounting 
Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(collectively referred to as IFRS) and related interpretations, as 
adopted for use in the European Union in all cases.
Accounting convention
The financial statements have been prepared using the historical 
cost convention, as modified by certain financial assets and 
financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value. The 
specific accounting policies adopted, which have been approved 
by the Board and which have been applied consistently in all years 
presented, are described within this note.
Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, 
a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Consolidation
The financial statements include the financial statements of the 
Company and all the subsidiaries during the years reported for the 
periods during which they were members of the Consort Medical plc 
group (‘the Group’).
Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business 
that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area 
of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a 
subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification of 
a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation 
meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an 
operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative 
income statement is presented as if the operation had discontinued 
from the start of the comparative period. 
Segmental reporting
The Group’s chief operating decision maker is considered to be the 
Executive Committee. This committee is responsible for the executive 
management of the Group and comprises the Chief Executive Officer, 
the Chief Financial Officer, the Company Secretary/General Counsel, 
the General Managers of the Group’s Bespak and Aesica businesses 
and the Director of Group Human Resources. The Executive 
Committee meets monthly to make decisions on operational and 
strategic matters, other than those reserved for the Board, including 
allocation of resources and assessment of the performance of 
the Group. The Group’s operating segments are determined 
with reference to the information that is supplied to the Executive 
Committee in order for it to allocate the Group’s resources and to 
monitor the performance of the Group. Following the acquisition 
of Aesica Holdco Limited (‘Aesica’) on 12 November 2014, the 
Executive Committee focuses on the operations of the Group by the 
Bespak and Aesica divisions as individual operating segments and, 
as a result, the Group has two reportable segments at the end of the 
current financial year.
Subsidiaries 
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial 
statements of the parent Company and all its subsidiaries made up to 
30 April 2015. Subsidiaries are entities which are directly or indirectly 
controlled by the Group. Control exists where the Group has the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so 
as to obtain benefits from its activities, generally accompanying a 
shareholding of more than one-half of the voting rights.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the 
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments 
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of completion. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair 
values at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets 
acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less 
than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the 
difference is recognised directly in the income statement. Costs of 
acquisition are charged to the income statement in the period in 
which they are incurred. 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is 
recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes 
to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be 
an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in 
profit or loss or as a change in other comprehensive income. Inter-
company transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on 
transactions between Group undertakings are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of 
the asset transferred. Uniform accounting policies have been adopted 
across the Group.
In the parent Company financial statements, investments in 
subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less provision for any 
impairment.

1. Presentation of the financial statements and 
accounting policies continued
Investments
Equity investments in entities that are neither associates nor 
subsidiaries are held at cost, less any provision for impairment.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of Consort Medical 
plc’s entities are measured using that entity’s functional currency, 
which is the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in sterling which is the parent Company’s functional and 
presentation currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period-
end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow 
hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
The results and financial position of all Group undertakings that have 
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency with (i) assets and liabilities 
for each balance sheet translated at the closing rate at the date 
of that balance sheet; (ii) income and expenses for each income 
statement translated at average exchange rates for the period; and 
(iii) all resulting exchange differences recognised as a component of 
other comprehensive income. In the case of subsidiaries acquired 
during the year, the average exchange rate takes into account the 
period of ownership only.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net 
investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency 
instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are 
recognised in the translation reserve within other comprehensive 
income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a 
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate.
The principal exchange rates applied in preparation of the financial 
statements were as follows:
2015 2014
GBP : EUR, average from 12 November 2014 1.32 n/a
GBP : EUR at 12 November 2014 1.27 n/a
GBP : EUR at the end of year 1.39 1.21
GBP : USD at the end of year 1.54 1.68
Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable for the sale of goods and services. Revenue from sales 
of products is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership 
pass to the customer, and is stated net of value added tax and other 
sales taxes. The point at which risk and reward is transferred is 
usually determined from shipping terms, which vary from customer to 
customer. Revenue from sales of services is recognised in the period 
in which the related chargeable costs are incurred or when revenue is 
earned under contractual obligations. Revenue from sales of tooling 
is recognised on a net basis, having regard to the transfer of risks and 
rewards. Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic 
benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Advance payments received from customers are credited to deferred 
income and the related revenue is released to the income statement 
in accordance with the recognition criteria described above.
Where a manufacturing contract includes variable consideration 
(such as a minimum order guarantee), the transaction price includes 
management’s best estimate of the variable consideration receivable 
at the balance sheet date.
Government grants
Grants received are revenue related and are credited to the income 
statement, within operating profit, so as to match them with the 
expenditure to which they relate to the extent that it is probable that 
conditions for repayment will not be met.
Post-employment benefits
The Group operates various post-employment schemes, including 
both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
(a) Pension obligations
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group 
pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no 
legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions once 
the contributions have been paid. The Group pays contributions 
to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a 
mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The contributions are 
recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. 
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a 
cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. 
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined 
contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of 
pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually 
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service 
and compensation. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in 
respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the 
fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit 
method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is 
determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using 
interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated 
in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have 
terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension 
obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such 
bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used. Actuarial 
gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes 
in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past-service 
costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.

(b) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated 
by the Group before the normal retirement date or whenever an 
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these 
benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier 
of the following dates: (a) when the Group can no longer withdraw 
the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs 
for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves 
the payment of termination benefits. In the case of an offer made 
to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are 
measured based on the number of employees expected to accept 
the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of 
the reporting period are discounted to their present value.
(c) Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and 
profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration 
the profit attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain 
adjustments. The Group recognises a provision where contractually 
obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a 
constructive obligation.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the 
Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange 
for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total 
amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of 
the options granted:
•	 including any market performance conditions (for example, an 
entity’s share price);
•	 excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance 
vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth targets 
and remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time 
period); and
•	 including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, 
the requirement for employees to save).
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about 
the number of options that are expected to vest. The total expense 
is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which 
all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of 
each reporting period, the entity revises its estimates of the number 
of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market 
vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original 
estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to 
the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as 
a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, 
measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised 
over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary 
undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost including any incidental 
costs of acquisition less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes 
the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable 
to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of property, plant 
and equipment (less the current expected residual value) on a straight-
line basis over their expected useful lives as follows:
— Freehold buildings and leasehold buildings 
with original lease terms over 50 years
50 years
— Leasehold buildings with original lease 
terms less than 50 years
Remaining period of 
lease
—  Cleanrooms 20 years
—  Building services 10 to 20 years
—  Mould and assembly machines Utilisation basis
—  Other plant, equipment and vehicles 3 to 10 years 
Cleanrooms and building services are categorised within plant and 
equipment. Land is not depreciated.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the 
proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income 
statement. From 1 November 2014, the method of depreciation for 
mould and assembly machines was changed from a time basis of 
3 to 10 years to a utilisation basis reflecting the amount a machine 
is used during the accounting period. This method is considered to 
better reflect the economic consumption of the value attributable to 
these machines. 
Assets under construction
The costs of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as 
incurred and are not depreciated until such time as the assets 
are commissioned, when the total costs are transferred to the 
appropriate asset category.

Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset 
at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is 
measured as the excess of:
•	 the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the 
acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity; over 
•	 the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least 
annually and more frequently if events or circumstances give 
indicators of an impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for 
impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication 
that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, the impairment 
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit  
pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the 
unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a 
subsequent period.
Internally generated intangible assets — research 
and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the 
period in which it is incurred. 
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s 
product development is recognised only if all of the following 
conditions are met:
•	 An asset is created that can be identified;
•	 It is probable that the asset created will generate future  
economic benefits; 
•	 It is technically feasible that the intangible asset can be completed 
so that it will be available for use or sale and there are sufficient 
available resources to complete it; and
•	 The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Where a product requires regulatory approval prior to launch, it 
is presumed that there is insufficient certainty over the product’s 
technical feasibility to recognise an intangible asset prior to that 
approval being obtained.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a  
straight-line basis over their useful lives. The estimated useful 
economic life of capitalised development costs is 5 to 10 years. 
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, 
development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period 
in which it is incurred.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets, including purchased patents, know-how, 
trademarks, software licences, customer contracts and relationships 
and distribution rights are capitalised at cost and amortised on a 
straight-line basis or sum of digits basis over their estimated useful 
economic lives through operating expenses. The estimated useful 
lives of other intangible assets are as follows:
Computer software: 4 years 
Patented and unpatented technology and know-how: 10 years 
Trademarks and trade names: 10 years 
Customer contracts and relationships: 
 —11 to 13 years on a sum of digits method (Aesica related)
 —5 to 10 years on a straight line basis (other) 
Licences and distribution agreements: 2 to 11 years
The amortisation method applied to the Aesica intangible assets on 
acquisition is deemed to better reflect the pattern in which the future 
economic benefits are expected to be consumed.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets excluding goodwill
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of 
impairment loss. Where it is not possible to identify separate cash 
flows relating to individual assets, Consort Medical plc estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. 
Where tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill have 
suffered an impairment, they are reviewed for possible reversal of the 
impairment at each reporting date.
Leasing commitments
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to 
income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all the 
benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as finance 
leases. Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the 
Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The 
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as 
a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between 
finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Inventories
Inventories and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. Cost comprises the direct cost of production 
and the attributable portion of overheads based on normal operating 
capacity appropriate to location and condition. Cost is determined on 
a first in, first out basis. Net realisable value represents the estimated 
selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made if 
necessary for any slow-moving, obsolete or defective inventory.

Cash and cash equivalents 
In the consolidated and Company statements of cash flows, cash 
and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call 
with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. In the 
consolidated and Company balance sheets, bank overdrafts are 
shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
Finance income and costs
Interest receivable and payable on bank deposits and borrowings is 
credited or charged to finance income and expenses as it falls due. 
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent 
assets
Provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation (legal or 
constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. The expense relating to any provision is presented 
in the income statement net of any reimbursement. If the effect of 
the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, 
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting 
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is 
recognised as other finance expenses.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of an obligation 
will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the 
obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. Contingent 
assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of 
economic benefits is probable.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently held at amortised cost. A provision for impairment of 
trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that 
the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms of the receivables. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
held at amortised cost.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at fair value, 
net of direct issue costs and subsequently stated at amortised cost. 
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals 
basis to the income statement and are added to the carrying amount 
of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period 
in which they arise. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as 
transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that 
some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is 
deferred until drawdown occurs. To the extent there is no evidence 
that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, 
the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and 
amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Dividends
Dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period in 
which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim 
dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved  
and paid.
Taxation
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year 
as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed. It is 
calculated using rates that have been enacted, or substantively 
enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Tax that relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income 
or in equity is recognised in other comprehensive income or equity 
respectively.
Deferred taxation is accounted for in full using the balance sheet 
liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from 
differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences except in respect of investments in subsidiaries where the 
Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised. Their carrying amount is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date on the same basis.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply 
in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled. It is recognised 
in the consolidated income statement except when it relates to items 
credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax 
is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on 
either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an 
intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Research and Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) has been 
available to UK companies on qualifying expenditure incurred since 
1 April 2013 and is of the nature of a government grant. Where 
UK companies expect to elect for RDEC the amount receivable 
is recorded as income and is included in profit before tax, netted 
against research and development expenses.

Share capital, share premium and share issue costs
Share issue costs are incremental costs directly attributable to the issue 
of new shares or options and are shown as a deduction, net of tax, 
from the proceeds. Any excess of the net proceeds over the nominal 
value of any shares issued is credited to the share premium account.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share 
capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from 
equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are 
cancelled or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently 
reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable 
incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is 
included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging 
activities
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value at each reporting date. 
Net investment hedges
Where the Group has entered into borrowings which form part of a 
net investment in a foreign operation, including a hedge of a monetary 
item that is accounted for as part of the net investment, these are 
accounted for in a way similar to cash flow hedges. Gains or losses 
on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the 
hedge are recognised in OCI while any gains or losses relating to the 
ineffective portion are recognised in the Income Statement through 
profit or loss. On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative 
value of any such gains or losses recorded in equity is transferred to 
profit or loss. 
The Group uses a loan as a hedge of its exposure to foreign 
exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries. Refer to note 
26 for more details.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are 
described in this note, the directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only 
that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving 
estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the directors 
have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies 
and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised 
in the financial statements.
A Impairment of goodwill 
The Group tests, at least annually, whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment in accordance with the accounting policy above. The 
goodwill recognised as part of the Aesica acquisition has also been 
subject to an impairment test in the current year. The recoverable 
amount is determined based on value in use calculations. The use 
of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the 
choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present 
value of these cash flows. Actual outcomes could vary. 
B Contingent consideration
The value of contingent consideration receivable on the disposal 
of King Systems depends upon the performance of that business 
following its disposal. Actual performance could vary from forecast.
In addition, as part of accounting for the acquisition of Aesica Holdco 
Limited, contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of 
£1.6m was recognised at the acquisition date and as at the reporting 
date. Future developments may require revisions to this estimate. The 
maximum consideration expected to be paid is £1.6m and this has 
been classified as an other financial liability (see note 26).
C Income taxes
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate 
tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. 
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based 
on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final 
tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were 
initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and 
deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is 
made. In the current year this included an evaluation of the provisions 
of the UK Government’s Patent Box regime and its potential 
applicability to the Bespak business (see note 10).
D Accounting for acquisition-related provisions
As part of the identification and measurement of assets and liabilities 
for the acquisition of Aesica on 12 November 2014, the Group has 
recognised a number of provisions. In determining the fair value of 
these provisions, assumptions and estimates were made in relation to 
the expected costs to fulfil customer obligations and other costs. The 
carrying amount of these provisions on acquisition was £4.4m (see 
note 28).

Estimates
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
discussed below.
A Post-employment benefits 
The determination of the pension cost and defined benefit obligation 
of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes depends on the 
selection of certain assumptions which include the discount rate, 
inflation rate, salary growth, mortality and expected return on scheme 
assets. Differences arising from actual experiences or future changes 
in assumptions will be reflected in subsequent periods (see note 21).
B Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the 
recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations 
prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates.
C Provisions and related assets
In determining the amount to recognise for any provision or related 
asset, management consults with suitably qualified and experienced 
Group personnel and considers the Group’s experience of similar 
matters and communications with potential counterparties and with 
the Group’s legal advisers. 
D Accounting for acquisition-related intangibles
The accounting for the identification and valuation of intangibles 
acquired from Aesica in the year was undertaken by management 
based on expert advice received from corporate finance specialists. 
Estimation was applied in identifying and valuing the £82.3m of 
acquired intangible assets, being the Aesica customer relationships 
in accordance with the principles in IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ 
and expectations of future economic benefits. There was also 
estimation applied in determining the most appropriate amortisation 
method for these intangible assets.
Special items and other non-GAAP performance 
measures
The directors believe that the ‘adjusted’ profit and earnings per share 
measures provide additional useful information for shareholders on 
the underlying performance of the business. These measures are 
consistent with how business performance is measured internally. The 
adjusted profit before tax measure is not a recognised profit measure 
under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with ‘adjusted’ profit 
measures used by other companies. 
Further detail on the special items in the period can be found in note 
6. The directors also refer to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) as a performance indicator. EBITDA 
also adds back any profit or loss on disposal of property, plant and 
equipment. 
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following new standards and amendments have been applied for 
the first time during the year commencing 1 May 2014 and have no 
impact on the financial statements:
IAS 27 Revised  ‘Separate Financial Statements’
IAS 28 Revised  ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’
IFRS 10  ‘Consolidated financial statements’
IFRS 11  ‘Joint arrangements’
IFRS 12  ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’ 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the 
following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in 
some cases have not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
Amendment to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
Amendment to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
Amendment to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in other Entities
IAS 27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements
IAS 28 (revised) Investments in Associates and Joint 
Ventures
Amendments to IFRS 7  
and IAS 32
Financial Instruments on Asset and 
Liability offsetting
IFRS 15 Revenue from customers with contracts
The Group is yet to assess the impact of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15.
Parent Company financial statements
The financial statements of the parent Company, Consort Medical plc, 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in 
the European Union in all cases. On publishing the parent Company 
financial statements together with the Group financial statements, 
the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the 
Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement 
or statement of comprehensive income and related notes that form a 
part of these approved financial statements.

2. Segmental information
The Group’s operating segments are determined with reference to the information which is supplied to the Executive Committee in order for it 
to allocate the Group’s resources and to monitor the performance of the Group. Following the acquisition of Aesica on 12 November 2014, that 
information analyses the Group between two divisions, Bespak and Aesica. Prior to this acquisition in the current year and for all of the prior 
year, the Group only had one operating segment. The Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on  
a measure of adjusted operating profit which excludes the impact of special items from the operating segments. Special items are analysed  
in note 6. 
Consequently, the segment information provided to the Executive Committee for both of these reportable segments for the year ended 30 April 
2015 is as follows:

•	 Integration costs are in relation to restructuring activity following the completion of the integration programme at Aesica. 
•	 Acquisition-related expenses in the current year are primarily the professional fees associated with the acquisition of Aesica other than those 
related to the equity raised and the new debt funding arrangement. 
•	 Other acquisition-related items includes the unwinding of the uplift in the book value of inventory held by Aesica on acquisition, as required by 
accounting standards.
•	 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets represents the charge for other intangible assets within Aesica (acquired in 2014) of £6.0m and 
£0.8m in relation to The Medical House (acquired in 2009).
•	 Accelerated amortisation of upfront facility fees of £0.3m was incurred in respect of the Group’s previous facility which was cancelled on 
acquisition of Aesica. 
•	 A special tax item of £1.3m arose in respect of the recognition in the current year of Patent Box benefits relating to the prior year.  
In the prior year:
•	 Acquisition-related expenses include the diligence costs incurred in investigating potential investment opportunities;
•	 The special tax item was in respect of a significant tax credit which arose as the Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued 
using the lower rate of UK Corporate Tax of 20% (reduced from 23%).
•	 Costs in relation to plant restructuring and recall credit related to the exit from an onerous property lease.

Profit before tax from continuing operations 5,512 16,140

Special tax item — rate change adjustment – (850)
(750) 2,494 
Factors affecting future tax charge
The standard rate of Corporation Tax in the UK reduced from 21% to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. Accordingly, the UK profits for this 
accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 20.9%. This rate change was enacted during the prior period and as such any deferred tax 
balances have been stated at a rate of 20%.
Unrecognised tax losses
The Group has capital losses which arose in the UK of £27,313,000 (2014: £27,313,000) that are available for offset against future chargeable 
gains in the UK group. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as it is not reasonably foreseeable that these 
will be utilised.
Deferred tax assets of £4,318,730 (2014: £1,727,298) in respect of tax losses carried forward have not been recognised due to insufficient 
certainty over their recoverability. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.

11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the employee share ownership trust, which are treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to assume conversion of all 
dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees 
where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year and contingently issuable 
shares under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.

Following the rights issue and issuance of new shares to Aesica management, the number of shares in issue has grown from 29.3m to 49.1m. 
The effect of the new shares and the bonus shares arising from the discount to the TERP (theoretical ex-rights price) results in an adjustment 
of the comparative EPS (earnings per share) and DPS (dividends per share) to enable meaningful comparison of the pre and post rights issue/
acquisition earnings and distributions.

The carrying value of goodwill is made up of balances arising on acquisition of The Medical House plc and Aesica.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to the Medical House and Aesica CGUs (cash-generating units) for impairment 
testing. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually. Value in use calculations are utilised to calculate the recoverable 
amounts. Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected, risk-adjusted, pre-tax cash flows of the cash-generating unit in 
which the goodwill is contained. 
In respect of The Medical House, the discount rate applied comprises the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for 
country-specific risks and is calculated at 9.5% (2014: 9.5%). This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount to pre-tax cash flows. The 
value in use calculation for The Medical House was based upon the FY2016 budget and following that, for the following four years, the 
Group’s strategic plan which was approved by the Board and takes into account both past performance and expectations for future market 
development. Cash flows beyond this period were extrapolated using an annual growth rate of 2%, which was selected as prudently below 
the Group’s estimate of the long-term average growth rate in the UK and does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the sectors in 
which this CGU operates. The key assumptions include product sales from existing customers in FY2016, product launches and revenues from 
as yet unidentified customers from 2017. The directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes to other key assumptions would result 
in an impairment of goodwill. The directors are confident that the amount of goodwill carried for The Medical House and the assumptions used 
in estimating its fair value are appropriate.
In respect of Aesica, the discount rate applied was calculated at 7.5% which comprises the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital. 
The value in use calculation for Aesica was based upon the FY2016 budget and following that, the Group’s acquisition plan for FY2017 and 
FY2018 which was approved by the Board and takes into account expectations for future market development as the Aesica business is fully 
integrated into the Group and which was updated for any currently known risks. Cash flows beyond FY2018 were extrapolated using an annual 
growth rate of 2%, which was selected as prudently below the Group’s estimate of the long-term average growth rate in the UK and does 
not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the sectors in which this CGU operates. The key assumptions include product sales from 
existing customers and contingencies to reflect risks in the cash flows. The directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes to other 
key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill. The directors are confident that the amount of goodwill carried for Aesica and the 
assumptions used in estimating its fair value are appropriate.
Critical judgements around goodwill impairment are disclosed in note 1.

The Group previously operated pension schemes in the UK only to provide pensions to retired employees. UK pension benefits are provided 
by a defined benefit scheme, whereby retirement benefits are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service, and by 
defined contribution schemes, whereby retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of 
each employee. The Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme, the Bespak plc Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme (‘Bespak’) was closed to 
new entrants with effect from 30 June 2002. As at 30 April 2015, the IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ deficit was £17.8m compared with £2.1m as 
at 30 April 2014. The movement was primarily due to the changes in financial assumptions (£20.1m) as the discount rate reduced by 1% when 
compared with the prior year and an adjustment of £3.4m reflecting a revised estimate of the costs of equalisation within the scheme. 
However, following the acquisition of Aesica Holdco Limited, the Group also now operates four additional defined benefit pension schemes, three 
of which are operated by Aesica GmbH in Germany and one which is operated by Aesica Pharmaceuticals SRL in Italy. The four schemes are the 
Retirement Benefit Obligations Scheme (the ‘RBO’), the Early Retirement Scheme (the ‘ATZ’), the Long Term Service Scheme (the ‘Jubilee’) and the 
Aesica Italy Scheme. The RBO and ATZ are closed to new members whereas the Jubilee continues to be open to all employees of Aesica GmbH. 
The Aesica Italy Scheme is open to all employees of Aesica SRL These had a net IAS 19 deficit of £3.3m.
In relation to Bespak, increases to pensions in payment and in deferment in respect of future service are capped at 2.5% p.a. The members’ 
share of the cost of the Scheme is 8% of pensionable salaries is generally paid via a ‘salary sacrifice’ arrangement. The Group meets the full 
cost of accrual, but members receive a reduction in their salary equal to their share of the cost of the Scheme. Members have the right to opt 
out of this arrangement if they wish to receive their full salary and contribute to the Scheme, in which case the Group’s contributions to the 
scheme are reduced.
Contributions to each of the Group’s defined benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of an independent, professionally 
qualified actuary. Pension costs of defined benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been assessed in accordance with independent 
actuarial advice, using the projected unit method. Liabilities are assessed annually in accordance with the advice of an independent actuary. 
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Group’s defined benefit scheme are undertaken, normally every three years.

Explanation of the relationship between Consort Medical plc and the trustees of the schemes
The assets of each scheme are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees. 
The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interests of the schemes’ beneficiaries. The Bespak scheme has a policy that one-
third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the Scheme whilst there is no such provision for the Aesica GmbH or Italy schemes.

* Applies to the RBO scheme only.
The IAS 19 accounting standard ‘Employee benefits’ requires that the discount rate used be determined by reference to market yields at the 
balance sheet date on high quality fixed income investments. The currency and term of these should be consistent with the currency and 
estimated term of the post-employment obligations. 
Bespak
The discount rate has been developed from a spot yield curve based on UK Government bonds, adjusted to reflect the credit spread between 
AA-rated corporate bonds and Government bonds.
The expected rate of inflation is an important building block for the salary growth and pension increase assumption. A rate of inflation is ‘implied’ 
by the difference between the yields on fixed-interest and index-linked Government bonds.
For the majority of members, pension accrued before 6 April 1997 does not receive any guaranteed increases and it is assumed that no 
discretionary increases will be awarded. Pension accrued between 6 April 1997 and 30 April 2009 receives increases in line with inflation 
subject to a maximum of 5% per annum (for which the Company has assumed future increases will be 3.2% per annum). Some members 
receive fixed increases of 3% per annum on pension accrued before 6 April 1997 and increases in line with inflation subject to a minimum of 
3% per annum and a maximum of 5% per annum on pension accrued between 6 April 1997 and 30 April 2009 (for which the Company has 
assumed future increases will be 3.6% per annum). For all members, pension accrued after 1 May 2009 receives increases in line with inflation 
subject to a maximum of 2.5% per annum (for which the Company has assumed future increases will be 2.2% per annum).
One of the key assumptions made in valuing the pension scheme’s liabilities are the mortality rates used to assess how long pensions will 
be paid for. The mortality rates used to calculate the Scheme’s liabilities were updated as part of the Scheme’s actuarial valuation in 2008 
to reflect the results of surveys that have highlighted that people are living longer. The mortality rates now used in calculating the Scheme’s 
liabilities are based on data collected between 1991 and 1994, but allow for the accelerated improvements in longevity witnessed since that 
time and also allow for these accelerated improvements to continue in the future with a minimum annual rate of improvement of 1% per annum. 
These mortality tables are referred to as 90% of the S1NA tables, with 2013CMI future improvements with a 1.25% p.a. long-term rate of 
improvement.

Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure the Bespak and Aesica scheme liabilities
The sensitivity of each scheme’s liabilities to changes in the principal assumptions used to measure these liabilities is illustrated below. The 
illustrations consider the single change shown with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged. In practice, changes in one assumption 
may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption (this is not always the case).
The Group liability is the difference between the schemes’ liabilities and the schemes’ assets. Certain changes in the assumptions will be as a 
result of changes in market yields. Where this is the case, the market value of schemes’ assets may change simultaneously, which may or may 
not offset the change in assumptions. For example, a fall in interest rates will increase each scheme’s liability, but may also trigger an offsetting 
increase in the market value of assets so that the net effect on the Group liability is reduced.

How the liabilities arising from the Bespak scheme are measured
The Group provides retirement benefits via the Bespak scheme to some of its former employees and approximately 30% of current UK 
employees. The level of retirement benefit is principally based on salary earned in the final three years of employment and period of service as a 
scheme member.
The projected liabilities of the scheme are apportioned between members’ past and future service using the projected unit actuarial cost 
method. The deficit in the consolidated balance sheet is the difference between the projected liability allocated to past service (the defined 
benefit obligation) and the market value of the assets of the scheme. The defined benefit obligation makes allowance for future earnings growth. 
If all active members were assumed to leave the Group and the allowance for future earnings growth was replaced by an allowance for statutory 
revaluation, the liabilities would reduce by approximately £5.2m.
An alternative measure of liability is the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurer. This amount represents the 
amount that would be required to settle the Scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the ongoing 
liabilities of the Scheme. The latest estimate of the amount required to settle the Scheme’s liabilities was calculated at 30 April 2011. This 
indicated that the amount required was £43.9m in excess of the assets held by the Scheme. 
Future funding obligations in relation to the Bespak scheme
The trustees have selected a funding target based on the scheme being closed to new members but with active members continuing to accrue 
benefits. The agreed funding objective is to reach, and then maintain, assets equal to 100% of the value of the projected past service liabilities, 
assessed on an ongoing basis, allowing for future salary increases for active members.
The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme was performed by an independent actuary for the trustees of the 
scheme and was carried out as at 30 April 2011. Following the valuation and changes to the scheme’s benefits for future service the trustees 
agreed that the Group could cease paying deficit reduction contributions of £238,000 per month.
The last triennial actuarial valuation of the Bespak pension scheme was at 30 April 2014. The company is currently in discussion with the 
scheme trustees to finalise this. Since the last triennial valuation in 2011, prevailing discount rates have worsened, and it is expected that this 
in particular may have a material effect on the updated valuation. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 24 years 
(2014: 24 years).
Nature and extent of the risks arising from financial instruments held by the Bespak scheme
The expected return on the Scheme’s assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the financial year for returns over the life 
of the related obligation. The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates can be derived exactly from their market value. 
Some of these bond investments are issued by the UK Government and the risk of default on these is very small. The trustees also hold bond 
investments issued by public companies. There is a more significant risk of default on these which is assessed by various rating agencies. The 
trustees also have a substantial holding of equity and hedge fund investments, with a target of 60% of the Scheme’s assets being invested 
in these funds. The investment return related to these is variable, and they are generally considered much ‘riskier’ investments. It is generally 
accepted that the yield on these investments will contain a premium (‘the equity risk premium’) to compensate investors for the additional risk of 
holding this type of investment. There is significant uncertainty about the likely size of this risk premium.
The majority of the equities held by the Scheme are in international blue chip entities. The aim is to hold a globally diversified portfolio of 
equities, with a target of 22% of equities being held in the UK, 27% in the rest of Europe, 20% in North American equities, 10% in each of 
Japanese and Pacific Basin equities and 11% in emerging markets.
As part of the investment strategy review, the trustees, in conjunction with the Group, have carried out an asset-liability review for the Scheme. 
These studies are used to assist the trustees and the Group in determining the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure 
of liabilities within the Scheme. The results of the study are used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment 
performance and the risk of a significant increase in the Scheme’s deficit by providing information used to determine the pension scheme’s 
investment strategy.

23. Net (debt)/cash continued
On 26 September 2014, the Group cancelled its $56m multicurrency revolving facility and the £40m multicurrency revolving facility and on 
29 September 2014 signed a new £160m multicurrency revolving facility. Under the terms of the refinancing, the Group also has a £65m 
‘accordion’ facility (£25m under the previous facility) by which further facilities may be made available by Barclays, Lloyds, RBS and Santander 
under the current terms to support significant investment or acquisition opportunities which may arise. The new revolving credit facilities expire 
in September 2019. The drawdowns on the facility as at 30 April 2015 are included within short-term borrowings as they were rolling amounts 
with a one month interest period. The undrawn facilities are unsecured. The bank loans and overdrafts are subject to cross-guarantees between 
Group undertakings. Interest on the multicurrency revolving credit facility is charged at LIBOR plus a margin of between 1.65% and 1.90%, 
depending upon the ratio of net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and on UK overdrafts at 1.75% 
above UK base rate.
As part of a corporate reorganisation, it was necessary to make a short-term borrowing of £37.6m on the Group’s banking facilities, which was 
repaid on 5 May 2015. This borrowing has no impact on the Group’s net debt at the 30 April 2015, as it was represented by cash within Group 
subsidiaries. This explains the inflated cash position at 30 April 2015.

Executive Share Option Scheme for total consideration of £62,989 (2014: £55,995). The Group purchases its own shares using an Employee 
Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) to satisfy entitlements under the Group’s Long-Term Incentive Plan. The cost of the shares held by the ESOT is 
deducted from retained earnings. The ESOT is financed by a repayable-on-demand loan from the Company of £9,021,000 (2014: £6,311,000). 
As at 30 April 2015 the ESOT held a total of 417,276 ordinary shares (2014: 425,843 shares) at a cost of £2,805,988 (2014: £3,475,230) and 
market value of £3,922,394 (2014: £3,755,935). 
The Group completed a 5 for 8 rights issue on 3 November 2014 in relation to the acquisition (see note 28). The rights issue raised gross funds 
of £98.9m with costs of £4.5m and shares priced at 540 pence which represented a 34% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price (TERP).

£17.8m (2014: loss £4.7m).
26. Financial instruments and related disclosures 
Financial risk management
Consort Medical plc reports in sterling and pays dividends out of sterling profits. Group Finance manages and monitors the Group’s external 
and internal funding requirements and financial risks in support of Group corporate objectives. Treasury activities are governed by policies and 
procedures approved by the Board and monitored by Group Finance.
Group Finance maintains treasury control systems and procedures to monitor interest rate, foreign exchange, credit and liquidity risks.
Consort Medical plc uses a variety of financial instruments, including derivatives, to finance and to manage market risks of its operations. 
Financial instruments include cash and liquid resources, borrowings, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
Liquid assets surplus to the immediate operating requirements of Group undertakings are invested and managed centrally by Group Finance. 
External borrowings are managed centrally by Group Finance and comprise a combination of long and short-term finance.
Consort Medical plc does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and the Group’ s Treasury policies 
specifically prohibit such activity. All transactions in financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Selling margins are sufficient to cover normal operating costs and the Group’s operating subsidiaries are cash-generative. None of the entities in 
the Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements. Operating cash flow is used to fund investment in new product development 
as well as to make the routine outflows of capital expenditure, tax, dividends and repayment of maturing debt.
The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as 
borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as total equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
As at 30 April 2015, the Group is in a net debt position following the new debt facility agreement on completion of the acquisition of Aesica 
Holdco Limited (see note 28).
The Group has historically monitored two widely used ratios to measure the ability to service debt, being net debt/EBITDA and EBITDA interest 
cover. These measures were ahead of target throughout FY2015.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
The table entitled ‘Fair value of financial assets and liabilities’ presents the carrying amount and the fair values of the Group’s financial assets 
and liabilities under IFRS. Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values. Where market values are not available, fair 
values are determined using the prevailing interest and exchange rates. 
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Currency exchange contracts — based on market prices and exchange rates at the balance sheet date;
Contingent consideration — the discounted value of anticipated future receipts. 
The fair value of other assets and liabilities approximates to the carrying amount reported in the balance sheet.

Fair value and cash flow hedging activities
All derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. Gains and losses are recognised 
in the consolidated income statement unless they are designated as hedging instruments and tested to be effective under IAS 39 ‘Financial 
instruments — Recognition and measurement’, in which case the element of gains and losses that fulfil the hedge effectiveness criteria are 
taken directly to equity.
Consort Medical plc’s hedging strategy is largely unchanged in respect of covering the transactional risk of foreign currency sales and 
purchases. In respect of the translational risk on the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, as a result of the Aesica acquisition during the year 
(see note 28), the Group has utilised a hedge of net investments in foreign operations. The Group uses a Euro loan, which had a carrying value 
of £29.5m at the year end, as a hedge of its exposure to foreign exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk management
The Group’s borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus potentially exposing the Group to interest rate risk, against which, in the past, the 
Group has sought to protect itself through interest rate swaps. Although the Group/Company are currently in a net debt position, no interest 
rate swaps are held as the Group was not subject to any significant movements in these rates during the period. This will continue to be kept 
under review over time.
Foreign exchange risk management
The Group’s principal currency exposure is movement between Sterling and the Euro and the movement between Sterling and the US dollar.
Transactional exposure
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge a proportion of forecast foreign currency transactional exposure generally extending up to 
12 months. At 30 April 2015, the Group held forward contracts to hedge the equivalent of £3.6m of forecast foreign currency transaction 
exposures (2014: £0.5m). The fair value of the forward exchange contracts was a liability of £117,000 at 30 April 2015 (2014: asset £7,000). 
The Group currently does not designate these forward contracts as cash flow hedges and so gains and losses are recognised in the income 
statement. 
The primary transactional exposures in the UK and European business are transactions denominated in the USD and the Euro. A 10% decline 
in Sterling against the USD and the Euro (which is considered reasonably possible) would increase operating profit and equity by £0.5m (2014: 
£0.2m). A 10% increase in the value of Sterling (which is considered reasonably possible) would have a similar but opposite effect.
Translational exposure
Following the acquisition of Aesica in the year, the Group also now has exposure in the retranslation of the German and Italian operations into 
GBP . The foreign currency translation sensitivity for the Euro for the full year FY2015 was such that a change in the rate of €0.01: £1 would have 
impacted revenue by £0.7m and EBIT by £0.1m.
Committed facilities
As explained in note 23, the Group has committed facilities available at floating rates which expire in September 2019 and an overdraft facility 
that expires within one year.
Market risk of financial assets
The Group invests centrally managed liquid assets in short-term investments with banks at floating interest rates. These investments are 
classified as cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk in respect of its major customers such that, if one or more of them is affected by financial 
difficulty, it could materially and adversely affect the Group’s financial results. However, the Group generally does not expect its customers to fail 
to meet their obligations.
The Group does not believe that it is exposed to major concentrations of credit risk on other classes of financial instruments. The Group 
is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not expect any 
counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
The Group applies Board-approved limits to the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty and employs strict minimum 
creditworthiness criteria as to the choice of counterparty. The Group takes out credit insurance cover against the majority of export sales.

Liquidity risk
The Group operates internationally, primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which the Group trades. Selling 
margins are sufficient to exceed normal operating costs and the Group’s main operating subsidiaries are cash-generative.
Operating cash flow is used to fund investment in the research and development of new products as well as routine outflows of capital 
expenditure, tax, dividends and repayment of maturing debt. The Group may, from time to time, have additional demands for finance, such as 
acquisitions. 
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities

Hedge of net investments in foreign operations — Included in loans at 30 April 2015 was a borrowing of £29.5m which has been designated 
as a hedge of the net investments in the two subsidiaries in Italy and Germany, Aesica GmbH. and Aesica SRL This borrowing is being used to 
hedge the Group’s exposure to the Euro foreign exchange risk on these investments. Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing are 
transferred to OCI to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries. There is no ineffectiveness in the year 
ended 30 April 2015.
The equity investment in Atlas Genetics is an unquoted investment and therefore held at cost, less any provision for impairment as its fair value 
cannot be measured reliably in the absence of an active market.

The following tables categorise the Group’s and Company’s financial assets and liabilities held at fair value by the valuation methodology applied 
in determining fair value. Where possible, quoted prices in active markets are used (Level 1). Where such prices are not available, the asset or 
liability is classified as Level 2, provided all significant inputs to the valuation model are based on observable market data. In other cases the 
instrument is classified as Level 3. The Company has no financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss.

Under the terms of the disposal of King Systems, completed on 15 February 2013, the purchaser, Ambu A/S, is due to pay amounts of 
consideration contingent upon the performance of King following disposal. This comprises:
•	 a milestone payment of US$10m upon completion of the first commercial sale of a video laryngoscope currently under development by King 
with a reusable display and an adaptor containing reusable optics and a disposable blade
•	 payments with a potential maximum value of US$40m related to the sales of King Vision products for the three years ending 30 April 2016. 
The fair value of contingent consideration is £2.5m (30 April 2014: £11.2m), with the reduction of £8.7m primarily due to:
•	 receipt of US$10m (£5.9m) following the first commercial sale of a video laryngoscope in June 2014
•	 receipt of US$2.3m (£1.4m) reflecting the first payment relating to the sales of the King Vision products for the year ended 30 April 2014  
in May 2014
•	 amendment to the sales assumptions reducing the receivable by £2.4m; offset by 
•	 the unwinding of the discount of £0.7m and 
•	 foreign exchange £0.3m. 
A reduction in the forecast sales by 10% would reduce the fair value of the receivable by £0.1m with the opposite assumption generating  
a matching increase. US$2.5m was received on 18 June 2015 in respect of the FY2015 King Vision sales.

27. Employee share scheme
Share options
The Group operates share award schemes whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares in Consort Medical plc at no cost, 
subject to the achievement by the Group of certain specified performance targets. It also offers savings-related share option schemes. Since 
the introduction of the 2005 LTIP scheme no further awards have been made under any Executive Share Option Scheme. In August 2011 and 
October 2011 awards were made under a new Company Share Option Scheme.
Grants of share options are normally exercisable at the end of the three-year vesting/performance period. Grants under savings-related share 
option schemes are normally exercisable after three years’ saving. Grants under share option schemes are normally exercisable between three 
and ten years from the date of grant. Options under the share option schemes are normally granted at the market price ruling at the date of 
grant. The majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are now granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
In June 2014, share options were granted under the new Company Share Option Scheme in tandem with grants under the LTIP . Further details 
are provided below.
Share options awarded to the directors are subject to performance criteria as laid out in the Remuneration Report.

The number of share options was increased in the period as a result of the rights issue in November 2014. Given that this adjustment preserves 
the rights of option holders no additional share-based payments charge has been recorded in the financial statements.

Option pricing
For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the share-based compensation charge, the Black–Scholes option pricing model has been used. 
The assumptions used in the model are as follows:
 SAYE 
 scheme 
 2014 
Risk-free interest rate 0.7%
Dividend yield 2.1%
Volatility 20.2%
Expected lives of options granted under:
Savings-related share option schemes 3 years
Weighted average share price for grants in the year:
Savings-related share option schemes — market and option price 871p 
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years. The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The 
risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

Awards granted in the year were made in the form of an award of performance shares, and a linked CSOS option. The cumulative economic 
effect of these awards for both participants and the Company is identical to that for performance shares, and as such the fair value of these 
awards has been calculated on this aggregate basis.

28. Acquisition of subsidiary
For the year ended 30 April 2015
On 12 November 2014, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Aesica Holdco Limited, obtaining control of Aesica 
Holdco Limited (‘Aesica’). Aesica is one of Europe’s leading pharmaceutical Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisations 
(‘CDMO’), providing contract development and manufacturing services for Finished Dose and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients to the global 
pharmaceutical industry. Aesica was acquired as it represents a very strong fit with the Group’s existing strategy of diversifying into adjacent 
markets and technologies to capture additional value in the drug/device supply chain. As one of Europe’s leading pharmaceutical CDMOs, 
Aesica is highly complementary to Bespak’s existing business and provides a number of clear strategic, competitive and value-enhancing 
benefits for the enlarged Group.

Less: Cash and cash equivalents acquired (6,221)
Cash outflow on acquisition of subsidiary 207,955
Intangible assets relating to customer relationships with a value of £82.3m have been separately identified on acquisition of Aesica on which 
£6.0m of amortisation has been charged in the period from 12 November to 30 April 2015. The goodwill of £101.1m arising from the acquisition 
has been allocated entirely to the Aesica operating segment and comprises the value of other intangible assets considered but not explicitly 
recognised such as brand, acquired workforce and buyer specific synergies. These intangibles were not separable and therefore did not meet 
the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset under IAS 38. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax 
purposes. 
The fair value of the 17,428,906 ordinary shares issued as part of the consideration paid for Aesica (£10.8m) was determined on the basis of 
the share price at the date of completion being 12 November 2014. 
Aesica entered into an option agreement with a third party to purchase a parcel of land presently owned by Aesica for consideration of £1.9m. 
In the event of the exercise of this option within 3 years from the acquisition date, the Group is required to pay the proceeds of such disposal as 
consideration, subject to a cap of £1.6m. This has been recognised as contingent consideration on acquisition.

28. Acquisition of subsidiary continued 
If the acquisition of Aesica had been completed on the first day of financial year, Group revenues for the period would have been £276.0m 
and operating profit would have been £28.1m. This operating profit figure has been significantly reduced by the inclusion of a number of 
non-standard accounting adjustments required as part of the acquisition including but not limited to one-off share based payment charges, 
transaction fees and provisions for liabilities and charges. The performance of Aesica’s European operations in that period would have been 
retranslated at monthly average rates under IAS 21 ‘The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’ at an average rate of €1.28 : £1. The fair 
value of the financial assets includes trade receivables with a fair value of £33.3m and a gross contractual value of £33.5m. The best estimate 
at acquisition date of the contractual cash flows not to be collected is £0.2m. Acquisition costs of £5.4m have been charged to operating 
expenses in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 April 2015 (see note 6). Costs of £4.5m associated with the equity raise 
have been accounted for as a deduction from equity.

Terms and conditions of transactions with related parties
The sales to and purchases from related parties are made at normal market prices. Outstanding balances that relate to trading balances are 
unsecured, interest-free and settlement occurs in cash. Long-term loans owed to and from the Company by subsidiary undertakings generally 
bear market rates of interest in accordance with the intercompany loan agreements. Consort Medical plc has provided guarantees to suppliers 
of Integrated Aluminium Components Limited amounting to £2.6m (2014: £2.8m), including a property lease that runs until 2020.
A provision of £3.1m exists against the amount due from Integrated Aluminium Components Limited to Consort Medical plc (2014: £3.1m). No 
other provisions have been made against amounts from related parties. This assessment is undertaken each financial year through examining 
the financial position of the related party and the market in which the related party operates.
Outstanding balances with the Company’s pension scheme are disclosed in note 21.

Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality
Areas of 
focus
Audit scope
•	 Overall Group materiality: £1,140,000 which represents approximately 5% of profit before taxation and special 
items from continuing operations.

The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we 
looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified as 
‘areas of focus’ in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion 
on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not 
a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Identification and valuation of assets and liabilities acquired 
on acquisition of Aesica Holdco Limited (‘Aesica’)
See note 1 to the financial statements for the directors’ 
disclosures of the related accounting policies, judgements and 
estimates and note 28 for further information. See also the Audit 
Committee report on page 51
On 12 November 2014, the Group completed the acquisition of 
Aesica for consideration of £226.6 million, as described in note 
28.
Accounting standards require that all assets and liabilities 
acquired in the business combination are recorded at fair values 
on acquisition. In the Aesica acquisition, the identification 
and valuation of acquired intangible assets, being customer 
relationships (£82.3 million), required significant judgement in 
estimating the lives of these relationships, forecast revenue and 
profit, and attrition rates.
Judgement was also applied by the directors in the valuation 
and extent of provisions of £4.4 million identified at acquisition.
We evaluated the process used by the directors to identify intangible 
assets acquired in the business combination, considering the rationale 
for the acquisition and the nature of the Aesica business.
We used our valuation expertise to test the methodology and 
assumptions used by the directors in valuing customer relationships. 
We evaluated the cash flows used by challenging the key assumptions, 
which included the length of the life of the relationships by comparing 
these to the patent expiries of key products, the forecast revenue and 
profit over this period and attrition rates. These assumptions were 
compared to historic industry-wide experience with previous acquisitions 
of similar businesses. 
We were satisfied that the fair value of customer relationships was 
supportable, and that the assumptions used in valuing the intangibles 
were within our acceptable range.
We traced provisions recorded to underlying calculations and challenged 
key assumptions made in determining the requirement for a provision. In 
particular we challenged whether a constructive obligation existed at the 
date of acquisition by obtaining third party evidence to support the need 
for a provision, such as correspondence with third parties. No material 
exceptions were identified in our testing.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Revenue recognition
See note 1 to the financial statements for the directors’ 
disclosures of the related accounting policies, judgements and 
estimates. See also the Audit Committee report on page 51
The Group’s revenue of £184.8 million is largely derived from 
sales of goods under long-term manufacturing agreements 
that span several years, the timing of which is determined from 
shipping terms, which can vary from customer to customer.
In certain cases, pricing arrangements include variable 
consideration, such as minimum order clauses, and significant 
up front or stage payments, which are contributions towards 
planned capital expenditure or advance payments for 
production. The directors apply judgement in determining the 
fair value of variable consideration and the timing of recognition 
of up front and stage payments, which are initially deferred and 
recognised as revenue over the length of the manufacturing 
agreement or in line with the product deliveries to the customer.
We focussed on revenue recognition because revenue 
represents a significant balance in the context of the Group’s 
financial statements.
We read a sample of contracts selected on a high value basis 
and assessed whether the revenue recognition methodology was 
in accordance with accounting standards and had been applied 
consistently. Where consideration included a variable element, we 
evaluated and challenged the judgements made by the directors in 
estimating the fair value of such consideration by testing the sensitivity 
of revenue recorded to reasonable changes in those judgements. Where 
we identified contracts with significant up front or stage payments, 
we understood the nature of the payments received by reading and 
understanding the terms of the contract and challenged the judgements 
made in determining the timing of deferred revenue released to the 
income statement through reading the related contracts, developing our 
own expectation of the revenue to be recognised and comparing this to 
the amount recognised in the income statement.
We inspected original signed contracts, agreed contract prices in the 
Group’s IT systems to the underlying contract and recalculated and 
agreed the revenue recognised in each agreement to the underlying 
accounting records. We tested internal controls over the timing and 
presentation of revenue recognised in the financial statements and also 
tested manual journal entries posted to revenue accounts to identify and 
test unusual or irregular items.
We did not identify any instances of improper revenue recognition in our 
testing.
Contingent consideration on disposal of King Systems
See note 1 to the financial statements for the directors’ 
disclosures of the related accounting policies, judgements and 
estimates and note 26 for further information. See also the Audit 
Committee report on page 51
The Group disposed of its King System division in February 
2013. The disposal consideration included an element that was 
contingent on future sales of King Vision products for the three 
years ending 30 April 2016. At 30 April 2015, the directors 
estimated the fair value of contingent consideration receivable 
to be £2.5 million ($3.9 million), representing the estimated 
amount receivable in respect of the year ended 30 April 2015 
and an estimate of the performance of King Systems in the year 
to 30 April 2016. This fair value was calculated after discounting 
expected future cash inflows.
The determination of the fair value of contingent consideration 
is based on uncertain future milestones and events and is 
inherently judgemental.
We evaluated the fair value determined by management, including 
the process by which it was calculated, and tested the underlying 
calculations. We challenged management’s assumptions of sales of the 
King Vision product in the year ending 30 April 2016 and the anticipated 
timing of collection by assessing the performance of King Systems since 
disposal and any other publicly available qualitative information, such as 
press releases and financial results released by the acquirer. No material 
exceptions were noted in our testing.
We also performed a sensitivity analysis around the key assumption 
over the timing and amount of contingent consideration expected to be 
received. Having ascertained the extent of change in this assumption 
that would be required to materially affect the determined fair value, we 
considered the likelihood of such a movement in this key assumption 
arising. We found that reasonable changes to the expected sales 
assumptions did not materially impact the fair value of the contingent 
consideration.

Goodwill impairment
See note 1 to the financial statements for the directors’ 
disclosures of the related accounting policies, judgements and 
estimates and note 14 for further information. See also the Audit 
Committee report on page 51
The Group has a total goodwill balance of £112.2 million, of 
which £15.8 million relates to the acquisition of The Medical 
House plc in 2008, which is part of Injectables CGU and £96.4 
million relates to the Aesica acquisition in November 2014.
Under IFRS, management is required to perform an annual 
goodwill impairment assessment. The directors performed 
their annual impairment review of the Injectables CGU in the 
second half of the year, which indicated that there is substantial 
headroom to support the goodwill balance.
Under IFRS, goodwill acquired in a business combination is 
required to be tested for impairment before the end of the 
period of acquisition. An impairment review of the Aesica 
goodwill balance was therefore also completed. Though 
some variations from the plan were identified, the directors 
did not consider these to be so significant as to give rise to an 
impairment of goodwill.
We focused on this area because the determination of whether 
or not an impairment charge was necessary involved significant 
management judgement about the future results of the 
Injectables and Aesica cash-generating units, including future 
cash flow projections using sales, gross margin and cost based 
assumptions. The cash flow projections were extrapolated using 
long-term growth rates and were discounted using a post-tax 
discount rate.
We obtained and understood management’s impairment models and 
tested them for mathematical accuracy, and found that they followed an 
acceptable methodology and, in the case of the Injectables model, was 
consistent with prior years.
We evaluated and challenged the future cash flow forecasts of the 
Injectables CGU and the process by which they were drawn up. 
In particular we focussed on assumptions made in respect of the 
Injectables pipeline and timing of future product launches by comparing 
to external qualitative information to support key assumptions around 
timing of launch. We found that, although there is uncertainty over 
the timing of future product launches, the assumptions made were 
supported by qualitative evidence. We compared the future cash flow 
forecasts for the Injectables CGU to the Group’s latest strategic plans 
and found them to be consistent.
We challenged financial assumptions used including discount rate, 
by comparing this to the Group’s cost of capital, and terminal growth 
rate by comparing this to economy and industry forecasts. These 
assumptions are disclosed in note 14. We also applied sensitivities to 
financial assumptions to evaluate the impact of a reasonable change 
in those assumptions. We found that the assumptions made by the 
directors were within an acceptable range.
We compared the post-acquisition performance of Aesica and latest 
forecasts to the acquisition plan to identify if there were any significant 
departures or potential indicators of impairment. Some variations from 
the plan were identified but were offset with compensating differences, 
and latest forecasts supported the conclusion that there is no 
impairment of goodwill.
Accounting for and presentation of special items
See note 1 to the financial statements for the directors’ 
disclosures of the related accounting policies, judgements and 
estimates and note 6 for more information. See also the Audit 
Committee report on page 51
The Group has reported special items, which the directors 
believe do not reflect the underlying performance of the Group, 
separately on the Consolidated Income Statement as the 
directors believe that these provide additional useful information 
to the shareholders on the underlying performance of the 
business. Special items before taxation in FY15 comprised £6.8 
million of amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets, 
£5.4 million of acquisition-related expenses, £2.8 million unwind 
of the fair value uplift on Aesica stock recognised on acquisition 
of Aesica, £1.9 million of costs associated with the integration 
of Aesica and £0.3 million of accelerated amortisation of upfront 
arrangement fees relating to the Group’s facilities prior to the 
acquisition of Aesica.
There is judgement in determining what constitutes a special 
item that is not reflective of the underlying performance of the 
Group.
We tested the items which have been classified as special items and 
traced these to supporting third party evidence, such as invoices and 
contracts with third parties. 
We did not identify any material exceptions in our testing of these items.
We tested the consistency of items classified as special items with 
the Group’s accounting policy for such, as disclosed in note 1, and 
whether the disclosure of such items was sufficient to enable a reader 
to understand the nature of these amounts. We also tested the 
completeness of special items, considering other items of expenditure 
or income that could have met the definition of a special item per the 
Group’s accounting policy.
We did not identify any material inconsistencies between the items 
identified as special by the directors and the Group’s accounting 
policies. We did not identify any material exceptions in the presentation 
and description of these items in note 6.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group 
operates.
The Group has two operating divisions, being the Bespak and Aesica divisions, which are supported by a centralised head office function. The 
Bespak division consists of three reporting units (being Bespak Europe Limited, The Medical House and Integrated Aluminium Components 
Limited) and the Aesica division consists of 5 reporting units (being Aesica Limited, Aesica Queenborough Limited, Aesica GmbH (Germany), 
Aesica Srl (Italy) and Aesica Formulation Development Limited) and an intermediate head office/financing function.
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of the two operating divisions and the centralised head office function, which in total 
comprise 22 statutory entities.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at these reporting units 
by us, as the Group engagement team. We audited the complete financial information of all three Bespak reporting units and the two Aesica 
trading companies that contributed most significantly to the performance of the Group (being Aesica Queenborough Limited and Aesica 
GmbH). We also performed audit procedures over significant account balances and transaction classes at the Group head office function 
and Aesica Limited, as well as assessing the risk of material misstatement in the remaining balances through the application of analytical 
procedures.
Taken together, the Group companies over which we performed our audit work accounted for over 80% of the Group’s revenues and profit 
before taxation and special items, and over 80% of the Group’s net assets.
All audit work in respect of the Group financial statements, including that on the Group consolidation, disclosures in the financial statements 
and all the areas of focus, was performed by the Group engagement team with the exception of Aesica subsidiaries, where assistance was 
received from other PwC network offices and firms in respect of the discrete financial information for these entities. The Group engagement 
team attended local audit planning and clearance meetings with component audit and management teams in planning, scoping and executing 
the audit of the Group financial statements.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to 
evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £1,140,000 (2014: £800,000).
How we determined it Approximately 5% of profit before taxation and special items from 
continuing operations.
Rationale for benchmark applied This is, in our view, the most relevant measure of the performance of the 
Group, and provides us with a basis for determining materiality which 
eliminates the disproportionate impact of special items on the Group’s 
underlying performance
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £57,000 (2014: £40,000) as 
well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 53, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to 
report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the going 
concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Parent Company have adequate resources to remain in 
operation, and that the directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our 
audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 43, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of:
•	 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed;
•	 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
•	 the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.

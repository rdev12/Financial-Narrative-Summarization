infrastructures and to continually exceed customer 
expectations through ever wider product ranges and 
superior service. The brands you see here are all 
recognised and trusted in their home markets.

07 Chairman’s statement
Staying ahead
An international group
committed to improving
performance
Chairman’s statement
Whilst we continued our record of substantial organic
growth, especially in the US, we also recorded our
highest-ever spend on acquisitions in 2005/6. Added
to this, shortly before the financial year closed, 
we agreed to buy, subject to competition approval, 
DT Group, the Nordic region’s leading distributor of
building materials. The Board is delighted with this
acquisition, particularly as it demonstrates our clear
commitment to the European business while also
delivering an excellent balance between our operations
in North America and Europe.
There has been a marked shift in the characteristics 
of the Group in recent years. Wolseley is now a
genuinely international company, with leadership 
from the corporate centre complemented by talented
management throughout the European and North
American organisations, ably supported by high quality
teams in the operating companies.
Organisational culture has evolved to reflect the
Group’s increasingly international position. Today, 
our managers across the world identify with the
Wolseley name. They remain committed to improving
the performance of their own operating companies, 
but they also recognise the opportunities available
internationally.
We now, therefore, have a Group where the sum of
the parts is truly greater than the individual components.
We have established significant leadership capabilities
both centrally and regionally in areas such as IT,
Procurement, Human Resources, Mergers &
Acquisitions and Strategy, supporting not only our
ongoing businesses, but also increasing our capability
to add value to acquisitions going forward.
Further, two successful debt issues confirmed
Wolseley’ s status as a soundly financed, well-
respected international group. In November 2005, 
the Group completed the largest ever US$ Private
Placement, followed by a bank syndication in May
2006 which was heavily over-subscribed by Wolseley’s
relationship banks.
Dividend
With our earnings per share before intangibles rising
19.7% to 98.9 pence, the Board is recommending a
final dividend of 19.55 pence, which represents a total
dividend for the year of 29.4 pence. This is an increase
of 11.4% over the total dividend paid last year.
The Board
The handover of Group Chief Executive responsibilities
from Charlie Banks to Chip Hornsby proceeded to
plan, with Chip being succeeded by Frank Roach 
as Chief Executive, North America. Frank joined the
Board in December 2005 and has already made a
significant contribution to our deliberations.
I would like to thank Charlie Banks not only for 
the efficient handover but also for the leadership,
experience and good humour he displayed throughout
his five years as Group Chief Executive. Charlie made
a major contribution to the Group and during his 
time at the helm we witnessed a marked change 
in management mindset to a more international
perspective. We saw Group sales rise by 96.8% 
and the share price by 144%. I, and the whole Board,
wish him every happiness in retirement.
Chip Hornsby has made an excellent start as Group
Chief Executive and I look forward to working closely
with him in the coming years. He spent the first three
months of this calendar year building on his already
solid knowledge of our European businesses and the
following three months acquainting himself with matters
at the Corporate level.
As Chip makes clear elsewhere in this Report,
Wolseley has delivered excellent performances 
over many years – but now it is time to encourage 
a step-change and to push forward to fully realise
Wolseley’s true potential.
In conclusion, I wish to thank our customers, 
suppliers, investors and debt providers for their
unswerving support over the last year. But of course
the year’s achievements would not have been possible
without the skills and unyielding commitment of 
more than 70,000 people and to each of them I
extend our wholehearted thanks.
The Board looks ahead with confidence. The proven
strategy we have followed in recent times will continue,
sustaining our record of growth and business
development. We have achieved a great deal, but
there remains much to do. The Board is confident that
Chip and his team will lead Wolseley to new and even
greater heights.

08 Group Chief Executive’s review
I was delighted and honoured to take over as
Wolseley’s Group Chief Executive on 1 August 2006.
We enjoyed a great run under Charlie Banks’
leadership and I want to put on record my admiration
for his tremendous achievements. 
Charlie established some fine foundations which are
reflected in the figures you see in this Report, with
2005/6 characterised by excellent growth in North
America, strong market outperformance in the UK,
good performances in Holland, Switzerland and Italy
and broadly satisfactory results elsewhere in the Group. 
In North America, Stock Building Supply achieved
excellent results, outperforming the market and growing
sales by 27.4%. Towards the end of the year a
reduction in housing starts and a fall in the price 
of timber affected revenue and this is likely to be
continued into the current financial year. Ferguson 
saw outstanding growth, with a 35.1% increase in 
top line performance and 40.4% bottom line growth
driven by some of the highest fill rates in the industry,
our ongoing distribution centre strategy, our market
focus and a clutch of successful acquisitions. Wolseley
Canada recorded a solid performance and again
delivered double-digit growth.
Despite major changes to our UK business, which
included the completion of a comprehensive
restructuring, the business performed well in a
challenging market, with good acquisition performance
driving sales up by 14.4%. In continental Europe, the
highlights included good progress in Switzerland and
Italy, the Benelux countries and also a rewarding
performance from our French business, PBM. The
results from Wolseley Austria and Brossette were less
satisfactory, although we remain confident that both
these businesses will deliver improved performance in
the coming 12 months.
This time next year, I expect to be reporting results 
from three new Wolseley countries, after the completion
of our acquisition of DT Group, which was agreed just
before the year end. At just over £1.3 billion this is the
largest single acquisition in Wolseley’s history so far.
DT Group is the Nordic region’s leading distributor of
building materials, with a strong presence in Sweden,
Norway, Finland and Denmark and significantly
broadens our European reach.
Just as the DT Group acquisition will take us into 
new geographic areas, others have taken us into 
new product areas. For example, during the year
Wolseley UK bought William Wilson and AC Electrical
to move into the electrical distribution sector for the
first time and moved further into the insulation
materials market through the acquisition of Encon. 
In the USA, Stock Building Supply also entered into
the electrical products and services market and
strengthened its position in installed services, meeting
a clearly emerging need from our major home
construction customers.
We invested £914 million on a total of 53 acquisitions 
in seven countries during the year, as follows:
North America Europe
Number of acquisitions 31 22
Total consideration for 
acquisitions £497m £417m
An impressive year
This has been another
outstanding1 2 months 
for the Group, with record
results for the1 0th year 
in succession. W e are
positioning ourselves  
to make further progress
Group Chief Executive’s review
WO40006_R&A 2006_01-19  10/10/06  10:09 pm  Page 08 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
09 Group Chief Executive’s review
Our European market: At the end of the 
financial year we had operations in1 3 European
countries, having moved into Belgium for the 
first time. As the new year opened, we were 
finalising our acquisition of DT Group which 
gives us a major presence in Sweden, Norway, 
Finland and Denmark.
Historically, acquisitions have delivered around half 
of our annual growth and this is an area where our
management team are strong. In industry at large,
there is always concern that acquisitions fail 
to deliver the anticipated benefits; at Wolseley a
rigorous assessment process and skilful integration
into the Group ensures that acquisitions perform in 
line with expectations and deliver shareholder value.
A simple business model, executed with
commitment and focus
A distribution business like ours is not an overly
complex model. 
What makes us different is the way in which we focus
on our markets and execute our business model.
That’s the competitive advantage behind our growth 
– and we’re not about to radically change such a
proven strategy.
So the future is about evolution not revolution. The
emphasis remains on growth, through acquisitions 
and through organic growth driven by our capabilities
in four key areas which are at the heart of our success:
People
We invest in – and support – the most important
resources that we have: our people. Our customer
experience is based on interaction with our 70,000
plus people and customer service is at the heart 
of every recruitment we make and every training
programme we launch. Our commitment is to recruit
and train the best people available throughout our
industry that have a particular eye on providing
outstanding customer service. This includes the way
we assist customers in all aspects of their business, 
by providing the right products at the right time, as
well as being knowledgeable in all aspects of their
particular needs.
Product
We continue to offer more products and services to
more customers in more sectors in more countries.
We buy the right products at the right specification
and the right price. Our objective is to have the widest
product offering of anyone in the industry, so we 
can fulfil all of our customers’ particular needs. This
includes carrying some of the most recognised brands
in each of our business sectors to allow us to support
our customers in each specific area.
Distribution
We buy our products well and provide those products
and services reliably, efficiently and quickly to our
customers. Our logistics infrastructure allows us to
ensure that our size translates directly into better,
faster service. Our objective is to have the highest
order fill rates of anyone in the industry, as this will be
of great benefit to our customers so that they consider
us to be not only reliable, but also, more importantly, 
a true partner in their business.
Service
We shape our business to meet our customers’ 
needs in whatever way is most advantageous for
them. We go out of our way to make it easy for
customers to choose Wolseley – whether that’s
through deliveries, collection services, online shops,
shared branches or any other initiative. Since the
largest majority of our business is transacted at the
local level, through more than 4,650 locations across
Europe and North America, our objective is to lead 
the industry when it comes to access and availability 
of product.
You can read practical examples of our model in
action on pages 12 to 19.
A track record of success and a 
focused future
We have demonstrated year after year that by 
doing it our way, we can consistently deliver excellent
performance. In this, our tenth successive year of
delivering record results, we have again demonstrated
that, despite facing some challenging market
conditions, we can continue to grow and in most
cases have been able to outperform both the market
and the competition. 
So our emphasis remains on profitable growth driven
by an ever stronger focus on the core competencies
that underpin the execution of our business and 
some key factors that we believe give us true
competitive advantage.
Our structure is designed to keep the right activities 
at the right level in the Group – the continental groups
are directly responsible for the profits of the operating
companies they oversee. This is their key priority and
area of focus. In addition, they are responsible for
organic growth; being same branch sales, new branch
openings, expansion into new geographies, as well as
expansion into new customer types throughout their
areas of responsibility.
At the Group and continental levels we also focus on
the strategy and our five core competencies, which
feed into the operating companies and underpin their
ability to grow.
Human resources and leadership development
Customer service is why we exist as an organisation.
Identifying and training the top talent within our
industry therefore not only impacts customer service,
but also our ability to support double-digit growth.
Whilst we recognise that people are a large component
of our costs, we strive to identify and train people as
one of our most valuable investments.

10 Group Chief Executive’s review
Our North American market: We have an 
extensive branch presence across the continent,
served by our impressive Distribution Centre 
network. During the year we continued to grow 
our leading positions in both the building materials 
and the plumbing and heating markets in the US
and Canada.
Charlie Banks retires
Charlie Banks retired at 
the end of the financial 
year, following 39 years with
Ferguson and Wolseley, the
last five as Group Chief
Executive. Here is his parting
message.
“It has been an honour and a
privilege to have been associated
with Wolseley for so many years.
In my time as Group CEO, we
saw sales almost double in size
and both the share price and 
EPS rise dramatically. It has 
been an amazing journey.
None of our achievements would
have been possible without the
continued support of our
shareholders and debt providers.
I am also grateful to the Board for
giving me the opportunity to lead
this great company and to our
employees, without whose
unswerving commitment we
would not have been able to
execute our strategy and deliver
such exceptional growth.
I know that we have laid the
foundations for continued
success in the coming years and
I have total confidence in Chip
Hornsby and his team to lead
Wolseley to new and even 
greater heights.” 
Organic growth and acquisitive growth 
We have just appointed Adrian Barden, previously
Managing Director of our UK business, to a newly
created position to lead our global M&A efforts. 
This will bring even more focus to our acquisition
processes, in a more competitive market, including
developing a target base of acquisition opportunities
on both continents, establishing a formalised
integration process of acquisitions into the Group and
refining our post acquisition performance review process.
Sourcing
We are elevating sourcing to a higher level to deliver
the right products to our customers. This will include
responsibility at the Group level for the top 30–50
suppliers, which will be coordinated with both the
continental groups.
We want to identify and drive low cost country/own
brand/proprietary brands throughout the entire Group
so that this will be a significantly larger portion of our
business within the next two to three years. Indirect
spend initiatives will also deliver cost savings across
our business.
Supply chain 
We are developing a format such that supply chain
becomes a distinct competitive advantage across the
Group. Simply put, our intent is to have the broadest
product offering with the highest fill rates of anyone in
the industry. We believe that the right combination of
sourcing and supply chain will become a significant
competitive advantage.
Business improvement
Our aim over the next several years is to continually
improve our net margin by focusing on a number 
of growth and cost reduction initiatives. In looking 
at the longer term, increased focus on efficiency and
productivity throughout the entire Group will bring great
benefit in improving our overall net margin. The utilisation
of information for the benefit of customer service and
productivity will be at the forefront of this initiative, but
it is certainly not limited to that aspect alone.
The future
So what are my objectives for our organisation in the
immediate future? We are still focused on delivering
double-digit sales growth – but now with a greater
emphasis on margin improvement and the new
leadership structure is designed to allow us to build 
on our experience and our scale. 
Our customer base runs into millions – every one of
them with individual needs, being serviced by our front
line staff. Above all, this is a relationship business and
the only way to make it work is by serving local
customers, locally. We will continue to go out of our
way to try and help our customers succeed – we
make their problems our problems and we work with
them to find solutions. Loyal customers provide repeat
business and increasingly more business, as the
amount of product they buy from us increases.
We are also making it easier to do business with us 
at all levels. In the USA and the UK we have structured
our branches into focused “business groups” (USA) 
or “core brands” (UK) to put a real emphasis on a
particular sector, customer or product range. 
Results from the businesses structured this way 
show significant organic growth, so it’s a model we 
are extending across the Group. This single point
focus on specific customer groups, be they plumbers,
electricians, roofers, or general contractors, means our
customers know what they can expect. Our team of
people are real subject and product experts, the
products are relevant to the requirement and the
customer remains loyal.
Looking ahead
We have huge potential for further growth. As you will
see in our Performance review on pages 20 to 41 the
size of our potential market is vast and despite our
success we still have only a relatively small share.
Look across the 19 countries where we currently
operate and you’ll find that we are in just about every
sector of construction materials somewhere – but we
don’t as yet provide a complete offering anywhere.
Even without moving beyond Europe and North
America, there are significant opportunities for our
businesses to share knowledge and learn from each
other’s experiences in order to extend our product
range and introduce ourselves to new customers.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the Board and you,
our shareholders, for giving me the opportunity to lead
this great company. I believe we have a tremendous
future ahead of us and with the continued loyal
commitment of our outstanding 70,000 plus strong
team, without whom we would be nothing, we can
look to the future with confidence. We are committed
to making Wolseley “the name the world builds on”.

13 Group Chief Executive’s review
In North America, Ferguson is widely respected for
market-leading graduate programmes that once again
brought people into the organisation in 2005/6 and
has recently seen them recognised by Business Week
magazine as one of the top 50 places in the USA to
start and build a career. People don’t just join Wolseley
companies – they stay at Wolseley companies for long-
term careers. Our new Group Chief Executive, the
head of our North American organisation and the
President and CEO of Ferguson, along with countless
other members of our leadership team, each have
over 20 years’ service with the Group.
The European Graduate Programme (“EGP”) delivers 
a pipeline of internationally-minded graduates who 
can move effortlessly between cultures as well as
languages. The programme, which provides a mix 
of on-the-job training with formal residential courses, 
has proved popular with trainees and managers alike.
Across the Group, the EGP is complemented by 
a wide range of innovative activities, ranging from
established programmes at Stock Building Supply to
the new Groupwide International Leadership
Development Programme, among others.
During the last year we invested £21 million on
142,000 days of training and development.
This investment in our people allows us to deliver the
services our customers need. For example, British 
Gas service engineers are able to get on with their
jobs, thanks to an innovative agreement with Wolseley
UK. A single national account means that engineers
can collect products and spare parts from any of our
branches throughout the UK, with just a signature,
meaning better and more immediate service for British
Gas customers.

We work hard to ensure that
our recruitment programmes
are geared to identify
customer-focused people
with the passion to deliver.

15 Group Chief Executive’s review
In the UK, we moved into the electrical distribution
sector for the first time, through the purchases 
of William Wilson and AC Electrical. In the USA, 
we followed suit with the acquisition of Efficient, 
an electrical supplier based in Las Vegas. In both
instances, we’re giving customers more opportunities
to become – and remain – Wolseley customers.
In the Spring, Brossette and PBM opened a joint
facility “Batipole” in Lannion, France, allowing
customers to purchase from one location building
materials from PBM’s Reseau Pro brand, electrical

businesses will continue to innovate to find ways to
meet their customers’ needs.
High volume, production builders in the western States
of the USA are increasingly demanding a turnkey
installation service from suppliers – they need the
people who provide the frames to also install
equipment throughout the build project.
Stock Building Supply evolved its business model 
to meet this new demand, shaping its service to win
business from a new set of customers by providing
the products and services they need, how and where
they need them.

Distribution – we’ll continue to roll out our
proven Distribution Centre (“DC”) strategy,
using our expertise and financial strength to
set the industry standard in logistics. But we’ll 
also develop initiatives at the sharp end of 
the supply chain, creating new ways to get
products to customers, with increased speed
and reliability.

Our DCs have helped to transform the Ferguson
business in the US. DCs don’t only save costs – they
also have impact on customer satisfaction. Fill rates
out of the US DC facilities regularly exceed 94% and
are amongst the highest in our industry.
Now we’re rolling out the DC model across Europe.
The new National Distribution Centre opened in the UK
in August 2006 and the Italian DC will follow towards
the end of the year. Plans are already advanced to
open similar facilities in other countries.
Through the “branch within a branch” initiative, we
establish a counter from one brand in the premises of
another, thereby increasing the branch’s total product
offering without increasing the size of the branch itself. 
At the Wasco branch in Diest, Belgium, we have gone
one step further – implanting not one but two new
product areas within the branch. So in addition to 
their regular plumbing and heating supplies, Wasco
customers can now access spare parts from a Parts
Center area and specialist fixings from a Unifix area, 
all under a single roof. These additional product areas
are also introducing a new customer base to the
Wasco brand.
> Less hassle and cost
We constantly search for
innovative ways, such as 
our “branch within a branch”
concept, to take more
products to more customers.

Few people would place plumbers close to the top 
of a list of those who use the web in their daily lives.
Yet a recent e-business initiative at Tobler in Switzerland
is proving the very opposite. The Tobler website
experiences an average of over 1,600 hits each day
and more than 15,000 unique visitors per month.
All 50,000 plus Tobler products are available online. 
If customers place an order by 6pm, products are
delivered first thing the following morning, either to 
the plumber’s business or to the job site.
In the UK and the USA, we’ve structured our branches
to put a real emphasis on a particular sector, customer
or product range. This single point focus on a specific
customer group – such as plumbers, electricians,
roofers and so on – delivers a truly personal,
knowledgeable service. Customers know what 
to expect and they know that our people will give
them the personal service they need to get on with
their jobs.
Our customers’ experiences are based on their
interaction with our people. We invest in a wide range
of programmes that help ensure that when customers
meet any of our people, they do so with somebody
who speaks their language – literally as well as
professionally – knows their business, understands
their pressures and can meet their needs. 
> Personal service
We get close to our
customers, listening to what
they need and then creating
innovative, often highly

Company overview and 
performance monitoring
Company overview
Wolseley’s business is the distribution of construction
materials and the provision of related services primarily
to a specialist market of professional contractors.
The Group is the world’s number one distributor 
of heating and plumbing products to professional
contractors and a leading supplier of building 
materials to the professional market. The Group 
is an international business, operating 4,658
branches in 19 countries and employing over 
70,000 people.
Wolseley plc is a holding company and its
subsidiaries are organised into two geographic
divisions – Europe and North America. Divisional
management are primarily responsible for the 
profits of the operating companies they oversee 
and for driving organic growth, which includes
additional sales from existing branches, new branch
openings, expansion into new geographies as well
as expansion into new customer types and 
product areas.
The divisional teams are supported by global
functional teams such as acquisitions, sourcing,
supply chain and business improvement. This
structure allows the Group to focus on the key
competencies by which the business is driven
forward. These key competencies and the business
model are described in the Group Chief Executive’s
review on pages 8 to 19.
The principal activities of the Group are:
• the distribution of plumbing, heating and 
air conditioning equipment within Europe and
North America;
• the distribution of building materials in the UK,
Ireland, France and USA;
• the distribution of electrical components and
supplies in the UK, France and USA;
• the distribution of pipes, valves, fitting and
waterworks in Europe and North America.

The opportunities
for organic

markets are

Wolseley’s products
The Group supplies materials used in the
construction industry. The range of products used in
construction is broad and the Group continually seeks
opportunities to widen that choice to its customers.
The main product categories supplied to customers
are set out at the bottom of the page.
Wolseley’s customers
The Group has a wide range of customers operating 
in different industry sectors that range from the
individual plumber or builder through to national
contractor chains or house builders and include large
industrial and commercial organisations. Wolseley’s
primary customer focus is on professional contractors.
These contractors work with households,
governments, property developers and industrial
companies in the construction of new homes, 
offices and industrial buildings or in the repair 
and maintenance of existing premises. Increasingly
the Group has structured around core business
groups or brands allowing its local companies to put
real focus on these sectors, whilst enhancing customer
service and developing further product expertise.
Competitive environment
The Group aims to be a leading distributor in each 
of the markets in which it operates. The markets
where the Group operates are typically fragmented
with a few large players and a significant portion of
the market is supplied by small local operations. In
certain markets the Group competes with the large
DIY chains which have increased their offerings to
professional contractors.
The opportunities for organic and acquisitive 
growth in these fragmented markets are substantial.
The environment for acquisitions has become
marginally more competitive over the last year 
in certain markets and the competition for large
acquisitions from private equity investors has also
increased. However for the majority of acquisitions
which are smaller businesses, financial purchasers
are few and there has been no significant change in
the competition for these acquisitions.
Other market factors
The changing demographics of the European and
North American markets, with a generally ageing
population and increasing immigration, suggests that
demand for new housing will continue at relatively
high levels over the long term. As the housing stock
ages, it will increase demand in the repair and
remodelling sector. The Group’s business model
gives it the flexibility and agility to respond to
changes of this nature.
While the Group does not operate in a regulated
industry, the performance of the Group can be
impacted by Government legislation. The key
regulatory influences centre on environmental
legislation and stipulations imposed when building 
or remodelling buildings. Such changes in legislation
present an opportunity for growth in response to
increasing demand as customers or end users
respond by changing their buying habits.
Performance monitoring
The Group employs a rigorous performance
management framework to plan, monitor and review
the activities of the businesses. An annual long term
rolling plan is produced by all businesses and this
sets out business plans and resource requirements.
Linked to this is the annual budget process, which 
is core to the target setting process. The form and
components of the budget are in general cascaded
down to branch level within the businesses.
Each month, the businesses submit their results,
which also include a forecast for the remainder 
of the financial year. Performance against both
budget and prior month forecast is reviewed 
with the businesses by continental and Group
management. Corrective actions or additional
resource deployments are discussed with the 
benefit of such information.
The Board of Wolseley plc meets regularly to 
discuss trading results and uses a set of Key
Performance Indicators to measure overall progress
of the Group against its business objectives.

Key Performance Indicator and definition
Growth in organic revenue
The total increase or decrease in revenue for the
year adjusted for the impact of currency exchange,
new acquisitions in the year and the incremental
impact of acquisitions in the prior year.
The Group seeks to achieve, on average, double-digit
growth in revenue through both organic growth and
through acquisitions. Over the economic cycle the
Group would expect growth to come evenly from
both sources.
Growth in acquired revenue
The growth in revenue from businesses that the
Group has acquired during the financial year and the
incremental effect of the prior years’ acquisitions.
Trading margin
The ratio of trading profit to revenue expressed as 
a percentage.
The Group seeks to achieve a growth in trading
profits higher than the growth in revenue through
year on year improvements in trading margin as a
result of continuous improvement in operations.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow represents cash flow from operating
activities less maintenance capital expenditure, tax,
dividends and interest.
The Group seeks to generate sufficient free cash flow
over the business cycle to fund normal “bolt on”
acquisitions and expansion capital expenditure.
Return on gross capital employed
The ratio of trading profit to the aggregate of the
monthly average of shareholders’ funds, minority
interests, net debt and cumulative goodwill and
acquired intangibles written off.
The Group targets to deliver an incremental return
on gross capital employed at least 4% in excess 
of the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
Review of performance
• Organic revenue increased in the year by 10.9%.
• Ferguson achieved organic revenue growth of
24.3% whilst Stock Building Supply also achieved
organic growth of 4.1%.
• The UK business outperformed the market and
achieved 2.1% organic growth.
• Each of the Italian, Swiss and Dutch businesses
achieved double-digit organic growth.
• Over the past five years the Group has delivered
average organic revenue growth of 7.0%.
• A total of 53 acquisitions were completed 
during the year.
• Acquisitions made in 2006 contributed £862 million
to revenue in the year or 6.1%.
• Over the past five years the Group has delivered
average acquired revenue growth of 10.4% with
11.9% in the last year, both exceeding target.
• Trading margin improvement was achieved in
North America although the European trading
margin reduced due to lower trading margins 
in Brossette, Austria and the UK.
• Overall, Group trading margin fell from 6.3% 
in 2005 to 6.2% in 2006 as a result of investments
in people and infrastructure.
• Over the past five years the Group’s trading margin
has increased from 5.8% to 6.2%.
• Free cash flow decreased from £321 million 
in 2005 to £285 million, down by 11.2% as a 
result of higher working capital demands due 
to organic growth.
• Over the past five years after dividends, average
free cash flow is £213 million.
• Return on gross capital employed in 2006
decreased from 19.1% to 18.8% due to higher
acquisition spend in the year, but was 7.5% ahead
of the estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of
capital of 11.3%.
• Average return on gross capital employed over the
past five years was 17.9%.
• Return on gross capital employed in Europe was
16.2% (2005: 19.9%) and in North America 21.9%
(2005: 20.3%).

People performance indicators
Wolseley’s 70,000 plus people are the cornerstone
of providing service to its customers and are one 
of its key competitive advantages. As much of the
customer experience is generated through ongoing
relationships with the Group’s branch personnel 
or outside sales force, staff turnover rates are
considered an important indicator and these are
reviewed as part of the monthly reporting.
The overall summary turnover rate for 2006 
was 22% (2005: 27%), reflecting an improved
performance and a rate management considers to
be in line with industry standards. Turnover in 2006
at the management level of staff is estimated to 
be at much lower rates. Enhanced measures and
information collection mechanisms are being
designed as part of the Group’s new human
resources management system.
The safety of Wolseley’s people is also regarded as
paramount and lost time incident rates are monitored
closely by health and safety committees established
in each of the major businesses. The lost day
incident rate used is affected both by the severity of
the cause of the absence from work but also the
effectiveness of the handling of each absence and
return to work programmes. 
Incidence rates are quoted per 200,000 work hours
(approximating to 100 people working for a year), an
internationally used standard. The estimated
incidence rate for 2006, using submissions from
companies representing 80% of the Group in terms
of total work days, was 35 (2005: 41). 
Other performance areas
In order to measure the success of its strategy
execution, the Group uses a variety of non-financial
performance indicators which continue to be refined
and developed.
Business diversity
A key element of the Group’s growth strategy is 
the enhancement of business diversity, which has a
number of elements. The Group is continuously
seeking to enhance its branch network to provide
improved service and a wider product offering to
new and existing customers. The expansion of the
branch network is detailed in the table below.
2006 2005 2004 2003 2002
Europe 2,861 2,486 2,393 2,266 1,799
North America 1,797 1,434 1,244 1,183 1,156
Total 4,658 3,920 3,637 3,449 2,955
The Group also aims to increase its geographic
footprint in its chosen areas of operation, Europe
and North America. During the year, the Group
expanded its geographic diversity by acquiring a
business in Belgium, Centratec, which contributed
revenue for the year of a35 million. In addition, 
in North America, Stock Building Supply expanded
operations into the states of Alabama, Louisiana and
New Jersey.
Wolseley has continued its strategy of moving 
into new market segments within the construction
materials and services industry. Wolseley UK
acquired William Wilson and AC Electrical, which
established a presence in the electrical distribution
sector, while the acquisitions of Brandon Hire and
Encon significantly expanded its presence in the plant
hire and insulation distribution sectors respectively.
Another key element is the transfer of knowledge
and expertise across the Group in order that local
companies can establish operations in new market
segments or channels. Examples during the past
year include:
• The “XpressNet” network established by 
Ferguson in the USA, which mirrors Wolseley UK’s
Plumb CenterExpress model. By the 2006 year
end, 124 locations had been established, with 64
added during 2006.
• The Wolseley UK Hire Center model is being rolled
out to PBM in France and ÖAG in Austria, with
further progress expected in the coming year.
A summary of the Group’s performance over the last five years is as follows:
2006 2005 2004 2003 2002
Growth in organic revenue 10.9% 8.7% 13.1% 1.3% 0.8%

The European
division continues
to seek
opportunities 
to expand 
into other
geographic 
areas such 
as Spain and
other parts of
Eastern Europe
• The Distribution Centre concept first developed by
Ferguson is being expanded in Europe. In the UK,
the National Distribution Centre has just opened
with the Italian Distribution Centre expected to
come on stream before the end of 2006.
• The blended branch concept where offerings from
different brands or business groups are co-located
to allow customers more convenience and choice
is now in use in the UK, USA, Ireland and France.
Environmental
The Group’s approach to environmental measures 
is set out in the Corporate social responsibility report
on page 46. In accordance with the reporting guidelines
suggested by the UK Government’s Department 
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Group 
is developing a range of environmental measures,
principally in the areas of carbon dioxide emissions
and volume of waste sent to landfill. The Group is
establishing mechanisms to capture and monitor this
information for use in subsequent reporting.
Operations
Europe
Market
The European division is managed through three
geographic areas with senior management allocated
responsibility for each. These areas are UK including
Ireland, France and Central Europe. The latter is
responsible for the division’s operations in Austria,
Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
Wolseley UK is managed through brands such as
Hire Center, Plumb Center and Build Center. These
brands allow focus on specific market groups of
customers while being supported by the common
logistics and operations infrastructure of Wolseley UK.
Europe in total represents a market estimated to be
450 million people and is experiencing the following
demographic factors, all of which present market
opportunities for Wolseley:
• Falling birth rates leading to less new build but
more repair, maintenance and improvement work.
• Longer life expectancies and increasing divorce
rates leading to an increase in apartment
accommodation compared to family homes.
• An increasing number of high incomes resulting 
in more demand for second homes.
• Skill shortages leading to a more migrant
population and an increased use of offsite fabrication.
• Increasing consumerism producing new routes 
to market, for example, the Internet.
These changes often represent shifts of activity
within segments rather than shifts into segments
where the division does not have a presence.
Nevertheless the Group does employ a flexible
business model which allows it to react quickly 
to market changes.
The European division continues to seek opportunities
to expand into other geographic areas such as
Spain and other parts of Eastern Europe. The Group
will be present in the growing Nordic region following
completion of the acquisition of DT Group.

Management has estimated market sizes through evaluating the building materials suppliers’ total market if all
products were channelled through the distribution network. Management’s best estimate of both Wolseley’s

Note: Wolseley’s small existing operation in Denmark has been excluded from this analysis.
Demand in the European markets is driven by activity in a number of key market sectors:
• the residential market analysed between new construction and repairs, maintenance and improvements;
• the non-residential market analysed between new construction and repairs, maintenance and improvements; and
• the civil infrastructure market.
The division’s split of business by each of these key drivers is given below:
Sales Sales

Residential:
New construction 1.4 28%

Non-Residential:
New construction 0.3 5%
Repairs, Maintenance and Improvements 0.6 11%
Civil infrastructure 0.3 6%
Total 5.2 100%
The division has more activity generated from residential
compared to non-residential and civil infrastructure
work, however the actions underway both through
acquisitions and enhancement of business diversity,
continue to broaden the business base. 
Significant opportunities are available to broaden 
the division’s reach both geographically and also 
in terms of market segment. The acquisition of DT
Group represents a significant step in this regard. 
Its annual revenue in its last financial year was 
£1.6 billion.
Divisional performance
All of the continental European operations with 
the exception of the Czech Republic, which had
marginally lower revenue, increased revenue and
most achieved profit improvements in the year to 
31 July 2006 despite markets in construction that
showed very little growth. The results benefited 
from the effect of acquisitions but were adversely
impacted by the fall in Brossette’s profits due to its
restructuring and lower profitability in Austria.
Reported revenue for the European division
increased by 11.1% from £4,637 million to 
£5,150 million, of which 2.8% was from organic
growth. Growth due to acquisitions accounted 
for £382 million (8.2%) of revenue. Trading profit,
after European central costs, increased 2.9% from 
£307 million to £316 million. European central costs
rose by £3 million to £7 million due to the planned
expansion of the European infrastructure to drive
future growth and profit initiatives.
The overall divisional trading margin, after European
central costs, fell from 6.6% to 6.1% primarily due 
to the lower trading margins in Brossette, Austria 
and the UK and the effect of acquisitions. Margin
improvements were achieved in PBM (France),
Manzardo (Italy), Cesaro (Czech Republic), Electro
Oil (Denmark) and Wasco (Netherlands).
In the year, a further net 375 branches were added
to the European network, giving a total of 2,861
locations (2005: 2,486).

The new national
DC in Royal
Leamington Spa,
which is located
alongside
Wolseley UK’s new
headquarters,
commenced
deliveries to
branches in
August 2006
UK and Ireland
Wolseley UK’s performance held up well against 
a UK building materials market which is estimated 
to be around 4–5% down on the prior period. Whilst
the fundamentals of the UK economy remained
positive, with relatively low interest rates and 
low unemployment, repairs, maintenance and
improvement (“RMI”) spending slowed in the first 
half of the financial year in response to weaker
consumer confidence, but sales trends started to
show a gradual improvement in the final quarter.
Government spending remained a relative bright
spot, although there have been noticeable delays 
in planned social housing expenditure.
Against this more challenging background, Wolseley
UK, which includes Ireland, recorded a 14.4%
increase in revenue to £2,690 million (2005: £2,351
million). Organic growth of 2.1% outperformed the
market generally, with Bathstore, the retail bathroom
offering and Heatmerchants and Brooks, the Irish
businesses, performing particularly well, producing
double-digit organic revenue growth.
Wolseley UK’s trading profit increased by 9.9% on
the prior year mainly as a result of the acquisitions 
of William Wilson, Encon, AC Electrical and Brandon
Hire, all of which have outperformed expectations 
at the time of acquisition. Although the gross margin
improved, the trading margin fell slightly from 
7.8% to 7.5%. This was the result of the ongoing
investment in the business to increase the
management resource, improve supply chain 
and logistics and expand the branch opening
programme. These investments provide a platform
for future growth in both the traditional brand areas
as well as those recently entered.
The new national distribution centre (“DC”) in 
Royal Leamington Spa, which is located alongside
Wolseley UK’s new headquarters, commenced
deliveries to branches in August 2006. The regional
DC, in the north west, is scheduled to open in
Autumn 2007. These investments and the current
initiatives to centralise control of transport and
branch inventory management should enhance
customer service, improve efficiency and support
continued growth in the business.
During the year, 288 net new locations were added
in the UK and Ireland, including 262 branches added
as a result of acquisitions, taking the total number 
of branches for Wolseley UK to 1,858 (2005: 
1,570 branches).
France
In France, government tax incentives continued 
to underpin growth in the new residential market, 
but RMI, representing approximately two-thirds of
revenue for both Brossette and PBM, continued 
to show only marginal improvement against the
background of little growth in the overall economy,
weak consumer confidence and persistent high
levels of unemployment.
Wolseley’s French operations, which since May have
been managed through one central team, generated
revenue up 4.8% to a2,515 million (2005: a2,399
million), including organic growth of 2.1%. Trading
profit for France was down to a132 million (2005:
a143 million) with a trading margin of 5.3% (2005:
6.0%) as a result of the lower level of profitability 
in Brossette.
PBM achieved an increase in revenue of 6.8% in
local currency, almost half of which was organic
growth. The sales trends in PBM improved in the
second half and this upward momentum is expected
to continue. Gross margin was down slightly. PBM’s
branch numbers increased by 57 during the year 
to 347 branches including the opening of 8 new
satellites and 12 hire locations. The underlying
trading profit, excluding the previously announced
a11.5 million (£8 million) wood import duties rebate,
showed an improvement, as did the underlying
trading margin. 
Local currency revenue in Brossette was 1.8% 
up on the prior year. Trading profit was significantly
lower, before taking account of the previously
announced a7.6 million (£5 million) fine from the
French Competition Authorities relating to matters
which took place more than ten years ago.
Brossette’s results reflect the ongoing reorganisation
of the district, branch and management structures
and the move to centralisation of purchasing and
logistics, all of which are designed to enhance
customer service and facilitate future expansion. 
In order to accelerate the changes being made at
Brossette a number of management and employee
changes were made during the year with associated
one-off severance costs of approximately a3.5 million.
PBM is expanding the number of joint sites with
Brossette, continuing to cross-sell each others’
products in their respective branches and exploiting
opportunities to create purchasing synergies and
indirect cost savings in cooperation with other 
Group companies.

Central Europe
The Group’s other continental European operations
enjoyed generally good results despite broadly flat
markets. Revenue in Central Europe was up by
14.6% to £735 million (2005: £642 million), reflecting
organic growth of 7.4% and the benefit of acquisitions.
Trading profit was up 3.9% to £31 million (2005: 
£30 million).
Tobler, in Switzerland, had another record year with
revenue up 17.8% to more than CHF300 million for
the first time, including 10.1% organic growth.
Despite competitive market conditions exerting some
pressure on prices and a change in the business mix
to lower margin products, its trading margin improved.
In the Netherlands, Wasco continued to make 
good progress expanding its product range into
sanitaryware, developing its offering to the more
profitable RMI market and focusing on cost control.
It achieved organic revenue growth of 16.1% and
trading profit improved by 57.0%. In Luxembourg,
CFM’s revenue increased by 3.6% although trading
profit was down, reflecting an increasingly competitive
market. Centratec, the Belgian business acquired in
October 2005, performed in line with expectations
and is now working with Wasco and CFM to 
achieve improvements in sourcing, logistics and
inventory management.
ÖAG, in Austria, increased revenue by 2.7%
although trading profit fell due to continued
competitive pressure on prices as a consequence 
of difficult housing and RMI markets and business
restructuring. In Hungary and the Czech Republic,
local market conditions remained difficult but Wolseley
Hungary achieved strong organic revenue growth
and Cesaro in the Czech Republic improved profits.
In Italy, Manzardo increased revenue by 21.4%
compared to the prior year, including 6.7% organic
growth in a flat market and the incremental effect of
Iser Zauli acquired in January 2005. The branch
opening programme of the past few years continued
to benefit Manzardo’s revenue growth. Trading profit
rose 13% reflecting the costs of branch openings
and preparations for the DC opening. Four new
branches were opened during the year. Progress 
on the a20 million new central DC in northern Italy
continues and the first branch deliveries are
expected to commence before the end of 2006, with
other branches being rolled out over the following 
12 to 18 months.
Further progress was made during the year to
manage the businesses in a more integrated 
way across Europe. The focus was on sharing 
best practice in areas such as branch format and
product/service offerings, rationalising the product
and supplier base, improving the supply chain and
sourcing from low cost countries. All of these
initiatives are designed to enable the Group to
benefit from cross-border synergies and accelerate
growth in Europe.
North America
Market
The Group’s activities in North America centre around
two main market areas – plumbing and heating
distribution, which are served by Ferguson and
Wolseley Canada and building materials distribution,
which is served by Stock Building Supply.
Ferguson is the largest wholesale distributor 
of plumbing supplies, pipes, valves and fittings 
in the USA and a major distributor of heating,
ventilation and air conditioning systems
1
. The

fire protection products and industrial pipes, valves
and fittings as well as operating a number of
speciality businesses, serving markets such as the
nuclear industry and a maintenance, repairs and
operations management services business.
Ferguson is managed through “business groups”
such as Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning
(“HVAC”) and Waterworks. These business groups
allow management to focus on the specific needs 
of key groups of customers. Ferguson is present in
50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and
has 1,237 branches (2005: 941 branches).
Wolseley Canada distributes plumbing, heating and
piping products, including heating, ventilation and

In North America,
Wolseley has
shown impressive
organic growth,
outperforming the
market and
gaining market
share
In general, the North American plumbing and heating
distribution market is fragmented with an estimated
95% of distribution operations employing less than
100 people. Consolidation of market players has
accelerated with some of the major retailers having
moved more significantly into the market. The North
American building materials market is also very
fragmented with no company enjoying more than 
a 3% market share
1
.
Both markets have shown good growth in recent
years reflecting low unemployment rates, relatively
low interest rates and strong real GDP growth.
Wolseley has shown impressive organic growth,
outperforming the market and gaining market share.
Demographic trends support high rates of home
ownership and residential construction with “baby
boomers” entering their peak earnings time and
purchasing second or trade-up homes while
immigrants are buoying the entry-level market. Baby
boomers, who are thought to control a majority of
the wealth in the USA, are also expected to have a
significant effect on the repair and remodel market
as their decision to improve their existing homes 
will be less influenced by the state of the economy.
The plumbing and heating distribution market is
driven by new construction and remodelling sales.
The latter market is less cyclical. The building materials
market is influenced similarly although Stock Building
Supply’s business is currently more focused on the
new residential construction sector. Annualised
housing starts in the USA at 31 July 2006 were 
just below 1.8 million per annum
2
, but there are
indications that the market will continue to soften.
Splitting the US into four geographic regions using
US Census information, it is possible to analyse the
number and growth in new housing starts by region.
This can then be compared to Wolseley’s share of 
its business in each of these regions although it
should be noted that this will also reflect sales into
non-residential sources.

activity, the division had 78.1% of its business and hence is well placed to exploit these key markets.

Management has estimated overall market sizes for North America. For the materials market, market size is 
based on the final selling cost to the installer or end user. For construction services, the market only includes

In general the division shows a broad spread of
business across the categories. While residential
new construction has slowed, the other segments
continue to show growth. Actions are being taken 
to widen the business base and increase Wolseley’s
presence in these other market segments. The use
of the business group model providing dedicated
focus on customer segments in North America 
is providing focus towards this objective.
Wolseley remains confident that with the continued
development in the strength and depth of its
management and the investment being made in 
the supply chain, the business is well placed to
succeed in meeting its growth targets and improve
margins over time.
Divisional performance
Wolseley’s North American division performed
strongly in the year to 31 July 2006 with significant
rises in revenue and profits, maintaining its position
as the leading distributor of construction products to
the professional contractor market in North America.
Reported revenue of the division was up 36.1% from
£6,619 million to £9,008 million, reflecting organic
growth of 16.4%, net gains from price fluctuations in
commodities, acquisitions and the beneficial impact
of currency translation. Trading profit, in sterling,
increased by 41.5% from £426 million to £603 million,
after an increase of £10 million in North American
central costs, reflecting the creation of the new 
North American management structure with effect
from 1 August 2005.
Currency translation increased divisional revenue by
£274 million (4.1%) and trading profit by £18 million
(4.2%). There was a net increase of 363 branches 
in North America to 1,797 (2005: 1,434).

31 Performance review
US Plumbing and Heating
Ferguson produced another outstanding performance
generating strong organic growth from its focus on
selected markets, new branch openings and driving
further commercial advantage from its distribution
centre (“DC”) network. These factors contributed 
to significant market out performance in the year.
Local currency revenue in the US plumbing and
heating operations rose by 35.1% to $9,651 million
(2005: $7,144 million) with trading profit up by
40.4% to $676 million (2005: $481 million). Organic
revenue growth was 24.3%. The second half 
gross margin benefited from further increases in
commodity prices, mainly copper towards the latter
part of the financial year. Ferguson’s scale and
distribution capability allowed it to take advantage 
of price movements in a rising commodity market 
to secure additional one-off profits amounting to
around $35 million in the second half in addition to
the one-off gains of around $8 million in the first half.
Taking into account the one-off gains, the trading
margin increased from 6.7% to 7.0%. The underlying
trading margin was approximately 20 basis points
higher, year on year, increasing from 6.5% to 6.7%,
despite significant revenue investments.
Volumes through the DC network grew by 34%
compared to the prior year and more than 50% of
branch sales now go through the network. Further
investment was made in the DCs with an additional
700,000 square feet of capacity added through 
the expansion of four existing facilities. Board
approval has recently been given for new DCs in
both Florida and northern California, which should
be operational within 12 months. 
Of the markets in which Ferguson operates, the
commercial and industrial sectors continued to
improve and although new housing slowed towards
the end of the financial year, other housing related
activity remained strong, with the positive economic
environment benefiting the repairs, maintenance and
improvement sector. RMI is becoming an increasingly
important element of overall construction spend in
the USA. To address this opportunity, Ferguson
opened a further 64 XpressNet branches and 30
new showrooms during the year. More than 60 new
specialist branches for heating, ventilation and air-
conditioning or waterworks were also opened and
this focus should lead to further growth opportunities.
As well as new branch openings, investment in
people and IT continued during the period. More
than 4,300 people joined the business and the new
warehouse management system is being introduced
into the large branches. This should lead to better
customer service as a result of faster and more
accurate product picking and more efficient
inventory management.
Ferguson’s total branch numbers increased by 296
during the year to 1,237 locations (2005: 941 branches).
US Building Materials
The strong performance of Stock Building Supply
benefited from improved market focus which was
brought about by the recent business restructuring
and from acquisitions. Reported figures also
benefited from currency translation. 
In local currency, Stock Building Supply’s revenue
was up 27.4% to $5,305 million (2005: $4,164
million) with trading profit up by 40.6% from $244
million to $343 million. Organic revenue growth was
4.1%, reflecting some commodity price deflation 
in lumber and structural panels. These commodity
price movements had the effect of decreasing 
Stock Building Supply’s local currency revenue 
by $167 million (4.0%) in the year compared to 
the prior year with the greater impact being in the
second half. Acquisitions contributed $970 million
(23.3%) to revenue growth.
Stock Building Supply’s trading margin increased
significantly from 5.9% to 6.5% primarily as a 
result of a more favourable sales mix arising from
increased management focus on value added
products and installed services, both of which
represent significant growth opportunities.
For the majority of the financial year, new residential
housing starts were around record levels at between 
1.9 and 2.0 million starts, although there were
significant regional variations. The markets in Georgia,
Utah, Texas and the Carolinas have been the
strongest throughout the year whereas the weakest
markets have been in the upper Midwest and the
Northeast. As expected, housing starts declined in the
final quarter of the year as a result of rising interest
rates, increased inventory of unsold houses and a
reversal in the trend of house price inflation. Housing
starts ended the year at just below 1.8 million per
annum, with the previously buoyant markets such as
Washington DC, Florida and Las Vegas showing
significant fourth quarter year on year declines.
Management action has already been taken to reduce
headcount and indirect costs and to shift emphasis to
the more resilient housing markets and increase
penetration of the RMI and industrial and commercial
markets. Initiatives are also being taken to expand the
product range throughout the branch network, which
should help Stock Building Supply continue to
outperform in these softening market conditions.
Value-added sales were up 31%, construction service
and installed business sales were up more than
140% and sales to commercial and RMI contractors
increased by 47% and 20%, respectively. As well 
as achieving this through its existing branch network
and acquisitions, Stock Building Supply opened 
19 new greenfield branches and these initiatives
further complement Stock Building Supply’s installed
service expertise.

32 Performance review
Stock Building Supply’s branch numbers increased
by 59 during the year to 314 locations (2005: 255
branches). The branch opening programme has
continued so that Stock Building Supply currently
operates in 33 states.
Wolseley Canada
In Canada, the construction and housing markets
remained mostly strong, while the buoyant energy
sector in Western Canada helped sales in the
industrial and commercial sector.
Local currency revenue increased by 13.0% to
C$1,330 million (2005: C$1,177 million). Of this,
10.7% of the revenue growth was organic, ahead 
of the market generally. Gross margin improved and
local currency trading profit rose by 12.4%, resulting
in an unchanged trading margin of 6.9%. 
Work continued to consolidate back offices, recruit
additional people to fill management and trainee
positions and to improve logistics. The second of
three regional supply centres for larger inventory
items was opened in Quebec in October 2005, with
the third likely to open near Toronto in Spring 2007.
These regional supply centres should lead to lower
inventory levels and enable the branch network to 
be utilised more effectively. 
Wolseley Canada’s total branch numbers increased
from 238 to 246 locations.
Future outlook
In the USA, the new residential housing market,
which is expected to account for around 30% 
of Group revenue, is likely to continue to soften 
with significant regional variations. Against a more
uncertain economic background, but with relatively
low unemployment and good levels of business
investment, the RMI and industrial and commercial
markets should continue to grow and more than
outweigh the slowing new residential market. The
diversity of the Group’s US operations should enable
them to outperform the market and make good
progress overall. However, for Stock Building Supply,
the outlook is more challenging due to the slowing
housing market and lumber prices which are likely 
to remain lower than the equivalent period in the
prior year.
In Canada, the overall environment is expected to
remain positive and although the new residential
housing market is slowing from recent high levels,
the industrial and commercial markets are expected
to remain strong, driven by a buoyant energy sector. 
The UK market is expected to continue to show 
a gradual improvement into the calendar year 2007,
with Wolseley operations in the UK and Ireland also
benefiting from the recent acceleration of acquisition
activity, product expansion and improved supply
chain efficiency.
In France, growth in the RMI market is likely to
remain modest. PBM is expected to continue to
show good momentum, benefiting from acquisitions,
new branch openings and other business improvement
initiatives. The reorganisation of Brossette will
continue and further investments in the business 
will be made to create a platform for future growth.
Brossette is expected to make progress in the
coming year.
The integration of DT Group into Wolseley will
provide additional growth and opportunities for
synergies against the backdrop of a positive
economic outlook in the Nordic region.
Whilst the majority of markets in the rest of continental
Europe are likely to remain broadly flat, Wolseley’s
operations are expected to show solid progress. 
There are a number of business improvement
initiatives in place relating to supply chain, sourcing
and procurement that should deliver enhanced
performance. The Group will continue to pursue its
objective of achieving, on average, double-digit sales
and profit improvements through a combination of
organic growth and acquisitions.
The 10% placing of new ordinary shares, announced
on 25 September 2006, will enable the Group 
to continue to pursue its growth strategy and its
programme of bolt-on acquisitions. 
The Board expects another year of good progress,
benefiting from the diversity of the Group in terms 
of geography, customer and product.

Risk management
In any business, there are a number of risks and
uncertainties which could have an impact on its
long-term performance. The Group has an extensive
risk management structure in place which is designed
to identify, manage and mitigate business risk. The
Group recognises that the risks and uncertainties
facing its businesses are constantly changing and it
therefore empowers local companies to monitor these
and deploy mitigation resources as appropriate.
Risk
Market conditions 
Wolseley’s products are distributed to professional
contractors in connection with commercial, industrial
and residential construction projects and the Group’s
results are consequently dependent on the levels of
activity in their markets. The level of activity varies by
market depending on many factors including general
economic conditions, mortgage and other interest
rates, inflation, unemployment, demographic trends,
weather, the price of fuel and consumer confidence.
Product prices and availability
The market price and availability of products
distributed by the Group, such as stainless steel,
copper, plastic and other products (or commodities
used in such products), can fluctuate. These
fluctuations can affect operating results.
Lumber prices are affected both by changes in 
the availability of the raw logs and by changes 
in the volume and age profile of production capacity
in the industry.
Product shortages may arise as a result of
unexpected demand or production difficulties and
this could have an effect on the Group’s operations.
Risk assessment and evaluation is an essential 
part of the annual planning cycle and an important
aspect of the Group’s internal control system. 
The relevant structures and processes across 
the Group are more fully described on page 58.
The ability of Wolseley to monitor, assess and respond
to these business risks can often provide it with
competitive advantages and hence the business’
resources are carefully managed in these areas. The
principal risks faced by the Group and its management
response thereto are summarised below:
Resource management
The Group’s businesses closely monitor both market
and geographic trends and understand lead and lag
indicators in order to take timely actions to address
issues affecting trading. 
The diversity of the Group’s operations, the nature 
of its customer base and its ability to react to market
changes also provide a degree of protection. The
Group actively manages both its acquisitions activity
and new branch openings to ensure it is best placed
to exploit market opportunities.
The Group’s businesses actively review market
prices for their supplies and take steps to protect
themselves or, indeed, maximise opportunities
arising from significant anticipated price rises. In
many cases, the businesses are able to cooperate
with their supplier base to manage the effects of
such product price changes. Generally, the Group 
is able to pass on price increases from its suppliers
to customers.
The Group sources products from a wide variety 
of manufacturers and suppliers with none of these
accounting for more than 5% of its total material 
and supply purchases during the 2006 financial year.
Increasing collaboration with suppliers including joint
demand forecasting initiatives is also helping to
better manage product shortage issues.

Risk
Competitive pressures
The Group operates in a number of different markets
with differing characteristics. The principal aspects 
of the Group’s offerings that have an impact on 
its competitive position in a market are product
availability, supply chain efficiency, pricing, customer
service, branch location, availability of credit,
technical product knowledge with respect to
application and usage and advisory and other
service capabilities.
In its markets, Wolseley competes with and is
affected by the actions of many local and regional
distributors together with product manufacturers.
Consolidation in the building materials market 
may produce pressure on prices and margins.
Systems and infrastructure capabilities
Wolseley targets sustained double-digit expansion
from acquisitions and organic growth. This growth
places increasing demands on Wolseley’s existing
systems and on its supply chain and logistics
infrastructure. Additionally, to support and enable
future growth, the Group is undertaking multiple
business change initiatives.
Identification and successful 
integration of acquisitions
Wolseley’s growth strategy is in part dependent 
on acquiring businesses but market consolidation
may, over a period of time, lead to increased
competition for targets and as a result higher
acquisition prices or fewer value-creating prospects. 
The integration of acquisitions also involves a
number of unique risks, including diversion of
management’s attention, failure to retain key
personnel of the acquired business and risks
associated with unanticipated events or liabilities.
Resource management
The Group actively works with its customers to 
find innovative ways to meet their changing needs 
in order to remain at the forefront of its chosen
markets. Wolseley’s value proposition centres 
around the service, expertise and the product
breadth it offers rather than strictly competing 
on price.
The combination of Wolseley’s international scale,
allowing it to continually invest efficiently in people,
technology and logistics, thus reducing the underlying
cost base, together with local company autonomy for
managing the customer base, is designed to enhance
the Group’s competitive position.
Wolseley is committed to investing to support its
short, medium and long-term growth targets and
ensure the appropriate infrastructure is in place.
There are a variety of business improvement
initiatives underway relating to supply chain,
sourcing, human resources, the deployment 
of technology and customer service.
These initiatives are actively and carefully planned
with defined governance procedures in place. 
An important component of this planning process is
to ensure that the risks of disruption to the business
are controlled and monitored.
The Group continually reviews acquisition targets
through established processes and searches. 
The status of targeting and progress in making
acquisitions is reported regularly to the Board and
the Executive Committee. 
The Group employs dedicated acquisition and
integration teams whose processes have given 
the Group a successful track record of integrating
acquisitions and achieving expected results. Recent
changes have been made to the Group’s management
structure to increase the central resource focused on
identifying and integrating acquisitions.
The Group typically targets high quality businesses
for acquisition, which not only quickly contribute to
cash flow and earnings, but also expand the depth
of management knowledge and expertise and
provide opportunities for best practice sharing with
existing businesses.
The Group continues to expect to find sufficient,
suitably priced acquisitions, to enable it to meet its
growth targets. The Group also has the advantage
of being able to expand and leverage its extensive
existing network as an alternative means to
achieving growth in certain areas.

Risk
Governmental regulations
The Group’s operations are affected by various
statutes, regulations and laws in the countries and
markets in which it operates. While the Group is not
engaged in a regulated industry, it is subject to 
the laws governing businesses generally, including
laws affecting land usage, zoning, environmental
(including laws and regulations affecting the supply
of lumber), health and safety, transportation, labour
and employment practices (including pensions),
competition and other matters. In addition, building
codes or particular tax treatments may affect the
products Wolseley’s customers are allowed to use
and consequently, changes in these may affect the
saleability of some Wolseley products. 
Litigation
The international nature of Wolseley’s operations
exposes it to the potential for litigation from third
parties. In the USA, the risk of litigation is generally
higher than that in Europe in such areas as workers’
compensation, general employer liability and
environmental and asbestos litigation.
There is risk that due to the increasing sourcing 
of products from lower cost countries, recourse 
to the manufacturer may be more difficult were 
a product to fail for a customer.
People
Wolseley’s ability to provide leadership and products
and services to customers is dependent on
retaining sufficiently qualified, experienced and
motivated personnel.
In order to achieve its growth strategy and increase
productivity, Wolseley must continue to increase this
skill and experience base to develop the managers
of the future.
Resource management
The Group monitors regulations across its markets
to ensure that the effects of changes are minimised.
Certain changes in regulations may also positively
impact the businesses. For instance, changes in
building regulations in the UK with regard to the 
level of heat insulation required in new buildings 
has presented a growth opportunity for Wolseley 
UK through the acquisition of Encon. Such changes
may also provide demand for a broader and higher
margin product range.
Wolseley has a culture and approach which 
is designed to resolve disputes directly with 
the party in question in a spirit of openness and
cooperation. Litigation is regarded as a last resort.
In the case of asbestos litigation, Wolseley employs
independent professional advisers to actuarially
determine the potential gross liability, which
necessitates the application of certain assumptions
relating to claims development and the cost of
settling such claims over the remaining lifetime 
of the potential litigants, which is approximately 
50 years. There are a number of factors which 
could enable actual experience to differ from the
assumptions made. Actual experience is reviewed
against the assumptions each year and the liability
adjusted in the financial statements.
Wolseley has insurance which significantly exceeds
the current estimated liability relating to asbestos
claims. Based on current estimates, no profit or 
cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in 
the foreseeable future. Wolseley has recognised 
a discounted liability of £31 million in respect of
asbestos litigation. An equal receivable amount of
£31 million is shown in other receivables reflecting
the discounted sum recoverable from insurers in
respect of this liability.
One of Wolseley’s key competitive advantages is the
quality and experience of its people. Local companies
have allocated specific responsibilities for reviewing
the performance of senior managers and employees
with high potential. Development and succession
planning for these individuals is planned and strong
performance is actively rewarded. 
The Group continues to invest significant time 
and money in senior management, manager
development and graduate trainee and graduate
recruitment programmes.

Risk
Risks related to international operations
Wolseley has its principal operations in North
America and Europe and is therefore subject to 
the specific risks of conducting business in these
regions. In addition, there are particular risks arising
from managing operations internationally: 
• fluctuations in currency exchange rates may 
affect Wolseley’s reported operating results and 
its financial position;
• changes in tax regulation and international tax
treaties could affect the financial performance 
of Wolseley’s foreign operations; and
• changes in other regulations/treaties may also
affect the ability of the Group to repatriate profits
from its foreign operations.
The management of Wolseley’s businesses and
personnel across 19 countries can also present
logistical and management challenges due to
different business cultures, laws and languages.
Credit risk
Wolseley provides sales on credit terms to many of its
customers. There is an associated risk that customers
may not be able to pay outstanding balances.
Stock Building Supply also provides loans to finance
the construction of properties. There is an associated
risk that customers may not be able to pay
outstanding loan balances.
Resource management
Wolseley believes that the benefits of its
geographical spread outweigh the associated risks.
The portfolio effect of economic conditions,
exchange rates and other associated factors of
having operations in Europe and North America
provide some protection in terms of the long-term
performance of Wolseley.
The Group continually seeks opportunities to 
increase its business diversity and has programmes 
in place to share best practice. Increasingly, the
Group’s businesses are working together to meet
customers’ needs and to ensure the Group achieves
more international leverage.
The Group seeks to manage its foreign currency risk
and the steps it takes are described in the Financial
Risk Management section on pages 39 to 41. The
Group actively works with its taxation advisors to
minimise its tax exposure and risk. 
Each of the businesses have established procedures
in place to review and collect outstanding receivables.
Significant outstanding and overdue balances are
reviewed on a regular basis and resulting actions are
put in place on a timely basis. In many cases,
protection is provided through lien rights on projects
or through credit insurance arrangements.
All of the major businesses use professional,
dedicated credit teams, in some cases field based.
Not only does this lessen the risk of non-payment
but it can also provide opportunities where these
teams can work with higher risk customers to
provide innovative, secured credit arrangements.
Historic write off rates are low and appropriate
provisions are made for debts that may be impaired 
on a timely basis.
Stock Building Supply’s construction loans are
secured on the related properties and are managed
by a dedicated lending team within that business.
Policies are also applied to provide further protection
and Key Performance Indicators are monitored
regularly by management outside the business.
Increasingly, 
the Group’s
businesses are
working together
to meet
customers’ needs
and to ensure 
the Group 
achieves more

Revenue and operating profit
After taking account of currency translation, Group
revenue increased by 25.8% from £11,256 million 
to £14,158 million.
Operating profit increased by 18.8% from £702
million to £834 million. Trading profit rose by 24.7%
from £708 million to £882 million, before deducting
amortisation of acquired intangibles of £48 million
(2005: £6 million).
Currency translation
Currency translation increased Group revenue by
£274 million (2.4%) and Group trading profit by 
£18 million (2.5%). Over the past five years the
constant currency growth of the Group is as follows:
Annual growth in 
constant currency 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002
Revenue growth 22.8% 14.2% 29.5% 8.5% 11.0%

Note: 2006 and 2005 figures prepared under IFRS. 2004, 2003
and 2002 figures prepared under UK GAAP .
The effect of US dollar appreciation has been to
increase translated US profits by £14 million (2.5%)
compared to 2005. US dollar denominated profits
account for 63.3% of the Group’s trading profit.
There has been little movement in the Euro translation
rate. Euro denominated profits accounted for 15.2% of
Group trading profit in 2006. If the results of the Group
are translated into dollars at the average rate for the
respective year the results of the Group are as follows:

and 2002 figures prepared under UK GAAP .
Further US$ figures and the basis of computation 
of the above figures can be found within the
Information in US dollars section on page 145.
Finance costs
Net finance costs of £65 million (2005: £37 million)
reflect an increase in Group debt as a result of
acquisitions and an increase in interest rates, partly
offset by strong operating cashflow and a5 million 
(£3 million) of interest received on the previously
announced French wood tax refund. Net interest
receivable on construction loans amounted to 
£12 million (2005: £9 million). Interest cover was 
14 times (2005: 23 times).
Tax
The effective tax rate, being tax payable on profit
before tax and amortisation of acquired intangibles,
increased marginally from 27.7% to 28.4%.
Earnings per share
Before the amortisation of acquired intangibles,
earnings per share increased by 19.7% from 
82.60 pence to 98.90 pence. Basic earnings 
per share were up by 11.2% to 90.77 pence 
(2005: 81.61 pence). The average number of 
shares in issue during the year was 592 million
(2005: 587 million).
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 
19.55 pence per share (2005: 17.60 pence per
share) to be paid on 30 November 2006 to
shareholders registered on 6 October 2006. The
total dividend for the year of 29.40 pence per share
is an increase of 11.4% on last year’s 26.40 pence.
Dividend cover is 3.1 times (2005: 3.1 times). The
increase in dividend for the year reflects the Board’s
confidence in the future prospects of the Group 
and its strong financial position. The dividend
reinvestment plan will continue to be available to
eligible shareholders.

38 Performance review
During the year the Group entered into certain
foreign exchange transactions to hedge the Group’s
foreign currency net assets. Gains and losses on
these transactions were taken to reserves. The gains
and losses are subject to taxation and accordingly
the taxation arising has been charged to reserves.
The Group’s employee benefit trusts purchased 
2 million shares for £27 million, including dealing costs,
during the period in order to allow greater flexibility 
in the settlement of long-term employee incentives.
Net debt, excluding construction loan borrowings, at
31 July 2006 amounted to £1,950 million compared
to £1,171 million at 31 July 2005, giving gearing 
of 75.2% compared with 50.9% at the previous 
year end and up from 68.1% at the half year. The
movement of sterling against overseas currencies,
particularly the US dollar, resulted in a translation
difference of £22 million which decreased
borrowings on the balance sheet.
The Group seeks to maintain a level of gearing,
generally in the range of 40% to 100%, to strike an
appropriate balance between maintaining an efficient
capital structure and having sufficient flexibility to
fund further acquisitions. Interest cover for the year
was 14 times (2005: 23 times). The Group is content
to see interest cover in the 7–10 times range over 
a number of years but would allow the cover to
reduce to 5 times in appropriate circumstances.
In the USA, construction loan receivables, financed
by an equivalent amount of construction loan
borrowings, were £313 million (2005: £262 million).
The increase is due to an expanding loan book and
additional business generated from the opening of
five new construction lending offices. 
Return on gross capital employed (“ROGCE”)
decreased slightly from 19.1% to 18.8% as a result
of acquisitions, partly offset by the significant organic
growth. The ROGCE remains well above the Group’s
weighted average cost of capital, demonstrating
significant shareholder value creation.
The unamortised balance of acquisition goodwill 
in the balance sheet as at 31 July 2006 is 
£1,173 million (2005: £815 million) with the increase
being due to the goodwill arising on acquisitions 
in the year. As set out in note 12, the Group
recognised, in accordance with IAS 38, acquired
intangibles of £251 million. These represent
principally customer relationships and brand names.
Provisions in the balance sheet (note 26) include 
the estimated liability for asbestos claims on a
discounted basis. This liability has been determined
by independent professional actuarial advisers. 
The asbestos related litigation is fully covered by
insurance and accordingly an equivalent insurance
receivable has been included in receivables. The
level of insurance cover available significantly
exceeds the expected level of future claims and 
no profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected 
to arise in the foreseeable future. There were 246
claims outstanding at 31 July 2006 (2005: 235). 
Details of the pension schemes operated by the
Group are set out in note 27 to the accounts.

39 Performance review
Net cash flow from operating activities increased from
£765 million to £850 million, despite the increase in
working capital required to support higher organic
growth in the USA. Free cash flow after dividends
was £285 million (2005: £321 million).
Capital expenditure increased from £239 million 
to £346 million reflecting continued investment in 
the business. During the period the DC and branch
network in the USA was expanded, investment
continued in DCs in UK and Italy and further
expenditure was incurred on the common IT
platform. Capital expenditure is expected to remain 
at a relatively high level over the next few years with
further investments in DCs, new branch openings 
and IT as the Group continues to put in place the
infrastructure required to support substantial growth
and improved margins.
Investments in acquisitions completed during the
year, including any deferred consideration and net
debt, amounted to £914 million (2005: £431 million).
These 53 acquisitions are expected to add around
£1,418 million per annum of incremental revenues 
in a full year. Further details regarding acquisitions 
are included in note 31.
Shareholder return
The Group monitors relative Total Shareholder
Return (“TSR”) for incentive purposes (as set out
within the Remuneration report on pages 64 and 65)
and for assessing relative financial performance.
For the year ended 31 July 2006, Wolseley achieved
an annualised TSR of 7.4% based on the average
closing price achieved during July 2006, which put it
in 54th position against the monitored peer group of
71 companies drawn from the FTSE 100 and the
building materials and construction sectors utilised
for the latest award under the long-term incentive
plan. Details of TSR performance since 2002 and
the composition of the peer group are set out in 
the Remuneration report. We continue to monitor
return on capital including goodwill, throughout the
Group, as one of the key measures of business
performance. Return on gross capital employed 
(as defined in the Five year summary on pages 143 
to 144) was 18.8% (2005: 19.1%), well ahead of the
Group’s weighted average cost of capital, thereby
generating shareholder value. At the close of
business on the date of the Report of the Directors,
the value of an ordinary share as quoted in the
Financial Times was 1094.0 pence per share (2005:
1156.0 pence) a decline of 5.4%. The decrease
primarily reflects adverse market sentiment relating
to the Group’s exposure to the slowing US housing
market. The market capitalisation of the Group at 
the date of this Report was £7,190 million (2005:
£6,845 million) reflecting the placing of 59.5 million
shares on 25 September 2006. The total dividend 
of 29.4 pence per share in respect of the financial
year gives a yield of 2.7%.
Post balance sheet events
Acquisition of DT Group
On 24 July 2006 Wolseley entered into an
agreement, conditional on regulatory approval, 
to acquire DT Group, the Nordic region’s leading
distributor of building materials for cash consideration
of a1,498 million together with the assumption of 
the indebtedness of DT Group. Regulatory approval
has now been received and it is anticipated that the
acquisition will complete on 25 September 2006.
Placing
On 25 September 2006, a placing of approximately
10% of the issued ordinary share capital was
undertaken to raise approximately £650 million. The
placing will reduce the debt which has built up as a
result of the £914 million of acquisitions in 2006 and
the £1.35 billion acquisition of DT Group. The
placing will also restore the Group’s financial flexibility
to enable it to continue to pursue its strategy of
organic and acquisitive growth.
Pro forma gearing, following the acquisition of DT
Group and the expected net proceeds from the placing,
is 79.1% whilst pro forma interest cover is 14 times.
Other post balance sheet events
There have been no other significant post balance
sheet events.
Other financial matters
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to market risks arising from 
its international operations. The Group has well
defined and consistently applied policies for the
management of foreign exchange and interest rate
exposures. There has been no change since the
year end in the major financial risks faced by the
Group. The main risks arising from the Group’s
financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity
risk and foreign currency risk.
The treasury committee of the Board reviews 
and agrees policies for managing each of these 
risks and they are summarised below. These 
policies are regularly reviewed. The Group’s financial
instruments, other than derivatives, comprise
borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various
items, such as trade receivables and trade payables
that arise directly from its operations. The Group also
enters into derivative transactions (principally interest
rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts).
The purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain
interest rate and currency risks arising from the
Group’s operations and its sources of finance.

40 Performance review
Details of financial instruments are shown in 
note 20 to the accounts.
Derivatives are also used to a limited extent to 
hedge movements in the price paid for lumber.
These options and futures hedging contracts 
mature within one year and all are with organised
exchanges. The Group’s policy is to control credit
risk by only entering into financial instruments with
authorised counterparties after taking account of
their credit rating. 
It is and has been throughout the period under
review, the Group’s policy that no trading in 
financial instruments or speculative transactions 
be undertaken.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture
of retained profits and bank and other borrowings.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies
principally at floating rates of interest and then uses
interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest
rate profile, so managing the Group’s exposure to
interest rate fluctuations. 
At the year end approximately £1,023 million of the
Group’s net debt were at fixed rates for one year or
more, after taking account of swaps. 
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by
currency at treasury committee and Board meetings.
The treasury committee gives prior approval to any
variations from floating rate arrangements.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks a balance between certainty of
funding and a flexible, cost-effective borrowings
structure. The Group’s policy is to ensure that, 
as a minimum, all projected net borrowing needs 
are covered by committed facilities arranged and
provided by the corporate office, supplemented
where appropriate by local facilities.
The Group’s strong earnings and low gearing are
such that the ratio of net debt to EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation)
for the year was 1.91:1 (2005: 1.42:1). This increase
on the prior year is principally due to the high level of
acquisitions in the year. In the absence of significant
acquisitions or exceptional organic growth, the
Group would anticipate having surplus funds within
the medium term. The Group does, however, actively
seek opportunities to secure long-term funding at
attractive rates.
In September 2005, the Group diversified its core
funding by launching a US Private Placement. The
issue was a great success raising US$1,200 million
(£643 million) consisting of 8 tranches ranging in

The amount raised through

maturity from 3 to 15 years. This is the largest
Private Placement ever by a foreign issuer. The
Group took advantage of favourable market
conditions to obtain long-term debt funding at rates
comparable to the 5 year bank syndicated debt
market. This diversification of funding marks another
step in the growth of the Group and reduces its
reliance solely on the bank market for debt funding.
In May 2006, the Group refinanced the great
majority of its bank debt with a highly successful
bank syndication, which raised a2,800 million with 
a maturity of just over 5 years. The syndicate
reaffirmed the Group’s core banks which provide
financial services to subsidiaries in all the countries 
in which the Group operates.
The year-end maturity profile of the Group’s centrally
managed facilities was as follows:

Foreign currency risk
The Group has significant overseas businesses
whose revenues are mainly denominated in the
currencies of the countries in which the operations
are located. Approximately 59.1% of the Group’s
revenue is in US dollars. The Group does not have
significant transactional foreign currency cash flow
exposure. However, those that do arise are generally
hedged with either forward contracts or currency
options. The Group does not normally hedge profit
translation exposure since such hedges have only
temporary effect. Most of the foreign currency
earnings generated by the Group’s overseas
operations are reinvested in the business to fund
growth in those territories. The Group’s policy is 
to maintain the majority of its debt in the currencies
of its operating companies as this hedges both the
net assets and cash flows of the Group.

41 Performance review
Details of average exchange rates used in 
the translation of overseas earnings and of 
year-end exchange rates used in the translation 
of overseas balance sheets, for the principal
currencies used by the Group are shown in the 
Five year summary on page 144 to the accounts.
The net effect of currency translation was to increase
revenue by £274 million (2.4%) and to increase
trading profit by £18 million (2.5%).
These currency effects reflect a movement of the
average sterling exchange rate against each of the
major currencies with which the Group is involved 
as follows:
2006 2005
(Strengthening)/ (Strengthening)/
weakening weakening
of sterling of sterling
US dollar 3.5% (5.4)%
Euro 0.1% 0.3%
Commodity risk
The Group’s operating performance is affected 
by price fluctuations in stainless steel, nickel alloy,
copper, aluminium, plastic, lumber and other
commodities. The Group seeks to minimise the
effects of changing prices through economies of
purchasing and inventory management, resulting in
cost reductions and productivity improvements as
well as price increases to maintain reasonable profit
margins. With the exception of lumber futures held
to hedge future sales commitments, no trading
instruments are held in respect of these commodities.
At 31 July 2006, the Group held no lumber 
futures contracts.
Market price risk
The Group regularly monitors its interest rate and
currency risk by reviewing the effect on profit before
tax over various periods of a range of possible
changes in interest rates and exchange rates. 
On the basis of the Group’s analysis it is estimated
that the maximum effect of a rise of one percentage
point in the principal interest rates on the Group’s
continuing businesses would result in an increase. 
In the interest charge of approximately £9 million.
Similarly, it is estimated that a strengthening of
sterling by 10% against all the currencies in which
the Group does business would reduce operating
profit before amortisation of acquired intangibles 
by approximately £75 million (8.5%) due to 
currency translation.
Financial reporting
These financial statements are the Group’s first
prepared under IFRS. Note 45 to the accounts sets
out the restatement of the results for the year ended
31 July 2005 from UK GAAP to IFRS.
The Group’s accounting policies set out on pages 
75 to 79 of the accounts have been updated to
reflect the requirements of IFRS. There have been 
no other amendments or changes to the Group’s
selected accounting policies.
Insurance
The insurance arrangements of the Group are
reviewed annually. The Group has a captive
insurance company which is registered and
operational in the Isle of Man. No policies are 
written for third parties. The administration is
undertaken by a specialist management company.
Going concern
The Directors are confident, on the basis of current
financial projections and facilities available, that the
Company and the Group have adequate resources
to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly the Directors continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.

44 Corporate social responsibility report
Although the Board believes that the environmental
impact of our distribution activities is comparatively
low, we are committed to sound Corporate Social
Responsibility (“CSR”) policies and practices for good
business reasons. Our commitment to CSR is not
simply a response to increased market attention in
this area, but such issues reinforce the way that our
various businesses operate.
We regard CSR as a sustainable approach to
business that seeks benefits for all of our stakeholders,
be they customers, employees, communities, the
environment or the Company and its shareholders.
During the year we have maintained our dialogue
with stakeholders in this important area. We are
committed to the highest standards of corporate
governance and environmental as well as other 
CSR issues form part of the overall internal control
process. The Board believes that the businesses are
best served by creating a safe working environment
that encourages and supports high levels of
business performance.
We focus on issues such as safety, training,
behaviour-based performance and the provision 
of opportunities for our employees’ career growth
and development. Local community initiatives are
considered to be investments providing support 
that will assist those communities, complement the
aspirations of our customers, give our employees
opportunities for professional development and help
us to achieve our business objectives. The Board
believes that the progressive integration of CSR
throughout the business and the incorporation 
of broader social and environmental issues into 
day-to-day decision making will better enable us 
to achieve our goals. 
In March 2006, we became a member of the 
UK’s FTSE4Good Index Series following its Policy
Committee’s decision that we had met its inclusion
criteria. The FTSE4Good Index is designed to
measure the performance of companies that 
meet globally recognised corporate responsibility
standards and to facilitate investment in those
companies where CSR issues are an influencing
factor in the investor’s decision making process.
Health, safety and environment
A key driver of the Group’s success has been the
high degree of autonomy which has been afforded
to local managements, allowing them to serve local
markets in the most appropriate manner. Within this
decentralised structure, the Board has set down a
number of health, safety and environment principles
with which all the Group’s businesses are required to
comply. The principles relating to environment cover:
the integration of environmental management into
business operations; a commitment to the adoption
and achievement of best practice wherever this 
is practicable; a commitment to prevent pollution;
compliance with local environmental legislation; 
the adoption where practicable of local formal
environmental management systems; a commitment
to strive for continual improvement; and a
commitment to ensure proper communication 
with employees on environmental matters.
Timber
PB & M (“PBM”), the French heavyside business,
purchased 940,000m
3
of timber in the financial year
ended 31 July 2005 and 957,971m
3
in the financial
year ended 31 July 2006. More than 91% in the
financial year ended 31 July 2006 (2005: 88%) of
such timber was softwood, mainly sourced from
countries such as Russia, Finland, France and
Sweden. A little over 3% of the timber purchased in
the year to 31 July 2006 was hardwood (2005: 5%),
sourced from suppliers who have not been censured
by the United Nations as part of resolution number
2001/1343. PBM works with its suppliers to ensure
that timber is sourced from forests which have been
certified by recognised forestry associations which
promote sustainable forestry management. During
the year further investment has been made in PBM’s
IT systems to enable more accurate tracking of 
the sources of timber purchased. PBM saw a 4%
reduction to 44% in the timber purchased in the 
year from certified suppliers, although much of 
the reduction is attributable to increased reporting
accuracy from the enhanced IT system. PBM, 
like Build Center and Stock Building Supply, has
engaged with its suppliers of Indonesian plywood
with a view to ensuring that any illegal logging 
is excluded from the supply chain. Imports of
Indonesian plywood accounted for a little over 
1% of all timber purchased by PBM in the financial 
year ended 31 July 2006 (2% in the year ended 
31 December 2005). Stock Building Supply’s
purchases of Lauan plywood remained under 
0.05% of its timber purchases in the year ended 
31 July 2006. None of Build Center, PBM or Stock
Building Supply purchase without appropriate 
permits any species of timber included in any of the
Appendices to the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora,
which, inter alia, identify threatened species of trees.
Le Commerce du Bois, the French timber trade
federation of which PBM is a member, submitted a
code of practice to the French environment ministry
in June 2005. The code, which is based on both
French domestic and internationally recognised
standards, has been developed by the federation
working with importers and distributors and is
intended to set the standards for timber sourcing,
purchasing and distribution in France. The code

and 88% in 2006 of such timber was sourced 
from Finland, Germany, Latvia, the UK and other
European countries. Less than 0.9% in 2005 and
0.5% in 2006 of such purchases were of hardwood.
Some 72% of Build Center’s raw material purchases
made in the year ended 31 July 2006 (2005: 67%)
were from certified sources. During the year Build
Center continued to engage with its suppliers with
regard to the responsible sourcing of timber and the
elimination of illegal timber from the supply chain. 
In June 2006 the governing board of the UK Timber
Trade Federation (“TTF”), of which Build Center is a
member, voted to make its Responsible Purchasing
Policy (“RPP”) which had been successfully trialled by
Build Center in 2004, a condition of its membership,
subject to the consent of its members. Formulated
by the TTF to meet the requirements of the UK
Government’s own timber procurement policy, the
RPP was developed with the benefit of input from
principal suppliers, with a view to ensuring that
increasing volumes of sustainable timber are
progressively being made available to businesses
especially where timber is sourced from forests 
where certification schemes are not widely in place.
Wolseley UK continues to promote the use of its
web-based interface onto which its suppliers can 
log their responses to specific questions and submit
documentary evidence in support of their provenance,
such as chain of custody certificates. Following a
successful round of supplier audits in 2005, 80% 
of timber supplies to Wolseley UK are documented
through the interface. It is intended that over the next
12 months the interface will be extended to collect
and store data related to timber supplies from Stock
Building Supply and PBM. 
Stock Building Supply purchased some 4,580,000m
3
of timber in the year ended 31 July 2005 and
5,398,000m
3
in the year ended 31 July 2006 of which
a little under 1,600,000m
3
were structural panels.
Over 95% of timber purchased by Stock Building
Supply in the financial years 2005 and 2006 were
sourced from the USA and Canada, with
approximately 3% being sourced from Europe. The
percentage of such purchases made from suppliers
who hold certifications from recognised forestry
sustainability agencies, such as the American Forest
Products Association and the Canadian Standards
Association remained at 90% for the third
consecutive year. The American Forest Products
Association’s Sustainable Forest Initiative programme
requires participants to meet an exacting standard of
environmental principles, objectives and performance
measures. The standard integrates the perpetual
growing and harvesting of trees with the protection of
wildlife, plants, soil and water quality, together with a
wide range of conservation goals. Stock Building
Supply maintains a constant dialogue with its suppliers,
reviewing their environmental practices and policies,
encouraging sustainable forestry management
practices and seeking opportunities to improve the
use of natural resources. Sales of engineered wood
products, which are substitutes for wide dimension
solid-sawn timber, increased by a further 10% in 
the year ended 31 July 2006 (2005: 21.6%). Such
substitutes improve structural performance, thereby
reducing the need to harvest as many larger, 
older trees.
Chain of custody
It is well recognised that whilst sustainable sourcing
is vital, it is also key that illegal timber is eliminated
from the supply chain, from the forest of origin to 
the end user. In the UK, Build Center began work 
in 2003 on a chain of custody project that initially
saw the implementation of new procedures in five
branches with 16 products within scope, all of which
had been independently audited and approved by,
or on behalf of, both the Forest Stewardship Council
(“FSC”) and Programme for the Endorsement of
Forest Certification (“PEFC”). The project required
Build Center to identify certified sources for these
initial 16 products, adapt management systems to
identify and capture relevant data, undertake on-site
training, create a dialogue with suppliers and create
new documentation to ensure that despatch notes
and invoices contain chain of custody certification
numbers and references to the certified status of 
the product. Internal and independent third party
audits have also been conducted. From the original
16 products, the number of products within the
chain of custody scheme now exceeds 3,000 
and certification has been achieved at a further 
41 branches during the year ended 31 July 2006
(2005: 15 branches), bringing the total to 61
branches by the end of the financial year. Work
continues to secure accreditation at all of its
remaining branches with the current target being 
to achieve accreditation at a further 59 branches 
by 31 July 2007. The volume of timber controlled
within the chain of custody scheme in the year
ended 31 July 2006 was 104,500m
3
(2005:
30,000m
3
), some 30% of total timber purchased
(2005: 8.6%). This exceeded the target of 75,000m
3
for the year ended 31 July 2006 by 28%. PBM’s
hardwood business, as well as its garden products
business, Cerland, achieved certification for their
chain of custody procedures in 2003. Significant
progress has been made during the year to achieve
the same recognition in PBM’s softwood import
business, with the requisite pre-audit report having
been completed in March 2004 and PEFC

certification awarded in November 2005. In line with
the target set last year, 100% of all PBM’s imported
softwood in the year ended 31 July 2006 had either
PEFC or FSC chain of custody certification.
Stock Building Supply does not have a formal chain
of custody procedure for its timber as it relies upon
the chain of custody procedures in place within 
its suppliers. As noted above, the vast majority 
of purchases made by Stock Building Supply are
from suppliers who hold recognised certifications
and whose harvests are strictly controlled by US 
and Canadian Federal and State law. Stock Building
Supply maintains an extensive dialogue with its
suppliers regarding sustainability issues including
chain of custody.
Waste management
All of the Group’s European companies comply with
EU and domestic waste management regulations. 
In Ireland, Heatmerchants continues to reduce
compliance costs by back-loading secondary waste
paper, cardboard, wood pallets and plastic from
branches to the main distribution centre for recycling.
In the year to 31 July 2006, over 900 tonnes of such
material was recycled (2005: 800) and thus saved
from landfill resulting in cost savings of a144,000.
Brossette in France has installed containers at each
of its branches for the collection of plastic/paper,
wood and metal for recycling. ÖAG in Austria
continues to operate its waste management strategy
that has been in place since 1994 and which
streams waste for collection and reprocessing 
by specialist contractors. Stock Building Supply 
has optimised the use of off-cuts in its truss
manufacturing facilities and, where possible, off-cuts
which cannot otherwise be used are recycled by
wood product manufacturers in order to minimise
waste, reduce the need to use landfill sites and
reduce costs. Stock Building Supply estimates 
that more than 4,800 tonnes of landfill was avoided
in the year ended 31 July 2006 (2005: 4,800) 
which has resulted in savings of more than $345,000
(2005: $290,000) in waste management costs.
Stock Building Supply intends to extend the
recycling of off-cuts to its new truss manufacturing
facilities which is expected to increase the number 
of tonnes of landfill that will be avoided. In the UK,
equipment has been installed at our distribution
warehouses to bale and recycle cardboard and 
hard plastic. Recycling programmes operate in all 
of the businesses’ corporate offices.
Environment
Wolseley UK has formed an Environmental 
Steering Group comprising senior managers and
local board directors. The Group identifies ways in
which environmental issues can be captured and
improvements made. Wolseley UK has agreed an
environmental policy which sets out the company’s
position to customers, suppliers and other
stakeholders in relation to environmental matters.
Commitment has been made to continuous
improvement in environmental performance, the
prevention of pollution and to improving efficiency 
in the use of resources including energy, water,
packaging and other raw materials. During the 
year Wolseley UK continued to promote the use 
of energy-efficient products in the boiler market,
working closely with power suppliers and major
boiler manufacturers to incentivise the installation 
of high efficiency boilers. Carbon emissions saved
through this and other schemes since 2001 
are in excess of 180,000 tonnes. Following the
establishment of its Environmental Management
System in 2004, which structures its approach to
environmental matters, Wolseley UK attained ISO
14001 accreditation in May 2005 for three of its
branches; this accreditation was maintained in the
year ended 31 July 2006 and work is underway 
to complete the accreditation process at a further
three Wolseley UK branches by autumn 2006.
Construction will begin in October 2006 of Wolseley
UK’s Sustainable Building Center (“SBC”), a 6,800
square feet living, interactive showcase for renewable
and sustainable building materials. The products
used in the construction of the building and those
displayed within it, will be commercially available
through Wolseley UK’s existing branch network.
Wolseley UK intends that the SBC, planned for
completion in July 2007, will become the leading UK
industry resource for sustainable building products
and supporting information as well as the promotion
of sustainable building practices. 
In common with other businesses within the Group,
transport is a key area of focus for Wolseley UK.
Tight controls are enforced to ensure that the
minimum number of vehicles operate out of each
Wolseley UK site and emphasis is placed upon route
planning to minimise delivery journeys and the
number of kilometres travelled. Progress continues
to be made across the whole UK transport fleet to
improve this utilisation. During the year, the Group
introduced a Groupwide standard for transport
management systems, with initial implementation 
in Wolseley UK. The standard will enable transport
management to work in real time to improve route
planning and resource scheduling across different
business sectors and between multiple sites helping
to ensure that while utilisation of commercial vehicles
increases, the kilometres covered are reduced. 
The UK rollout of the transport management system
will take place over the next 12 months with the aim

models
to deliver an 8% reduction in kilometres covered,
equivalent to 5 million kilometres and reducing
carbon emissions by around 2,000 tonnes per
annum. The transport management system is an
important tool in the Group’s drive to support
environmentally friendly transport initiatives,
alongside a reduction in vehicle sizes and numbers
and backloading, which in the UK has saved
suppliers over 7,000 journeys each year. 
In March 2006, Wolseley UK took part in a fleet
efficiency survey of delivery vehicle activities, the
results of which will be used by the UK Department 
for Transport sponsored Freight Best Practice
programme in its work towards encouraging fleets 
to improve their operational efficiency. The survey
covered a range of measures including fuel use,
number of deliveries and operating costs. A
benchmarking report is expected be published by
the Freight Best Practice programme in October 2006.
The use of high capacity trailers has continued to
reduce the number of vehicles operating between
each of the UK distribution centres and significant
investment continues to be made in distribution
warehousing. Multiple stock replenishment deliveries
to branches from suppliers have been reduced 
as loads are consolidated in Wolseley UK’s own
distribution warehouses for onward delivery.
Consolidating loads further reduces the number of
supplier vehicles on the road while minimising the
local impact around branches. There is a continued
focus on pooling branch vehicles across each of the
Wolseley UK brands, which will ensure that the fleet
eliminates wasteful multiple deliveries and reduces
the number of kilometres travelled. During the year,
Wolseley UK has continued with its project to
improve fuel consumption across its primary
distribution fleet, switching its commercial vehicle
fuel use to bio-diesel at its three regional distribution
centres which now use around two million litres 
of bio-diesel annually; this is set to increase as the 
fuel becomes more available within the UK. Further
initiatives include individual vehicle monitoring,
combined with driver training programmes and 
the replacement of older, less fuel-efficient vehicles.
Some 265 (2005: 216) vehicles were replaced during
the year with vehicles that are more than 3% more
fuel-efficient. Wolseley UK’s transport group also
pays continuous attention to servicing programmes
which include regular emissions checks to ensure
vehicle efficiency and has adopted a reduced
emissions and tyre pressure management system 
for optimal fleet use. 
Ferguson in the USA has been using a transportation
management system for its fleet of more than 
2,000 diesel powered delivery vehicles. The system
optimises the delivery of goods from distribution
centres to branches as well as directly to customers,
thereby reducing handling and transport costs
together with vehicle emissions. Ferguson has a
policy of sourcing vehicles from a supplier with a
leading reputation in environmentally friendly diesel
technology. The engines for all replacement vehicles
are certified to meet the US Government’s standards
for particulate emissions. Approximately 508 vehicles
or 25% of the fleet replaced during the year were
equipped with emissions technology that meets
such standards. Ferguson is also seeking to take 
full advantage of new digital valve technology 
to improve air quality and fuel economy throughout
its entire distribution network. In the previous financial
year Ferguson purchased a hybrid electric/petrol
vehicle to assess the benefits of improved fuel
economy and reduced emissions which such vehicles
may be able to offer compared to conventional
vehicles. The assessment revealed that the reduction
in fuel consumption is minimal and concluded that
the particular vehicle is commercially unviable.
However, further work continues both within
Ferguson and Stock Building Supply to identify
suitable alternatives.
As part of Stock Building Supply’s transport
management programme, many suppliers back-load
their delivery vehicles to avoid wasteful return journeys.
This initiative is part of a modernisation programme
that also includes investment in a national fleet
management, fuel and servicing system aimed 
at achieving optimal fleet efficiency and curbing
excessive emissions and which has also ensured
that an appropriate level of capital expenditure is
invested in new environmentally friendly vehicles.
These vehicles incorporate emission and fuel
economy technologies which already comply with, 
or exceed, forthcoming US Government standards.
During the year ended 31 July 2006, over 420 such
vehicles were replaced (a little under 11%) (2005:
300 or a little over 8% of such vehicles). These new
vehicles are approximately 70% more fuel-efficient
than the ones they replaced. In common with other
Wolseley companies, Stock Building Supply’s
maintenance programme seeks to improve both
safety and fuel-efficiency by increasing reliability
through the direct purchase of spare parts and also
by rigorous tyre management. In 2004 Stock
Building Supply successfully tested a GPS (Global
Positioning System) pilot programme, which
indicated that further efficiencies could be achieved
and would allow the company to plan more efficient
delivery routes to enhance customer service and
further reduce the number of kilometres driven. 
The pilot also demonstrated that safety could be
improved as drivers’ speed can be monitored. Stock
Building Supply has now rolled out the initiative such
that in the year ended 31 July 2006, 371 vehicles

benefited from the GPS programme (2005: 225).
The initiative, having estimated the avoidance of 
over 350,000 additional kilometres being driven 
in the last year, is expected to be rolled out to a
further 150 vehicles in the next year. Stock Building
Supply’s regional distribution centres were designed
to facilitate product delivery by rail. More than 70%
(2005: 55%) of deliveries to the distribution centres
are made in this way, with over 17,000 wagon loads
(equivalent to some 68,800 (2005: 60,000) lorry
loads) received during the last year alone. Delivery by
rail continues to be encouraged and is expected to
continue to grow with our investment in distribution
centres designed to receive more product in this way.
Brossette’s new organisational structure has 
reduced the number of warehouses and has
regrouped branches to improve productivity and
customer service while at the same time reducing
the number of delivery journeys and transport 
costs. Brossette has a national fleet maintenance
programme in place, which seeks to secure optimal
use of its delivery vehicles while minimising the
impact on the environment. Brossette seeks to 
take advantage of technological improvements 
when renewing its fleet to both reduce emissions
and to optimise fuel consumption. All new vehicles
are fitted with the latest software technology to
improve efficiency and to reduce the number of
kilometres driven. Some 170 vehicles (around 13% 
of such vehicles) (2005: 102, around 10%) were
replaced during the year. PBM has continued with 
its fleet renewal programme to increase fuel efficiency,
improve safety and reduce both emissions and
transport costs. In the year to 31 July 2006, 
872 vehicles were replaced (2005: 486) representing 
a little over 22% of PBM’s fleet (2005: 13%). 
Fleet efficiency is underpinned by a national fleet
management programme, which ensures uniform
operating standards. PBM ensures that its drivers’
training is maintained and seeks ways of encouraging
responsible driving. 
Health and safety
The Company has developed a health and safety
framework which requires local management to have
suitable procedures in place to ensure compliance
with applicable laws and regulations and, wherever
possible, to employ best practices. One of the key
issues for the Group is the creation of a work
environment free from injury and illness and how 
to achieve improvements in our health and safety
performance. This is driven not only by legal
responsibility, but also by the ethical desire to protect
our employees. Wolseley UK has an Executive
Safety Steering Group, supported by its health and
safety department. This comprises senior managers
and local board directors. The Steering Group
reviews the UK businesses’ performance in health
and safety matters, promotes good practice and
ensures appropriate consultation on any intended
changes to its health and safety management
systems. All branch and area managers are 
trained in this area and all employees are trained 
to complete their daily tasks in a safe manner. 
In July 2006, Wolseley UK received recognition for 
its health and safety initiatives by winning two awards
at the UK Fleet Safety Awards. The awards are a
national event organised by Brake, the UK road
safety charity, and are designed to promote risk
management best practice among businesses 
by recognising organisations and professionals 
who have worked significantly to improve the safety
of vehicle operations. The awards for “Road Risk
Manager of the Year” and “Best Crash Analysis
Procedures” recognise the work undertaken by 
the company’s Fleet Safety Steering Group which
introduced a fleet safety handbook, newsletters, 
an occupational road risk policy, regular management
review meetings with industry experts and insurers
as well as benchmarking against best in class.
Online driving assessments and a “Commercial
Vehicle Driver of the Year” award to promote safety
amongst employees have also contributed towards
increased awareness of safety issues and an overall
reduction in commercial vehicle and company 
car accidents.
Brossette has a central health and safety committee
which oversees the work carried out by the health
and safety committees in individual branches.
Representatives of Brossette and its employees 
sit on each local committee, together with an
occupational health doctor. All new employees and
managers receive appropriate induction and training
which includes matters related to health and safety.
PBM seeks to increase awareness of the importance
of health and safety matters throughout its business
using a programme which reinforces the fact that
each of its employees has both a responsibility and
a part to play in maintaining and improving health
and safety standards. Stock Building Supply has a
safety committee with responsibility for developing,
introducing and monitoring the effectiveness of its
overall safety programme and objectives. Stock
Building Supply recognises that it must work
together with its employees towards the common
goal of eliminating hazards and accidents and
employees are expected to participate in actively
promoting a positive safety culture. The safety
committee comprises employees with different
perspectives and from varied disciplines. Each
branch manager is responsible and accountable 
for health and safety at his or her branch, including
compliance with regulations, safety awareness and
accident prevention. All new employees are given

in 2006/7
induction training relating to safe working practices
and hazards present in the workplace. Training is
also provided when an employee is requested to
manage new processes, procedures or equipment.
Monthly mandatory safety meetings are held at 
each branch during which, as a minimum, topics
designated by the safety committee must be
discussed. Safety issues within each branch are
dealt with by a safety coordinator or local safety
committee consisting of a cross-section of employees. 
Stock Building Supply and Ferguson have been
working together over the last three years to improve
their performance in the areas of both health and
safety and traffic accidents. The joint initiative has
been driven not only by the costs to the business of
increasing medical and other expenses associated
with claims for workers’ compensation but also the
desire to reduce the incidence of injury and to reduce
the consequential effect that such incidences have 
on other employees and the business. Each of 
the businesses set targets during the year to reduce
the frequency and cost of both workers’ compensation
and traffic incidents, enhance their programmes to
help employees to return to work even if this is on
modified duty, improve the reporting of claims to
ensure that prompt action is taken and increase
measures to ensure that employees are able to seek
any required medical attention. This joint initiative has
resulted in a significant improvement to the longer term
trends in both companies’ health and safety records.
Ferguson, having seen a 14% reduction in the
number of work-related injuries in the six months 
to 31 March 2005, saw an increase of 24% in the
number of such injuries in the year to 31 July 2006
against a background of a 19% increase in its
workforce. Whilst Stock Building Supply achieved 
a 21% reduction in work-related injuries in the six
months to 31 March 2005 it experienced an increase
of 22% in the number of such injuries in the year 
to 31 July 2006 during which period its workforce
increased by 23%. Measures have been taken to
increase focus to return to the results achieved in
2005. These include the appointment of a director of
health and safety for the North American businesses
and, with effect from 1 August 2006, the creation of 
a North American safety committee which will oversee
such matters across both the US and Canada.
Ferguson achieved a 100% rate of returning injured
employees to work either on modified duty or to their
original jobs, with Stock Building Supply achieving
90% in the year ended 31 July 2006. Both companies
have continued to make progress in reducing vehicle
accidents and the impact of such accidents over the
last year. Ferguson saw an increase of 6.5% in vehicle
accidents in the year ended 31 July 2006 in a period
when its vehicle fleet expanded by 23% and Stock
Building Supply held its accident frequency rate at
prior year levels. In May 2005, Stock Building Supply
introduced its “Driven to Safety” programme, a
proactive safe driver training programme. Since then,
every delivery driver has been trained in a variety of
ways to recognise hazardous conditions, plan the
appropriate response and take decisive action. Every
new driver joining Stock Building Supply receives such
bespoke training and each driver’s knowledge and
ability to practice safe driving techniques will be
assessed. Ferguson intends to roll out a Driven to
Safety initiative within its own business during the 
year ending 31 July 2007. Ferguson has continued 
to promote its Customer “CARE” (Customers and
Associates Require Excellence) programme which 
is intended to symbolise Ferguson’s determination 
to achieve a culture of excellence throughout the
organisation. The programme includes two goals
aimed at communicating the importance of safety 
and quality and to promote a safe working
environment for all of its employees. In common 
with Mart in Hungary which obtained its accreditation
in 1997, Cesaro in the Czech Republic has also
continued to demonstrate its commitment to
customer care during the year following its achievement
of ISO 9001 accreditation in June 2005 for its quality
management processes. The continued accreditations
acknowledge the companies’ ability to fulfil their
customers’ quality requirements and applicable
regulatory requirements while aiming to enhance
customer satisfaction and achieve continual
improvement of performance in pursuit of 
these objectives.
Acquisitions
A great deal of importance is placed on
environmental matters during the due diligence
process for acquisitions. External environmental
consultants review and assess environmental 
risks to which the Group could potentially become
exposed. Depending upon the type of proposed
acquisition, this assessment could include reviews 
of environmental management systems, compliance
with laws and regulations and the respect and care
shown for the environment. Health and safety
compliance and processes are also considered as
part of the process. Appropriate dialogue with, and
indemnities from, the proposed vendors are sought
where appropriate.
Code of Ethics
A Groupwide Code of Ethics has been in place 
since 2003. This sets out a number of fundamental
principles which all companies and employees are
required to follow. In keeping with our decentralised
approach, businesses are required to adopt their
own codes which respect local cultures and
businesses but which also set standards that are 
still no less exacting than those detailed in the
Groupwide Code. To a large extent, these individual

codes simply underpin and endorse existing
practices. New companies joining the Group are
required to adopt codes of ethics on the same 
basis as existing businesses. The Groupwide 
Code covers many areas including fair competition,
compliance with laws, including anti-trust laws,
maintenance of the Group’s reputation for integrity
(including a prohibition on bribery and general
principles for dealing with suppliers and authorities)
and can be viewed on the Company’s website at
www.wolseley.com or a printed copy is available
from the Group Company Secretary. Wolseley UK,
for example, has incorporated the Code of Ethics
into a wider document which sets out the principles
on which business is transacted. This includes
principles related to diversity, safety, inducements,
communication, the environment and human rights.
The human rights policies and procedures are based
on the principles set out in the United Nations
Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
The workplace
One of the Board’s objectives is to ensure that we
provide a workplace environment that encourages
and supports our employees in achieving their best
personal performance. Further work was undertaken
during the year in this area coordinated by the
Groupwide human resource function that resides 
in Theale. The development of leadership skills of
senior managers is also a key objective and further
progress has been made to enable more participants
than ever before to attend programmes at Darden
and IMD. Training and development programmes for
all employees are crucial to the ability of the
business to achieve its goals. Significant attention
and resources continue to be devoted to this issue.
Just under £21 million (2005: £12 million) was spent
on training of employees during the year, with over
142,000 (2005: 75,250) days of training provided.
Whilst Wolseley is committed to promoting equal
opportunities for all, it is believed that, overall,
women and minorities continue to be under-
represented. We believe that we have the right
policies in place to meet or exceed legal requirements
in this area although we continue to explore the
factors that are critical to achieving greater diversity.
Further work continues to be undertaken in this area.
Wolseley UK and Stock Building Supply both
undertook company-wide employee surveys during
the year allowing employees to suggest areas for
improvement and voice concerns. Wolseley UK’s
2005 survey highlighted the need for better internal
communications; in response, the company
introduced a monthly online chat session which
generated over 700 questions in the first two
sessions. Each session is hosted by a senior
manager from Wolseley UK and the level of interest
to date has proved very encouraging. Themes and
topics that do not receive sufficient coverage during
the online sessions gain a response in the weeks
following the live event and all questions and
answers are posted on the company’s intranet to
allow employees who were not able to join the live
event an opportunity to participate. Stock Building
Supply’s survey compared results to its previous
survey in 2002 and to the US national norm; the
results showed that of the 13 areas covered by 
the survey, including such matters as working
conditions, supervisor’s skills, communication and
benefits, nine were statistically above the US national
norm and four were at that level. Overall, Stock
Building Supply’s employees expressed far greater
satisfaction with their jobs compared with the 
US national norm and demonstrated a significant
amount of goodwill towards the company. 
Community relations
Notwithstanding the international nature of the
business, the Group continues to operate with a
high degree of autonomy, working in and with our
local communities. We recognise our responsibility 
to invest in the communities in which our businesses
operate and to act as a good corporate citizen. 
We are members of Business in the Community in
the UK and continue to work with that organisation
to help develop our approach and practice. The
Group’s businesses are involved in a wide range 
of initiatives for the benefit of local communities, 
of which the following are representative:
The Group’s businesses, customers, suppliers and
employees were directly affected by the devastation
in the southern states of the US caused by Hurricane
Katrina in August 2005. Just a few weeks before 
the hurricane began the Group had announced 
the creation of Wolseley North America to leverage 
the combined resources of all of its North American
businesses. The groundwork was thus in place 
to enable Ferguson and Stock to make a strong 
joint response to those affected in the Gulf Coast
region by formulating plans to develop pre-existing
relationships with local businesses and customers in
order to offer joint premises staffed by local people to
assist some of the hardest hit areas in re-establishing
water and sewer systems and supplying pipe used 
to pump flood waters out of the area. Assistance 
was also given to the US Federal Emergency
Management Agency to provide emergency housing.
Among the numerous local efforts to help the victims
of the hurricane and in addition to the Groupwide
and local company cash donations noted on page 51
of this Report. Ferguson delivered emergency response
products, including generators, batteries, torches 
and pumping equipment to the affected area. Stock

school supplies and books to a school in Gulfport,
Mississippi where several of the classrooms and
more than 10,000 library books had been destroyed.
Teams of Stock Building Supply management
trainees also travelled to areas where the families 
of colleagues had been affected by the hurricane to
help with the relief effort. As well as school supplies
donated by employees, supplies of tools were
donated by many Stock Building Supply branches.
A Relay for Life team from Ferguson’s corporate
offices in Newport News, Virginia, participated in this
year’s event for the ninth consecutive year, raising
$16,500 for cancer charities. In May 2006, Ferguson
employees participated in a food drive in aid of 
the Virginia Peninsula Food Bank. The goal was 
to collect 1,000lbs of non-perishable foods ranging
from individual meals and soups to baby food and
rice. Within just 12 days, 10,350lbs of food had
been collected, surpassing the goal by over ten
times. Employees from Ferguson’s Waterworks
division in San Marco raised over $3,000 for the
city’s Rescue Mission, taking part in a fancy dress
bed race around the city’s Fletcher Park. In
November 2005, employees from Ferguson’s Fort
Myers branch raised nearly $4,000 in a Turkey Drive
allowing the Salvation Army to purchase over 400
Christmas turkeys for families in the local area. 
In April 2006, numerous initiatives by employees 
at Stock Building Supply’s corporate headquarters 
in Raleigh, North Carolina, raised over $5,000 for 
the US National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Stock
Building Supply supported a project with the US
television show Extreme Makeover: Home Edition 
to build a new home for the members of a family 
in Cincinnati who had experienced severe personal
difficulties. Stock Building Supply, together with local
contractors, donated time and materials to build a
new home for the family in just five days. An initiative
in Fort Worth, Texas, saw Stock Building Supply and
Ferguson join forces to help a local contractor
rebuild the home of a local family who were
struggling to cope with the ongoing medical
problems of their seven-year-old son and whose
home had fallen into a state of disrepair. Between
them, Stock Building Supply and Ferguson donated
timber, windows, doors, plumbing fixtures, fittings
and appliances for the project. 
Wolseley UK supported the renovation of an old 
jetty at a special needs centre near Birmingham by
donating materials from a local branch. The new 
jetty has been designed for children who are blind,
partially sighted or wheelchair users so that they 
can get closer to the local wildlife. Many of Wolseley
UK’s employees took part in the 2006 Race for Life
including three employees from the company’s Ripon
office who raised over £3,000 for Cancer Research
UK. Wolseley UK and the Variety Club Golf Society
raised £15,000 towards the 15th Variety Club coach
which has been sponsored by the company. The 
16 seat coach will be used to take pupils from 
a local school, 60% of whom are involved in the
Special Olympics, to sporting events around the 
UK and overseas.
Habitat for Humanity
All three of the Group’s North American businesses
once again supported the efforts of Habitat for
Humanity, the non-profit organisation that seeks to
eliminate substandard housing and homelessness
from the world. Ferguson and Stock Building Supply
participated in the organisation’s Home Builders Blitz
with donations of materials and over 100 employees
in 32 states working to help build 700 Habitat homes
in a week. Wolseley Canada, through its membership
of the Canadian Institute of Plumbing and Heating
(“CIPH”), has helped to raise over C$1,000,000 
for Habitat for Humanity Canada (“HFHC”) in 2006.
CIPH has raised over C$3,500,000 for HFHC since
1994, helping over 500 Canadian families across the
country move into their own homes.
Donations
In response to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina,
Wolseley plc together with its three operating
companies in North America (Ferguson, Stock
Building Supply and Wolseley Canada), committed
$200,000 to the relief effort. In many cases, the
Group’s companies also match dollar-for-dollar
employee donations to charitable causes, such as
the $68,000 in hurricane relief donations made by 
its employees which were matched by Stock Building
Supply. Ferguson made a $10,000 donation to
Cancer Services of Greater Baton Rouge to help
improve the quality of life for cancer sufferers in 
the hurricane affected region. In addition to these
initiatives, the Group supports charities relevant 
to the countries and to the locations in which its
businesses operate. These are wide-ranging and
cover health, welfare, education, civic and
community projects as well as culture and the arts.
Each year, several hundred donations are made. 
In the USA, many of our employees make regular
contributions to the United Way, an organisation
which distributes funds to charities. In the UK, 
a Give As You Earn Scheme operates with the
assistance of the Charities Aid Foundation which
distributes funds to UK charities. Further details of
the donations made during the year are set out on
page 59.

52 Report of the Directors
The Directors submit their annual report and the audited consolidated
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended 
31 July 2006.
Principal activities and business review
Wolseley plc is a holding company; its subsidiaries are organised 
into two geographical divisions which are set out on pages 25 to 32.
The principal activities of the Group are the distribution of plumbing
and bathroom materials, central heating and air conditioning
equipment and pipes, valves and fittings within Europe and North
America. Additionally in the UK, Ireland and France, it distributes
heavyside building materials, whilst in the USA, the Group distributes
timber and other building materials, as well as supplying other
construction services. In the UK, France and Austria, it operates 
tool hire centres and, in the UK, France and USA, it also distributes
electrical components and supplies.
Details of the development of the Group’s businesses during the year
and information which fulfils the requirements of the Business Review
(as required by the Companies Act 1985 (Operating and Financial
Review and Directors’ Report Regulations 2005)), are given in the
Performance review on pages 20 to 41 and in the Group Chief
Executive’s review on pages 8 to 19, which are incorporated in 
this report by reference.
Results and dividends
The Group’s consolidated income statement, set out on page 
72, shows an increase of 18.8% in Group operating profit from 
£702 million (restated under IFRS) in 2005 to £834 million. An analysis 
of revenue and operating profit is given on page 82 in note 2 to 
the accounts. Shareholders were paid the 2006 interim dividend of
9.85 pence per share (2005: 8.8 pence) on 31 May 2006. The
Directors recommend a final dividend of 19.55 pence per share 
(2005: 17.6 pence) making a total dividend for the year of 29.4 pence
per ordinary share, an increase of 11.4% on the 26.4 pence paid 
in respect of last year. Payment of the recommended final dividend, 
if approved at the Annual General Meeting, will be made on 
30 November 2006 to shareholders registered at the close of 
business on 6 October 2006. 
On 24 July 2006 the Group entered into an agreement, conditional on
regulatory approval, to acquire DT Group, the Nordic region’s leading
distributor of building materials for cash consideration of a1,498 million
together with the assumption of the indebtedness of DT Group.
Regulatory approval has now been received and it is anticipated 
that the acquisition will complete on 25 September 2006.
On 25 September 2006, a placing of approximately 10% of the
Company’s issued ordinary share capital was undertaken to raise
approximately £650 million. The placing will reduce the debt which
has built up as a result of the £914 million of acquisitions in 2006 and
the £1.35 billion acquisition of DT Group. The placing will also restore
the Group’s financial flexibility to enable it to continue to pursue its
strategy of organic and acquisitive growth.
There have been no other significant post balance sheet events.
The Wolseley plc 2004 Overseas Employee Benefit Trust, the
Wolseley plc 2004 Employee Benefit Trust and the Wolseley plc 
2004 Directors Benefit Trust were established on 5 October 2004 
in connection with the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 and the
Wolseley plc 2002 Long Term Incentive Scheme, details of which 
are set out in the remuneration report on pages 64 to 67. The trustees 
of each of the trusts have waived their rights to receive dividends on
any shares held by them. Following purchases of shares in the capital
of the Company made between November 2004 and April 2006, 
the trustees of the Wolseley plc 2004 Employee Benefit Trust hold
4,011,478 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company. The average
purchase price was 1247.36 pence per share excluding dealing
costs. The amount of dividends waived in respect of the year ended
31 July 2006 was £300,425 (2005: £176,000). The Directors of
Wolseley QUEST Limited have also waived their right to receive
dividends on any shares held by that company under the Wolseley
Employees Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1981. For the year
ended 31 July 2006, Wolseley QUEST Limited held no shares and 
no such dividend waiver was required (2005: £0)
The Company’s dividend reinvestment plan will continue to be
available to eligible shareholders. Shareholders who do not currently
participate in the plan and wish to do so can obtain an application
form and explanatory booklet from the Company’s registrars, 
Lloyds TSB Registrars. Contact details for the Registrars are shown
on page 147. The latest date for receipt of new applications to
participate in respect of the 2006 final dividend is 9 November 2006.
Acquisitions and disposals
Details of acquisitions made during the year are contained in the
Performance review on page 23 and in note 31 on page 110. There
were no disposals of businesses during the year.
Future development
It remains your Board’s intention to develop the Group through
organic growth and by selective acquisitions.
Share capital
At the date of this report, 657,210,884 ordinary shares of 25 pence
each have been issued and are fully paid up and are quoted on the
London Stock Exchange. In addition, the Company has entered into 
a level II American Depository Receipt programme with the Bank of
New York, under which the Company’s shares are traded in the form
of American Depository Shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
During the year ended 31 July 2006, options were exercised pursuant
to the Company’s share option schemes, resulting in the allotment of
5,553,785 new ordinary shares. A further 14,668 new ordinary shares
have been allotted under these schemes since the end of the financial
year to the date of this report. Details of these issues including, where
appropriate, the amounts subscribed for new shares are set out in
note 28 to the accounts on page 106, which also contains details of
options granted over unissued capital.

53 Report of the Directors
The Directors propose (Resolution 10 in the Notice of Meeting set out
on pages 149 to 152) to renew the authority granted to them at the
Annual General Meeting held in 2005 to allot equity shares up to an
aggregate nominal value of £35,697,279 (representing the authorised
but unissued ordinary share capital at the date of this report) (the “section
80 authority”). If approved at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting,
the authority will expire no later than 15 months from the date on which
the resolution is passed, or at the conclusion of the Annual General
Meeting to be held in 2007, whichever is the sooner. 
The limited power granted to the Directors at last year’s Annual General
Meeting to allot equity shares for cash other than pro rata to existing
shareholders expires no later than 17 February 2007. Subject to the
terms of the section 80 authority, your Directors recommend (Resolution
11 in the Notice of Meeting) that this authority should be renewed so as
to give them the ability (until the Annual General Meeting to be held in
2007) to issue ordinary shares for cash, other than pro rata to existing
shareholders, in connection with a rights issue or up to a limit of 5% of
the ordinary share capital issued at the date of this report. Your Directors
have no present intention to issue ordinary shares, other than pursuant 
to the Company’ s employee share schemes and any share dividend
alternatives. The Directors recommend that you vote in favour of
Resolutions 10 and 11 to maintain the Company’s flexibility in relation 
to future share issues, including any issues to finance business
opportunities should appropriate circumstances arise.
A Special Resolution will also be proposed (Resolution 12 in the Notice
of Meeting) to renew the Directors’ limited authority last granted in 
2005 to repurchase ordinary shares in the market. The authority will 
be limited to a maximum of 65,721,088 ordinary shares (being 10% 
of the Company’s issued share capital at the date of this report) and 
also sets the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid. This
authority will enable your Directors to continue to respond promptly
should circumstances arise in which they consider such a purchase
would result in an increase in earnings per share and would be in the
best interests of the Company. 
The Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares)
Regulations 2003 allow shares repurchased by the Company to be 
held as treasury shares that may be cancelled, sold for cash or used 
for the purpose of employee share schemes. The Company holds 
no shares in treasury but the Directors currently intend that any shares
which are repurchased will be held in treasury. The authorities to 
be sought by each of Resolutions 11 and 12 are intended to apply
equally to shares to be held by the Company as treasury shares and 
to the sale of treasury shares. The Directors consider it desirable for
these general authorisations to be available to provide flexibility in the
management of the Company’s capital resources.
Substantial share interests
The following interests of 3% or more in the Company’s issued ordinary
share capital appeared in the register maintained under the provisions 
of section 211 of the Companies Act 1985:

Lloyds TSB Group plc 4.126
Barclays plc 3.020

Directors
Brief particulars of the Directors in office at the date of this report are
listed on pages 42 and 43 and further details of the Board composition 
are contained in the Corporate governance report. The Directors
standing for re-election at the Annual General Meeting are Gareth Davis,
Fenton Hord and Nigel Stein. Each Director, being eligible, offers 
himself for re-election and each, following a performance evaluation
during the year, continues to be effective and demonstrates
commitment to their respective roles. It is the view of the Board 
that Messrs Davis and Stein each bring considerable management
experience and independent perspective to the Board’s discussions 
and both are considered to be independent of management and free
from any relationship or circumstance that could affect, or appear 
to affect, the exercise of their independent judgement. In addition, 
Frank Roach, who joined the Board as an Executive Director on 
16 December 2005, will stand for election.
Directors’ interests in shares

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
54 Corporate governance
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate
governance set out in the Combined Code on corporate governance
published by the Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) in July 2003 
(the “Code”). The Board has also applied the principles and provisions
in the form set out in the revised draft Combined Code published 
by the FRC in June 2006 (the “Revised Code”) in advance of its
commencement date. The Board is accountable to the Company’s
shareholders for good governance and this report describes how the
Board applied the principles of good governance set out in the Code
and the Revised Code during the year under review.
The Board
As at 31 July 2006, the Board of Directors was made up of 
12 members comprising the Chairman, six Executive Directors 
and five Non Executive Directors. The Non Executive Directors are
considered by the Board to be independent of management and 
free of any relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise
of their independent judgement. The Board considers that each of 
the Non Executive Directors brings his own senior level of experience,
gained in their own fields of mainly international operations. Frank Roach
was appointed to the Board with effect from 16 December 2005. 
Mr Roach was appointed as Chief Executive Officer of North America
to succeed Mr Hornsby, who became Group Chief Executive on 
1 August 2006 following Mr Banks’ retirement on 31 July 2006. For
the period from Mr Roach’s appointment until Mr Banks’ retirement,
the provisions of the Code requiring a balance between executive and
non executive directors were not met, albeit that this was a temporary
position in advance of Mr Banks’ retirement. At the date of this report,
there are 11 members of the Board, comprising the Chairman, five
Executive Directors and five Non Executive Directors. Accordingly, 
the Board considers that the Company once again satisfies the
obligations under the Code.
Biographical details of the Directors currently in office are shown 
on pages 42 and 43. The Company’s policy relating to the terms 
of appointment and the remuneration of both the Executive and 
Non Executive Directors is detailed in the Remuneration report on
pages 62 to 70.
The Board meets regularly during the year as well as on an ad hoc
basis, as required by time critical business needs. The Board has 
a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for its decision, which 
was reviewed in July 2005, although its primary role is to provide
entrepreneurial leadership and to review the overall strategic
development of the Group as a whole. Day-to-day operational
decisions are delegated to the executive committee referred to 
on page 57. The Board met 11 times during the year and Director
attendance for each meeting is shown in the table on page 57. 
The Board has established a procedure for Directors, if deemed
necessary, to take independent professional advice at the Company’s
expense in the furtherance of their duties. This is in addition to the
access that every Director has to the Company Secretary, who is
charged with ensuring that Board procedures are followed and that
good corporate governance and compliance is implemented within
the Group. Together with the Group Chief Executive and the Company
Secretary, the Chairman ensures that the Board is kept properly
informed and is consulted on all issues reserved to it. Board papers
and other information are delivered at times to allow Directors to 
be properly briefed in advance of meetings. In accordance with the
Company’s Articles of Association, Directors are granted an indemnity
from the Company to the extent permitted by law in respect of
liabilities incurred as a result of their office. The indemnity would not
provide any coverage to the extent that a Director is proved to have
acted fraudulently or dishonestly. The Company has also arranged
appropriate insurance coverage in respect of legal action against its
Directors and officers. The differing roles of Chairman and Group Chief
Executive are acknowledged and set out in writing. The Chairman has
confirmed that he would not chair any other major company’s Board.
The Chairman has addressed the developmental needs of the 
Board as a whole, with a view to developing its effectiveness as 
a team and assists in the development of individual skills, knowledge
and expertise. During the year, the Board took forward the results of
previous ongoing evaluation processes to assess its performance and
that of its committees and to identify areas in which its effectiveness,
policies and processes might be enhanced, utilising both a questionnaire
(in relation to the performance of the Non Executive Directors) and
discussions with all Board members.
Performance evaluations, including the skills brought to the Board and
the contributions each Director made to it, were carried out for each
member of the Board. Executive Directors’ performance has been
assessed by the Chairman and Mr Banks. Mr Banks’ performance
was evaluated by the Chairman and the Non Executive Directors. 
The Senior Non Executive Director led the review of the Chairman’s
performance in consultation with the Executive and Non Executive
Directors. The Non Executive Directors’ performance was reviewed 
by both Mr Banks and the Chairman, as well as by the Board as a
whole, which considered the results of the questionnaires referred 
to above.
Meetings between the Non Executive Directors, both with and 
without the presence of the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive,
are scheduled in the Board’s annual timetable. The Board has also
arranged to hold at least two Board meetings each year at divisional
locations to help all Board members gain a deeper understanding of
the business. This also provides senior managers from across the
Group the opportunity to present to the Board as well as to meet the
Directors on more informal occasions.
As part of their ongoing development, the Executive Directors are
encouraged to take up an external non executive position on a non
competitor board, for which they may retain payments received in
respect of the appointment. In order to avoid any conflict of interest, 
all appointments are subject to the Board’s approval. Generally
outside appointments for Executive Directors are limited to one
company board only, although Mr Banks, by exception, served on
two outside boards. The Board is satisfied that these appointments
did not conflict with his duties to the Company. The Board monitors
the extent of Directors’ other interests to ensure that the effectiveness
of the Board is not compromised. Succession planning is considered
to be a matter for the whole Board rather than for a committee. 
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that one-third of 
the Directors retire by rotation each year and that each Director will
seek re-election at the Annual General Meeting every three years.
Additionally, new Directors are subject to election by shareholders at
WO40006_R&A 2006_52-71  10/10/06  8:50 pm  Page 54 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
55 Corporate governance
the first opportunity after their appointment. It is Board policy that Non
Executive Directors are normally appointed for an initial term of three
years, which is then reviewed and extended for a further three-year
period. It is also Board policy that Non Executive Directors should 
not generally serve on the Board for more than nine years and that, 
in cases where it is proposed to exceed this period, the Director
concerned will retire annually and offer himself for re-election.
Following their appointment, formal comprehensive and tailored
induction is offered to all Non Executive Directors, supplemented by
visits to key locations within the Group and meetings with members 
of the executive committee and other key senior executives. All of 
the Directors being proposed for re-election have been subject to a
performance evaluation during the year ended 31 July 2006 and the
Board is content that each has continued to be effective and has
demonstrated his commitment to his respective role.
Although the Non Executive Directors are not asked, at present, 
to meet the shareholders of the Company, their attendance at
presentations of the annual and interim results is encouraged. The
Chairman ensures that the Board maintains an appropriate dialogue
with shareholders. Gareth Davis is the Company’s Senior Independent
Non Executive Director. 
The formal terms of reference for the main Board committees,
approved by the Board and complying with the Code to assist in the
discharge of its duties, are available from the Company Secretary and
can also be found on the Company’s website at www.wolseley.com.
Membership of the various committees is shown on page 147. The
Company Secretary acts as secretary to all Board committees.
Nominations committee
The nominations committee meets on an as needed basis and, at the
date of this report, is comprised of Mr Whybrow (Chairman), Mr Davis,
Mr Duff, Mr Hornsby and Mr Walker. Mr Banks stepped down as 
a member of this committee upon his retirement on 31 July 2006 
and was succeeded by Mr Hornsby. Mr Whybrow would not chair 
the committee when it considers the appointment of a successor
chairman. The committee reviews the structure, size and composition
of the Board and its committees and makes recommendations with
regard to any changes that are considered necessary, both in the
identification and nomination of new Directors and the continuation 
of existing Directors in office. The committee retains external search
consultants as appropriate. The committee also advises the Board 
on succession planning for executive board appointments although
the Board itself is responsible for succession generally. The committee
met once during the year and Director attendance for such meeting 
is shown in the table on page 57, although, as reported last year, a
working party was established, which met on a number of occasions,
to consider the issues arising out of Mr Banks’ retirement.
Audit committee
The audit committee comprises Messrs Davis, Stein and Murray 
(who chairs the committee). The committee’s membership is reviewed
by the nominations committee and by Mr Murray at regular intervals.
Members of the committee are appointed by the Board following
recommendations by the nominations committee. The committee is
normally comprised of three independent Non Executive Directors.
Two members constitute a quorum. 
Each member of the committee brings relevant financial experience
from senior executive levels. The expertise and experience of the
members of the committee are summarised on pages 42 and 43. The
Board considers that each member of the committee is independent
within the definition set out in the Code. Mr Stein is considered by the
Board to have significant, recent and relevant financial experience, 
as he is currently Finance Director of GKN plc. 
All members of the committee receive appropriate induction, which 
is in addition to the induction which all new Directors receive and
includes an overview of the business, its financial dynamics and risks.
Audit committee members are expected to have an understanding of
the following areas: the principles of, contents of and developments
in, financial reporting, including the applicable accounting standards
and statements of recommended practice; key aspects of the
Company’s approach, including corporate policies; company financing;
systems of internal control; and matters that require the use of
judgement in the presentation of accounts and key figures as well as
the role of internal and external auditors. Members of the committee
undertake ongoing training as required.
The committee meets regularly throughout the year and its agenda 
is linked to events in the Company’s financial calendar. The agenda 
is mostly cyclical such that the committee Chairman approves the
agenda on behalf of all members of the committee; each member of
the committee may require reports on matters of interest in addition to
the regular items. Members’ attendance at the meetings held during
the year is set out in the table on page 57.
The committee invites the Chairman, the Group Chief Executive, 
the Group Finance Director, the Director of Financial Reporting and
Strategic Planning, the Group Financial Controller and the Head of
Internal Audit together with senior representatives of the external
auditors to attend each meeting although it reserves part of each
meeting for discussions without the invitees being present. Other
senior management are invited to present such reports as are
required for the committee to discharge its duties.
The Chairman of the audit committee attends the Annual General
Meeting to respond to any shareholder questions that might be raised
on the committee’s activities. The remuneration of the members of the
committee is set out on page 63 and the policy with regard to the
remuneration of Non Executive Directors is set out on page 70.
The committee is required to assist the Board to fulfil its responsibilities
related to external financial reporting and associated announcements.
During the year, the committee reviewed the proposed introduction of a
statutory operating and financial review and its subsequent replacement
by a business review; the progress made towards financial reporting
under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”); the interim
and annual financial statements and the restatement of the 2005
preliminary statement under IFRS; the interim and preliminary
announcements made to the London and New York Stock Exchanges
and the Form 20-F , which is filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in the USA, having received the appropriate information
on the accounting principles, policies and practices adopted in the
preparation of the accounts; changes proposed to those principles,
policies and practices; significant accounting issues; operation of the
Company’s whistleblowing policy; litigation and contingent liabilities
and tax matters, including contingencies against tax liabilities together
with compliance with statutory tax obligations.

Including the report of the audit committee
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
56 Corporate governance
The committee is also responsible for the development,
implementation and monitoring of the Company’s policy on external
audit. The committee reserves oversight responsibility for monitoring
the independence, objectivity and compliance with ethical and regulatory
requirements. The committee recommends the appointment and
reappointment of the Company’s external auditors. The committee
reviews the scope, results (including schedules of unadjusted errors
and representation letters) and cost-effectiveness of the audit as well
as the auditors’ remuneration and performance. The committee also
ensures that key partners within the external auditors are rotated from
time to time in accordance with both UK and US rules. In line with 
this policy, there was a rotation of the engagement partner for the year
ended 31 July 2006. The Committee also monitors the extent of 
non-audit work which the external auditors can perform, to ensure
that the provision of those non-audit services that can be undertaken
by the external auditors falls within the agreed policy and does not
impair their objectivity or independence. Under the policy, the external
auditors cannot be engaged to perform any of the following services:
• Bookkeeping services related to accounting records or financial
statements;
• Financial information systems’ design and implementation;
• Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions and contributions
in kind reports;
• Actuarial services;
• Internal audit outsourcing services;
• Management functions including human resources;
• Broker or dealer, investment advisor or investment banking 
services; or
• Legal and other services unrelated to the audit.
The policy requires pre-confirmation by the committee of any non-
audit work subject to de minimis levels. The external auditors provide
audit related services such as regulatory and statutory reporting as
well as formalities relating to shareholder or other circulars. The external
auditors report to the committee any material departures from Group
accounting policies and procedures that they identify during the
course of their audit work. Within the constraints of applicable US and
UK rules, the external auditors undertake due diligence reviews and
provide assistance on tax matters given their in-depth knowledge 
of the Group’s business. The provision of non-audit services within
such constraints and the agreed policy is assessed on a case-by-case
basis so that the best-placed advisor is retained. During the year 
the committee reviewed the effectiveness of the external auditors and
considered whether the agreed plan had been fulfilled and the reasons
for any variation from the plan. The committee also considered the
external auditors’ robustness and the degree to which the external
auditors were able to assess key accounting and audit judgements
and the context of the management letter.
The committee reviews annually a formal letter provided by the external
auditors confirming their independence and objectivity within the
context of applicable regulatory requirements and professional standards.
The committee also reviewed the terms, areas of responsibility and
scope of the audit as set out in the external auditors’ engagement
letter; the overall work plan for the forthcoming year, together with 
the associated fee proposal; any major issues which arose during 
the course of the audit and their resolution; key accounting and 
audit judgements; the level of errors identified during the audit; 
and the recommendations made to management by the auditors 
and management’s response.
The total fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in the year 
ended 31 July 2006 were £9.6 million (2005: £7.2 million) of which
£4.2 million (2005: £3.4 million) related to non-audit work. Further
disclosure of the non-audit fees paid during the year ended 31 July 2006
can be found in note 3 on page 86.
The committee also reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s internal
audit function and its relationship with the external auditors, including
internal audit plans and performance. Throughout the year, the
committee reviewed the internal audit function’s plans and its
achievements against plans. The committee considered the results of
the audits undertaken by the internal audit function and considered
the adequacy of management’s response to matters raised, including
the time taken to resolve any such matters.
The committee also reviews, where practicable, all proposed
announcements to be made by the Company to the extent that they
contain material financial information. It also reviews disclosures made
by the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director during the
certification process for the Form 20-F concerning the design and
operation of internal controls or material weaknesses in the controls,
including any fraud involving management or other employees
involved in the Group’s financial controls. The committee monitors 
and reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems,
accounting policies and practices, standards of risk management and
risk management procedures and compliance controls as well as the
Company’s statements on internal controls before they are agreed by
the Board for each year’s annual report. The committee has also
monitored the Company’s response to the requirements of the US
Sarbanes-Oxley Act as they apply to foreign private issuers with
particular focus on the progress made in evaluating internal controls
as required by Section 404 of that Act. The Board retains overall
responsibility for internal control and the identification and management
of business risk. During the year, the committee also reviewed the
processes which have been embedded throughout the Group to
implement compliance with IFRS reporting requirements. 
The Company’s whistleblowing policy (which is an extension of the
Groupwide Code of Ethics) sets out arrangements for the Company
Secretary to receive, in confidence, complaints on accounting, risk
issues, internal controls, auditing issues and related matters which
would, as appropriate, be reported to the committee. A copy of 
the Code of Ethics is available on the Company’s website at
www.wolseley.com. 
Each year the committee critically reviews its own performance and
considers where improvements can be made. The committee’s terms
of reference, which had been approved in October 2004, were reviewed
during the year.

57 Corporate governance
Remuneration committee
The committee comprises Messrs Davis, Walker and Duff (who chairs
the committee), all of whom are independent within the definition set
out in the Code. Mr Duff succeeded Mr Walker as chairman of the
committee on 1 November 2005. The committee met five times
during the year and Director attendance for each meeting is shown 
in the table below. The committee is responsible for making
recommendations on remuneration to the Board. The Board’s
Remuneration report is set out on pages 62 to 70. During the year 
as part of its evaluation process the committee reviewed its terms of
reference, which had been approved in July 2004. It was agreed that
no amendments were required. Copies of these terms of reference
are available from the Company Secretary or on the Company’s
website at www.wolseley.com.
The Chairman of the remuneration committee attends the Annual
General Meeting to respond to any shareholder questions that might
be raised on the committee’s activities.
Treasury committee
The committee comprises the Group Chief Executive, the Group T reasurer
and the Group Finance Director, who acts as its Chairman. Mr Banks
stepped down as a member of this committee upon his retirement on
31 July 2006 and was succeeded by Mr Hornsby. The committee’s
role is to consider treasury policy, tax matters and certain transactions
on behalf of the Group within a framework delegated by the Board. 
Executive committee
The Executive Directors of the Company together with Mr Barden,
who has been responsible for Wolseley UK Limited since 1 August 2003,
and Mr White, the Group Company Secretary & Counsel, meet at least
eight times each year, often on the day before formal Board meetings.
The committee addresses operational business issues and shares
best practice, thereby allowing the Directors more time at Board
meetings to focus on strategy.
Internal audit
The internal audit function is involved in the assessment of the 
quality of risk management and internal control and helps to promote
and further develop effective risk management within the businesses.
Certain internal audit assignments (such as those requiring specialist
expertise) continue to be outsourced by the Head of Internal 
Audit to KPMG LLP as required. A policy has been established 
regarding the recruitment of staff from both KPMG LLP and
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . The audit committee reviews 
internal audit reports and considers the effectiveness of the function.
Internal control
In a highly decentralised Group, where local management has
considerable autonomy to run and develop their businesses, 
a well designed system of internal control is necessary to safeguard
shareholders’ investment and the Company’s assets. The Directors
acknowledge that they have overall responsibility for the Group’s
systems of internal control and for reviewing their effectiveness.
In accordance with the guidance set out in the Turnbull Report
“Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code”, 
an ongoing process had been established for identifying, managing
and evaluating the risks faced by the Group. This process has been 
in place for the full financial year and up to the date on which the
financial statements were approved.
The systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of
failure to achieve the Group’s objectives, safeguard the Group’s assets
against material loss, fairly report the Group’s performance and
position and to ensure compliance with relevant legislation, regulation
and best practice including that related to social, environmental and
ethical matters. The systems provide reasonable, not absolute,
assurance against material misstatement or loss. Such systems are
regularly reviewed by the Board to deal with changing circumstances.

Including the report of the audit committee
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
58 Corporate governance
A summary of the key financial risks inherent in the Group’s business
is given on pages 39 to 41. Risk assessment and evaluation is an
integral part of the annual planning cycle. Each business documents
the strategic objectives and the effectiveness of the Group’s systems
of internal control. As part of this review, each business area and
function has been required to identify and document each significant
risk, together with the mitigating actions implemented to manage,
monitor and report to management on the effectiveness of these
controls. Senior managers are also required to sign bi-annual
confirmations of compliance with key procedures and to report any
breakdowns in, or exceptions to, these procedures. Summarised
results have been presented to senior management (including to the
executive committee) and to the audit committee. These processes
have been in place throughout the financial year ended 31 July 2006
and have continued to the date of this Report. The Board has
reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control 
for the year under review and a summary of the principal control
structures and processes in place across the Group is set out below.
Control structures
Whilst the Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, it has delegated
responsibility for the internal control and risk management programme
to the Group Finance Director. The detailed review of internal control
and risk management has been delegated to the audit committee.
The management of each Group company is responsible for internal
control and risk management within its own business and for ensuring
compliance with the Group’s policies and procedures. Each Group
company has appointed a risk director whose primary role in such
capacity is to ensure compliance by local management with the
Group’s risk management and internal control programme. Both the
internal and external auditors have reviewed the overall approach
adopted by the Group towards its risk management activities so 
as to reinforce these internal control requirements. 
Control processes
The Board reviews its strategic plans and objectives on an annual
basis and approves Group company budgets and strategies in light 
of these. Control is exercised at both Group and subsidiary board
level through monthly monitoring of performance by comparison to
budgets, forecasts and cash targets and by regular visits to Group
companies by the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.
Group companies approve and submit risk reports to the audit
committee on a bi-annual basis, summarising the key risks facing 
their businesses and the controls in place to manage those risks.
These reports, together with reports on internal control and departures,
if any, from established Group procedures prepared by the internal
and external auditors, are reviewed by the Group Finance Director and
the audit committee. Group companies also submit annual risk and
internal control representation letters to the Group Finance Director 
on internal control and risk management issues, with comments on
the control environment within their operations. The Group Finance
Director summarises these submissions for the audit committee and
the Chairman of the audit committee reports to the Board on any
matters which have arisen from the committee’s review of the way in
which the risk management and internal control processes have been
applied. Group companies are also required to support the disclosures
and attestations that the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance
Director are required to give under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
The Board has formal procedures in place for the approval of investment
and acquisition projects, with designated levels of authority, supported
by post investment review processes for selected acquisitions and
major capital expenditure. The Board considers social, environmental
and ethical matters in relation to the Group’s businesses and
assesses these when reviewing the risks faced by the Group. The
Board is conscious of the effect such matters may have on the short
and long-term value of the Company. The external auditors of the
Company and the Head of Internal Audit attend audit committee
meetings and receive its papers. The report of the audit committee
is set out on pages 55 to 56 and the audit committee members
regularly meet the Head of Internal Audit and the external auditors
without the presence of executive management.
As noted on page 52, the Company has entered into a level II
American Depository Receipt programme with the Bank of New York
and has securities registered with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission (“the Commission”). As a result, the Company is 
required to comply with applicable US regulations including the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, insofar as it applies to foreign private issuers. 
In accordance with the Commission’s recommendations, the
Company has established a disclosure committee comprising the
Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Financial
Controller and the Group Company Secretary and Counsel.
The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director will also
provide the certificates required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when the 
Form 20-F for 2006 is filed. There were no changes to the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year
ended 31 July 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting. During the year, work necessary to achieve compliance with
the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act related to
internal controls has continued.
Compliance statement
The Company applied all of the principles set out in section 1 of 
the Code and the Revised Code for the period under review and has,
throughout the year, complied with the detailed provisions set out
therein, save that, during the period from 16 December 2005 to 
31 July 2006 there was an imbalance between Executive and 
Non Executive Directors on the Board and following the introduction
of a new Directors’ bonus scheme in 2000, the pensionable salary of
one Executive Director includes his bonus capped at a fixed amount.
The Company’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , are required
to review whether the above statement reflects the Company’s
compliance with the nine provisions of the Code specified for its
review by the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and to report if
it does not reflect such compliance. No such report has been made.

59 Corporate governance
New York Stock Exchange corporate governance
requirements
Whilst the Company is not required to comply with the measures set
by the board of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. to strengthen
corporate accountability as it is a private foreign issuer, it does comply
in all material respects with those standards. Those standards state 
that companies should have a nominating/corporate governance
committee composed entirely of independent Directors with written
terms of reference, which develops and recommends to the board 
a set of corporate governance principles for the Company. Details 
of the Company’s nominations committee are set out on page 55. 
The nominations committee does not develop corporate governance
principles for the Board to approve. The Board itself approves the
Group’s overall system of internal controls, governance and authority
limits. A majority of the members of the nominations committee are
independent Non Executive Directors and all such Directors sit on 
the Board. The Company’s practice, in accordance with the UK
Companies Act and the Code in relation to the appointment and
termination of the external auditors, is that a recommendation is 
made by the audit committee to the Board, which will then make 
a recommendation to shareholders in general meeting. This differs
from the procedure in the USA, where the external auditors are
accountable to the audit committee, which has the authority to appoint
or dismiss the external auditors without reference to shareholders.
The US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the New York Stock Exchange introduced rules in July 2005
requiring the Company to comply with certain provisions relating to 
the audit committee. These include a requirement related to the
independence of audit committee members and procedures for 
the treatment of complaints regarding accounting or auditing matters.
The Company is fully compliant with these requirements.
Communications with shareholders
The Company places considerable importance on communication
with its shareholders, including its employee shareholders. The Group
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director are closely involved in
investor relations and a senior executive has day-to-day responsibility
for such matters. The views of our major shareholders are reported 
to the Board by the Group Finance Director and by the Chairman 
and discussed at its meetings. The Annual Report and Accounts are
available to all shareholders either in paper form or electronically and
can be accessed via the Company’s website or via Shareview, an
Internet service offered by the Company’s registrars, Lloyds TSB
Registrars, detailed on page 148.
There is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders and this has
been extended to include private shareholders through the Annual
General Meeting and meetings with shareholder representatives.
Contact with institutional shareholders (and with financial analysts,
brokers and the media) is controlled by written guidelines to ensure
the protection of share price sensitive information that has not already
been made generally available to the Company’s shareholders.
Contact is also maintained, when appropriate, with shareholders 
to discuss overall remuneration plans and policies. The Group’s
preliminary and interim results, as well as all announcements issued 
to the London and New York Stock Exchanges, are published on the
Company’s website, www.wolseley.com. The Company issues regular
trading updates to the market and these, together with copies of
presentations to analysts and interviews with the Group Chief
Executive and Group Finance Director, are also posted on the
Company’s website. The Notice of the Annual General Meeting is
circulated to all shareholders at least 20 working days before such
meeting and it is Company policy not to combine resolutions to 
be proposed at general meetings. All shareholders are invited to 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting at which they have the
opportunity to put questions to the Board and it is standard practice
to have the chairmen of the audit, nominations and remuneration
committees available to answer questions. The proxy votes for and
against each resolution, as well as abstentions (which may be
recorded on the proxy form accompanying the Notice of Meeting), 
are counted before the Annual General Meeting and the results will 
be made available at the meeting after shareholders have voted on
each resolution on a show of hands. The results are also announced
to the London and New York Stock Exchanges and are published 
on the Company’s website shortly after the meeting.
Donations
The Company’s Corporate social responsibility report is set out 
on pages 44 to 51. The Group’s charitable donations in 2006 totalled
£2,445,000 (2005: £2,020,711). 
At each of the Annual General Meetings held since 2002,
shareholders have passed a resolution, on a precautionary basis, 
to approve donations to EU political organisations and to incur 
EU political expenditure (as such terms are defined in section 347A of
the Companies Act 1985 (as amended)) not exceeding £125,000 per
annum. The Board has repeatedly confirmed that it operates a policy
of not giving any cash contribution to any political party in the ordinary
meaning of those words and that it has no intention of changing that
policy. The Directors, however, propose to seek once more, authority
for the Group to make donations and incur expenditure of not more
than £125,000 in total until the Company’s next Annual General
Meeting, which they might otherwise be prohibited from making or
incurring under the terms of the Act and which would not amount to
“donations” in the ordinary sense of the word. The authority sought by
Resolution 13 in the Notice of Meeting will last until the Company’s
next Annual General Meeting.

Awards under employee share schemes
Options were granted under the Employee Share Purchase Plan in
March 2006 to 8,151 US-based employees (2005: 9,036) and 442
Canadian-based employees (2005: 941) in respect of a maximum of
817,439 ordinary shares (2005: 2,780,555) exercisable at 1236 pence
per share. Options were granted under the UK Employees Savings
Related Share Option Scheme in April 2006 to 2,649 employees
(2005: 2,246) in respect of a maximum of 621,422 ordinary shares
(2005: 582,757) exercisable at 1164 pence per share. Options were
granted under the Irish Sharesave Scheme in April 2006 to 229
employees (2005: 145) in respect of a maximum of 86,100 ordinary
shares (2005: 70,878) exercisable at 1164 pence per share. In
November 2005 options were granted under the Wolseley Share
Option Plan 2003 over 4,473,070 ordinary shares (2005: 4,081,340)
to senior employees of the Group at an option price of 1185 pence
per share. A further award of 111,820 options were granted under the
2003 Plan in January 2006 at an option price of 1281 pence per
share. These schemes are described in more detail on pages 64 to
68. Details of the total options outstanding at 31 July 2006 are set out
in note 29 to the financial statements. Details of the cash awards
under the 2001 Long Term Performance Related Incentive Scheme
for Mr Banks and the cash and share awards under the Wolseley plc
2002 Long Term Incentive Scheme are set out on page 64.
Employee policies and involvement
The Group places particular importance on the involvement of 
its employees, keeping them regularly informed through informal
bulletins, such as “Directions” and other in-house publications,
meetings and the Company’s internal website, on matters affecting
them as employees and on the issues affecting their performance. 
A European Works Council has been operating since 1996 to provide
a forum for dialogue and consultation with employees on significant
developments in the Group’s operations, management’s plans and
expectations, organisational changes within the Group and for
employee representatives to consult management about concerns
over any aspect of the Group’s operations. At the date of this Report,
there are 25 members comprising 14 employee representatives
nominated from among employees from each European company
with the balance being Company appointees.
Permanent UK employees are usually invited to join the Company’s
pension arrangements which include defined contribution and 
defined benefit pension schemes. The principal UK scheme has one
corporate and two individual trustees. The Chairman of the trustees 
is David Tucker and, save for an independent trustee, all of the other
trustees are UK-based employees or former employees of the Group.
The other main UK scheme provides benefits for employees of the
recently acquired William Wilson Group and has five trustees. The
Chairman of the trustees is Ian Percy CBE and all of the other trustees
are UK-based employees of the William Wilson Group or of the
Company. Permanent employees outside the UK are usually offered
membership of their employing companies’ pension arrangements.
Employees are offered a range of benefits depending on the local
environment, such as private medical cover. Employees are encouraged
to become shareholders in the Company, where possible, through
participation in the Company’s share schemes. Priority is given to the
training of employees and the development of their skills is of prime
importance. Employment of disabled people is considered on merit
with regard only to the ability of any applicant to carry out the 
function required. Arrangements to enable disabled people to carry
out the function required will be made if it is reasonable to do so. 
An employee becoming disabled would, where appropriate, be
offered retraining. The Group continues to operate on a highly
decentralised basis. This provides the maximum encouragement 
for the development of entrepreneurial flair, balanced by a rigorous
control framework exercised by a small head office team. Local
managements are responsible for maintaining high standards of 
health and safety and for ensuring that there is appropriate employee
involvement in decision-making.
Creditor payment policy
All Group companies are responsible for establishing terms and
conditions of trading with their suppliers. It is the Group’s policy 
that payments to suppliers are made within agreed terms and are,
where applicable, consistent with the UK Government-backed Better
Payment Practice Code. Copies of this Code can be obtained from
the Group Company Secretary at the Company’s registered office. 
At 31 July 2006 the Company had no trade creditors (2005: nil). 
The amount of trade creditors for the Group as at 31 July 2006 
was equivalent to 52 days (2005: 55 days) of trade purchases.
Shareholder services
Shareview is a service offered by our registrars, Lloyds TSB Registrars,
which allows shareholders on-line access to a range of shareholder
information. Shareview provides access to details of shareholdings 
in the Company and practical help on transferring shares or updating
personal details. It also allows shareholders to choose to receive
shareholder communications electronically, rather than by post. To
register, shareholders simply need to log on to www.shareview.co.uk
with their shareholder reference number, which is shown on the form
of proxy sent to all shareholders with this Report. First time users will
need to enter certain information and choose a Personal Identification
Number before they are able to access their shareholding details. 
Shareview dealing is also available to UK-based shareholders. 
This is a simple and convenient telephone and Internet share
purchase and sale service offered by the Registrars. For telephone
purchases and sales call 0870 850 0852 between 8.30am and
4.30pm, Monday to Friday. For Internet purchases and sales, log 
on to www.shareview.co.uk/dealing. A postal dealing service is also
available from Lloyds TSB Registrars and a form, together with terms
and conditions, can be obtained by calling 0870 242 4244.

Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors are required by UK company law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European
Union to prepare financial statements for each financial period which
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the
Group and of the profit or loss for that period.
The Directors consider that, in preparing the accounts, appropriate
accounting policies have been used and applied consistently, supported
by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates; they have
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European
Union and on the going concern basis. Applicable UK accounting
standards have also been applied.
The Directors are also responsible for maintaining adequate accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position 
of the Company and the Group, which enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the UK Companies Act 1985
and Article 4 of the International Auditing Standards Regulation.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the wolseley.com
website. The work carried out by the auditors does not involve
consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept 
no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the 
financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
the financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company
and the Group and to prevent and detect fraud or other irregularities.
The Directors, having prepared the financial statements, have permitted
the auditors to take whatever steps and undertake whatever inspections
they consider to be appropriate for the purpose of enabling them to
give their audit opinion.

Including the statement of remuneration policy for the year ended 31 July 2006
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
62 Remuneration report
The Board sets the Company’s remuneration policy. The remuneration
committee (“the Committee”) makes recommendations to the Board,
within its agreed terms of reference (available on the Company’s
website, www.wolseley.com) on the Company’s framework of
executive remuneration and its cost. It also determines, on behalf of
the Board, specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive
Directors and for the Chairman. The Committee recommends 
and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior
management who report to the Group Chief Executive and whose
roles have a significant influence within the Group’s business to meet
its strategic objectives. The Board itself determines the remuneration
of the Non Executive Directors. The Committee also administers the
Company’s share incentive schemes for employees. The current
members of the Committee, all of whom are independent Non
Executive Directors within the definition set out in the Code (and the
Revised Code), are set out on page 57 and the Company Secretary
acts as its secretary. The Committee has access to detailed external
research on market data and trends from independent and
experienced consultants. The Committee has, since March 2003,
sought external advice from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP , who
also provided certain pensions advice to the Company and has in 
the past also been provided with advice by Mercer Human Resource
Consulting in the USA. The Group Chief Executive, the Chairman and
the Director of Human Resources, Peter Buckingham, are normally
invited to attend the meetings of the Committee to respond to 
specific questions raised by members of the Committee. This
specifically excludes such matters concerning the details of their 
own personal remuneration.
The Company has followed the provisions of Schedules A and B of
the Code (and the Revised Code) and has complied with the relevant
provisions of the Companies Act 1985, as amended by the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The Directors’ report on remuneration has been approved by
shareholders at each of the Annual General Meetings held since 
2003. Shareholders will again be invited to approve this report 
at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 29 November 2006. 
With the exception of the description of the performance bonus
arrangements, service agreement details, performance graph,
disclosure of remuneration to other senior executives, executive 
share ownership and external directorships, the information set out 
on pages 63 to 70 of this report represents the auditable disclosures
referred to in the Auditors’ report on page 130 as specified by the UK
Listing Authority and under Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.
Policy on remuneration of Executive Directors
The Company’s policy now and for the future, is to provide
remuneration packages that fairly reward executives for the
contribution they make to the business, having regard to the size and
complexity of the Group’s operations and the need to attract, retain
and motivate executives of the highest quality. Remuneration packages
comprise competitive salary, performance bonuses, share options,
long-term incentives, benefits in kind and pensions. The Company
takes a total approach to remuneration, which includes all these
elements. None of the long-term awards or options are pensionable.
The packages, which link corporate and individual performance with
an appropriate balance between short and long-term elements, are
designed to be broadly comparable with those offered by other similar
international businesses and reflect competitive practices in the
countries and markets in which the Executive Directors operate. 
The policy is designed to incentivise the Executive Directors to meet
the Company’s financial and strategic objectives, such that a significant
proportion of total remuneration is performance related. The Committee
considers that the targets set for the different elements of performance
related remuneration are appropriate and demanding in the context 
of the Company’s trading environment and the business challenges 
it faces. The following chart shows the average proportions of salary,
target bonus and the estimated value of long-term incentives granted
during the financial year to Executive Directors in office at the date of
this Report:
Salaries
Basic salaries are determined having regard to competitive market 
data, the degree of individual responsibility and individual performance.
Market data is derived from a group of companies selected on the 
basis of comparable size, geographic spread and business focus. Due
consideration is also given to the wider economic and employment
backdrop, including general pay and employment conditions elsewhere 
in the Group. The target salary is at the median, with the opportunity to 
go above this level, subject to sustained individual performance. The
Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors with effect
from 1 August 2005, having sought the views of both the Chairman and
(other than in the case of his own salary) Mr Banks, the Group Chief
Executive in office at that time. As a US national, 40% of Mr Banks’ 
salary was currency protected, based on an exchange rate of £1: $1.50.
Mr Hornsby will not benefit from such currency protection arrangements.

Benefits in kind
These principally comprise car benefits, life assurance, healthcare
insurance and, in the case of Messrs Banks, Hornsby, Marchbank and
Webster, relocation and housing allowances following their relocations
from the USA to the UK (Messrs Banks, Hornsby and Marchbank) and
from Droitwich to Theale (Mr Webster), where the Company’s head
office is located.
Performance bonuses
Performance bonus arrangements for the Executive Directors are
designed to encourage individual performance, corporate operating
efficiencies and profitable growth. The annual bonus awards are based
on a mix of demanding financial targets, derived from the Company’s
historic performance, annual long-term strategic business plan and
annual budget, as well as market expectations and will depend on
performance against annual targets of return on capital employed,
working capital, Group profit before tax and, where relevant, profit
before tax for the appropriate division (which, in aggregate, account for
85% of the bonus, the majority of which relates to the profit before tax
targets). The balance of 15% of the bonus depends on specific
personal objectives set for each Executive Director.
The following percentages of base salary, which vary between
Executive Directors depending on their particular responsibilities 
and spheres of influence, will be paid in bonus for the year ended 
31 July 2006, subject to the achievement of the minimum, on-target
and maximum levels of performance (with the percentages increasing
on a linear basis for achievement between each level):

F W Roach 80 110 140 127.00
S P Webster 40 70 100 87.25
Stretching targets are set for each element of the bonus, determined
by the Committee each year, which also considers the levels of
performance targets to be achieved for bonus payments to be 
made in the succeeding year. For the year ending 31 July 2007, 
the Committee has determined that there will be no change from
2006 for the minimum, on-target and maximum targets which 
will be 80/130/180% for Mr Hornsby, 80/120/160% for Mr Hord,
80/110/140% for Mr Roach and 40/70/100% for Messrs Marchbank 
and Webster.

Service agreements
All service agreements with Executive Directors are subject to 
a maximum of 12 months’ notice of termination if given by the
Company and six months’ notice of termination if given by the
Executive Director. Such notice periods reflect current market practice
and the balance that should be struck between providing contractual
protection to the Directors that is fair and the interests of our shareholders.
The date of each service agreement and the year in which each
Director was last elected or re-elected are noted in the table opposite.
There are no provisions in any service agreement for early termination
payments and, in the event of early termination of any service agreement,
the Committee will take a robust view of the mitigation, which should
be taken into account when computing any compensation payable.

Long-term incentives
The Company currently operates a long-term incentive plan which
provides ordinary shares in the capital of the Company, conditional
upon the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) over single 
three-year periods. All awards are made subject to the achievement 
of stretching performance conditions and TSR has been selected 
as the performance measure to more closely align the interests of the
Executive Directors and senior executives with those of shareholders
over the long term. The plan rewards the relative out-performance 
of the Company against a defined list of comparator companies.
Calculations are performed independently and are approved by 
the Committee.
The long-term incentive plan is discretionary. The Committee’s 
current policy is to make annual awards to the Group Chief Executive,
Executive Directors and other senior executives under the Wolseley plc
2002 Long Term Incentive Scheme (“2002 Scheme”), which was
approved by shareholders in December 2002 and amended at the
Annual General Meeting held on 18 November 2004. Prior to this date
only cash awards were made. Since 2004, awards will normally be
made in shares, save where there are material securities or tax law
constraints in overseas jurisdictions where the scheme is to be
operated, in which case conditional awards in cash would continue 
to be made.
Details of the awards conditionally made to the Executive Directors 
in office during the year under the amended 2002 Scheme and
outstanding at 31 July 2006, as well as at the date of this Report, 
are shown in the table below.
WO40006_R&A 2006_52-71  10/10/06  8:50 pm  Page 64 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
65 Remuneration report
The maximum amount that can be granted under the amended 2002
Scheme for each award is 200% of base salary per annum; however
awards made to date have not exceeded 125% (or 150% in the case
of the Group Chief Executive) of base salary. Each year the Committee
assesses the proportion of awards that should be made up of both
share options and long-term incentive awards. It is the Committee’s
intention that for the year ending 31 July 2007, awards are made 
to the Group Chief Executive over 150% of salary with lower award
levels for other Executive Directors. The vesting level for a maximum
award under the amended 2002 Scheme requires performance to 
be in the upper decile. To better reflect market practice, shareholder
approval was sought and received on 18 November 2004 so that
25% of awards made from that date would vest for achievement 
of performance at the median (with a straight line percentage to vest
between median and upper decile). Extant awards remain subject to the
achievement of performance conditions following a participant’s agreed
retirement and vesting is determined at the end of the performance period.
The following table sets out the percentage of each award which has
vested and the percentage of each extant award, had it vested on 
31 July 2006:
Percentage vested on maturity or indicative vesting percentage
Year of award based on performance as at 31 July 2006
2001 100% (vested 31 July 2004)
2002 100% (vested 31 July 2005)
2003 34.5% (vested 31 July 2006)
2004 45% (performance after 24 months)
2005 0% (performance after 12 months)
During the year, the Committee reviewed whether future grants 
under the amended 2002 Scheme should be subject to a financial
performance underpin, in addition to the satisfaction of a TSR
performance target. The Committee has decided that future awards
under the amended 2002 Scheme may, if deemed appropriate, be
subject to performance criteria in addition to the current TSR targets.
The factors which would demonstrate a significant influence to their
decision include: a substantial drop in the Company’s share price; 
the presence of significant bid speculation in the sector; the adoption
of weaker targets for the TSR condition; or, a significant change 
in policy away from granting options to granting only long-term
incentive awards. The Committee will continue to monitor whether
circumstances warrant the imposition of such additional criteria. 
The Committee decided that for the 2005 award, the continuing use
of EPS as a performance target under the Wolseley Share Option
Plan 2003 and the use of financial measures for the annual bonus
plan provided an appropriate balance to the use of TSR within the
amended 2002 Scheme. 
The lists of comparator companies for awards made since 2001
under the 2001 cash plan (a plan introduced to facilitate Mr Banks’
recruitment which is similar in structure to the 2002 Scheme) and,
since 2002, under the 2002 Scheme are based upon the constituent
members of the FTSE 100 as at the respective dates of grant,
excluding banks, telecommunications, IT and utility companies but
together with CRH plc and Travis Perkins plc, which compete in the
same sector as the Company. A similar group of companies will be
selected for the 2006 awards under the amended 2002 Scheme.
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company’s TSR performance against
the performance of the FTSE 100 Index over the five-year period 
to 31 July 2006. The FTSE 100 Index has been chosen as being 
a broad equity market index consisting of companies comparable 
in size and complexity to Wolseley.

Share options
The Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 (“2003 Plan”) received shareholder
approval at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2003.
Consequently, no further options will be granted under the Executive
Share Option Scheme 1984 (“1984 Scheme”) nor under the Executive
Share Option Scheme 1989 (“1989 Scheme”) which are now closed.
No options under any such scheme have or will be granted at a
discount to the relevant middle market price at the time of grant 
and no option under any such scheme can be exercised unless
performance conditions have been satisfied. 
All employees and Executive Directors of the Company, its
subsidiaries and joint ventures, are eligible to participate in the 2003
Plan. Participants are selected by the Committee at its discretion. 
The Committee considers annually the levels of grant, which are
phased over time and they determine the size of each award at the
time of grant based on individual performance, the ability of each
individual to contribute to the achievement of the performance
conditions and market levels of remuneration. Awards may not
exceed an amount equal to three times base salary for UK and 
other European-based executives and five times salary for US-based
executives although the Committee may, as it so determines, 
also use the higher limit in exceptional circumstances. It is the
Committee’s intention that for the year ending 31 July 2007, awards
will not exceed 225% of base salary (or 300% in the case of the US
Executive Directors). 
No options may be granted more than 10 years after the date on
which the 2003 Plan was approved by the Company’s shareholders
and the Committee will formally review the 2003 Plan by no later than
November 2008.

The Company monitors the awards made under the various employee
and discretionary share plans, which it operates, in relation to their
effect on dilution limits. Options are either satisfied by the issue of new
shares or shares purchased in the market (including treasury shares).
The number of new shares, as recommended by the Association of
British Insurers (“ABI”), that may be issued to satisfy options granted
under the 2003 Plan or any other employee share scheme is restricted
to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company over 
any rolling 10 years. Further, as set out in the ABI principles and
guidelines, the number of new shares that may be issued to satisfy
options granted under the 2003 Plan or any other discretionary share
scheme is restricted to 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of 
the Company over any rolling 10 years. In addition, for US-based
participants, the 2003 Plan will be restricted such that the aggregate
number of shares for which options may be granted to such
participants during the life of the 2003 Plan will not exceed 5% of 
the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at the date the
2003 Plan was approved by shareholders.
By 31 July 2006, awards had been granted resulting in shares being
issued or capable of being issued during the preceding 10 years
under all of the Company’s employee share plans representing some
6.72% of the issued ordinary share capital at that date (3.70% of the
issued ordinary share capital under the Company’s discretionary 
share plans). 
The extent to which the options will be capable of exercise depends
on the satisfaction of a performance condition. The performance
condition is based on the growth above UK inflation of the 
Company’s earnings per share (“EPS”), before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items measured from the year ended immediately
prior to grant.
For all grants made under the 2003 Plan on or after 25 November
2004 there is a single three-year performance period and, in the event
that the performance conditions are not fully met on the third anniversary
of the date of grant, the options will lapse.
The performance condition for options now granted under the 2003
Plan operates on the following sliding scale:
Multiple of salary worth of shares under option Total margin over UK inflation after 3 years
First 100% of salary 9%
Second 100% of salary 12%
Next 50% of salary 15%
Greater than 250% of salary 15% to 21%
The performance of the Company is initially measured over three
financial years, starting with the financial year in which the option 
grant takes place. For awards granted in 2003, to the extent that the
performance target is not fully met at the end of the initial three-year
period, a subsequent retest on the fourth anniversary of grant can be
undertaken, but from the same performance-related base prevailing 
at the time the awards were made and with prorated targets for EPS
growth. Should the performance target not be met on this subsequent
date, the option will lapse.
Provided the performance condition has been satisfied an option 
may be exercised at any time until it lapses, 10 years from the date 
of grant. No amount is payable on the award of an option. 
The Committee can set different EPS targets from those described
above for future options, provided that the new conditions are no less
challenging in the circumstances than the initial ones. Similarly, the
Committee can vary the terms of existing options to take account of
technical changes, for example, changes in accounting standards.
The amended target will be materially no less challenging as a result
of any such change. The Committee continues to believe that the
EPS condition is appropriate for share options, as it requires
substantial improvement in the Company’s underlying financial
performance and complements the inherent requirement for share
price growth for an option to have value.
Following the introduction of International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”), the Group now reports results on this new 
basis. EPS calculated under the IFRS basis will be utilised to measure
performance in respect of options granted since 2005 but EPS and,
to the extent required, return on capital employed, will be calculated
on as near a UK GAAP basis as possible in respect of options
granted prior to 2005 under which performance is still required 
to be measured in order to assess whether options have vested.

Notes:
(a) The highest mid-market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year was 1462 pence 
and the lowest was 1079 pence. The year-end price was 1140 pence.
(b) The performance conditions for options granted under the 1984 and 1989 Schemes between 
May 1994 and December 1996 are that they may not be exercised unless the growth in earnings 
per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds the growth in the UK Retail
Prices Index over the same period by at least 6%. Options granted in, and subsequent to, December
1997 may not be exercised unless growth in earnings per share over a period of three consecutive
financial years exceeds growth in the UK Retail Prices Index over the same period by at least 9%. 
The number of options exercisable for Executive Directors under the 1984 and 1989 Schemes are, 
in addition, determined by the return on capital employed achieved over the same rolling three-year
period. For options granted in 1997 and 1998, achieving a return on capital employed of 15% per
annum will enable 50% of options granted to become exercisable, rising on a sliding scale to 100%
for achieving a return on capital employed of 20% or more. With effect from October 1999 the return
on capital employed required to permit exercise of 100% of options granted was reduced from 20%
to 17.5% and the sliding scale was adjusted accordingly.
(c) Performance targets not yet met.
WO40006_R&A 2006_52-71  10/10/06  8:50 pm  Page 67 Savings related share option schemes
The UK- and US-based Executive Directors may, along with all eligible
employees, also participate in the UK Savings Related Share Option
Scheme (“SRSOS”) and the Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
respectively. Under the SRSOS, participants who enter into a savings
contract for three, five or seven years, to a maximum level of £250 
per month, are granted options to subscribe for shares in the
Company. Under the ESPP , a US Code 423 Plan, US participants
may enter into a one-year savings contract to a maximum level of
$400 per month. The Board may determine that the options granted
under either scheme may be granted at a discount. The maximum
discount, as applied to the 2006 awards, is 20% for the SRSOS and
15% for the ESPP of the average market prices used to determine the
price of the award. The following table sets out the number of share
options held under the SRSOS and ESPP by the Executive Directors.

69 Remuneration report
Pensions
Mr Webster, as a UK Executive Director, participates in the Wolseley
Group Retirement Benefits Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan is a defined
benefit scheme and provides benefits based on final pensionable
salaries. The Company makes contributions to the Plan based on 
the recommendation of the Plan actuary. Bonuses payable to UK
Executive Directors are not pensionable. Mr Webster currently
contributes 7% per annum of his pensionable salary to the Plan. 
The Finance Act 1989 introduced an earnings cap (the “Cap”) for
employees joining the Plan after 31 May 1989. This has the effect 
of limiting the amount of an employee’s salary that can be pensioned
through a tax approved pension scheme. A Plan specific earnings cap
was introduced from 6 April 2006 when the Cap was prospectively
abolished. The current Plan specific limit, to which Mr Webster is
subject, is £107,400 per annum. The Company has agreed to provide
Mr Webster with benefits which are broadly comparable with those
that would have applied under the Plan had the Cap not been
introduced. This was, until 6 April 2006, provided for by payments 
into a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme (“FURBS”). 
The Committee approved the Company’s approach in response to
the UK pensions simplification, which became effective on 6 April
2006 for those Executive Directors who are, or will become, members
of the UK approved pension plan. Such Directors have the option 
of either maintaining the existing pension promise, in which case the
executive would be responsible for any additional taxation arising; 
or ceasing to accrue pension benefit above the lifetime allowance in
respect of service from 6 April 2006 and instead, receiving a cash
retirement benefit allowance, subject to income taxation consistent
with the Company’s cost neutral objective. The Company will not
compensate Board members for any change in their personal tax
liability. Mr Webster elected to cease to accrue pension benefit above
the lifetime allowance in the Plan and to receive a cash retirement
allowance in respect of the excess and in respect of prior underfunding
of the FURBS.
Past service benefit would remain linked to future salary increases
subject to a cap similar to the existing Cap.
Additionally, the Finance Act 1989 capped life assurance payable
through an approved pension scheme in respect of such executives.
The Company has taken out an insurance policy to cover that part 
of the life assurance for Mr Webster which is in excess of the Cap.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account during the year 
in respect of his future obligation was £2,988 (2005: £66,812). 
Messrs Banks, Hornsby, Marchbank and Roach, who are US citizens,
participate in the defined contribution pension arrangements of
Ferguson Enterprises, Inc. In line with US practice, Messrs Banks,
Hornsby and Marchbank received contributions at the level of 15% 
of their earnings (for this purpose $420,000 for Mr Banks and
$400,000 for Messrs Hornsby, Marchbank and Roach of bonus 
was included with base salary). Bonus ceased to be included 
in the calculation of pension contributions from 1 August 2006.
Contributions will increase (but will be limited to base salary) to 20%
for Mr Hornsby and to 23% for Messrs Marchbank and Roach.
Mr Hord, also a US citizen, participates in the defined benefit and
defined contribution plans of Stock Building Supply, Inc. Mr Hord’s
pensionable earnings include his bonus up to a maximum of
$742,400 as agreed when the bonus scheme was introduced in order
to preserve his pension entitlement at that time. Mr Hord is also a
member of a US non-qualified plan, which will provide a benefit for 
20 years after retirement at age 60 of 40% of final pensionable salary.
At Mr Hord’s choice and with Company consent, the benefit can be
paid over a period of 1, 5, 10 or 15 years with the total amount of the
benefit, in cash terms, being the same. 
The following table shows those Executive Directors participating in
money purchase pension plans and the cost of the Group’s

*Mr Roach was appointed to the Board on 16 December 2005.
A US subsidiary undertaking has a commitment to a former Director,
who is a US citizen, to pay a joint survivor pension of $300,000 per
annum for 15 years from 1 August 1993. The net present value of 
the future obligation at 31 July 2006 was £298,000 (2005: £460,110),
which has been charged in prior years’ accounts.
Additionally, Brossette, a French subsidiary undertaking, has a
commitment to a former Director, who is a French citizen, to pay 
an annual pension of a221,833 (2005: a215,392), with a widow’s
entitlement of 60%, subject to an annual increase based on the
agreed French pension index. The full actuarial cost of this arrangement
was provided in previous years as part of Brossette’s ongoing pension
obligations. The Company is guarantor of this future pension
commitment which at 31 July 2006 was approximately £2.3 million
(2005: £1.9 million).
The following table shows the Executive Directors in office on 31 July
2006 who participated during the year in the Group’s defined benefits
plans and the amounts of benefit accrued at the end of the year as if
the Director had left service on 31 July 2006, the change in accrued
benefit over the year, the transfer value at both the beginning and end
of the year as well as the change in the transfer value over the year 
as required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The increase in transfer value figures represents an obligation on the
pension fund or the Company – they are not sums due or paid to 
the Director. The Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority require
additional disclosure of the change in accrued benefit net of inflation
and the transfer value of this change. These pension liabilities are
calculated using the cash equivalent transfer value method prescribed
in the Listing Rules.

As previously noted Mr Webster elected, with effect from 6 April 2006, to cease to accrue pension benefit above the lifetime allowance in the Plan and to receive a cash retirement allowance in respect of the excess and in
respect of prior underfunding of the FURBS, which became a defined contribution arrangement from the same date. The figures shown in the table above reflect this change and show the information required under the
Listing Rules and under the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 in respect of that part of his arrangements that continue to accrue pension on a defined benefit basis notwithstanding the changes that
came into effect from 6 April 2006. The figure of £70,000 included in the column headed “pension/life assurance” in the emoluments table on page 63 includes £23,117 in respect of the cash retirement allowance
payable with effect from 6 April 2006.
Policy on remuneration of Non Executive Directors
The remuneration of Non Executive Directors during the year under
review was made up of a basic fee and an additional fee where a 
Non Executive Director acts as Chairman of either the audit or
remuneration committees and for the Director nominated as Senior
Independent Non Executive Director. Fees are reviewed from time 
to time by the Board. The Non Executive Directors have letters of
engagement rather than service contracts and do not participate 
in any incentive plan, nor is any pension payable in respect of their
services as Non Executive Directors. The Board’s policy is that Non
Executive Directors are normally appointed for an initial term of three
years, which is then reviewed and extended for a further three-year
period. Appointments may, however, be terminated upon six months’
notice. There are no provisions for compensation in the event of
termination. The terms and conditions of appointment of the Non
Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s
registered office during normal business hours and at the Annual
General Meeting.
The Board of Directors of Wolseley plc has approved this
Remuneration report.
On behalf of the Board
Andrew J Duff
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
25 September 2006
External directorships
Executive Directors are encouraged to take on not more than one
external Non Executive Directorship on a non-competitor board, 
as the Committee believes there are significant benefits to be
achieved to both the Company and the individual. In order to avoid
any conflict of interest, all appointments are subject to the Board’s
approval. Executive Directors may retain payments received in respect
of these appointments. Mr Banks is a Non Executive Director of
Bunzl plc and of TowneBank/Peninsula (formerly Harbor Bank), for
which the annual rate of his fees is respectively £56,500 and $600
per meeting attended. Mr Banks attended one meeting of the
Board of TowneBank/Peninsula during the year (2005: £56,000 and
$0). Mr Hornsby is a Non Executive Director of Virginia Company
Bank for which he received 3,000 stock options at $10 each on
appointment. Mr Hord is a Non Executive Director of Investors
Management Corporation for which the annual rate of his fees is
$22,000 (2005: $18,000). Mr Webster is a Non Executive Director
of Bradford and Bingley plc, for which the annual rate of his fees 
is £60,000 (2005: £60,000).
Executive share ownership
A share ownership programme was introduced with effect from 
1 August 2004. It is designed to encourage all Directors and
members of the Executive Committee to build up a shareholding
with a value of 1.5 times annual base salary for the Group Chief
Executive; 1 times annual base salary for all Executive Directors; 
1 times annual fees for all Non Executive Directors, including 
the Chairman; and 0.5 times annual base salary for all Executive
Committee members. For Executive Directors and members of 
the Executive Committee this may be achieved by retaining shares
received as a result of participating in a Company employee share
plan (other than the shares sold to finance option exercises, 
or to pay a National Insurance or income tax liability or overseas
equivalent). The programme specifically excludes the need for
executives to make a personal investment should awards not vest.
Normally these levels of shareholding should be expected to be
achieved within three to five years from the time the individual is
included in the programme. The Committee reviewed and noted 
the progress which has been made towards meeting these targets
during the year. Directors’ current shareholdings are set out on
page 53.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
75 Group accounting policies
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)
as adopted by the European Union, including interpretations issued by
the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and its committees
and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to
companies reporting under IFRS. The disclosures required by IFRS 1,
“First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards”
concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 45.
The date of transition to IFRS is 1 August 2004.
A summary of the principal accounting policies applied by the Group in
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is set out below.
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the
historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available
for sale investments and financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
First-time adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards
IFRS 1, “First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards” sets out the procedures that the Group must follow 
when it adopts IFRS for the first time as the basis for preparing its
consolidated financial statements. The Group is required to establish
its IFRS accounting policies as at 31 July 2006 and, in general, apply
these retrospectively to determine the IFRS opening balance sheet at
its date of transition, 1 August 2004.
Certain optional exemptions to this general principle are available
under IFRS 1 and the significant first-time adoption choices made by
the Group are as follows:
• The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to
business combinations that took place before 1 August 2004. 
As a result, in the IFRS opening balance sheet, goodwill arising 
from past business combinations of £666 million remains as stated
under UK GAAP at that date.
• The Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains
and losses in relation to post employment defined benefit schemes
at the date of transition. In addition, the Group has elected to
recognise actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which
they occur in a statement of recognised income and expense.
• The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2, “Share Based Payment”
only to equity-settled awards that had not vested as at 1 August
2004 and were granted on or after 7 November 2002 and 
cash-settled awards that had not vested as at 1 August 2004.
• The Group has elected to reset the foreign currency translation
reserve to zero at 1 August 2004. Going forward, IFRS requires
amounts taken to reserves on the retranslation of foreign
subsidiaries to be recorded in a separate foreign currency
translation reserve and be included in the future calculation 
of profit or loss on sale of the subsidiary. 
• The Group has elected to implement IAS 39, “Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement” and IAS 32, “Financial Instruments:
Disclosure and Presentation” at its date of transition, 1 August 2004
and apply hedge accounting where the requirements of IAS 39 
are met.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial information includes the results of the parent
Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 July 2006.
The trading results of businesses acquired, sold or discontinued during
the year are included in profit on ordinary activities from the date 
of effective acquisition or up to the date of sale or discontinuance.
Intra-group transactions and balances and any unrealised gains 
and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated 
on consolidation.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s
subsidiary undertakings are measured using the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the subsidiary undertaking operates
(the “functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are
presented in sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group
and the functional currency of the parent Company.
The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated
into sterling using average rates of exchange ruling during the relevant
financial period.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated
into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the period end.
Exchange differences arising between the translation into sterling of
the net assets of these subsidiary undertakings at rates ruling at the
beginning and end of the year are recognised in the currency
translation reserve as are exchange differences on foreign currency
borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide 
a hedge against foreign currency net assets.
Changes in the fair value and the final settlement value of derivative
financial instruments, entered into to hedge foreign currency net
assets and that satisfy the hedging conditions of IAS 39, are
recognised in the currency translation reserve (see the separate
accounting policy on derivative financial instruments).
In the event that an overseas subsidiary undertaking is sold, the 
gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement is
determined after taking into account the cumulative currency
translation differences that are attributable to the subsidiary
undertaking concerned. As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has
elected to deem the cumulative currency translation differences of 
the Group to be £nil as at 1 August 2004. As a result the gain or loss
on disposal of an overseas subsidiary undertaking does not include
currency translation differences arising before 1 August 2004.
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of
the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance
sheet date. All currency translation differences are taken to the income
statement with the exception of differences on foreign currency
borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide 
a hedge against foreign currency net assets as detailed above.

76 Group accounting policies
Revenue
Revenue is the amount receivable for the provision of goods and
services falling within the Group’s ordinary activities, excluding intra-
group sales, estimated and actual sales returns, trade and early
settlement discounts, value added tax and similar sales taxes.
Revenue from the provision of goods is recognised when the risks
and rewards of ownership of goods have been transferred to the
customer. The risks and rewards of ownership of goods are deemed
to have been transferred when the goods are shipped to, or are
picked up by, the customer.
Revenue from services, other than those that arise from construction
service contracts (see below), are recognised when the service
provided to the customer has been completed.
Revenue in respect of construction service contracts, where the
Group is providing framing lumber installation services to residential
property companies, is recognised using the percentage of completion
method, with the percentage complete being determined by
comparing the percentage of costs incurred to date with the
estimated total costs of the contract. Losses on these contracts, 
if any, are recognised in the period when such losses become
probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Revenue from the provision of goods and all services is only
recognised when the amounts to be recognised are fixed or
determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
Vendor rebates
The Group enters into arrangements with certain vendors providing 
for inventory purchase rebates. These purchase rebates are accrued
as earned and are recorded initially as a reduction in inventory with a
subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold.
Business combinations
The Group has applied the purchase method in its accounting for 
the acquisition of subsidiaries.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3
“Business Combinations” to acquisitions of subsidiaries that were
recognised before 1 August 2004 and as a result the carrying amount
of goodwill recognised as an asset under UK GAAP has been brought
forward unadjusted as the cost of goodwill recognised under IFRS as
at 1 August 2004. IFRS 3 has been applied with effect from 1 August
2004 and goodwill amortisation ceased from that date.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets
given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed 
at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the
acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at
their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any
minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s
share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group’s share
of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is
recognised directly in the income statement.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over 
the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets 
of the acquired subsidiary undertaking at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiary undertakings is included in
intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and
carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses
on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill
relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of
impairment testing. Each of those cash-generating units represents
the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill 
is monitored for management purposes and are not larger than the
primary or secondary reporting segments determined in accordance
with IAS 14 “Segmental Reporting”.
Other intangible assets
An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset
without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is
probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to
the asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can be measured
reliably. The asset is deemed to be identifiable when it is separable 
or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights.
Intangible assets, primarily brands, trade names and customer
relationships, acquired as part of a business combination are
capitalised separately from goodwill and are carried at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is calculated using the reducing balance method for
customer relationships and the straight-line method for other 
intangible assets. The cost of the intangible assets is amortised over
their estimated useful lives, which can range from less than a year 
to 25 years, depending on the nature of the intangible asset.
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant
and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset and 
is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated
impairment losses. Costs include software licences, consulting costs
attributable to the development, design and implementation of the
computer software and internal costs directly attributable to the
development, design and implementation of the computer software.
Costs in respect of training and data conversion are expensed as
incurred. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method 
so as to charge the cost of the computer software to the income
statement over its estimated useful life (3-5 years).

77 Group accounting policies
Property, plant and equipment (“PPE”)
PPE is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses, except for land and assets in the
course of construction, which are not depreciated and are carried at
cost less accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure
that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. In addition,
subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is
probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will
flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income
statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to
allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated
useful life, as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leaseholds 35–50 years
Short leaseholds over the period of the
lease
Plant and machinery 7–10 years
Fixtures and fittings 5–7 years
Computers 3–5 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
The residual values and useful lives of PPE are reviewed and adjusted
if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs attributable to assets under construction are charged
to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Leased assets
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have
transferred to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet and
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives. The
asset is recorded at the lower of its fair value and the present value of
the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease. The capital
elements of future obligations under finance leases are included in
liabilities in the balance sheet and analysed between current and 
non-current amounts.The interest elements of future obligations under
finance leases are charged to the income statement over the periods
of the leases and represent a constant proportion of the balance of
capital repayments outstanding in accordance with the effective
interest rate method.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership are classified as operating leases. The cost of operating
leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) is charged 
to the income statement on a straight line basis over the periods 
of the leases.
Assets held for sale
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be
recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the business. For
this to be the case, the asset must be available for immediate sale in
its present condition, management must be committed to and have
initiated a plan to sell the asset which, when initiated, was expected
to result in a completed sale within 12 months. Assets that are
classified as held for sale are not depreciated and are measured 
at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment of assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not
subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and
whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to
amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less
costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there
are separately identifiable cash flows.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or the
average cost method as appropriate to the nature of the transactions
in those items of inventory. The cost of goods purchased for resale
includes import and custom duties, transport and handling costs,
freight and packing costs and other attributable costs less trade
discounts, rebates and other subsidies. It excludes borrowing costs.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Taxation
Current tax represents the expected tax payable (or recoverable) 
on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into
account any adjustments arising from prior years.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary
differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business
combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither
accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been
enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or
the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on
investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of
the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

78 Group accounting policies
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments, in particular, interest rate swaps and
currency swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from
the business activities of the Group and the financing of those
activities. There is no trading activity in derivative financial instruments.
At the inception of a hedging transaction entailing the use of derivative
financial instruments, the Group documents the relationship between
the hedged item and the hedging instrument together with its risk
management objective and the strategy underlying the proposed
transaction. The Group also documents its assessment, both at the
inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing
basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting movements in the
fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities
measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. Where
derivative financial instruments do not fulfil the criteria for hedge
accounting contained in IAS 39, changes in their fair values are
recognised in the income statement.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships
are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net
investment hedges. Where the hedging relationship is classified as a
fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability is
adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the
hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income
statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be
offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. Where
the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net
investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the
fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are
recognised directly in equity rather than in the income statement.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the
accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity are either recycled
to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial
asset, are recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
Pensions and other post retirement benefits
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans and other post
retirement benefits are charged to the income statement as incurred.
For defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits, the
cost is calculated annually using the projected unit credit method and
is recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of
participating employees, in accordance with the recommendations
of independent qualified actuaries. The current service cost of defined
benefit plans is recorded within operating profit. The total expected
return from pension scheme assets less the total interest on pension
scheme liabilities is recorded within finance revenue if a gain and
finance costs if an expense. Past service costs resulting from
enhanced benefits are recorded within operating profit and recognised
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, or immediately if the
benefits have vested. Actuarial gains and losses, which represent
differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan
assets and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are
recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense
in the period in which they occur. The defined benefit liability or asset
recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan
of the present value of the benefit obligation at the balance sheet
date, less any past service costs not yet recognised, less the fair 
value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date. Where a
plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any
unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount
which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction
in future contributions.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and measured
subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method,
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the
original terms of the receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at
call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank
overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the
balance sheet to the extent that there is no right of offset and practice
of net settlement with cash balances.
Share capital
The Company only has one class of shares, ordinary shares, which
are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or
options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net
of tax.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share
capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted from equity
attributable to the company’ s equity holders until the shares are cancelled,
reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold 
or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable
incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included 
in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at cost being the fair value 
of the consideration received net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value being recognised in the income statement over 
the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has 
an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least
12 months after the balance sheet date.

79 Group accounting policies
Investments
The Group classifies its investments in the following categories:
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and
receivables; held-to-maturity investments; and available-for-sale
financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for 
which the investments were acquired. Management determines the
classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates
this designation at every reporting date.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
This category comprises financial assets held for trading which have
been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term.
Derivatives also fall within this category unless they are designated as
hedges and the hedge is effective for accounting purposes. Assets in
this category are classified as current.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
and with no intention of trading. They are included in current assets,
except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance 
sheet date, which are classified as non-current assets. Loans 
and receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the 
balance sheet.
(c) Held-to-maturity investments
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with
fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Group’s
management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.
They are included in non-current assets unless the investment is due
to mature within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
(d) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets
that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of
the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless
management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months
of the balance sheet date.
Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs
for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows
from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the
Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and
receivables and held-to-maturity investments are subsequently carried
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Realised and
unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of
the “Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss” category are
included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of
non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised
in equity. When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or
impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the
income statement as gains and losses from investment securities.
Provisions
Provisions for environmental restoration, restructuring costs and
legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than
not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation
and the amount can be reliably estimated. Such provisions are
measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the
expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance
sheet date. The discount rate used to determine the present value
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions for insurance represent an estimate, based on historical
experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims and
claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet.
Share-based payments
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s
executive share option, long-term incentive and share purchase
schemes. The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect
of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the awards,
measured using Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation
methodologies. For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is
determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured
unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
For cash-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of
grant and is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the liability
is settled. Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made
to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period
due to the failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market
performance conditions.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has applied IFRS 2 “Share-based
Payment” retrospectively only to equity-settled awards that had
not vested as at 1 August 2004 and were granted on or after
7 November 2002 and cash-settled awards that had not vested
as at 1 August 2004.
Dividends payable
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Group’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the
shareholders of the Company (generally in the case of the final
dividend) or paid (in the case of interim dividends).

80 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS
requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain
circumstances that affect reported amounts. The most sensitive
estimates affecting the financial statements are in the areas of
assessing the recoverability of receivables, the net realisable value of
inventory, the impairment of goodwill and long-lived intangible assets,
the reserves in respect of self-insured insurance, the consideration
received from vendors and pensions and other post-retirement benefits.
Allowance for doubtful accounts
Provision is made against accounts that in the estimation of
management may be impaired. Within each of the businesses
assessment is made locally of the recoverability of accounts
receivable based on a range of factors including the age of the
receivable and the creditworthiness of the customer. The provision 
is assessed monthly with a detailed formal review of balances and
security being conducted at the full year and half year. Determining
the recoverability of an account involves estimation as to the likely
financial condition of the customer and their ability to subsequently
make payment. If the Group is cautious as to the financial condition 
of the customer the Group may provide for accounts that are
subsequently recovered. Similarly if the Group is optimistic as to 
the financial condition of the customer the Group may not provide 
for an account that is subsequently determined to be irrecoverable.
Furthermore, while the Group has a large geographically dispersed
customer base, a slowdown in the markets in which the Group
operates may result in higher than expected uncollectable amounts
and therefore higher (or lower) than anticipated charges for irrecoverable
receivables. In recent years the Group has not experienced significant
variation in the amount charged to the income statement in respect 
of doubtful accounts, when compared to sales.
The Group held a provision for impairment of receivables at 31 July
2006 amounting to £41 million (2005: £32 million).
Inventories
For financial reporting purposes the Group evaluates its inventory 
to ensure it is carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Provision is made against slow moving, obsolete and damaged
inventories. Damaged inventories are identified and written down
through the inventory counting procedures conducted within each
business. Provision for slow moving and obsolete inventories 
is assessed by each business as part of their ongoing financial
reporting. Obsolescence is assessed based on comparison of the
level of inventory holding to the projected likely future sales. Future
sales are assessed based on historical experience and adjusted
where the manufacturer has indicated that it will no longer continue 
to manufacture the particular item. To the extent that future events
impact the saleability of inventory these provisions could vary
significantly. For example, changes in specifications or regulations 
may render inventory, previously considered to have a realisable 
value in excess of cost, obsolete and requiring such inventory to be
fully written off. The Group held allowances in respect of inventory
balances at 31 July 2006 amounting to £134 million (2005: £99 million).
Impairment of long-lived assets
Wolseley periodically evaluates the net realisable value of long-lived
assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets and tangible fixed
assets, relying on a number of factors, including operating results,
business plans and projected future cash flows.
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not
subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and
whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to
amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less
costs to sell and value in use. The fair value is in most cases based
on the discounted present value of the future cash flows expected 
to arise from the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates, 
or from the individual asset or asset group. Estimates are used in
deriving these cash flows and the discount rate. 
The complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the
assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of
the intangible and tangible fixed asset accounting policies affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements. In particular, if different
estimates of the projected future cash flows or a different selection 
of an appropriate discount rate were made, these changes could
materially alter the projected value of the cash flows of the asset and
as a consequence materially different amounts would be reported in
the financial statements.
Self-insured insurance
The Group operates a captive insurance company, Wolseley
Insurance Limited, which is registered and operational in the Isle 
of Man. This company provides reinsurance exclusively to certain
companies within the Group, principally to cover US casualty 
and property damage risks. Provision is made based on actuarial
assessment of the liabilities arising from the insurance coverage
provided. The actuarial assessment of the reserve for future claims
necessarily includes estimates as to the likely trend of future claims
costs and the estimates as to the emergence of further claims
subsequent to the year end. An actuarial review of claims is
performed annually. To the extent that actual claims differ from those
projected the provisions could vary significantly. At 31 July 2006, 
the provision for claims arising from this insurance was £47 million
(2005: £35 million).

81 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Consideration received from vendors
The Group enters into agreements with many of its vendors providing
for inventory purchase rebates primarily upon achievement of specified
volume purchasing levels with many of these agreements applying to
sales in a calendar year. For certain agreements the rebate rises as a
proportion of purchases as higher quantities or values of purchases
are made. The Group accrues the receipt of vendor rebates as part of
its cost of sales for products sold, taking into consideration cumulative
purchases of inventory to date and projected purchases through 
to the end of the qualifying period. Rebates are accrued for each
reporting period with an extensive reassessment of the rebates
earned being performed at the end of the financial year and halfway
through the financial year. The Group has agreements with numerous
and geographically dispersed suppliers, but a slowdown in the
markets in which the Group operates, or a significant change in 
the profile of products purchased may result in purchases for the
remainder of the year differing significantly from those projected.
Consequently the rebate actually received may vary from that accrued
in the financial statements.
Pensions and other post retirement benefits
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the United
Kingdom and in a number of overseas locations, that are accounted
for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate costs
and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements. These actuarial
assumptions include discount rates, assumed rates of return, 
salary increases, employee turnover rates and mortality rates.
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are
appropriate, any significant changes to those used would affect the
balance sheet and income statement. The Group considers that the
most significant assumptions are the discount rate and the expected
return on plan assets. The Group has estimated the sensitivity of 
the financial statements to changes in these assumptions as follows:

85 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
The Group will prepare segmental disclosures in accordance with US GAAP and disclose them in its Form 20-F for the year ended 31 July 2006.
The disclosure requirements under US GAAP differ from those under IFRS, such that revenue, trading profit and operating profit for North America
will be further analysed by operating segment in the Form 20-F . In order to ensure consistency of information disclosed to all investors, the following
table is included in these financial statements.

The change in revenue and trading profit between the years ended 31 July 2005 and 2006 can be analysed into the effects of changes of
exchange rates, the effects of acquisitions made during the financial year and the effect of taking in a full year’s revenue and trading profit of
businesses acquired part way through the previous year, with the remainder being organic change.

Proposed final for the year ended 31 July 2006 of 19.55 pence per share (year ended 31 July 2005: 17.6 pence) 128 104
The final dividend will be authorised by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and is not included as a liability in these financial
statements. The final dividend is based on an anticipated 657 million shares in issue on 6 October 2006, an increase of 59 million shares 
on the shares in issue as at 31 July 2006 due to a proposed placing.
8. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share of 90.77 pence (2005: 81.61 pence) is calculated on the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of
£537 million (2005: £479 million) on a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 592 million (2005: 587 million).
As detailed in note 9 below, the Group believes that profit measures before the amortisation of acquired intangibles provide valuable additional
information for users of the financial statements. Basic earnings per share, before the amortisation of acquired intangibles, has, therefore, been
presented in the following table.
2006 2005
Before amortisation of acquired intangibles 98.90p 82.60p
Add back: amortisation of acquired intangibles (8.13)p (0.99)p
Basic earnings per share 90.77p 81.61p
The impact of all potentially dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to increase the weighted average number of shares in issue
to 597 million (2005: 593 million) and to reduce basic earnings per share to 90.02 pence (2005: 80.75 pence). Diluted earnings per share
before amortisation of acquired intangibles is 98.08 pence (2005: 81.74 pence).
9. Non-GAAP measures of performance
Trading profit is defined as operating profit before the amortisation of acquired intangibles and is a non-GAAP measure. The current businesses
within the Group have arisen through internal organic growth and through acquisition. Operating profit includes only the amortisation of acquired
intangibles arising on those businesses that have been acquired subsequent to 31 July 2004 and as such does not reflect equally the
performance of businesses acquired prior to 31 July 2004 (where no amortisation of acquired intangibles was recognised), businesses that
have developed organically (where no intangibles are attributed) and those businesses more recently acquired (where amortisation of acquired
intangibles is charged). The Group believes that trading profit provides valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in
assessing the Group’s performance since it provides information on the performance of the business that local managers are more directly able
to influence and on a basis consistent across the Group.

All goodwill has arisen from business combinations. On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK GAAP was allocated
to cash generating units (CGUs). These are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which
the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes, which may be at country, divisional, brand or regional level. Goodwill arising 
on business combinations after 1 August 2004 has been allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections based 
on five year financial forecasts approved by management. The key assumptions for these forecasts are those regarding revenue growth, net
margin and the level of working capital required to support trading, which management estimates based on past experience and expectations
of future changes in the market. To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are extrapolated after the five-year period at the
estimated average long-term inflation rate for each market (ranging from 1% to 3%) and discounted back to present value. The key assumption
is the discount rate, which uses an estimate of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, based on the three-month historic volatility of

There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling £43 million (2005: £13 million) that have not been recognised 
on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain. All of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further £459 million (2005: £406 million) of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries
because the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the associated temporary deferred tax differences and it is probable 
that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

rate of 5.2% (2005: 4.5%) due to the long-term nature of the receivable. The fair value of the remaining balances in trade and other receivables
approximates to book value. 
Concentration of credit risk in trade receivables is limited as the Group’s customer base is large and unrelated. Accordingly, management
consider that there is no further credit risk provision required above the current provision for impairment.

Interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings. The fair value of interest rate swaps
is estimated on the basis of the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date. 
The Group’s bank borrowings generally attract variable interest rates based on 6 month LIBOR. Certain interest rate swaps are designated and
effective as cash flow hedges, with the valuation gains being deferred in equity until realised.

The Group’s private placement borrowings are at fixed rates. Certain interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the fair values of these
borrowings. The movement in fair value of these interest rate swaps has been analysed into a proportion that is effective as a hedge and a
proportion that is ineffective: both portions have been charged to the income statement with the effective portion offsetting the change in fair
value of the hedged borrowings. The ineffective portion was less than £1 million.

Outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 July 2006 comprised fixed interest payable on notional principal of US$650 million, a770 million

expire between September 2006 and November 2020 (2005: August 2005 and August 2009) and the gains deferred in equity will reverse in 
the income statement over that period. The fixed interest rates vary between 2.313% and 5.415% (2005: 2.0375% and 4.3275%).

Currency swaps
The Group uses currency swaps either to obtain the optimum return on its surplus funds or to hedge cash flows in respect of committed
transactions. The fair value of currency swaps has been estimated as the cost of closing out the contracts using market prices at the balance
sheet date.
At the balance sheet date the Group had entered into certain short-term currency swaps amounting to assets of US$3 million (2005: assets 
of a130 million, C$33 million and CHF 22 million) and liabilities of £2 million (2005: £4 million, US$53 million and C$170 million) which were held
at fair value through the income statement.

At 31 July 2006, £651 million of loans carried a fixed interest rate (2005: £34 million). The weighted average interest rate paid on fixed
interest borrowings is 5.0% (2005: 6.2%). Interest receipts and payments on the floating rate assets and liabilities are determined by
reference to short-term benchmark rates applicable to the relevant currency or market, such as LIBOR.

24. Bank loans and overdrafts continued
The fair value of fixed interest rate loans payable after one year is £621 million, compared to their book value of £626 million (2005: no material
difference). The floating rate loans payable after one year generally attract variable interest rates based on 6 month LIBOR. Thus the fair value 
of these instruments approximates to their book value.
The Group’s undrawn committed facilities amount to £780 million. Further details of these centrally managed facilities and the financial risk
management activities of the Group are set out in the Performance review on pages 39 to 41.

Wolseley Insurance provisions represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding and potential
claims on certain risks retained by the Group (principally US casualty and global property damage). 
Environmental and legal liabilities include known and potential legal claims and environmental liabilities arising from past events where it is
probable that a payment will be made and the amount of such payment can be reasonably estimated. Included in this provision is an amount 
of £31 million (2005: £32 million) related to asbestos litigation involving certain Group companies. This liability is fully covered by insurance and
accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in ‘Trade and other receivables’ (note 17). The liability has been actuarially
determined as at 31 July 2006 based on advice from independent professional advisors. The provision and the related receivable have been
stated on a discounted basis using a long-term discount rate of 5.2% (2005: 4.5%). The level of insurance cover available significantly exceeds
the expected level of future claims and no profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.

27. Retirement benefit obligations
(i) Description of plans
United Kingdom
The principal plan operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on final
pensionable salaries. The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds. The plan’s retirement benefits are funded by a contribution
from employees with the balance being paid by Group companies. The contribution rates paid by employees at 31 July 2006 are either 5% or
6% of earnings depending on the level of benefits that were accruing at that date. The Group and employee contribution rates are calculated
on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary.
Outside the United Kingdom
North America
The principal plans operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, which are established in accordance with US 401k rules.
Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing plans. Contributions are charged to the income statement in
the period in which they fall due. In the year to 31 July 2006 the cost of defined contribution plans charged to the income statement was
£23 million (2005: £18 million).
In addition, the Group operates three defined benefit schemes in the United States. In Canada a defined benefit scheme and a defined
contribution scheme are operated. Two of the US plans and the Canadian plan are funded; two plans are closed to new entrants. The majority
of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies. The closed plans now provide a minimum pension
guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution plan. The remaining plans provide benefits based on final pensionable salaries. The
contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit (credit) Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries. 
Europe
Both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are operated. Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes are calculated in
accordance with actuarial advice. Contributions to defined contribution schemes are accounted for in the period in which they fall due. The cost
of defined contribution schemes charged to the income statement was £5 million (2005: £1 million).
Post retirement health care
There are no material obligations to provide post retirement health care benefits.
The Group expects to contribute £23 million to the UK defined benefit scheme in the year ending 31 July 2007 and £15 million to the non-UK
schemes.

The expected long-term rates of return for equities have been determined by reference to government bond rates (minimum risk rates) in the
countries in which the plans are based. To reflect the additional risks associated with equities, expected long-term rates of return on equities
include a risk premium. These risk premiums are long-term assumptions and were set after taking actuarial advice and considering the
assumptions used by listed companies. The expected long-term rates of return for other assets are determined in a similar way, i.e. by using 
an appropriate risk premium relative to government bonds in the relevant country. For the UK scheme a premium of 3.0% per year as at
31 July 2006 (2005: 3.0%) was applied to the expected return from government bonds. For the principal overseas schemes in the USA,
Canada and Switzerland a similar approach was adopted with returns set by reference to long-term bond rates after taking actuarial advice.
The Group’s investment strategy for its funded post employment plans is decided locally by the Group and, if relevant, the trustees of the plan
and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements. The Group’s objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return
in excess of the increase in the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long-term to deliver the target
rate of return. Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention being that this will result in the ongoing cost
to the Group of the post employment plans being lower over the long-term and within acceptable boundaries of risk.
For the UK scheme the policy is to invest approximately 75% of the assets in equities and 25% in other asset classes, principally bonds. 
The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the scheme trustees in consultation with the Group. For the overseas schemes the
investment strategy involves the investment in defined levels of predominantly equities with the remainder of the assets being invested in cash
and bonds.

Allotment of shares
From 1 August 2005 to 31 July 2006, new ordinary shares of 25 pence each in the Company have been issued as follows:
Proceeds to the Group
Allottees Number of shares Price per share (p) £m Purpose of issue
Various 2,318,435 251.00 – 935.85 17 Exercise of savings related share options

5,553,785 31
Limits on grant of options
The maximum number of shares over which options may be granted (but excluding any which lapse) under all share option schemes and the
stock appreciation plan in any ten year period is 10% of the issued share capital from time to time. The number of shares over which options 
may be granted under all such schemes as at 31 July 2006 was 59,769,622 (2005: 59,214,243) of which 20,632,264 (2005: 15,510,090) 
have already been issued pursuant to options exercised in the ten year period ended on 31 July 2006.
The maximum number of shares over which options may be granted (but excluding any which lapse) under the rules of the executive share
option schemes in any ten year period is 5% of the issued share capital from time to time. The number of shares over which options may be
granted as at 31 July 2006 was 29,884,811 (2005: 29,607,122) of which 6,181,529 (2005: 4,886,655) have already been issued pursuant to
options exercised on or before 31 July 2006.
Executive Benefit Trusts
Three Employee Benefit Trusts have been established in connection with the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 and the Wolseley plc 2002 
Long Term Incentive Scheme. During the year one of these trusts purchased 2,011,478 ordinary shares of the Company, with a nominal value of 
£1 million, for a cash consideration of £27 million. The market value of the 4,011,478 shares held by the employee benefit trusts at 31 July 2006,
which have a nominal value of £1 million, was £46 million (2005: £24 million) and none of them had been allocated to employees or Directors 
at that date. Dividends due on shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts are waived in accordance with the provisions of the trust deeds.
29. Share-based payments
The Group operates six share option plans: the 1984 Executive Share Option Scheme, the 1989 Executive Share Option Scheme and the
Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 (collectively, the “Executive Option Schemes”); the Wolseley Employees Savings Related Share Option Scheme
1981 and Wolseley Irish Sharesave Scheme 2000 (collectively, the “Employees Savings Option Schemes”); and the Wolseley Employee Share
Purchase Plan 2001 (the “ESPP”). The Wolseley Employees International Stock Appreciation Plan (the “SAP”) expired during the year ended 
31 July 2006.
Awards granted under the Executive Option Schemes are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the growth in
earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period by at
least 9% and consequently vest over a period of three years. Awards granted under the Employee Savings Option Schemes vest over periods
ranging from three to seven years. Awards granted under the Employee Share Purchase Plan vest over a one-year period. Awards granted
under the SAP vested over a period of five years.
The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Scheme (“LTIS”) for senior executives. Under this Scheme, executives will be awarded 
a variable number of shares depending on the level of total shareholder return over the next three years relative to that of a number of 
comparator companies. The vesting period is three years. The maximum award under the scheme is determined at grant date and then 
adjusted at vesting date in accordance with the market performance condition.

*The initial assumption was for 2006 interim and final dividends of 9.68 pence and 19.36 pence respectively (2005: 8.73 pence and

Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historic volatility over the expected term. Expected life has been estimated on the basis 
of historical data on the exercise pattern.

The fair value adjustments shown above for the year ended 31 July 2006 are provisional figures, being the best estimates currently available.
Further adjustments to goodwill may be necessary when additional information is available concerning some of the judgemental areas.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the new markets and product ranges to which
the Group has gained access and to additional profitability and operating efficiencies in respect of existing markets.
The acquisitions contributed £862 million to revenue, £60 million to trading profit and £33 million to the Group’s operating profit for the
period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If each acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue would have been £14,940 million and Group
trading profit would have been £934 million.

42. Accounting standards, interpretations and
amendments to published standards not yet 
effective
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing
standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 August 2006 or later
periods, but which the Group has not early adopted. The new
standards which are expected to be relevant to the Group’s
operations are as follows:
Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 “Financial Guarantee
Contracts” (effective from 1 August 2006)
This amendment requires issued financial guarantees, other than
those previously asserted by the entity to be insurance contracts, 
to be initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently
measured at the higher of: (a) the unamortised balance of the
related fees received and determined; and (b) the expenditure
required to settle the commitment at the balance sheet date.
Management is currently assessing the impact of this amendment
on the Group’s financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 39 “Cash Flow Hedge Accounting 
of Forecast Intragroup Transactions” (effective from 
1 August 2006)
This amendment allows the foreign currency risk of a highly
probable forecast intragroup transaction to qualify as a hedged 
item in the consolidated financial statements, provided that: (a) the
transaction is denominated in a currency other than the functional
currency of the entity entering into that transaction; and (b) the
foreign currency risk will affect consolidated profit or loss.
Management does not expect adoption of this amendment to 
have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 39 “The Fair Value Option” (effective
from 1 August 2006)
This amendment changes the definition of the financial instruments
classified at fair value through the income statement and restricts
the ability to designate financial instruments as part of this category.
Management does not expect adoption of this amendment to have
a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” (effective from
1 August 2007) and amendment to IAS 1 “Presentation of
Financial Statements – Capital Disclosures” (effective from
1 August 2007)
IFRS 7 introduces new disclosures of qualitative and quantitative
information about exposure to risks arising from financial instruments
including specified minimum disclosures about credit risk, liquidity
risk and market risk, including sensitivity analysis to market risk. 
The amendment to IAS 1 introduces disclosures about the level 
of an entity’s capital and how it manages capital. Management is
currently assessing the impact of IFRS 7 and the amendment to
IAS 1 on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRIC 7 “Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29”
(effective from 1 August 2006)
IFRIC 7 deals with the accounting when an entity identifies the
existence of hyperinflation in the economy of its functional currency
and how deferred tax items in the opening balance sheet should be
restated. The Group has operations in hyperinflationary economies.
The Group has assessed the impact of the interpretation and
concluded it is not likely to have a significant impact on the Group’s
financial statements.
IFRIC 8 “Scope of IFRS 2” (effective from 1 August 2006)
IFRIC 8 clarifies that transactions within the scope of IFRS 2 “Share
Based Payment” include those in which the entity cannot specifically
identify some or all of the goods and services received. The Group
has assessed the impact of this interpretation and has concluded it is
not likely to have a significant impact on the Group’ s financial statements.
IFRIC 9 “Reassessment of embedded derivatives” (effective
from 1 August 2006)
IFRIC 9 clarifies that an entity should assess whether an embedded
derivative is required to be separated from the host contract and
accounted for as a derivative when the entity first becomes a party 
to the contract. Subsequent reassessment is prohibited unless 
there is a change in the contract terms, in which case it is required. 
The Group has assessed the impact of this interpretation and has
concluded it is not likely to have a significant impact on the Group’s
financial statements.

43. Summary of significant differences between
International Financial Reporting Standards and
accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”), which differ in certain
significant respects from generally accepted accounting principles 
in the United States (“US GAAP”). Such differences involve methods
for measuring the amounts shown in the financial statements, 
as well as additional disclosures required by US GAAP .
A summary of the principal differences applicable to the Group is set
out below: 
(i) Goodwill
On transition to IFRS, the amount of goodwill at 1 August 2004 is the
previous carrying amount under UK GAAP . Under IFRS goodwill is no
longer amortised but tested annually for impairment.
Prior to 1 August 1998, purchased goodwill was written off to
reserves in the year of acquisition as permitted under UK GAAP . 
Since 1 August 1998, all acquired goodwill has been capitalised and
amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years. If a subsidiary or a
business is subsequently sold or closed, previously written off goodwill
which was the result of the initial acquisition is taken into account in
determining the profit or loss on sale or closure.
Under US GAAP prior to 1 August 2002, goodwill arising on
acquisitions prior to 1 July 2001 was capitalised and amortised 
over its estimated useful life, not exceeding 40 years. Following
implementation of SFAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”
goodwill is no longer amortised, but is reviewed at least annually 
for impairment.
The Group completed the required impairment tests under both IFRS
and US GAAP during 2006, which indicated that no impairment
charge was required under either set of accounting principles.
(ii) Intangible assets
Under IFRS, the accounting for business combinations prior to
transition to IFRS has not been revisited. Therefore intangible assets
arising in respect of acquisitions prior to the transition date of
1 August 2004, previously recognised under US GAAP , have not 
been recognised under IFRS and remain within goodwill.
(iii) Contingent purchase consideration
Under IFRS, contingent purchase consideration is recorded as part of
the purchase cost at the date of acquisition if it is reliably measurable
and probable. Under US GAAP , this cost is not recognised until the
contingency is resolved and the amount determinable.
(iv) Pensions
Under IFRS, pension costs are accounted for in accordance with
IAS 19 (revised 2004). Under US GAAP , pension costs comprise the
estimated cost of benefits accruing in the period as determined in
accordance with SFAS 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” 
and SFAS 88, “Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and
Curtailments of Defined Benefit Plans and for Termination Benefits.”
Under IFRS, actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences
between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets and the
effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the
statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which
they occur. The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the
balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present
value of the benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less any past
service costs not yet recognised, less the fair value of the plan assets,
if any, at the balance sheet date. Where a plan is in surplus, the asset
recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised past service
costs and the present value of any amount which the Group expects
to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
Under US GAAP , the annual pension cost comprises the estimated
cost of benefits accruing in the period as determined in accordance
with SFAS 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.” SFAS 87
requires the use of the projected unit credit actuarial method for
determining defined benefit pension costs and provides for the
deferral of actuarial gains and losses (in excess of a specified corridor)
that result from changes in assumptions or actual experience.
(v) Deferred taxation
Under IFRS and US GAAP , deferred tax is provided in full, using the
liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the
consolidated financial statements. There is a difference in the definition
of tax basis between IFRS and US GAAP , which gives rise to an
additional deferred tax liability under IFRS. Under IFRS, deferred tax 
is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or
liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at 
the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit
or loss.
Under US GAAP , a valuation allowance is established against deferred
tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all 
of these will not be realised. Under IFRS it is recognised net.
Under IFRS the deferred tax asset in relation to share based payments
is based upon the intrinsic value of the share option and is adjusted 
at every year end to reflect changes in the share price valuation, 
as well as pre-vesting forfeitures, changes in tax rate, relocation of
employees, or changes in tax legislation. If the cumulative estimated
tax deduction – either during vesting or on exercise – exceeds the
“book expense” tax deduction, the difference is credited to equity.
WO40006_R&A 2006_72-147.qxd  10/10/06  8:55 pm  Page 116 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
117 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Under US GAAP this asset is based upon the fair value expensed
under SFAS 123R and only adjusted for pre-vesting forfeitures,
changes in tax rate, relocation of employees, or changes in tax
legislation. If the final tax deduction exceeds book expense (“windfall”),
the difference is credited to additional paid-in capital. If the final tax
deduction is less than book expense (“shortfall”), the difference is
included in additional paid-in capital to the extent there have been
previous windfalls credited; otherwise the difference is recorded in 
the income statement.
(vi) Share-based payments
Under the transition provisions of IFRS, the Group has elected to
apply IFRS2 “Share-based Payment” retrospectively only to equity-
settled awards that had not vested as at 1 August 2004 and were
granted on or after 7 November 2002 and to cash-settled awards
that had not vested as at 1 August 2004. Under US GAAP , the Group
adopted SFAS 123 (Revised), “Share-Based Payments” with effect
from 1 August 2005 using a modified prospective transition method
and the Group’s prior periods have not been restated to reflect and
do not include the impact of, SFAS 123 (R). Under SFAS 123 (R)
share based compensation expense is recognised during the period
based on the portion of share based payments awards that is
ultimately expected to vest during the period.
The Group operates a number of plans which are defined within
note 29. The Executive Option Schemes are subject to a condition
such that they may not be exercised unless the growth in earnings
per share over a period of three consecutive fiscal years exceeds
growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period by at least
9% (for options granted in and after December 1997). Under IFRS
such options are treated as equity-settled. 
For the year ended 31 July 2005 the Group was accounting for the
Executive Option Schemes under SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock
Based Compensation.” The condition described above was regarded
as a performance condition and such options were also treated as
equity-settled. On application of SFAS 123 (R), the condition is not
regarded as a performance condition, as the performance target is
set by reference to an index, rather than being fixed at the date of
award. As the condition is not a service or market condition either, the
options are accounted for as liabilities under US GAAP and revalued
at every reporting date until the option has vested.
Under SFAS 123, the cumulative cost recorded up to 31 July 2005 
in respect of executive options was £11 million. Under SFAS 123 (R),
£18 million has been charged in the year ended 31 July 2006 in
respect of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
Under SFAS 123 (R), the charge in the year ended 31 July 2006 in
respect of executive options is £12 million.
(vii) Sale and leaseback accounting
Under IFRS, in a sale and leaseback transaction where the leaseback
is recognised as an operating lease and the sale price equals fair
value, the profit or loss on the sale should be recognised immediately.
Under US GAAP , in general, the gains or losses on disposal of 
the properties are deferred and amortised over the term of the
operating lease.
(viii) Other adjustments
Restructuring costs 
Under IFRS, a provision for restructuring costs is recognised only
when a present obligation (legal or constructive) exists as a result of 
a past event; it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be
made of the amount of the obligation.
Under US GAAP , for restructuring plans initiated after 1 January 2003,
a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity can only
be recognised when the liability is incurred. An entity’s commitment to
a plan, by itself, does not create a present obligation to others that
meets the definition of a liability. The timing of recognition and related
measurement of a liability for one-time termination benefits in relation
to employees who are to be involuntarily terminated depends on
whether the employees are required to render service until they are
terminated in order to receive the termination benefits and, if so,
whether employees will be retained to render service beyond the
minimum retention period.
Capitalised interest
Under IFRS, the Group has chosen not to capitalise interest on
specific or general borrowings to finance the construction of certain
property, plant and equipment. Under US GAAP , this interest is
capitalised. The amount of interest capitalised is based on a weighted
average method considering the general borrowings outstanding
during the period.
Employers’ payroll taxes in respect of share-based payments
Under IFRS, employers’ social security liability arising from share-
based payment transactions is recognised over the same period 
or periods as the share-based payment charge. Under US GAAP ,
employers’ payroll taxes due on the exercise of share options are
recognised as an expense when the liability arises, which is generally
at the option’s exercise date.

45. Reconciliation of net assets and profit under
UK GAAP to IFRS
This is the first year that the Group has presented its financial
statements under IFRS. In the year ended 31 July 2005, Wolseley plc
reported under UK GAAP .
IFRS 1, “First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards” sets out the procedures that the Group must follow 
when it adopts IFRS for the first time as the basis for preparing its
consolidated financial statements. The Group is required to establish
its IFRS accounting policies as at 31 July 2006 and, in general, apply
these retrospectively to determine the IFRS opening balance sheet at
its date of transition, 1 August 2004.
Certain optional exemptions to this general principle are available
under IFRS 1 and the significant first-time adoption choices made by
the Group are as follows:
Business combinations before 1 August 2004 (IFRS 3,
“Business Combinations”)
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business
combinations that took place before 1 August 2004. As a result, in
the IFRS opening balance sheet, goodwill arising from past business
combinations (£665.9 million) remains as stated under UK GAAP at
that date.
Employee Benefits – actuarial gains and losses (IAS 19,
“Employee Benefits”)
The Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains 
and losses in relation to employee benefit schemes at the date of
transition. In addition, the Group has elected to recognise actuarial
gains and losses in full in the period in which they occur in a
statement of recognised income and expense.
Share-based Payments (IFRS 2, “Share-based Payment”)
The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards
that had not vested as at 1 August 2004 and were granted on or after
7 November 2002 and cash-settled awards that had not vested as at
1 August 2004.
Foreign Currency Translation Reserve (IAS 21, “The Effects 
of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”)
The Group has elected to reset the foreign currency translation
reserve to zero at 1 August 2004. Going forward, IFRS requires
amounts taken to reserves on the retranslation of foreign subsidiaries
to be recorded in a separate foreign currency translation reserve 
and be included in the future calculation of profit or loss on sale 
of the subsidiary.
Financial Instruments (IAS 39, “Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement” and IAS 32, “Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation”)
The Group has elected to implement IAS 32 and IAS 39 at its date 
of transition, 1 August 2004 and apply hedge accounting where the
requirements of IAS 39 are met.
The Group is also required to provide reconciliations of equity at the
transition date, equity at 31 July 2005 and profit for the year ended
31 July 2005 under UK GAAP and IFRS and to provide explanations
of the effect of the transition on its financial position, financial
performance and cash flows. These are presented in the 
following tables.

45. Reconciliation of net assets and profit under UK GAAP to IFRS continued
(i) Intangible assets 
Arising on business combinations
Under UK GAAP , goodwill was amortised over its useful economic life, tested for impairment and provided against as necessary. Under IFRS,
goodwill is no longer amortised but must be tested for impairment as at 1 August 2004 (the transition date) and at least annually thereafter.
Goodwill amortisation charged under UK GAAP during the year ended 31 July 2005 has been credited back to the income statement under IFRS.
In addition IFRS requires identifiable intangible assets to be recognised separately on the balance sheet and consequently certain intangible
assets, such as contractual customer relationships and trade names, which were previously recorded as part of goodwill under UK GAAP , 
have been separately recognised as intangible assets under IFRS and amortised over their expected useful lives.
Software
Under UK GAAP software was included in plant and equipment and the allocation of its cost over its estimated useful life was charged as
depreciation. Under IFRS, only software which is necessary to operate hardware is included in plant and equipment. Other expenditure on
software is included in intangible assets and the allocation of its cost over its estimated useful life is charged as amortisation.

(ii) Leases
IAS 17, “Leases” requires that the land and buildings elements of property leases are considered separately for the purposes of determining
whether the lease is a finance or operating lease. The majority of the Group’s leased buildings are on short-term leases and, consistent with
UK GAAP , are classified as operating leases under IFRS. There are, however, a small number of leases where the building element of the lease
has been reclassified as a finance lease based on the criteria set out in IAS 17.
Under UK GAAP , committed rental increases, which could be considered in the same way as inflationary increases and increases due to market
comparables, were generally recognised as they arose and property lease incentives were generally recognised over the period to the first
market rent review. Under IFRS, committed rental increases and lease incentives are required to be spread over the entire lease term.

(iii) Post-employment benefits
Under UK GAAP , the Group accounted for post-employment benefits under SSAP 24, “Accounting for pension costs”, whereby the cost of
providing defined benefit pensions and post-retirement healthcare benefits was charged against operating profit on a systematic basis with
surpluses and deficits arising recognised over the expected average remaining service lives of participating employees. The Group has adopted
the amendment to IAS 19, “Employee Benefits” which allows actuarial gains and losses to be charged to equity and as a result, the net deficit
on the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes is carried in full in the Group’s IFRS balance sheet.

45. Reconciliation of net assets and profit under UK GAAP to IFRS continued
(iv) Share-based payments
Under UK GAAP , the cost of awards made under the Group’s employee share schemes was based on the intrinsic value of the awards, 
with the exception of SAYE schemes for which no cost was recognised. Under IFRS 2, “Share-based Payment”, the cost of employee share
schemes, including SAYE schemes, is based on the fair value of the awards, which must be assessed using an option-pricing model. The
Group has principally used a binomial model for this purpose.
Generally, for an equity-settled award, the fair value of the award at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period,
with adjustments being made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or
achieve non-market performance conditions, such as EPS growth targets. For a cash-settled award, the fair value of the award at each balance
sheet date is used to calculate the probable liability of the Group; changes in this liability from the opening to closing balance sheet are charged
or credited to the income statement.

(v) Derivatives and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative contracts to manage its economic exposure to movements in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Under
UK GAAP , such derivative contracts were not recognised as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and gains or losses arising on them were
not recognised until the hedged item had itself been recognised in the financial statements.
Under IFRS all derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair market value whilst other financial instruments are accounted for either at
amortised cost or at fair value depending on their classification. Subject to stringent criteria, derivative financial instruments, financial assets and
financial liabilities may be designated as forming hedge relationships as a result of which fair value changes are offset in the income statement 
or charged/credited to equity depending on the nature of the hedge relationship. Hedge accounting has been applied to the Group’s interest 
rate swaps (which are hedging floating rate debt) and foreign currency financial instruments (which are hedging the net assets of the Group’s
foreign operations).

(vi) Post balance sheet events
Under UK GAAP dividends were recognised in the period to which they related. IAS 10, “Events after the Balance Sheet Date” requires that
dividends declared or approved after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date as the liability does
not represent a present obligation as defined by IAS 37, “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”.

(vii) Taxation
Under UK GAAP , deferred tax was provided on timing differences between the accounting and taxable profit (an income statement approach).
Under IFRS, deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the book carrying value and tax base of assets and liabilities (a balance
sheet approach). As a result, the Group’s IFRS balance sheet includes an additional deferred tax liability in respect of fair value property
revaluations on acquisitions and property roll-over gains.
In addition, deferred tax has been recognised on the adjustments between UK GAAP and IFRS with the majority of the net deferred tax asset
relating to the adjustments for share options and post-employment benefits (reflecting the substantially increased defined benefit liability 
under IFRS).

(viii) Foreign exchange gains and losses
A small number of the Group’s subsidiary companies have changed their functional currency in order to comply with the more stringent functional
currency requirements of IAS 21, “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates” which requires companies that are acting on behalf of the
parent company to have the same functional currency as the parent company. As a result, some foreign exchange differences arising in these
companies have been recorded in the Group’s income statement under IFRS rather than in equity, under UK GAAP .

(ix) Other adjustments
• The Group holds invoiced products on its premises for customer call-off: under UK GAAP such products are generally treated as sold, 
while under IFRS they are held in inventory.
• Available-for-sale financial assets are stated at historical cost under UK GAAP , but at fair value under IFRS.
• Assets held-for-sale are shown in a single balance sheet caption under IFRS, but under UK GAAP are included in property, plant and
equipment, trade and other receivables or, where they arise out of foreclosed loans, in construction loans receivable.
• Under IFRS holiday pay is accrued over the period when employees render the service that increases their entitlement to paid leave. 
Under UK GAAP , there is no requirement to adjust salary costs to reflect the timing when such benefits are taken.

130 Independent auditors’ report to the members of Wolseley plc
Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Wolseley plc
We have audited the group financial statements of Wolseley plc for
the year ended 31 July 2006 which comprise the group income
statement, the group balance sheet, the group cash flow statement,
the group statement of recognised income and expense and the
related notes. These group financial statements have been prepared
under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial
statements of Wolseley plc for the year ended 31 July 2006.
We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A
to the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 contained in the Directors’
Remuneration report (“the auditable part”). 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and 
the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union and for preparing Part 3 of Schedule 7A information
in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law, are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements and the
auditable part of the Remuneration report in accordance with relevant
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been
prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no
other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the group financial
statements and the auditable part of the Remuneration report have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects 
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures 
or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited group financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’
report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration report, 
the Chairman’s Statement, the Group Chief Executive’s review, the
Performance review and the Corporate Governance Statement. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the group
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any 
other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the group financial statements. 
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the group
financial statements and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the group financial statements and the auditable part of the
Remuneration report are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the group financial statements and the auditable part of the
Remuneration report.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 July 2006 and of its profit,
statement of recognised income and expense and cash flows for
the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation;
• those parts contained within the Remuneration report required by
Part 3 of the Schedule 7A to the United Kingdom Companies Act
1985 have been properly prepared in accordance with the UK
Companies Act 1985 and
• the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the
group financial statements.

Notes to the Company 
financial statements
Year ended 31 July 2006 
1. Company accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These Companies Act financial statements are prepared under the
historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK
accounting standards. As permitted by the Companies Act 1985 
the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The principal accounting policies, as set out below, have been applied
consistently throughout the period. Financial Reporting Standards 17
“Retirement Benefits” (FRS 17), 20 “Share-based Payment” (FRS 20),
21 “Events After The Balance Sheet Date” (FRS 21), 23 “The Effects
of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates” (FRS 23), 25 “Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation” (FRS 25) and 26 “Financial
Instruments: Measurement” (FRS 26) have been adopted by the
Company for the first time in these financial statements. The
cumulative impact on the Company’s reserves at 1 August 2005 of
applying these new accounting standards is an increase in reserves 
of £98 million, primarily as a result of the reversal of the 2005 final
dividend, which has been accounted for as a prior period adjustment.
Note 27 on pages 101 to 105 and note 29 on pages 106 to 108 
of the Wolseley plc consolidated financial statements form part of
these financial statements.
Foreign currencies
The cost of the Company’s investments in overseas subsidiary
undertakings is translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the date 
of investment.
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates 
of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date. All currency translation differences are taken to the
income statement with the exception of differences on foreign currency
borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a
hedge against foreign currency investments.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are recorded at cost less provision 
for impairment.
Taxation
Current tax represents the expected tax payable (or recoverable) 
on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into
account any adjustments arising from prior years.
Provision is made for deferred taxation in so far as a liability or asset
has arisen as a result of transactions that had occurred by the
balance sheet date and have given rise to an obligation to pay more
tax in the future, or the right to pay less tax in the future. An asset 
has not been recognised to the extent that the transfer of economic
benefits in the future is uncertain. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
recognised have not been discounted. Provision is made for UK or
foreign taxation arising on the distribution to the UK of retained profits
of overseas subsidiary undertakings where dividends have been
recognised as receivable.
Derivatives and financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments, in particular, interest rate swaps and
currency swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from
the business activities of the Company and the financing of those
activities. There is no trading activity in derivative financial instruments.
At the inception of a hedging transaction entailing the use of derivative
financial instruments, the Company documents the relationship
between the hedged item and the hedging instrument together 
with its risk management objective and the strategy underlying the
proposed transaction. The Company also documents its assessment,
both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently 
on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting
movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities
measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. Where
derivative financial instruments do not fulfil the criteria for hedge
accounting contained in FRS 26, changes in their fair values are
recognised in the income statement.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships
are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net
investment hedges. Where the hedging relationship is classified as a
fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability is
adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the
hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income
statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be
offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. Where
the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net
investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the
fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are
recognised directly in equity rather than in the income statement.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the
accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity are either recycled
to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial
asset, are recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.

133 Notes to the Company financial statements
Pensions and post-retirement benefits
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans and other post-
retirement benefits are charged to the income statement as incurred.
For defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits, the
cost is calculated annually using the projected unit credit method and
is recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of
participating employees, in accordance with the recommendations 
of independent qualified actuaries. The current service cost of defined
benefit plans is recorded within operating profit, the expected return
from pension scheme assets is recorded within finance revenue and
the interest on pension scheme liabilities is recorded within finance
costs. Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are
recorded within operating profit and recognised on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, or immediately if the benefits have
vested. Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences
between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets and the
effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the
statement of recognised gains and losses in the period in which they
occur. The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance
sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of 
the benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less any past service
costs not yet recognised, less the fair value of the plan assets, if any,
at the balance sheet date. Where a plan is in surplus, the asset
recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised past service
costs and the present value of any amount which the Company expects
to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
Cash at bank and in hand
Cash at bank and in hand includes cash in hand, deposits held at 
call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank
overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the
balance sheet to the extent that there is no right of offset and practice
of net settlement with cash balances.
Share capital
The Company only has one class of shares, ordinary shares, which
are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the
issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction
from the proceeds, net of tax.
Where the Company or the Company’s trust purchases the
Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration
paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax),
is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders
until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such
shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received,
net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the
related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s
equity holders.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at cost being the fair value of the
consideration received net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value being recognised in the income statement over 
the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at 
least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the
Company’s executive share option, long-term incentive and share
purchase schemes. The Company recognises a compensation cost 
in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the
awards, measured using Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo
valuation methodologies. For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is
determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently remeasured
unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
For cash-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of
grant and is remeasured at each balance sheet date until the liability 
is settled. Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to
reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due 
to the failure to satisfy service conditions or achieve non-market
performance conditions.
The Company has applied FRS 20 retrospectively only to equity-
settled awards that had not vested as at 1 August 2004 and were
granted on or after 7 November 2002 and cash-settled awards that
had not vested as at 1 August 2004.
Dividends payable
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Company’s
financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved
by the shareholders of the Company (generally in the case of the final
dividend) or paid (in the case of interim dividends).

9. Retirement benefit obligations
The Company participates in the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan. This is a defined benefit multi-employer plan, the assets and
liabilities of which are held independently from the Group. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of
the plan and accordingly accounts for the plan as if it were a defined contribution plan. Information in respect of the plan is provided in note 27,
on pages 101 to 105, to the Wolseley plc consolidated financial statements.
10. Share-based payments
Details of share options granted by Group companies to employees and that remain outstanding, over the Company’s shares are set out 
in note 29, on pages 106 and 108, to the Wolseley plc consolidated financial statements. The Company recognised an equity-settled share-based
payment charge of £3 million in the year (2005: £1 million).

Interest rate swaps
The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings. The fair value of interest rate 
swaps is estimated on the basis of the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.

137 Notes to the Company financial statements
The Company’s bank borrowings generally attract variable interest rates based on 6 month LIBOR. Certain interest rate swaps are designated
and effective as cash flow hedges and the valuation gains have been deferred in equity until realised.

Outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 July 2006 comprised fixed interest payable on notional principal of US$650 million and
a770 million (2005: US$575 million and a785 million) and fixed interest receivable on notional principal of US$350 million. The contracts expire
between September 2006 and August 2009 (2005: August 2005 and August 2009) and the gains deferred in equity will reverse in the profit 
and loss account over that period. The fixed interest rates varied between 2.313% and 5.415% (2005: 2.0375% and 4.3275%).
Currency swaps
The Company uses currency swaps either to obtain the optimum return on its surplus funds or to hedge the spot exchange rate risk of its
assets and liabilities, principally loans. The fair value of currency swaps has been estimated as the cost of closing out the contracts using
market prices at the balance sheet date.

13. Contingent liabilities
Provision is made for the Directors’ best estimate of known legal claims and legal actions in progress. The Company takes legal advice as to
the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on that advice, that the action 
is unlikely to succeed or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made.
The Company has the following quantifiable contingent liabilities which arose in the ordinary course of business and which have not been
provided in these accounts since no actual liability is expected to arise:
2006 2005
£m £m
Value added tax of certain subsidiary undertakings 5 5
Sundry guarantees, performance bonds and indemnities 1,018 7
Obligations under forward foreign exchange contracts 497 413
An amount of £499 million (2005: £402 million) is expected to be received from counterparties in respect of the obligations under forward
foreign exchange contracts detailed above.
In addition, the Company has given its principal UK bank authority to transfer at any time any sum outstanding to its credit against or towards
satisfaction of the liability to the bank of certain subsidiary undertakings.
The Company acts as guarantor or surety for various subsidiary undertakings in financing and other agreements entered into by them in the
normal course of business and has given indemnities and warranties to the purchasers of businesses from the Company and certain Group
companies in respect of which no material liabilities are expected to arise. Additionally, the Company has issued a guarantee to the trustees of
the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan in respect of the solvency of the plan and has guaranteed the pension payable by Brossette BTI
to Mr. G. Pinault, a former Director.

14. Employees, employee costs and audit fees
The average number of employees (including Directors) of the Company in the year ended 31 July 2006 was 15 (2005: 14). Total employee
costs of the Company for the year were £6 million (2005: £6 million) and audit fees incurred by the Company in the year were £0.1 million
(2005: £0.1 million).
15. Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 “Related Party Disclosures” to dispense with the requirement to
disclose transactions with subsidiaries, 90% or more whose voting rights are held within the Group and which are included in the Wolseley plc
consolidated financial statements.
16. Post balance sheet events
The Board has declared a final dividend for the year ended 31 July 2006 of 19.55 pence (2005: 17.60 pence). This dividend has not been
included as a liability as at 31 July 2006.
In addition, a vendor placing of approximately 59 million ordinary shares of the Company is expected to take place on 25 September 2006.
Further details of this are provided in the Performance review on page 39.

140 Independent auditors’ report to the members of Wolseley plc
Independent auditors’ report 
to the members of Wolseley plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Wolseley
plc for the year ended 31 July 2006 which comprise the company
balance sheet and the related notes. These parent company financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set 
out therein.
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of
Wolseley plc and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration
report for the year ended 31 July 2006.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the
parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement
of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of
the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in
giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent
company financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We report to you 
whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report 
is consistent with the parent company financial statements. We also
report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company
financial statements. The other information comprises only the
Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration
report, the Chairman’s statement, the Group Chief Executive’s review,
the Performance review and the Corporate Governance statement.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not
extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates
and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the
parent company financial statements and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the parent company financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the parent company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the parent company financial statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the company’s affairs as 
at 31 July 2006;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with 
the parent company financial statements.

148 Shareholder information
Shareholders can register on-line to view their Wolseley plc
shareholding details using Shareview, a service offered by our
registrars, Lloyds TSB Registrars. To access the service, you should
log on to www.shareview.co.uk and complete the simple on-screen
registration process. You will then need to enter your surname,
postcode, e-mail address and shareholder reference number 
(which is detailed on the form of proxy accompanying this Report). 
By logging on to www.shareview.co.uk, you will be able to do all 
of the following at the click of a mouse:
• check your shareholding in Wolseley plc 24 hours a day; 
• register your e-mail and mailing preference (post or electronic) 
for future shareholder mailings; 
• gain easy access to a variety of shareholder information including
indicative valuations and payment instruction details; 
• access the share dealing facility; and
• use the internet to appoint a proxy for you at general meetings 
of the shareholders. 
The Company can, at shareholders’ request, send shareholders 
an e-mail notification each time a new shareholder report or other
shareholder communication is put on the website. Shareholders will
then be able to read and/or download the information at their leisure,
but will still be able to request paper copies of the documents should
they so wish. 
To encourage more shareholders to convert to e-communications, 
the Company will arrange for a sapling tree to be planted in the UK for 
each shareholder who chooses to receive all future communications
electronically. The next opportunity for us to notify you electronically
will be for the Interim Report, which will be published in Spring 2007.

be held by them, subject only to such arrangements or exclusions as
the Directors may feel necessary or expedient to deal with fractional
entitlements otherwise existing or legal or practical problems arising
by virtue of shares being represented by depositary receipts or
otherwise under the laws of or any other requirements of any
regulatory body or stock exchange in any territory or any matter
whatsoever; and

Company as at 25 September 2006 and shall expire at the conclusion
of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company after the passing
of this resolution and in any event no later than 15 months after the
passing of this resolution.

Directors to make an offer or an agreement before the expiry of the
power which would or might require equity securities to be allotted
after such expiry and the Directors may allot equity securities in
pursuance of such offer or agreement as if the authority conferred 
by this resolution had not expired.

authorised in accordance with Part VII of the Companies Act 1985

be purchased is 65,721,088;
12.2 the minimum price which may be paid for each ordinary share 
is 25 pence, exclusive of expenses;

resolution and prior to the expiry of the authority make a contract 
to purchase its own ordinary shares which will or may be executed

151 Notice of meeting
Resolutions 8 and 9
Auditors have to be appointed at every general meeting at which
accounts are presented to shareholders. The current appointment 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s auditors will end
at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting and it has advised 
its willingness to stand for reappointment. It is normal practice for 
a company’s Directors to be authorised to agree how much the
auditors should be paid.
Resolutions 10 and 11
The Companies Act 1985 prevents Directors from allotting unissued
shares without the authority of shareholders in general meeting. 
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Directors to allot
unissued shares but this power is subject to renewal by shareholders.
Resolution 10 empowers the Directors to allot shares of up to
£35,697,279 in nominal amount representing the authorised but
unissued ordinary share capital as at 25 September 2006, being a
date not more than one month prior to this Notice. The Directors were
last given this authority at the Annual General Meeting held in 2005
and it is intended that renewal of this authority will be sought on an
annual basis. Resolution 11 empowers the Directors to allot shares 
for cash or sell/transfer shares out of treasury otherwise than pro rata 
to existing shareholders but this power is limited to allotments in
connection with a rights issue and otherwise up to an aggregate
nominal amount of £8,215,136 (approximately 5% of the issued
ordinary share capital as at 25 September 2006, being a date not 
more than one month prior to this Notice). Save for the issue of 
shares pursuant to the Company’s various employee share schemes
and any share dividend alternatives, the Directors do not presently
intend to allot any unissued shares. Treasury shares and the regulations
which came into force on 1 December 2003 in relation to them, 
are more fully explained in the note to Resolution 12.
The authority conferred by these Resolutions will expire no later than
15 months from the date on which the resolution is passed, or at
the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2007,
whichever is the sooner.
Similar resolutions have been approved by shareholders at each
Annual General Meeting since 1984.
Resolution 12
This resolution empowers the Directors to make limited on-market
purchases of the Company’s ordinary shares. The power is limited 
to a maximum of 65,721,088 shares (10% of the issued share capital
as at 25 September 2006) and details the minimum and maximum
prices that can be paid, exclusive of expenses. The authority
conferred by this resolution will expire at the conclusion of the
Company’s next Annual General Meeting.
The Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares)
Regulations 2003 came into force on 1 December 2003. These
regulations allow shares repurchased by the Company to be held as
treasury shares. Treasury shares may be cancelled, sold for cash or
used for the purpose of employee share schemes. The authority to 
be sought by this resolution is intended to apply equally to shares to
be held by the Company as treasury shares. No dividends will be paid
on shares which are held as treasury shares and no voting rights will
be attached to them. Shares held as treasury shares will be treated 
as if cancelled. The Company holds no shares in treasury but the
Directors currently intend that any shares which are repurchased 
will be held in treasury.
Resolution 13
This resolution enables the Directors to incur expenditure of up to
£125,000 (including any such expenditure by a subsidiary company)
without unintentionally breaching the provisions of the Political Parties,
Elections and Referendums Act 2000, which defines political
organisations and donations in a very broad manner. The authority
sought will, if granted, last until the conclusion of the 2007 Annual
General Meeting of the Company when the Directors intend to seek
renewal of this authority. The policy of not giving any cash
contributions to any political party will continue. 
The Directors consider that each of the resolutions is in the best
interests of the Company and the shareholders as a whole and
recommend all shareholders to vote in favour of all resolutions, 
as the Directors intend to do in respect of their own shares.

This is a secure service enabling shareholders to set up and view
personal shareholding details. When you register please have your
shareholder reference number to hand (this can be found on your
share certificate or your proxy form).
To encourage more shareholders to convert to e-communications, 
if you make the choice to receive all future communications electronically,
we will arrange for a sapling tree to be planted in the UK to be
dedicated to you.
This offer and the provision of a facility to communicate with
shareholders electronically, does not discriminate between registered
shareholders of the same class. The facility is available to all registered
shareholders on equal terms and participation is made as simple as

the relevant page on our website. A similar procedure will be followed
for future shareholder documentation. There are no particular software
requirements to view these documents, other than those described
and available on our website www.wolseley.com. Shareholders wishing
to continue to receive shareholder information in the traditional paper
format should take no action. 
Before electing for electronic communication, shareholders should
ensure that they have the appropriate computer capabilities. The
Company takes all reasonable precautions to ensure no viruses are
present in any communication it sends out, but cannot accept any
responsibility for loss or damage arising from the opening or use of
any e-mail or attachments from the Company and recommends that
shareholders subject all messages to virus checking procedures prior
to use. Please note that any electronic communication sent by a
shareholder to the Company or the Registrar containing a computer
virus will not be accepted.
The Company’s obligation is satisfied when it transmits an electronic
message. It cannot be held responsible for a failure in transmission
beyond its control. In the event that the Company becomes aware
that an electronic transmission is not successfully transmitted, a paper
notification will be sent to the shareholder at their registered address.

revert to sending paper documentation by post, whenever the Board
considers it necessary or desirable to do so.

 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Transforming Performance 
Helping our customers to achieve 
operational excellence
 “The past year was transformational for Invensys. The disposal of Invensys Rail 
for £1,7 42 million has enabled us to deal with our legacy UK pension issues, 
recommend a substantial return of cash to shareholders and provided us with 
signiﬁ cant funds to invest in our future. It has also allowed us to carry out a 
reorganisation of the Group, removing our previous divisional structure and 
providing signiﬁ cant cost savings of £25 million per annum by April 2014.
 “Invensys is now a focused supplier of industrial software, systems and control 
equipment, delivering state-of-the-art technologies to the world’s major industries. 
The lines of business structure we began to put in place last year has enabled 
us to concentrate upon those areas with the greatest opportunities for growth and 
proﬁ tability. We now have signiﬁ cant resources to invest in these businesses which 
we will do in a thoughtful and disciplined manner to enhance shareholder value.”
Wayne Edmunds, Chief Executive
Everything that we do is about 
enhancing our customers’ 
productivity 
From oil reﬁ neries and power stations to 
mining companies and appliance 
manufacturers, Invensys’ market-leading 
software, systems and controls help to 
give  our customers a competitive edge by 
speeding up their processes, improving 
accuracy, saving time, cutting waste and 
boosting their safety and sustainability 
performances.
Our long-term sustainable growth will continue 
to come from two key drivers: in the developed 
world we have a considerable base of 
customers who are continually seeking 
to  improve the efﬁ ciency of their existing 
plants, products and facilities; and in rapidly 
developing economies such as India and 
China we are seeing greater demand for 
our  technologies from customers as a result 
of  the  urbanisation and industrialisation taking 
place there. 
With a deep understanding of our customers’ 
industries and their business needs, together 
with an absolute commitment to safety and 
project execution excellence, Invensys is 
well-positioned to capitalise on markets with 
long-term structural growth prospects.
We work with 
• 23 of the top 25 petroleum companies
• 48 of the top 50 chemical companies
• 18 of the top 20 pharmaceutical 
companies
• 35 of the top 50 nuclear power plants
• All of the top 10 mining companies
• 7 of the top 10 appliance 
manufacturers
We enable 
• 20% of the world’s electricity 
generation
• 18% of the world’s crude oil reﬁ ning
• 37% of the world’s nuclear energy 
generation
• 62% of the world’s liqueﬁ ed natural 
gas production
• 23% of the world’s chemical 
production

Overview Chairman’s Statement 
A transformational year for Invensys
 “The past year was transformational for Invensys. 
Going forward, one of the major priorities of your 
Board will be to ensure that the investment of funds 
from the Invensys Rail disposal continues to build 
upon the signiﬁ cant increase in shareholder value 
that has already taken place.”

Dear Shareholder
The past year has undoubtedly been 
transformational for Invensys. 
Our decision to sell Invensys Rail to Siemens 
for £1,742 million followed a detailed strategic 
review that concluded that a disposal would 
be the best way of maximising value for 
shareholders. As a result, we have been able 
to deal with our legacy UK pension issues in 
a way that has been acceptable to our 
shareholders, the Trustee and the Pension 
Regulator. We will also be returning £625 
million of cash to shareholders and we will still 
retain substantial funds to invest in our more 
focused technology businesses both 
organically and through acquisitions. Going 
forward, one of the major priorities of your 
Board will be to ensure that the investment 
of these funds continues to build upon the 
signiﬁ cant increase in shareholder value that 
has already taken place.
06 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The Board
There were no changes to the membership 
of the Board during the year.
Francesco Caio and Pat Zito have informed 
the Board that they do not intend to seek 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) and accordingly will be retiring from 
the Board at the close of that meeting. Given 
the smaller size of the Group following the 
disposal of Invensys Rail, we have decided 
that they will not be replaced and the future 
Board will now consist of the Chairman, three 
executive directors and ﬁ ve non-executive 
directors.
The Board would like to thank Francesco and 
Pat for their contributions to the Board and we 
wish them well for the future.
Our people
The achievements of the past year reﬂ ect the 
efforts of everyone at Invensys. Many were 
involved in the disposal of Invensys Rail and 
the subsequent reorganisation and all were 
responsible for ensuring that our daily 
business was not affected by these activities. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all 
of Invensys' people for contributing to such a 
transformational year.
Dividend and dividend policy
The Board has recommended a ﬁ nal dividend 
of 2.85 pence per share, amounting to 
£23 million, which brings the total dividends 
payable in respect of the year ended 31 March 
2013 to 4.6 pence per share (2012: 4.4 pence 
per share), an increase of 5%. The amount 
paid per share could increase dependent 
upon the share capital consolidation as 
detailed below.
If the return of cash to shareholders and 
subsequent share capital consolidation are 
approved by shareholders and take place as 
planned, the Board has recommended that 
the total amount of the ﬁ nal dividend will 
remain the same, £23 million, but will be paid 
on the smaller number of shares in issue 
resulting from the share consolidation. 
Therefore the amount paid per share would 
increase and details of these changes will be 
set out in the circular to shareholders to be 
issued regarding the return of cash.
Subject to approval by shareholders at the 
AGM on 25 July 2013, the ﬁ nal dividend will 
be  paid on 2 August 2013 to shareholders 
on  the register at 21 June 2013. A dividend 
reinvestment plan (DRIP) is available for this 
ﬁ nal dividend, which will enable shareholders 
to reinvest their dividends directly into 
Invensys  shares. 
The Board remains committed to a 
progressive dividend policy with future 
dividend growth reﬂ ecting the long-term 
sustainable trend in underlying earnings 
per  share and free cash ﬂ ow. 
Outlook
Looking ahead, we do not expect any 
signiﬁ cant changes to general market 
conditions in the near term but anticipate 
an improved performance due to continued 
growth in our higher-margin segments, 
especially Software, and the beneﬁ ts 
of the Group reorganisation.
We expect our Software segment to show 
good growth supported by our customers’ 
requirements for optimisation, efﬁ ciency 
and productivity. The Industrial Automation 
segment is likely to see continued strength in 
its brownﬁ eld revenue stream which will be 
offset by an anticipated decline in revenue 
from large greenﬁ eld projects such as China 
Nuclear; however, margins should improve 
due to the improved sales mix. Energy 
Controls is likely to be stable as management 
works to consolidate the range of businesses 
and drive market and technology synergies. 
Appliance is expected to see modest growth 
helped by somewhat improved conditions in 
North America.

Overview Chief Executive’s Statement
A thoughtful and disciplined approach 
to investing
 “In order to give the market greater insight into the 
performances of our businesses and their value, we 
have now changed our operating model and ﬁ nancial 
reporting with the lines of business grouped into 
four new business segments – Software, Industrial 
Automation, Energy Controls and Appliance.”
Wayne Edmunds, Chief Executive
The past year was transformational for 
Invensys. The disposal of Invensys Rail 
for £1,742 million has enabled us to deal 
with our legacy UK pension issues, 
recommend a substantial return of cash 
to shareholders and provided us with 
signiﬁ cant funds to invest in our future. 
It has also allowed us to carry out a 
reorganisation of the Group, removing our  
previous divisional structure and 
providing signiﬁ cant cost savings of 
£25 million per annum by April 2014.
Invensys is now a focused supplier of industrial 
software, systems and control equipment, 
delivering state-of-the-art technologies to the 
world’s major industries. The lines of business 
structure we began to put in place last year has 
enabled us to concentrate upon those areas 
with the greatest opportunities for growth and 
proﬁ tability. We now have signiﬁ cant resources 
to invest in these businesses which we will do in 
a thoughtful and disciplined manner to enhance 
shareholder value.
Disposal of Invensys Rail
Following a strategic review which highlighted 
the likely consolidation in the global rail 
signalling market and the limited scope to 
increase the size of the Invensys Rail division, 
we decided to refocus the Group around 
our industrial software, systems and control 
equipment businesses and, accordingly, 
to dispose of Invensys Rail.

08 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 On 28 November 2012, we announced 
that we had reached agreement to sell 
the business to Siemens for £1,7 42 million 
on a cash and debt free basis. That price 
represented an attractive value for the 
business and fully recognised Invensys Rail’s 
leading positions in long-term growth markets 
with returns ahead of its peers and well-
invested technology. The disposal was 
completed on 2 May 2013  and therefore the 
results of Invensys Rail have been included in 
discontinued operations with comparatives 
restated accordingly.
Following completion, a contribution of 
£400 million has been made to the UK 
Pension Scheme and a further payment of 
£225 million has been made into a reservoir 
trust. As a result of these payments, the 
previous deﬁ cit reduction payments of 
£40-47 million per annum have ceased and 
it  is anticipated that no further contributions 
will be payable into the Scheme for the 
foreseeable future. More details of the pension 
arrangements are contained in the Financial 
Review on page 26.
As previously announced, we now intend to 
return £625 million of cash to shareholders 
and information on the return of cash will be 
set out in a circular to shareholders which will 
be issued as soon as practicable. The return 
of cash is subject to the approval of Invensys 
shareholders at a General Meeting which is 
expected to take place in June 2013. It is 
intended that shareholders will be able to elect 
to receive their cash as income, capital or 
deferred capital or a combination of the three. 
Following the return of cash, we are proposing 
a share capital consolidation that, subject to 
market ﬂ uctuations, will result in the share 
price being returned to approximately the 
same level as before the return of cash. 
Reorganisation and revised business 
segment reporting
Following last year’s creation of individual 
lines of business within our divisions to bring 
additional focus upon our leading brands 
and technologies, the disposal of Invensys 
Rail  has enabled us to take the further step 
of removing our former divisional structure. 
This reorganisation will give rise to signiﬁ cant 
savings of around £25 million per annum by 
April 2014. 
As a result, we have changed our external 
reporting from 1 April 2013 to reﬂ ect the new 
basis on which information will be reported 
internally. We will group our lines of business 
into four new business segments. This 
grouping brings together businesses with 
similar economic characteristics, operating 
margins, market drivers and technologies as 
well as providing greater transparency as to 
the true value of our market-leading 
businesses:
• Software which consists of the software 
businesses previously within Invensys 
Operations Management and includes our 
Wonderware
®
, SimSci
TM
 and Avantis
®
 
brands.
• Industrial Automation which consists 
of the systems businesses of our Foxboro
®
 
distributed control systems (DCS) and 
Triconex
®
 safety systems with the addition 
of the Foxboro measurement and 
instrumentation products previously 
within  the equipment business of Invensys 
Operations Management.
• Energy Controls which consists of 
the Eurotherm
®
 and IMServ
®
 businesses 
previously included within the equipment 
business of Invensys Operations 
Management, together with the residential 
heating and commercial businesses that 
were formerly part of Invensys Controls.
• Appliance which consists of the Appliance 
controls line of business previously within 
Invensys Controls, together with the 
appliance replacement parts business 
formerly within Wholesale, also part of the 
former Invensys Controls.
Although the commentary on the past year’s 
performance contained in this Annual Report 
and Accounts is based upon the previous 
reporting structure, we will be using these 
new  business segments for future reporting. 
The past year ’s performance by new business 
segment, together with an estimate of the 
allocation of cost savings from the Group 
reorganisation is shown on page 23 in the 
Financial Review. 
Looking ahead
As a focused supplier of industrial software, 
systems and control equipment to the world’s 
major industries, we will be focusing our 
investment on growing those lines of business 
which offer attractive long-term growth 
prospects with high returns on investment 
and excellent cash conversion. In particular, 
we will focus on expanding the breadth 
and depth of our higher-margin software 
businesses, which represent a major engine 
of future growth.  
Our long-term sustainable growth will 
therefore be driven by maintaining and 
developing our leading technologies; 
focusing on project and commercial 
execution excellence; developing our portfolio 
through bolt-on acquisitions; supporting and 
expanding our customer base and growing 
our business in emerging markets.
Operationally and ﬁ nancially, Invensys is 
now well  placed to capitalise on markets 
with long-term structural growth prospects 
and deliver further value for shareholders.

Everything that we do is about enhancing our customers’ 
productivity and proﬁ tability
Who are we?

company that works in partnership

control and automate their 
products and processes, thereby 
maximising safety, efﬁ ciency, 
reliability and ease of use.

industries and their business needs, our 
long-term sustainable growth is driven 
by an absolute commitment to project and

the opportunity to streamline the organisation 
and create an operational and ﬁ nancial 
structure that enables us to make substantial 
cost savings while providing greater 
transparency as to the true value of our 
market-leading businesses.
Whereas previously Invensys had three

complement our own portfolio.
12 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Commercial
Our Commercial line of business designs and 
supplies a range of controls under the Eliwell 
and Ranco brands for use in refrigeration, 
heating, ventilation and air-conditioning. 
Our customers are original equipment 
manufacturers, large project installers and 
systems integrators in the food preservation, 
food preparation and comfort sectors.
Our growth in Commercial will be driven by 
geographic expansion and the introduction 
of new products such as wireless-based 
solutions for refrigerated transportation.
Residential
Our Residential line of business designs, 
manufactures and distributes heating controls 
under the Drayton, Eberle and Robertshaw 
brands, including room thermostats, time 
controls, thermostatic radiator valves and 
under-ﬂ oor heating controls, predominantly 
for use in homes.
Our growth in Residential will be driven by 
geographic expansion and the introduction of 
new products based on smart home energy 
monitoring and control systems.
Monitoring
Our IMServ business provides data 
measurement, visualisation and control 
services for large industrial, commercial 
and retail energy users, as well as full market 
settlement services for managing wholesale 
electricity trading.

Our Appliance business is the world’s largest 
supplier of components and systems that 
control the operation of appliances, including 
cooking, refrigeration, laundry and 
dishwashing, in both the residential 
and commercial sectors. 
We supply the mid- to high-end of the home 
appliance market, providing seven of the 
world’s top 10 appliance manufacturers with 
components and systems that enhance their 
appliances by improving their operating and 
sustainability performances.
Our business model
How do we generate revenue?
Our revenue can be broken down as follows: 
15% Software, 53% Industrial Automation, 
14% Energy Controls and 18% Appliance.
Our customers are primarily large, global 
companies with complex production 
processes spanning a broad range of 
industries, including oil reﬁ neries; chemical, 
gas, liqueﬁ ed natural gas (LNG), power, 
pharmaceutical and mineral processors; 
food and drinks companies; appliance 
manufacturers; metals and mining companies; 
water and wastewater facilities; and pulp and 
paper mills.
Our businesses are well-positioned to 
capitalise on markets that have long-term 
structural growth prospects. Speciﬁ cally, 
our markets in oil, gas and power will continue 
to be driven by the need for new greenﬁ eld 
capacity in rapidly developing economies 
such as India and China and by our existing 
customers’ desire to maximise the efﬁ ciency 
of their brownﬁ eld sites in the developed 
world.
During the year, 12% of the Group’s revenue 
from continuing operations came from large 
contracts, deﬁ ned by us as those in excess 
of £10 million. These large contracts sit within 
our Industrial Automation business segment.
Our route to market varies by product:
• Our Software routes to market vary 
depending upon the solution and are either 
direct or indirect through distributors and 
systems integrators;
• The majority of our Industrial Automation 
sales are direct;
• Our Energy Controls sales are largely 
indirect through distributors; and
• Our Appliance sales are primarily direct 
to original equipment manufacturers.

Overview Our Business Model continued
What is our strategy?
The sale of Invensys Rail to Siemens for 
£1,742 million has been transformational 
for Invensys. In summary, it has enabled us 
to deal with the Group’s legacy UK pension 
issues, return cash to shareholders and 
enable signiﬁ cant investment in our refocused 
strategy on our higher-margin, faster-growth 
markets. The sale is also enabling us to 
simplify the Group’s management structure 
and make substantial cost savings, while 
creating an operational and ﬁ nancial structure 
that provides greater transparency as to the 
true value of our market-leading businesses.
In our Appliance segment we will be looking 
to build upon the signiﬁ cant investments that 
we have made in restructuring and product 
development during the last ﬁ ve years. 
Demand in its markets remains subdued but 
our investments will ensure that its operating 
performance will improve signiﬁ cantly as the 
appliance market recovers.
We will now be focusing our investment 
on growing the lines of business within our 
Software, Industrial Automation and Energy 
Controls business segments, which offer 
attractive long-term growth prospects with 
high returns on investment and excellent cash 
conversion. Our long-term sustainable growth 
will therefore be driven by:
Growth in software
We will be focusing on expanding the breadth 
and depth of our higher-margin software 
businesses, which represent a major engine of 
future growth. We will achieve this through 
acquisitions and additional investment in 
research and development.
Maintaining and developing 
leading  technologies
As a leading technology company, research 
and development is fundamental to what 
we do, so we will continue to invest in our 
state-of-the-art technologies to ensure that 
they remain  “best in class ” and are evolving to 
meet the needs of our customers in both the 
developed world and in rapidly developing 
economies, such as China and India. During 
the year, we invested 4.5% of continuing 
operations revenue on research and 
development (2012: 4.2%); in Software, the 
investment was 19.3% of segment revenue.
Project and commercial 
execution  excellence
Project and commercial execution excellence 
sits at the heart of our long-term sustainable 
growth strategy and it will continue to drive our 
reputation as a partner of choice. We will 
therefore be continuing to invest in employing 
the best people for each project and providing 
them with the delivery support they need to 
achieve consistently high levels of customer 
satisfaction.
Developing our portfolio 
through  acquisition
We will supplement our organic growth by 
pursuing an active but disciplined programme 
of bolt-on acquisitions designed to broaden 
and enhance our market positions and 
product ranges, predominantly in our 
Software and Energy Controls business 
segments.
Supporting and expanding our 
customer base
We have a considerable base of customers 
whose prime focus is on maximising the 
reliability and efﬁ ciency of their existing plants 
and facilities. As a result, the opportunities for 
upgrading or replacing their control and safety 
technologies are signiﬁ cant and we will 
continue to provide them with outstanding 
service and support in order to capitalise 
on this. We will also continue to secure new 
greenﬁ eld contracts to expand our base 
of installed technologies and provide further 
opportunities for selling other products.
In addition, we will seek to expand into 
new industry sectors. Currently, 39% of our 
revenue from continuing operations comes 
from the oil & gas, petrochemicals and utilities 
& power sectors. Our aim is to acquire strong 
positions in new sectors by broadening our 
Software product range.

Invensys Operations Management 
improved in the second half to produce 
orders in line with last year but Invensys 
Controls experienced a further market-led 
decline.
The value of orders received from binding 
contractual agreements with customers in the 
year. This excludes blanket orders (e.g. from 
OEMs) unless there is a ﬁ rm commitment for

Invensys Controls enabling us to meet our 
medium-term target of 90%. 
Operating cash ﬂ ow divided by 
operating proﬁ t.
This measures our efﬁ ciency in generating 
operating cash from our operating proﬁ t.
Free cash ﬂ ow (£m) Free cash ﬂ ow was £106 million 
(2012: £11 million outﬂ ow).
The increased free cash ﬂ ow was driven by 
higher operating cash ﬂ ow, lower pension 
contributions into the Invensys Pension 
Plan (US), and lower legacy item costs.
Operating cash ﬂ ow less cash costs of net 
ﬁ nance costs paid, taxation paid, exceptional 
items and legacy items paid.
This indicates the level of cash that can 
be used to enhance shareholder value 
e.g. through dividends, acquisitions, changes 
to capital structure.
Earnings per share (EPS) — underlying (p) Underlying EPS were 8.5p (2012: 5.3p), 
up 60%.
The increase was driven by improved 
operating proﬁ t, offset by higher IAS 19 
ﬁ nance charges.
Earnings per share before the exceptional Group

We are reporting our performance for the 
year ended 31 March 2013 on the basis of 
the Group management structure during 
that year. 
From 1 April 2013, we have changed the 
Group management structure and our 
future reporting of performance will 
reﬂ ect the four new business segments, 
namely Software, Industrial Automation, 
Energy Controls and Appliance.
Markets
Despite the continued macroeconomic 
uncertainty in Europe, the outlook for the 
global industrial automation and software 
markets was unchanged in the year. Demand 
is being driven in emerging markets by 
greenﬁ eld investment for capacity expansion 
in the energy sectors and brownﬁ eld 
investment in increased efﬁ ciency in 
a broad range of markets elsewhere.
In Systems, the ever-increasing demands for 
energy in the Middle East, Brazil, India and 
China should make them the strongest growth 
markets with signs that the recent delays we 
have seen in the award of larger greenﬁ eld 
projects are coming to an end. In developed 
markets, ageing assets, new sources of 
energy and our customers’ strong cash 
positions continue to drive service, upgrade 
and migration business.
The industrial software markets have not been 
affected by economic uncertainty with strong 
demand for simulation and optimisation 
software to improve the reliability and 
performance of existing assets. This is a 
signiﬁ cant area of focus and investment as 
the markets show strong resilience and high 
returns on investment, as demonstrated by 
our recent acquisition of Spiral Software. 
Our equipment markets have seen some slight 
reductions in demand, particularly resulting 
from the economic difﬁ culties in Europe which 
have affected sales of Eurotherm products.

18 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Developments
The delivery of control and safety systems to 
eight nuclear reactors in China has continued 
in accordance with the revised project plans 
put in place in January 2012. On each of the 
three contracts, we are making good progress 
with no further signiﬁ cant issues identiﬁ ed. 
Although we are continuing to invest in 
working capital to progress these contracts, 
with the consequent adverse effect on 
operating cash ﬂ ow, we did reach some key 
payment milestones in the second half of the 
year which contributed to the improvement in 
the division’s cash conversion in the second 
half. We are continuing with our decision not 
to recognise any proﬁ ts from the two later 
contracts until we have achieved key 
milestones on the ﬁ rst reactor.
During the year, we acquired Spiral Software, 
a privately held company based in Cambridge, 
UK, which expanded our simulation and 
optimisation offerings. Founded in 1998, Spiral 
Software provides integrated solutions ranging 
from crude assay management to reﬁ nery 
supply chain optimisation, enabling clients to 
make the best possible choices in trading and 
reﬁ ning crude oil. It provides the only 
integrated reﬁ ning-industry solution designed 
from the ground up, bringing together 
feedstock data management, planning and 
scheduling. This means that our offerings will 
now fully support and optimise the entire 
reﬁ ning value chain, from crude trading to 
supply chain distribution, including lifecycle 
modelling from design to start-up to 
performance optimisation. 
Performance
Following a decline in orders in the ﬁ rst half 
caused primarily by the absence of large 
greenﬁ eld project awards, order intake 
improved in the second half so that overall 
orders for the year were in line with last year 
at £1,254 million (2012: £1,266 million). 
Revenue in the year was up 6% at CER to 
£1,335 million (2012: £1,272 million). Software 
had another strong year with revenue up 15%. 
Systems revenue rose 6% at CER helped by 
the execution of large projects which 
accounted for 16% of divisional revenue. 
Equipment revenue declined by 2% mainly 
due to a shortfall at Eurotherm in Europe and 
North America. 
Operating proﬁ t showed a signiﬁ cant recovery 
compared to the prior year which was affected 
by the £40 million additional costs in respect 
of our nuclear projects in China. Operating 
proﬁ t was up 51% at CER at £146 million 
(2012: £96 million) and operating margin 
was 10.9% (2012: 7 .5%); our decision not to 
recognise any proﬁ ts on the second and third 
China Nuclear contracts diluted divisional 
margins by around 50 basis points. 
Operating cash ﬂ ow remained robust 
at £132 million (2012: £123 million) 
notwithstanding some further net outﬂ ows 
on the China Nuclear projects ahead of the 
achievement of payment milestones. Cash 
conversion for the year was 90% (2012: 128%).

A satisfactory performance in difﬁ cult end markets
Markets
The North American appliance market was 
more stable during the year than in previous 
periods but remained weak with little or no 
recovery despite early signs of improving 
sentiment within residential markets, 
particularly in the US. This improved sentiment 
is focused upon the new residential market 
which has little impact upon our target market 
of mid- to higher-end appliances. In Europe 
and Asia, the appliance market remained 
weak with few signs of any recovery in the 
short term but South America held up well due 
in part to government tax incentives in Brazil 
which are due to expire in June 2013.
The commercial markets in North America 
and Europe improved but our performance 
was affected by the knock-on effect of delays 
in new product launches by some customers. 
Our wholesale markets saw some improving 
conditions as the year progressed but were 
generally held back by lower demand in the 
heating season. 
Looking forward, based upon customer 
comments, we expect the appliance markets 
in North America to see some modest 
improvements and in Europe to be stable 
or slightly declining. In Commercial and 
Wholesale, we expect further improvement 
supported by several key new product 
launches in the commercial business delayed 
beyond our year end.
Developments
The continued weakness in the appliance 
markets has led us to take further actions 
to mitigate costs and improve efﬁ ciency. 
In Europe, we took the decision to close 
the Belluno factory in Italy and move 
manufacturing to other plants. Elsewhere 
we have been reducing the size of certain 
facilities and investing in high-speed electronic 
production capabilities which will reduce unit 
cost and improve quality.
The investment in new product development 
resulted in new products representing 13% of 
the division’s revenue in the year which is in 
line with the prior year, despite some delays 
within Commercial and Appliance. 
We have continued our focus on innovation 
and, following our work with Thermo King in 
applying wireless and remote monitoring 
technologies to refrigerated transportation, 
Invensys Controls has worked with Verizon to 
create a new application for our Centeron tank 
monitoring system, using radio and sensor 
technology to remotely track fuel levels in a 
company’s tanks. 
Performance
Orders during the year were £446 million 
(2012: £493 million), down 7% at CER 
reﬂ ecting the continued downturn in end 
markets and the effect of delays in new 
product introductions in Commercial and 
Appliance. Revenue was £457 million 
(2012: £492 million), a 5% decrease at CER 
and the order book at 31 March 2013 was 
£57 million (31 March 2012: £70 million). 
Operating proﬁ t was down 21% at CER to 
£27 million (2012: £35 million) with the effect 
of the reduced revenue and the lower than 
expected new product revenue in Commercial 
and Appliance partially offset by tight control 
of operating costs and overheads. Operating 
margin was 5.9% (2012: 7 .1%). Operating cash 
ﬂ ow was £31 million (2012: £49 million) with 
cash conversion at 115% (2012: 140%).

Performance
Following the near record level of orders in

in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, order intake during 
the year continued at high levels at £905 
million (2012: £991 million). As a consequence, 
the order book at 31 March 2013 increased to 
£1,374 million (31 March 2012: £1,202 million). 
Revenue in the period was down 1% at CER 
at £757 million (2012: £775 million) with good 
growth in products sales in North America 
offset by a further reduction in Spain due to 
government austerity measures and the 
expected delays in mobilisation on some of 
the large new market contracts won last year.

Business Review Financial Review 
Simplifying our ﬁ nancial position
Introduction and summary
As reﬂ ected in our key performance 
indicator trends, the Group has 
performed well against a background of 
challenging economic conditions and 
ended the year with £268 million of net 
cash. As seen in our business division 
reviews on pages 18 to 21, performances 
by our divisions have been inﬂ uenced by 
a number of factors. The performance 
of Invensys Rail was particularly strong 
in all aspects and was reﬂ ected in the 
value of the business which was 
realised on disposal.
 “This has been a year of signiﬁ cant change 
for the Group with the disposal of Invensys Rail; 
a fundamental Group reorganisation into our new 
lines of business structure, and the resolution 
of our legacy pension issues.”
David Thomas, Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer
The disposal of the Invensys Rail division was 
completed on 2 May 2013 with a provisional 
gain on sale of £1.4 billion. The results of 
Invensys Rail are reported in discontinued 
operations with the assets and liabilities of the 
business reported as held for sale at 31 March 
2013. We are now proceeding with the return 
of £625 million of cash to shareholders which, 
subject to shareholder approval, is anticipated 
in June 2013.
We have used £625 million of the proceeds 
from the Invensys Rail disposal to provide 
funding for our UK Pension Scheme. £400 
million has been paid directly into the Scheme, 
with a further £225 million paid into a reservoir 
trust to provide security in favour of the 
Pension Trustee to cover any remaining deﬁ cit 
and act as a buffer for future contingencies. As 
a result of these actions, the deﬁ cit reduction 
payments, £41 million paid this year, have now 
ceased and it is anticipated that no further 
contributions will be payable to the Scheme 
until 2018 at the earliest. It is expected that the 
reservoir trust will remove any need for the 
Group to make future deﬁ cit reduction 
payments for the foreseeable future. In 
addition to the main pension scheme funding 
arrangements, we have continued to manage 
other pension liabilities. Around £180 million of 
gross liabilities have been transferred on the 
disposal. In respect of our Invensys Pension 
Plan (US), we have recently concluded the 
planned second phase of a settlement to 
deferred members which has, in total, 
extinguished £133 million of liabilities.

4 Return on operating capital at CER is calculated as OPBIT divided by average capital employed excluding goodwill, net pension liabilities, non-operating provisions and net taxation liabilities.
The balance of cash from the Invensys 
Rail disposal will be used to accelerate the 
strategic development of the continuing 
Group with investment to grow the business 
organically and through bolt-on acquisitions.
The new lines of business structure has been 
established effective 1 April 2013 and will be 
reported in the business segments of 
Software, Industrial Automation, Energy 
Controls and Appliance. Financial information 
for these segments is shown below. This 
fundamental reorganisation of the Group 
resulted in £32 million of restructuring costs, 
impairments of £12 million following a detailed 
review of investments for the new lines of 
business, and £31 million of provisions for 
legacy matters designed to bring to a 
conclusion on-going charges for these 
items.  We expect annualised net savings of 
£25  million by April 2014, with approximately 
£20 million of this realised in 2013/14.
Against this background of change across 
Invensys, I would like to acknowledge the 
contribution of the ﬁ nance teams who 
supported these projects while continuing to 
maintain and enhance operations and internal 
controls.
In terms of our divisions, Invensys Operations 
Management experienced good growth 
across all of its main lines of business 
delivering an operating margin of 10.9%. Our 
decision not to recognise any proﬁ ts on our 
large, complex China Nuclear project has 
diluted this margin by about 50 basis points, 
though I am pleased to report that the 
contracts have stabilised after the signiﬁ cant 
provisions booked last year.
Weakening consumer conﬁ dence continues to 
adversely impact Invensys Controls revenue 
performance along with some delays in new 
product introductions in the Appliance and 
Commercial lines of business. Cost actions 
taken in the prior periods have mitigated the 
impact on operating proﬁ t.
The Group has continued to invest in research 
and development to support its technology 
base, with spend during the year amounting to 
4.5% of revenue (2012: 4.2%).
Following the signing of the sale agreement 
with Siemens, Invensys Rail was moved to 
discontinued operations on 28 November 
2012. Notwithstanding the disposal process, 
it  is pleasing to report a near record order 
intake, and the year closes with a strong 
order  book. 
The Group closed the year with a net cash 
balance of £268 million. Although our cash 
performance in the ﬁ rst half was disappointing, 
we achieved 141% cash conversion of 
operating proﬁ t in the second half. Looking 
forward, the ﬁ rst half is again expected to be 
challenging due to the timing of the underlying 
invoicing milestones on China Nuclear.

Capital is managed under the Group’s treasury policy. The policy sets out a strategy for the long-term funding of the Group, with the objective 
of ensuring the Group has access to appropriate sources of funding to support its business, as and when required. The Group’s bank facilities 
expire in March 2017 . Following completion of the sale of the Invensys Rail division on 2 May 2013, the Group’s revolving credit facility was reduced 
by £100 million to £150 million reﬂ ecting reduced working capital requirements. The Group’s guarantee facility remains at £350 million.
Exceptional items
The exceptional charge for the year totalled 
£88 million ( 2012: £33 million) comprising 
£75 million in respect of the Group 
reorganisation and £13 million of other items.
The £75 million charge for the Group 
reorganisation included restructuring costs of 
£32 million, asset impairments of £12 million 
(intangible assets of £9 million and property, 
plant and equipment of £3 million), and other 
operating exceptional items of £31 million 
relating to additional environmental and 
surplus property provisions following a 
detailed review of our facility portfolio.
Other exceptional items of £13 million included 
£16 million of restructuring (the closure of 
Invensys Controls’ Belluno facility in Italy and a 
number of other rationalisation projects across 
the Group) and a past service cost of £3 
million relating to the closure of a Canadian 
pension plan, offset by a settlement gain of 
£10 million relating to the Invensys Pension 
Plan (US) and a gain on some asset sales.
The comparative period included restructuring 
costs of £18 million; £5 million of property, 
plant and equipment impairment; and £9 
million of other operating exceptional items, 
including a £3 million settlement loss relating 
to the Invensys Pension Plan (US).
Net ﬁ nance costs
Net ﬁ nance costs remained ﬂ at at £9 million 
(2012: £9 million). Lower ﬁ nance income 
reﬂ ected reduced cash balances during 
the  year. 2012 included the write-off of 
unamortised facility fees of £2 million.
Other ﬁ nance charges – IAS 19
IAS 19 ﬁ nance charges increased to 
£19 million as anticipated (2012: £4 million). 
The expected return on assets fell further 
than the discount rate, mainly due to falls 
in bond yields.
The changes to the accounting standard 
IAS  19, Employee Beneﬁ ts (Revised) will apply 
from 2013/14. We estimate that our operating 
proﬁ t will be reduced by approximately 
£10  million as a result of this change; this 
is  a  non-cash item.
Taxation
The tax charge for continuing operations was 
£11 million (2012: £8 million), which comprised 
a current year income tax charge of £31 million 
(2012: £37 million), offset by prior year credits 
of £6 million (2012: £nil) and a deferred tax 
credit of £14 million (2012: £29 million).  The 
Group is subject to several factors that affect 
the tax charge including the levels and mix of 
proﬁ tability in different jurisdictions and the 
availability of tax losses.  The effective  tax rate 
has been impacted by the Group 
reorganisation costs and tax implications of 
the disposal of Invensys Rail.  The underlying 
effective tax rate for the Group, after excluding 
the £75 million of Group reorganisation costs 
and the £48 million deferred tax credit arising 
on the expected gain on sale, was 20% (2012: 
25%).  The prior year included the impact of the 
proﬁ t adjustment on our nuclear projects 
in  China.
Discontinued operations
The proﬁ t from discontinued operations of 
£124 million (2012: £60 million) represent ed the 
results of Invensys Rail, with the increase in net 
earnings reﬂ ecting the improved performance 
of the business and a deferred tax credit of 
£48 million arising on the expected utilisation 
of tax losses on the gain on sale.
Net proﬁ t
Net proﬁ t increased to £128 million (2012: £99 
million), arising from an increase in operating 
proﬁ t before exceptional items of £38 million 
and an increase in proﬁ t from discontinued 
operations of £64 million (including a £48 
million deferred tax credit), offset by higher 
exceptional items of £55 million as a result of 
Group reorganisation costs and an increase in 
the IAS 19 ﬁ nance charge of £15 million.
Earnings per share
Basic EPS from continuing operations w ere 
0.1 pence per share (2012: 4.7 pence per 
share). Underlying EPS w ere 8.5 pence per 
share (2012: 5.3 pence per share).
Free cash ﬂ ow
Free cash ﬂ ow for the year was £106 million 
(2012: £11 million outﬂ ow). The increased free 
cash ﬂ ow was driven by higher operating cash 
ﬂ ow, lower pension contributions into the 
Invensys Pension Plan (US), and lower legacy 
item costs.
Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 25
Business Review Financial Review continued
Total equity
Total equity increased by £29 million, 
principally due to net proﬁ t of £128 million, 
offset by IAS 19 actuarial losses of £97 million 
and dividends paid to equity shareholders of 
£37 million.
Non-controlling interests
The non-controlling interests balance was 
£20 million (2012: £20 million), the majority 
of which relates to Ranco Japan Limited.
Net cash
Net cash was £268 million (2012: £262 million) 
with the cost of acquisitions and dividends 
paid covered by free cash ﬂ ow. 
Capital employed
Capital employed increased by £23 million 
to  £337 million in the year, mainly attributable 
to the proﬁ t in the year of £128 million and 
foreign exchange gain of £18 million, partially 
offset by pension scheme losses of 
£97  million. Capital employed for continuing 
operations of £162  million (2012: £314 million) 
includes operating capital of £214 million 
(2012: £259 million), generating a return 
of  32.1% (201 2: 22.0%).
Pension liabilities and funding
The IAS 19 valuation of pension assets 
and liabilities as at 31 March 2013 resulted 
in a net pension liability of £477 million 
(2012: £426 million). Of this, £50 million has 
been classiﬁ ed as assets held for sale. The 
overall increase is the result of net actuarial 
losses of £127 million, partially offset by deﬁ cit 
reduction payments made throughout the year 
of £62 million.
Agreements with the Trustee of the UK 
Pension Scheme have been implemented with 
payments of £225 million made to a reservoir 
trust on 2 May 2013 and £400 million made 
to the UK Pension Scheme on 3 May 2013. 
No further deﬁ cit reduction payments are 
expected to be made in the foreseeable future.
In the Invensys Pension Plan (US), we have 
reached a further settlement with a number 
of deferred plan members in addition to that 
disclosed last year. These taken together have 
resulted in settlement payments during the 
year totalling £123 million, of which £60 million 
is in respect of the settlement agreed last year. 
Both payments have been made from scheme 
assets. This year’s settlement gave rise to an 
exceptional gain of £10 million (2012: 
exceptional loss of £3 million). In addition, 
a number of smaller schemes were closed 
during the year and are in the process of 
being wound up.
As part of the requirements of the Invensys 
Rail disposal, a funding valuation of the 
Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) was 
undertaken effective 31 October 2012. This 
has been ﬁ nalised at a deﬁ cit of £478 million, 
well within the funding provisions of the 
Scheme.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a ﬁ nal dividend 
of 2.85 pence per share, amounting to £23 
million, which brings total dividends payable in 
respect of the year ended 31 March 2013 to 
4.6 pence per share (2012: 4.4 pence per 
share), an increase of 5%.  The amount paid 
per share could increase dependent upon the 
share capital consolidation as detailed below.
If the return of cash to shareholders and 
subsequent share capital consolidation are 
approved by shareholders and take place as 
planned, the Board has recommended that 
the total amount of the ﬁ nal dividend will 
remain the same, £23 million, but will be paid 
on the smaller number of shares in issue 
resulting from the share consolidation. 
Therefore, the amount paid per share would 
increase and details of these changes will be 
set out in the circular to shareholders to be 
issued regarding the return of cash.
Subject to approval by shareholders at the 
AGM on 25 July 2013, the ﬁ nal dividend will 
be  paid on 2 August 2013 to shareholders 
on  the register at 21 June 2013.  A dividend 
reinvestment plan (DRIP) is available 
for  this  ﬁ nal dividend, which will enable 
shareholders to reinvest their dividends 
directly into Invensys shares.
The Board remains committed to a 
progressive dividend policy with future 
dividend growth reﬂ ecting the long-term 
sustainable trend in underlying earnings per 
share and free cash ﬂ ow.
Summary and conclusions
With the transformation behind us and legacy 
matters largely addressed, we will focus 
on strong ﬁ nancial management through 
a simpler ﬁ nance structure to support the 
future growth of the Group in the new lines 
of business structure.

26 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Policies 
Statement of accounting policies
The Group’s Financial Statements have been 
prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) in issue 
that are endorsed by the European 
Commission and effective at 31 March 2013. 
The Group’s accounting policies under IFRSs 
are set out in Note 2 to the Group Financial 
Statements on pages 8 5 to 9 2. The Parent 
Company Financial Statements have been 
prepared in accordance with UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP) 
and include details of the Company’s 
accounting policies.
Treasury policy
The Group’s treasury policy is approved by 
the Board and seeks to ensure that:
• appropriate ﬁ nancial resources are available 
for the maintenance and development 
of the Group’s businesses;
• the ﬁ nancial risk of currency, interest rate 
and counterparty credit exposure is 
understood, measured and managed 
appropriately; and 
• the Treasury department operates as a cost 
centre and that no speculative transactions 
are undertaken. 
Funding, liquidity and treasury 
management
Operating within the strict controls of 
the Group’s treasury policy, the Treasury 
department manages this risk, ensuring that 
sufﬁ cient funding and liquidity is available 
to meet the expected needs of the Group 
together with a prudent level of headroom 
to allow for cash ﬂ ow and bank guarantee 
variability. In addition to the free cash ﬂ ow 
of the Group, Invensys adopts a ﬂ exible 
approach to liquidity management using 
a mixture of long-term debt facilities and 
short-term cash deposits. Funding was 
provided by a £250 million bank facility 
which matures in March 2017 . This was 
reduced to £150 million following the 
completion of the Invensys Rail disposal. 
The  undrawn level of these facilities together 
with the Group’s cash balances are the 
key  measures of the Group’s liquidity.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to risk arising from the 
effect of changes in ﬂ oating interest rates on 
the level of interest it receives on its cash 
deposits, and pays interest on its facility 
drawings.
As at 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012, 
Invensys had no signiﬁ cant borrowings.
Currency risk
Transaction exposure
Currency transaction exposure arises when 
businesses face revenue  or costs in a 
currency other than their own. The incidence 
of this risk varies across the Group and is 
subject to change. However, the majority 
of revenue and costs will usually be in the 
functional currency of the business 
undertaking the transaction. Where this is not 
the case and the exposure is signiﬁ cant, it is 
the Group’s policy for the business units to 
hedge their exposures. The Group 
predominantly uses forward currency 
contracts to manage transaction exposure. 
The Group is also subject to exchange risk 
when making bids, particularly on major 
contracts, where movements against the 
speciﬁ c exchange rate assumed within a bid 
would lead to a change in the anticipated 
margin on the contract should the bid be 
successful. If it is likely that the bid will be 
successful and the resulting foreign currency 
exposure would be signiﬁ cant then the 
currency risk will be hedged.
Translation exposure
The majority of the Group’s operating capital 
is employed in overseas locations and is 
denominated in foreign currencies, particularly 
US dollars. As a consequence, changes in 
exchange rates affect both net asset values 
and reported results.
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to risk if a counterparty 
to a ﬁ nancial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. Such a risk arises 
principally in relation to receivables due from 
customers and cash deposited with banks or 
other ﬁ nancial institutions.
This exposure has peaked following the 
receipt of the Invensys Rail disposal proceeds, 
prior to the anticipated return of cash.
The Group monitors the identity of the 
counterparties with whom it deposits cash 
and transacts other ﬁ nancial instruments so 
as to control exposure to any territory or 
institution. As far as it is both feasible and 
practical to do so, cash is held centrally by the 
Treasury department. Risk is assessed using 
ratings from major credit rating agencies. 
Further information on the risks arising from 
ﬁ nancial instruments is included in Note 19 
to the Group Financial Statements.

Business Review Corporate Responsibility 
Our approach to sustainability
Invensys is committed to the principles of economic success, environmental 
stewardship, diversity and social responsibility. We believe that by acting as 
a responsible global citizen, we will improve our performance, minimise 
business risk and enhance our reputation as a partner of choice.
Introduction and summary
As Chief Executive, I am pleased to provide 
a summary of our approach to corporate 
responsibility, governance and the progress 
we have made during the year. Corporate 
responsibility, also referred to as sustainability, 
remains central to our value proposition, 
inﬂ uencing the way we interact with our 
customers, employees, communities and 
shareholders.
We remain committed to reducing the 
environmental footprint of our operations 
and to working safely at both our own facilities 
and those of our customers. In the last year, 
we exceeded our 2% environmental key 
performance indicator (KPI) reduction targets 
at our manufacturing sites for energy use, 
carbon emissions, water use and waste 
generation. In addition, we maintained our 
leadership position in safety performance 
with our injury/illness incident frequency 
rates reﬂ ecting the effective programmes 
we have in place.
For the fourth consecutive year, Invensys 
was listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Indexes (DJSI) in recognition of our economic, 
environmental and social performance. 
In the UK, Invensys was again listed on the 
FTSE4Good Index Series, which identiﬁ es 
companies that meet recognised standards 
of corporate responsibility. And once again, 
we reported our greenhouse gas emissions 
to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 
voluntarily and renewed our participation in 
the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). 
Furthermore, our UK operations continue to 
be certiﬁ ed for our reductions in carbon 
emissions under the Carbon Trust Standard. 
We continued to invest in the development of 
our people and we improved our organisation 
effectiveness by continuing to place greater 
accountability upon our individual businesses.
Our Sustainability Report 2013, which 
will be available for download from 
our website, provides further details 
of our activities and achievements 
during the year.

28 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Our strategy and approach to 
corporate responsibility
Our strategy encompasses the following 
key elements:
• Efﬁ cient and safe solutions  – designing 
our products and services responsibly, 
improving our customers’ efﬁ ciency and 
enhancing the sustainability performance 
of our suppliers;
• Efﬁ cient and safe operations  – reducing 
the environmental footprint of our 
operations, maintaining a safe and healthy 
workplace and mitigating environmental 
impacts; 
• Investing in our employees and 
communities  – developing the potential of 
our employees, striving to attract and retain 
the best talent and engaging locally in the 
communities in which we operate; and
• Governance  – ensuring the highest 
standards of ethical and honest behaviour 
in everything we do. 
Building a successful and sustainable 
business requires strong values, strong 
governance and effective communication. 
As Chief Executive, I am responsible for driving 
Invensys’ corporate responsibility strategy, 
which is implemented by the Group 
Leadership Team with the support of key 
functions, including Environment, Health, 
Safety and Sustainability, Legal and Human 
Resources. 
Our approach to corporate governance is set 
out in the Corporate Governance section on 
pages 44 to 56.
The principal risks which are speciﬁ c to and 
may impact our businesses are set out in the 
Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 33 
to 40. In addition to these risks, there are other 
sustainability-related risks associated with our 
business which are not considered to be 
as signiﬁ cant as these key risks and are 
therefore not discussed in this report. 
These sustainability-related risks are covered 
in more detail in our Sustainability Report 
2013, which will be available for download 
from our website.
Environmental performance 
For the past year, we set a 2% absolute 
reduction target at our manufacturing 
locations for our environmental KPIs, which 
include energy use, CO2 emissions, water 
use, non-hazardous waste and hazardous 
waste generation. Energy use and CO2 
emissions within our manufacturing sites 
decreased by 3%, primarily as a result of the 
implementation of KPI efﬁ ciency projects and 
a consolidation of some of our operations. 
On a same site basis, energy use was down 
1% while CO2 emissions were up 1%. At our 
manufacturing sites, water consumption 
decreased by 9%, while our non-hazardous 
and hazardous waste generation rates 
decreased by 7% and 29% respectively. 
On a same site basis, water use was down 5% 
while non-hazardous waste and hazardous 
waste generation rates decreased by 4% and 
28% respectively.
At our non-manufacturing sites, our energy 
use was up 1% and our CO2 emissions 
were up 2%.
We encourage our site and regional 
operations to seek external management 
system certiﬁ cation and we have eight 
operations certiﬁ ed to the ISO 14001 
environmental management system standard.
Management continues to be briefed on 
Group environmental performance and 
receives regular reports on KPI reduction 
progress and any violations or environmental 
releases that occur. In the past year, there 
were no environmental releases or ﬁ nes 
related to environmental regulations. In the 
US, one notice of violation was received for 
failing to register equipment under local air 
regulations. All deﬁ ciencies were corrected.

Business Review Corporate Responsibility continued
Social performance
The health and safety of our employees 
remains our highest priority.
Health and safety in the workplace 
We are pleased to report a strong health and 
safety performance, as reflected in our injury/
illness incident frequency rates
1
. From April 
2012 to the end of March 2013, our Total 
Recordable Case Incident Rate (TRCIR) 
remained flat at 0.18 and our Lost Workday 
Case Incident Rate (LWCIR) also remained flat 
at 0.05. Over the past four years, our TRCIR 
has fallen by 14% and our LWCIR has fallen 
by 38%. 
Our Safety and Sustainability Awareness 
Metric (SSAM) is the model we use to drive 
and measure safety activities at an operational 
level. The SSAM, which is measured and 
reported monthly, includes on-time closure of 
corrective actions, near misses, completion of 
safety training, safety tours/inspections, and 
the implementation of priority safety 
programmes across our operations.
We grant recognition awards to those sites 
and business operations that demonstrate 
consistently strong safety performances. As of 
31 March 2013, 31 locations had reached the 
safety milestone of one million hours or more 
worked without a recordable incident.
We continue to support external management 
certifications and four operations are certified 
to the Occupational Health and Safety 
Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001 safety 
management system standard.
As Chief Executive, I review health and safety 
performance data, including any violations 
or major incidents, on a monthly basis. 
In addition, site leaders and management 
teams review each recordable incident to fully 
understand the root causes of accidents 
and ensure adequate corrective actions 
are implemented.
We are pleased to report that there were again 
no work-related fatalities during the year. 
During inspections by government officials, we 
received safety-related citations at six sites in 
five countries related to deficiencies in safety 
programmes, emergency response, machine 
guarding, electrical requirements and 
ergonomics. No fines were incurred and 
corrective actions are being taken. 
Diversity and inclusion in the workforce
Invensys seeks to recruit the best individual for 
every position regardless of gender, ethnic or 
national origin, religion, sexual orientation or 
any personal characteristic including disability, 
not relevant to their work.
Invensys fosters an inclusive culture where 
anyone with the skills and abilities to perform 
is treated fairly. We embrace the diversity of 
our employees and the greater effectiveness 
a diverse workforce allows us to offer our 
customers. We continue to respect and 
support the principles of the European 
Convention on Human Rights and the UNGC 
by ensuring we comply with the labour laws 
of the countries in which we operate and by 
creating an inclusive and respectful culture 
for our diverse workforce.
Invensys is committed to equal opportunities 
and supports the recommendations of Lord 
Davies and the Financial Reporting Council 
regarding diversity. This is reflected in the 
wide range of backgrounds and skills of 
our directors, as well as the appointment of 
two female directors to the Board. We also 
recognise the importance of diversity below 
Board level and have launched a number of 
diversity initiatives including an independent 
diversity assessment intended to highlight 
issues and opportunities across the business. 
In addition, the Invensys Women’s Exchange 
is an established resource group that provides 
support, education and networking 
opportunities within Invensys and with 
our customers.
Communication and engagement 
with employee representatives 
and employees
Regular and open communication is vital to 
maintaining engaged teams and Invensys 
uses many media channels including regular 
updates from myself, an Invensys-wide 
intranet, global “All Hands” calls and local 
communications networks, including site-level 
briefings, smaller face-to-face meetings and 
employee newsletters.
Invensys has established the use of blogging 
through initiatives such as “iShare” and 
is increasingly using social networking 
technologies to facilitate fast and open 
communication between employees and 
to realise the performance advantages of 
sharing knowledge and best practices 
across the Group.
We continue to encourage our businesses 
and employees to engage with good causes 
to build relationships in the community and 
enhance workplace morale and 
cohesiveness.
Community and charitable investment 
Our businesses provide a variety of 
programmes under our InvensysInvolved 
community engagement framework. 
InvensysInvolved combines employee 
volunteerism and strategically-aligned 
company resources to address essential 
needs in the communities where we live and 
work. Under InvensysInvolved, our employees 
are encouraged to participate in four distinct 
areas of community service: Education, Health 
& Safety, Civic Enrichment and the 
Environment. Based on a combination of 
employee input and a review of our business 
focus, these four areas align with Invensys’ 
broader business objectives and offer the 
greatest potential for positive local impact.
Some examples of projects with which we 
have been involved are included on the 
opposite page.
Information on our levels of charitable 
contribution is set out in the Directors’ Report 
on page 74.
We strive to make Invensys a place where 
high-performing people choose to be, 
where they can enhance their lives and 
careers and are motivated to perform at 
their best.
Invensys Values
The Invensys Values – Agility, Innovation, 
Integrity and Performance – reflect the 
aspirations of our people and underpin the 
way we work together. Alignment with the 
Invensys Values is considered integral to the 
performance of our employees and they are 
therefore embedded within our performance 
assessment, internal communications and 
recognition arrangements.
1 The injury/illness incident frequency rates are for recordable 
or lost time in the workplace per 100 employees per annum 
consistent with US definitions. Further details regarding 
health and safety performance can be found on our website.
30 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 We also recognise our obligation and the 
beneﬁ ts arising from consulting through more 
formal channels such as the Invensys 
European Employees Forum (IEEF), which 
promotes dialogue between elected employee 
representatives and senior management. The 
annual meeting between IEEF representatives 
and senior management has been running for 
14 years.
Aligning our people with the Group’s 
goals and objectives
During the year we use our goal deployment 
and performance management tools and 
processes to help our employees understand 
Invensys’ goals and objectives and align them 
with their own. Line managers are required to 
hold annual performance reviews with their 
employees in order to discuss their 
performance, set personal objectives for the 
coming year and create personal development 
plans. Approximately 11,000 managerial, 
professional and technical employees 
participated in our online performance 
management processes last year. Other 
employees, such as those in manufacturing, 
participate in local performance management 
processes.
Developing our leadership and our talent
We continue to focus on growing our 
capability and enabling internal career moves 
through our Organisational Capability Review 
(OCR) process. This process takes place 
across Invensys and over the past year has led 
to the creation of robust succession plans for 
50 senior leadership roles. OCR has also 
enabled the identiﬁ cation of key talent across 
the Group with 53 individuals considered to be 
“High Potential” or “High Professionals”. Each 
of these employees has an individual 
development plan, completion of which is 
tracked and actively supported to achieve their 
potential through quarterly talent reviews with 
our Group Leadership Team. We also have a 
range of talent development programmes 
including our “Programme for Action Learning 
and Mentoring (PALM)” and the “Functional 
Expert to Business Partner” programme 
across our Finance and Legal functions.
In 2010 we launched a new set of Invensys 
competencies following extensive external 
benchmarking and internal research drawing 
on inputs from over 200 of our own high-
performing leaders. These competencies 
have been embedded into our performance 
management system and form the basis 
for the assessment of our top talent.
Investing in our leadership and 
delivery capability
Our Learning and Development Centre of 
Expertise (CoE) has become well established 
and has delivered 119,153 hours of online 
training this year in seven languages. This year 
we launched a new development programme 
for our  senior  leaders called “Leading 
Execution” which supplemented our core 
programmes “Leading Leaders” and 
“Leadership Essentials”. This year, the CoE 
has focused increasingly on fundamental 
Invensys capabilities with the delivery of our 
new Project Management Development 
Curriculum containing over 60 learning 
modules. We also launched an assessment of 
project management skills, which has resulted 
in a new suite of related programmes, with a 
particular focus on commercial and contract 
management.
Introducing students to engineering:
Foxboro, MA, United States 
Over several years, our team in Foxboro has 
led interactive sessions that foster interest 
in engineering as a career at the local 
high school. 
Nationwide run for charity: 
Nuremberg, Germany 
Our team in Nuremberg participated in the 
nationwide B2RUN run/walk event raising 
money for B2RUN’s children-focused 
charity partner.
Making a difference: 
Bangalore, India 
Our team in Bangalore partnered with 
the Bridge School and the Concern India 
Foundation to support the children of local 
migrant workers with educational and 
childcare needs.
Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 31
Business Review Corporate Responsibility continued
Employee engagement
We conducted an Invensys-wide Employee 
Engagement Survey in November 2012 which 
achieved a healthy response rate of 76%.
We were pleased to see our employee 
engagement levels compare favourably with 
our global external benchmarks and that 
overall our people feel increasingly positive 
about their work with Invensys. The results 
have been communicated transparently and 
we are now implementing action plans to build 
on the feedback.
Ensuring responsible, ethical and 
honest behaviour
Our corporate responsibility strategy is 
underpinned by our business principles 
and Code of Conduct which stress the 
importance of responsible, ethical and 
honest behaviour.
The Invensys Code of Conduct
The Invensys Code of Conduct describes and 
represents our commitment to responsible 
business and is the foundation of our broader 
Compliance Programme. Under the terms of 
the Code of Conduct, our employees 
undertake to work with integrity as 
representatives of Invensys and in accordance 
with both local laws and our own standards of 
ethical behaviour. Where the Code of Conduct 
is more exacting than local laws or standards, 
the Code of Conduct must be followed.
The Board is given regular updates on 
compliance issues by the Chief Legal Ofﬁ cer 
and Company Secretary. The Chief Executive 
and Chief Human Resources Ofﬁ cer receive 
regular brieﬁ ngs from the Chief Legal Ofﬁ cer 
and Company Secretary during which any 
concerns can be raised. Legal and ethical 
compliance is recognised as a priority 
for Invensys.
The Code of Conduct is available on the 
Invensys website and can be read by any 
customer, shareholder or member of the 
public. Invensys has adopted a Supplier Code 
of Conduct based on our Code of Conduct 
and asks major suppliers to comply with it (or 
have in place a similar code of conduct of their 
own) as a condition for doing business with us.
The Code of Conduct is supported by periodic 
training for all employees and the Board. All 
new employees must complete Code of 
Conduct training within the ﬁ rst month of 
employment. To promote the Code of 
Conduct and our Helpline, Invensys has 
produced a range of supporting materials 
including Helpline posters, abridged versions 
of the Code of Conduct and other 
presentation materials which are displayed at 
Invensys’ facilities and are available in multiple 
languages on the Invensys intranet.
The Code of Conduct, together with 
supporting Group policies and associated 
training, forms the core of the latest iteration of 
the Compliance Programme. During the year, 
we ran training courses on speciﬁ c areas of 
compliance in our Learning Management 
System, highlighting critical areas of the 
Code  of Conduct such as Anti-Bribery, 
Anti-Harassment/Bullying and 
Helpline  Awareness.
Looking forward
This report demonstrates how corporate 
responsibility is embedded within our 
business and our priority for the year ahead 
will be to continue building on the good work 
achieved to date.
As far as our most valuable asset is concerned 
– our people – we will continue doing 
everything we can to create a work 
environment that attracts and retains the best 
people and which motivates them to perform 
at their peak. Their safety and well-being will, 
of course, remain our highest priority so we 
will continually be looking for new ways in 
which we can improve our performance in this 
critical area. We will also continue encouraging 
our people to reach out and bring their many 
talents to bear upon the communities in which 
they live and work. 
We will strive to reduce our environmental 
footprint and to highlight the environmental 
beneﬁ ts that many of our products and 
services offer to our customers. And ﬁ nally, 
we will continue to operate to the highest 
standards of governance and good corporate 
citizenship.

32 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Risks and Uncertainties 
Introduction to our approach 
and appetite for risk
The effective understanding, acceptance and 
management of risk is fundamental to the 
long-term success of Invensys. Every single 
employee has a role to play in this process 
and the Invensys Risk Management Policy 
recognises that success relies on the ability 
to work together cohesively to address this.
The consistent application of the Invensys 
Code of Conduct (see page 32) is a key 
control in maintaining the strong reputation 
of the Group with regard to customers, 
regulatory bodies and employees. 
Our businesses have developed specialist 
knowledge in products, services, processes 
and regions which allows us to understand 
the associated risks and accept them in an 
informed way. Our approach is encapsulated 
in the key principles of our Risk Management 
Policy:
• To understand the nature and extent of risks 
facing the Group;
• To accept and manage within the business 
those risks which our employees have the 
skills and expertise to understand and 
leverage;
• To assess and transfer or avoid those risks 
which are beyond our appetite for risk; and
• By consideration of materiality to establish 
the authority levels within Invensys at which 
decisions on acceptance and mitigation of 
these risks are taken.
Operating businesses and key functional 
departments are required to undertake a 
formal review of risks. The resulting risk 
registers are maintained and reviewed on a 
monthly basis. These are consolidated and 
reviewed by the Head of Risk and, on a 
quarterly basis, a summary of the Group’s key 
risks is then presented to the Risk Committee 
and Audit Committee.
The Risk Committee has accountability for 
overseeing the risk management processes 
and procedures, and reports to the Board 
through the Audit Committee on the key risks 
facing the Group. It also monitors the 
mitigating actions put in place by the relevant 
operational managers to address the identiﬁ ed 
risks. Membership of the Risk Committee is 
set out on page 44.
The Board has approved the acceptance of 
certain risks which are considered appropriate 
to achieve the Group’s strategic objectives. 
The degree of risk to be accepted within the 
business is managed on a day-to-day basis 
through the Board Delegated Authority levels. 
These provide the framework for informed risk 
taking within the businesses and the route for 
escalating decision making up to the Board. 
Key developments
Our risk management approach is subject 
to continuous review and updating to take 
account of new and developing issues which 
might impact our business objectives. The 
following signiﬁ cant developments should 
be noted:
• The business continues to make progress 
against a challenging global backdrop;
• The sale of Invensys Rail has allowed us to 
address certain risks and offers additional 
opportunities:
 –  We have addressed the deﬁ cit on the UK 
Pension Scheme and created a reservoir 
trust to pay future contributions if required;
 –  The de layering of the management 
structure following the sale of Invensys Rail 
provides the opportunity for restructuring 
efﬁ ciencies; and
 –  The transaction has provided signiﬁ cant 
cash which is available to grow and 
develop the business, both organically 
and through acquisitions.
Risks associated with our restructuring and 
acquisition strategy have been assessed and 
appropriate mitigating actions implemented.

Identiﬁ cation
• Risks are recorded in the risk registers, their 
likelihood and impact assessed, risk owners are 
identiﬁ ed and mitigation strategies established.
• Risks are considered against appropriate 
categories including: strategic, people, ﬁ nancial, 
operational, reputational, legal, environmental 
and compliance.
Analysis
• Risks are analysed for likelihood and impact to 
determine the level of exposure.
Evaluation
• Risks are reviewed and prioritised against the 
potential impact on achievement of short-term 
and long-term business objectives.
Mitigation
•  Actions are identiﬁ ed to minimise, manage 
or respond to the risks.
Monitoring and control
• Risk action plans are reviewed by the business 
operations at least quarterly.
•  Serious emerging issues are notiﬁ ed 
immediately to the Group crisis 
management team.
•  Risks are reviewed at each Risk Committee 
meeting.
•  The Audit Committee and the Board review 
risk on a regular basis.
The Invensys approach is consistent with 
ISO 31000, the international risk management 
standard, and has been subject to external review 
and updating to take account of developing risk 
governance practices.
Principal risks
Invensys operates globally in varied markets 
and is affected by a number of risks inherent 
in its activities, not all of which are within its 
control. Some of these risks and uncertainties 
are common to other companies, for example: 
changes in economic conditions including the 
impact of austerity measures and currency 
and interest rate ﬂ uctuations; changes in 
taxation legislation; the cost of materials; the 
recruitment and retention of skilled personnel; 
the impact of competition; political stability in 
the countries where we operate or undertake 
contracts; and sustainability-related risks. 
Some of these common risks and 
uncertainties are subject to signiﬁ cant change, 
the impact of which may be difﬁ cult to predict. 
Invensys has undertaken a review of certain 
country risks. This is shown on pages 39 
and 40 and uses the Group’s revenue by 
destination for continuing operations as 
a proxy for the relative level of exposure 
in each case.
The principal risks which are speciﬁ c to and 
may impact the Group are outlined on pages 
36 to 38. In addition, there may be other risks 
and uncertainties which are unknown to the 
Group or which could become material in the 
future. These risks may cause the Group’s 
results to vary materially from historic and 
expected results.

Business Review Risks and Uncertainties continued
Description of risk 
Failure to maintain a competitive and technologically advanced product 
range could reduce margins and revenue growth
Invensys operates in highly competitive markets and the Group’s 
products and services are characterised by continually evolving industry 
standards and rapidly changing technology, driven by the demands of the 
Group’s customers. As an illustration of this, our Software business 
segment continues to invest in industrial software applications to 
optimise plant performance for our global customers.
Impact
Failure to keep pace with technological changes 
and system or application requirements in the 
industrial sectors may result in loss of market 
share and lower margins. Furthermore, delays to 
development programmes may adversely impact 
the delivery of major projects.
Mitigation
The Group invests in research and development to 
create new technologies and products to sustain 
or improve its competitive position. However, all 
new technologies and products involve business 
risk in terms of possible abortive expenditure 
including asset impairments, reputational risk and 
customer claims. The Group reviews its portfolio 
of technologies as part of the strategic planning 
process. In addition, there is a regular review 
process to control individual development 
programmes.
The timing and frequency of substantial contract awards are uneven
Our Industrial Automation business segment is associated with the 
supply of technology and consulting to the oil and gas, chemical and 
nuclear industries. Capital expenditure requirements from customers in 
these industries are often highly cyclical and linked to the international 
supply, demand and pricing of hydrocarbons. Also the timing of new 
contract awards in the nuclear industry may be impacted if certain 
nuclear programmes are subject to delay or cancellation.
Impact
The timing of contract awards is uncertain and 
delays in awards may result in volatility in the order 
book and operating performance. Major projects 
may also impact the proﬁ tability where a 
substantial element of the contract may be 
supplied by third parties. In addition, the 
opportunity to develop control and safety systems 
for the nuclear industry may lead to an increased 
dependence on a small number of major 
customers for our Industrial Automation 
business segment. 
Mitigation
The Group monitors its order pipeline, sales 
activity, sales cover in its order book, expected 
margins and the impact of potential delays on the 
expected results to allow appropriate mitigating 
actions to be considered. 
36 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Description of risk 
Undertaking large, long-term projects exposes the Group to risk of loss
A signiﬁ cant amount of the Group’s business involves long-term projects 
that can take many months or even years to complete. These projects 
may be subject to delays and cost overruns due to delays in technology 
development, equipment deliveries, engineering problems, work 
stoppages, unanticipated cost increases, shortages of materials 
or skilled labour or other unforeseen problems inherent in the nature 
of such projects.
Impact
The Group’s failure to anticipate technical and 
development problems, estimate costs, control 
delivery or receive timely payments may reduce 
the proﬁ tability of such a contract and impact 
cash collection. 
Mitigation
The Group has an established process with clear 
delegated authorities for the approval of major 
contracts, which includes a review system for 
the approval of bids submitted to customers. 
Contracts with a large monetary value or 
non-standard contractual terms require Board 
approval. Execution of major projects is subject 
to regular reporting to the Board. 
The Group may be subject to ﬁ nancial loss and/or damage to its 
reputation as a result of product liability claims
Errors and defects in the Group’s products, systems or applications, 
which may be used in safety-critical applications, could cause injury 
to persons or damage to property and equipment or be the subject 
of product recalls.
Impact
These occurrences could result in claims, loss 
of revenue, warranty costs, costs and damages 
associated with product recalls, litigation, delays 
in market acceptance or harm to the Group’s 
reputation for safety and quality. 
Mitigation
Each business segment has an established 
quality control function and, if an event occurs, 
there are processes to investigate and manage 
the occurrence.
The Group may be exposed to liability through the actions of co-source 
partners or its supply chain
On occasions the business activities of the Group are conducted with 
co-source partners whose day-to-day management actions are outside 
the control of the Group. A signiﬁ cant element of the Group’s risk proﬁ le 
is the delivery performance of its supply chain. These partnerships exist 
across our businesses. 
Impact
Given the nature of the Group’s business mix, a 
quality or other failure in the supply chain could 
present a risk to safety and delivery which might 
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, ﬁ nancial performance and/or reputation. 
There is also a risk that regulatory non-compliance 
of partners could have a material adverse effect on 
the Group’s reputation.
Mitigation
Assessment, mitigation and management of these 
risks are addressed by the business segments in 
conjunction with our legal and risk departments. 
In-depth due diligence on partners is undertaken 
where considered appropriate, and cross-
indemnities entered into to mitigate liability.
Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 37
Business Review Risks and Uncertainties continued
Description of risk 
The Group may be exposed to additional liabilities with respect to its UK 
and US pension plans
The Group has a large level of gross liabilities in respect of its major 
pension plans relative to its market capitalisation. 
Impact
With respect to both of the Group’s major pension 
plans for its UK and US operations, any material 
decline in the equity market, improvement in life 
expectancy, change in expected morbidity 
rates, long periods of low inﬂ ation or deﬂ ation, 
or future decreases in interest rates could require 
additional funding contributions in excess of those 
currently expected.
Mitigation
The Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) has a high 
proportion of pensioners relative to its active 
workforce which provides a level of certainty 
with respect to the valuation of the plan’s liabilities. 
In addition, its investment policy has been 
established to address the need to match the 
plan assets and liabilities as far as is realistically 
possible. On completion of the sale of Invensys 
Rail there was a £400 million contribution into 
the Scheme and the creation of a £225 million 
reservoir trust for the beneﬁ t of the plan. It is 
anticipated that no further contributions will be 
payable into the Scheme for the foreseeable 
future. The Group will continue to monitor the 
performance of the principal UK and US plans. 
The Group is subject to on- going litigation and environmental liabilities
As a consequence of the past disposal of a signiﬁ cant number of 
businesses, the Group has, or may incur, certain liabilities in relation to 
environmental claims (including the cost associated with the remediation 
of contaminated sites no longer owned by the Group), litigation (including 
personal injury claims arising from alleged exposure to asbestos and 
silica), indemnity claims and other disposal costs relating to the disposed 
businesses. These risks have receded over time as warranties and 
indemnities in relation to past disposals have expired, existing disputes 
have been settled and remediation work on contaminated sites has been 
completed. The Group also has environmental liabilities in relation to the 
remediation of vacant sites which it owns.
Impact
All of these liabilities are subject to a number of 
uncertainties, assumptions and contingencies, 
and there can be no assurance that the liabilities 
will not be substantially higher or become payable 
sooner than anticipated, or that the provisions in 
the Group’s accounts in respect of any such 
liabilities will be sufﬁ cient.
Mitigation
The Group continually monitors the remaining 
liabilities and has established performance 
indicators to support and facilitate this. The 
indicators include cash spend, provisions, 
insurance recoveries and estimated exposures. 
The Group has recently carried out a detailed 
review of the related provisions and will continue 
to monitor the level of provisions going forward. 
In negotiations it aims to limit the risk of future 
liabilities or disputes. 
The Group is exposed to cyber risks
In common with other entities, the Group is exposed to risk of business 
disruption and intellectual property loss associated with adverse cyber 
incidents. Invensys provides products, services and solutions for 
industrial control systems responsible for monitoring and controlling 
a variety of processes and operations including gas and electricity 
distribution, water treatment and oil reﬁ ning. These control systems may 
be susceptible to disruption through cyber events and the Group may incur 
liabilities as a result of such events.
Impact
These events could result in claims, loss of 
revenue, warranty costs, costs and damages 
associated with product recalls, litigation, delays 
in market acceptance or harm to the Group’s 
reputation for safety and quality. 
Mitigation
The Group has established quality and security 
processes to address this. 
38 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Country risks
Description of risk 
Financial risk
The global economy has continued to experience a sovereign debt crisis with 
particular concern within the Eurozone. Invensys maintains oversight of its 
exposures by analysing the revenue by destination for all territories against 
published risk rating categories
1
. This is summarised in the adjacent chart.
Mitigation
Key ﬁ nancial risks including liquidity needs, partner/supply chain exposure and cash 
management have been identiﬁ ed. Measures have been taken to minimise exposures and crisis 
management plans have been established to respond to developing scenarios.
Financial risk exposure (%)
Political stability risk
Political risk considers the likelihood of state or political inﬂ uences negatively 
affecting business operations in a country through regime instability or direct/
indirect interference. The adjacent chart illustrates the Invensys exposure using 
the country ratings as published by Control Risks Group
2
.
Mitigation
Invensys analyses current and developing issues and maintains crisis management plans 
designed to respond to threats and safeguard the business operations.
Political stability risk exposure (%)
Security risk
Security risk considers the likelihood of state or non-state engagement in actions 
that harm the ﬁ nancial, physical and human assets of a company and the extent to 
which the state is willing and able to protect those assets. The adjacent chart 
illustrates Invensys’ exposure using the security country risk ratings published by 
Control Risks Group
2
.
Mitigation
Invensys analyses current and developing issues and maintains crisis management plans 
designed to safeguard people, assets and the business.
Security risk exposure (%)
Corruption risk (anti-bribery compliance)
The Corruption Perception Index published by Transparency International

 ranks 
countries according to their perceived levels of public sector corruption. A score 
of 10 is considered very clean and a score of zero is highly corrupt. Invensys has 
considered its revenue by destination against this index for all territories and this 
is shown on the adjacent chart.
Mitigation
Invensys has a zero tolerance approach to bribery and maintains a programme of 
communication and education for employees and partners. Particular focus is appropriate in 
higher-risk territories to ensure that Group policy is understood and enforced.

Business Review Risks and Uncertainties continued
Country risks
Invensys is a global organisation with its own 
facilities, supply chain and customers in many 
countries across the world. There are diverse 
country risks to address in certain core 
markets, including ﬁ nancial risks relating to 
the Eurozone crisis, and risks in developing 
markets, including Asia Paciﬁ c, South America 
and the Middle East. 
As detailed on the previous page, Invensys 
has undertaken a review of the following 
country risks in respect of those territories 
where we generate revenue: 
• Financial risk utilising the rating categories 
published by credit agency Moody’s;
• Political stability risk utilising the risk 
categories published by Control Risks 
Group; 
• Security risk utilising the risk categories 
published by Control Risks Group; and
• Corruption risk utilising the risk ratings 
published by Transparency International.
Revenue by destination for continuing 
operations has been analysed and 
categorised in accordance with rating criteria 
obtained from appropriate external sources. 
The charts on the previous page illustrate the 
proﬁ le of country risk for the Group’s revenue 
by destination and outline the broad mitigation 
actions in place to address these.

Governance Corporate Governance
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present our Corporate Governance Report which explains the 
governance framework within the Group and how this has been applied and 
operated during the year. 
The Board sets the tone from the top and promotes principles of good corporate 
governance across the Group. To do this we have in place effective practices which are 
essential to our business integrity, performance and accountability to shareholders. 
This Report, together with reports from our committee chairmen as set out on pages 51 
to 7 2 will, I hope, provide a good overview of the systems of governance and control 
which operate within the Group and provide a summary of the work we have 
undertaken during the year. 
As reported in my Chairman’s Statement on page 7 , Francesco Caio and Pat Zito have 
informed the Board that they do not intend to seek re-election at the 2013 AGM. We 
thank them for their contributions to the Board and we wish them well for the future. 
Given the reduced size and complexity of the Group following the disposal of the 
Invensys Rail division, it is not our current intention to replace these positions on 
the Board.
The Board has sought to implement the ﬁ ndings of the previous year’s external 
performance evaluation, and progress against the speciﬁ c objectives we set ourselves 
has been measured by an internal evaluation during the year. Further information about 
the evaluation process is set out on page 48. 
The Board is pleased to conﬁ rm that during the year the Company has been fully 
compliant with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 (the Code). 
It has also implemented, where appropriate, certain disclosures recommended in the 
latest revision of the UK Corporate Governance Code published in September 2012 
(the 2012 Code) for the year under review.

As at 1 April 2013.
44 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The Board is collectively responsible for 
promoting the success of the Group by 
directing and supervising the Group’s affairs 
to create long-term shareholder value. The 
Board provides entrepreneurial leadership 
and sets the Group’s strategic aims. In doing 
this it ensures there are robust corporate 
governance and risk management processes 
in place.
The Invensys Governance Framework is 
shown in the diagram on the opposite page. 
The Board’s duties are set out in a formal 
schedule of matters reserved for the Board, 
as summarised in the adjacent table. Certain 
responsibilities are delegated to Board or 
executive committees through structured 
procedures, as set out in the Governance 
Framework on the opposite page. The 
chairman of each committee provides an 
update on the activities of their committee 
at the next Board meeting. A report from 
the Nominating Committee, from the Audit 
Committee and from the Remuneration 
Committee is included on pages 51 to 7 2. 
Other operational matters are dealt with by 
senior management through formalised 
delegated authorities.
Meetings – attendance and processes
There is an agreed schedule of Board and 
committee meetings which are held 
throughout the year. In 2012/13 there were 
eight scheduled meetings of the Board. 
A further seven Board meetings were called 
at short notice relating to consideration 
and negotiation of the sale of the Invensys

Governance Corporate Governance continued
The Board and its committees each have an 
annual agenda programme (that aligns to the 
formal schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board) which is maintained by the Company 
Secretary. There are established processes in 
place to ensure meetings are well prepared 
and run effectively :
Meeting processes
• Agendas are reviewed with the Chairman/
committee chairmen against the overall 
calendar with key priorities and business 
issues being added to the agenda as 
required; agendas are agreed approximately 
six weeks before the meeting
• Meetings are scheduled to ensure there is 
adequate time available for meaningful 
discussion of items
• Papers are agreed with the Chairman/
committee chairmen and distributed 
electronically approximately one week before 
the meeting (unless the meetings have been 
called at short notice) to enable directors 
adequate time for review 
• Papers are designed to be comprehensive 
and clear without “clutter” and contain an 
executive summary to present key highlights
• Relevant actions and outcomes from Board 
and committee meetings are tracked and 
disseminated to members of the Group 
Leadership Team which promotes 
transparency and ensures decisions are 
implemented
How the Board spent its time
The chart below provides a summary of the 
work of the Board and its committees during 
the year.
At each scheduled meeting the Board 
received reports from the Chief Executive 
on  operational matters, the Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer on ﬁ nancial performance and the 
Chief  Legal Ofﬁ cer on legal, regulatory and 
compliance matters. 
Following the annual strategic review last year, 
the Board engaged in a series of meetings 
which enabled them to provide constructive 
input and to implement the strategic 
transformation of the Group. This gave rise to 
the decision to dispose of the Invensys Rail 
division which was contingent on ﬁ nding a 
solution to our legacy UK pension issues. 
The  return of cash proposal and restructuring 
proposal to reduce costs were developed 
contemporaneously.

Strategy 37
Operating & ﬁnancial 
performance 17
Governance 8
Committees 38
Following the disposal of Invensys Rail, a full 
day was spent on the annual strategic plan 
of the restructured Group; this included 
discussions with the divisional CEOs who 
attended this session and made presentations 
on their plans. 
Other areas of focus during the year included 
the monitoring and control of major projects; 
review and adoption of new Board Delegated 
Authorities; and consideration and approval of 
the acquisitions of PHW and Spiral Software 
and subsequent review of the post-acquisition 
plan. All committee chairmen provided 
updates on the activities of their committees 
to the Board. 
There were also informal meetings of the 
Chairman and the non-executive directors 
without the executive directors being present. 
In addition, the non-executive directors are in 
regular informal communication with the 
executive directors and other senior leaders.
To increase the visibility of business leaders to 
the Board, the divisional CEOs joined Board 
meetings on a rotational basis. In light of the 
new structure of the Group, the leaders of the 
Software, Industrial Automation, Energy 
Controls and Appliance business segments 
will join the meetings in future. This will enable 
the Board to become more acquainted with 
these leaders and to receive updates on 
performance and progress against their 
agreed strategies.
Directors: composition 
and independence
Following the retirement of Francesco Caio 
and Pat Zito with effect from the 2013 AGM, 
there will be a total of nine directors on the 
Board, comprising the Chairman, ﬁ ve 
non-executive directors and three executive 
directors.
The Board considers that all of the current 
non-executive directors are independent. 
The non-executive directors are drawn from 
diverse international businesses and, as 
illustrated on pages 42 and 43, bring a range 
of skills and experience to enable them to 
constructively challenge and develop the 
Group’s strategy and direction. 
Whilst all directors have an equal responsibility 
for the operations of Invensys, the role of the 
non-executive directors is particularly 
important in ensuring that the strategy 
and business proposals of the executive 
management team are fully debated, to 
ensure that they meet the long-term interests 
of shareholders and also take account of 
issues affecting employees, customers, 
suppliers and the many communities with 
which Invensys interacts.
The Senior Independent Director is Michael 
Parker, who has held this role since December 
2006. Mr Parker is available for shareholders 
to contact through the Invensys Investor 
Relations team and is also responsible for 
leading the Chairman’s annual performance 
evaluation.
The Board believes that it can be of beneﬁ t to 
the Group as a whole for the executive 
directors to broaden their experience through 
service as a non-executive director of other 
businesses. Subject to individual review and in 
line with the Code requirements, the Group’s 
policy is that executive directors may hold 
one non-executive directorship in another 
business and may retain the fees. None of 
the executive directors hold any external 
non-executive directorships.

46 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Chairman and Chief Executive
There is a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive, which is deﬁ ned in writing in a 
schedule which has been approved by the 
Board. The schedule was reviewed during 
the year and updated to conform with the 
provisions in the 2012 Code and the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Guidance on Board 
Effectiveness. Whilst the duties are separate 
in practice they work collaboratively and 
maintain a close working relationship. 
A summary of the individual roles is set 
out below :
Summary of duties
The Chairman is responsible for:
• leadership of the Board 
• facilitating the contribution of the non-
executive directors and ensuring that 
constructive relations exist between the 
executive and non-executive directors
• reviewing the effectiveness of the Board
• ensuring compliance with the Board’s 
approved procedures
• safeguarding the interests of shareholders 
and promoting effective communication 
with  shareholders
The Chief Executive is responsible for:
• management and leadership of the Group; 
he is supported by the Group Leadership 
Team, as detailed in the Invensys 
Governance Framework on pages 44 and 45
• developing the Group’s strategy in close 
consultation with the Chairman and 
executing the agreed strategy 
• promoting high standards of integrity, probity 
and corporate governance
Election and re-election of directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require 
that any director appointed during the year 
should stand for election at the ﬁ rst AGM 
following their appointment. In line with the 
Code, all directors are required to seek 
re-election by shareholders annually. 
Following the evaluation of performance of 
each director, which concluded that each 
member brings skills and experience to the 
effectiveness of the Board, it is proposed that 
all directors stand for re-election at the 2013 
AGM, other than Francesco Caio and Pat Zito 
who informed the Board that they did not 
intend to seek re-election and accordingly 
will be retiring from the Board at the close 
of that meeting. As detailed on page 44, given 
the reduced size and complexity of the Group 
following the disposal of the Invensys Rail 
division, it is not the current intention of the 
Board to replace these positions.
Bay Green, non-executive director and 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, has now 
completed an eight-year term. Following a 
rigorous review by the Nominating Committee 
in 2011, it was concluded that Mr Green had a 
range of skills which added value to the Board 
and, as a result, they recommended to the 
Board that his appointment be extended and 
that he continue as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. Mr Green received overwhelming 
support for his re-election at the 2012 AGM. 
Following further review, the Board is still of the 
opinion that Mr Green adds value to the Board 
and recommends that he remain a non-
executive director. However, in accordance 
with succession planning he will stand down 
as the Chairman of the Audit Committee and 
be replaced by Deena Mattar with effect from 
17 May 2013. It is intended that Mr Green will 
continue as a member of the Audit Committee.
Paul Lester, non-executive director, will have 
completed a three-year term in July 2013. 
Following the outcome of his performance 
review, the Nominating Committee concluded 
that Mr Lester has skills, experience and 
knowledge of value to the Board and, as 
a result, has recommended to the Board the 
appointment of Mr Lester be extended for 
a further three-year term.
As detailed on page 52, the Nominating 
Committee will be reviewing succession 
planning over the coming year.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is Victoria Hull, 
who is also the Chief Legal Ofﬁ cer. She 
was appointed as Company Secretary on 
1 January 2006 and acts as secretary to all of 
the committees of the Board. Her biographical 
details are set out on page 42. The 
combination of Ms Hull’s roles as the 
Company Secretary and director is regularly 
monitored to ensure there is no conﬂ ict of 
interest. The Deputy Secretary attends Board 
and committee meetings and has the ﬁ rst line 
of responsibility for preparation of minutes and 
the issue of Board papers.
To enable the Board to perform its duties, 
all  directors have full and timely access to 
all  relevant information and to the services 
of  the Company Secretary. 
Induction and development
On appointment, new directors receive a 
comprehensive induction programme tailored 
to their speciﬁ c requirements based on their 
experience. The objective is to provide 
directors with a combination of selected 
written information and the opportunity to visit 
business sites and meet with key leaders of 
the Group. 
Deena Mattar joined the Company in May 
2011 and at that time a tailored induction 
programme was developed for her. During 
the year under review, Ms Mattar completed 
this programme by visiting the Invensys 
Operations Management division to gain 
a deeper understanding of the Group’s 
operations and meet with key employees.
The continuing development of the directors, 
collectively and individually, is effected through 
a number of channels. Directors receive 
regular brieﬁ ngs at Board meetings which are 
relevant to their role. During the year these 
included developments in governance 
matters, regulatory updates and legislative 
changes. For example, updates on the revised 
2012 Code and review of new reporting 
requirements and obligations (including 
proposals from the Department for Business, 
Innovation & Skills: “The Future of Narrative 
Reporting” and “Directors’ Pay”).
Normally as part of the annual Board 
programme at least one meeting is held offsite 
at a Group business location so that directors 
can increase their understanding of the 
business activity. During the year a meeting 
was scheduled to be held in Turkey with senior 
leaders from the businesses to emphasise the 
importance of the wider Middle East region to 
Invensys. Given the activities involved with the 
disposal of the Invensys Rail division, the 
Board decided not to proceed with this trip. 
In the next year the Board intends to resume 
its schedule for offsite meetings.
Independent professional advisers are made 
available in order for directors to discuss 
matters of signiﬁ cance to the Group, and 
directors are encouraged to attend external 
brieﬁ ngs. The Board ensures that directors 
have access to independent professional 
advice on how to discharge their 
responsibilities as directors of the Company.

Governance Corporate Governance continued
Board performance evaluation
An annual review is undertaken of the performance of the Board, committees and directors. 
Outcomes of 2011/12 evaluation
In 2011/12, in line with the Code and best practice, the Company commissioned its ﬁ rst externally-facilitated performance evaluation. This was 
an extensive exercise conducted by an independent consultancy, Egon Zehnder, which provoked good debate. Overall it was concluded that 
the Board and its committees continue to operate effectively. Areas of focus were agreed and progress against these actions is set out below:
Action Status
Focus on strategic discussions The strategic direction of the Group has been an area of signiﬁ cant focus during the year. Implementation 
of the agreed strategy resulted in the sale of the Invensys Rail division to create a more focused supplier of 
industrial software, systems and control equipment.
Ensure there is appropriate consideration of 
project risk, including bidding and control of 
projects
This continues to be an area of focus for the Audit Committee and the Board, with input from the Risk 
Committee.
Give increased focus to developing the talent of 
the Group’s senior leaders
Information on the top leaders is included in the Chief Executive’s Board report as a standing item and 
plans for these leaders are regularly reviewed by the Board. An audit of the talent of the top leaders was 
conducted as part of the Organisational Capability Review process.
Review the format of Board meetings to ensure 
there is appropriate time to discuss key issues in 
depth
The content and format of papers were reviewed and changed with a view to enhancing discussions on 
key matters. In addition, papers were prepared for discussion at Board dinners to help ensure adequate 
time was devoted to Board matters. 
In months where there is no scheduled meeting a report from the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and, if required, 
updates from the Chief Executive and/or Chief Legal Ofﬁ cer are issued electronically. Any questions on 
these reports can be raised directly with the executive directors.
Ensure that the Board composition continues to 
have the appropriate balance of skills, experience 
and diversity
Monitored by the Nominating Committee and changes to the Board agreed for 2013/14.
2012/13 evaluation
Following the external evaluation last year, the Board conducted an internal evaluation of its performance and that of its committees and 
individual directors. All directors contributed to the evaluation which was conducted using a comprehensive questionnaire in which directors 
were asked to rate certain statements as well as providing additional commentary as required. 
Individual performance evaluations focused on the effectiveness of the contributions made by directors. Consideration was given to the 
aggregate time commitments of the non-executive directors. The Board is satisﬁ ed that each director is committed to their role.
For the evaluation of the Board, consideration was given to procedures and effectiveness. Assessment was given to the relevant roles and 
responsibilities under review, the terms of reference of the committees and best practice. Following discussion of the results, the Board is 
satisﬁ ed that it and its committees remain effective. However, in recognising the need for continuous improvement, a number of areas of 
focus have been agreed for 2013/14 as summarised below and progress against these objectives will be reported in the Annual Report 
and Accounts 2014.
Summary of 2013/14 objectives
• Enhance the Board evaluation process to provide a more qualitative and interactive exercise.
• Deepen the non-executive directors’ understanding of the new lines of business as well as providing an opportunity to meet key leaders.
• Consider further the skills, experience and geographic diversity of the Board taking into account succession planning.
• Review the remuneration strategy for appropriateness in light of the reorganised Group.
• Monitor cost savings as a result of the reorganisation.
48 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Directors’ conﬂ icts of interest
In line with the Companies Act 2006, directors 
are required to avoid any situation in which 
they have or can have a direct or indirect 
interest that conﬂ icts or may possibly conﬂ ict 
with the interests of the Company, unless 
authorised by the Board. The Company’s 
Articles of Association allow the Board to 
authorise such conﬂ icts and to impose such 
limits or conditions as it deems necessary. 
There is no breach of duty if the relevant 
matter has been authorised in advance.
The Company has an established procedure 
whereby actual and potential conﬂ icts of 
interest are reviewed regularly and in any event 
annually. Appropriate authorisation is required 
prior to the appointment of any new director 
and when any new conﬂ ict arises for a director 
or there is a change in circumstances that may 
affect an authorisation previously given. 
Authorisations are granted by those directors 
who have no interest in the matter being 
considered and are recorded in the Register 
of  Directors’ Conﬂ icts. Where there is a 
conﬂ ict, the Board will conﬁ rm whether any 
conditions should be imposed under the 
terms of the authorisation. 
During the year the Board considers the 
procedure was operated effectively.
Board committees
The Board delegates speciﬁ c authorities to 
its Audit Committee, Nominating Committee, 
Remuneration Committee and Contracts 
Committee, all of which operate within deﬁ ned 
terms of reference. Copies of these terms 
of reference, together with certain other 
governance-related documents can be found 
on the Company’s website. Board committees 
are authorised to engage the services of 
external advisers as circumstances require, 
at the Company’s expense. Reports of the 
Nominating Committee, Audit Committee 
and Remuneration Committee are included on 
pages 51 to 7 2. Directors receive copies of all 
committee minutes and the chairman of each 
committee provides an update on matters of 
signiﬁ cance at the Board meeting following the 
committee meeting.
Group Leadership Team
The Group Leadership Team provides the 
senior executive management with a platform 
for strategic discussion and information 
sharing to assist with the following:
• Development of Group strategy and 
operational plans; 
• Oversight and review of strategic plan 
execution, including:
– business development opportunities and 
their potential impact;
– assessment and control of risk and 
compliance by considering the Group’s 
risk appetite and risk proﬁ le;
– resources, giving consideration to 
succession planning for senior executives 
and the needs of the Group with a view to 
ensuring its continued ability to compete 
effectively in the marketplace; and
– incentive plans and executive 
remuneration.
To ensure the aligned execution of the Board’s 
strategy, Board actions and outcomes are 
disseminated to members of the Group 
Leadership Team to facilitate a remit that is 
broader than a purely operational committee 
and to encourage the consideration of the 
Group perspective by the leaders of the 
business segments. 
Communication with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is at all 
times given a high priority, and a number of 
means are used to promote greater 
understanding and dialogue with the 
investment community. The Board receives 
regular reports from the Chief Executive and 
the Group’s Investor Relations team. The 
Chairman and the Senior Independent 
Director are available to meet with major 
shareholders on request. During the year, 
the  Chairman spoke with a number of major 
shareholders regarding general business 
topics. In addition, the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee held discussions 
with major shareholders on relevant matters.
Shareholders are kept informed of the 
progress of the Group during the course 
of the year through half-year and full-year 
results presentations, interim management 
statements, capital markets days and other 
announcements of material developments 
that are released through the London Stock 
Exchange and other news services. The 
results presentations made to the investment 
community are webcast and copies of 
supporting materials are made available on 
the Group’s website (details of which can be 
found in Shareholder Information on page 
15 7). Other general shareholder information 
can be found on the Group’s website.
The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer 
maintain regular dialogue with the major 
institutional shareholders and participate in 
sector conferences. Shareholders can also 
raise questions directly with the Company at 
any time by contacting the Group’s Investor 
Relations team, whose contact details are 
listed on our website.
The annual report and accounts are made 
available to shareholders at least 20 working 
days prior to the AGM. Directors are available 
at the AGM to answer questions, which 
provides a useful interface with private 
shareholders. Shareholders also have an 
opportunity to meet informally with directors 
after the meeting. Resolutions are proposed 
separately and voting is conducted by polls 
at general meetings, and voting results are 
announced through the London Stock 
Exchange. The results and proxy levels are 
also available on the Group’s website and 
on request from the Company Secretary. 
The Company is permitted under its 
Articles of Association to send or supply 
communications to shareholders 
electronically, and the Company now supplies 
information such as notices of meetings, forms 
of proxy and annual reports and accounts via 
the Group’s website. Shareholders are notiﬁ ed 
by email or post when new information is 
available on the website. The Company sends 
hard copy communications to those 
shareholders who have requested them. 
Shareholders may at any time revoke a 
previous instruction and elect to receive 
hard copies or electronic copies of 
shareholder information.
Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 49
Governance Corporate Governance continued
Accountability and audit
Financial planning and reporting
The Group has comprehensive planning and 
ﬁ nancial reporting procedures. Management 
prepares detailed operational budgets for the 
year ahead and a three-year strategic plan, 
which are reviewed and approved by the 
Board. Performance is monitored through 
the monthly reporting of ﬁ nancial results and 
regular updating of forecasts for the year. 
The Group Accounting Policies Manual is 
used by all businesses in the Group to ensure 
that transactions and balances are recognised 
and measured in accordance with the Group’s 
prescribed accounting policies. All businesses 
submit their results using the Group’s 
consolidation system, which ensures that 
information is gathered and presented in a 
consistent way that facilitates the production 
of the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
Internal control
The directors are responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. During the year ended 31 March  
2013, each of the Group’s divisions was 
accountable to the Chief Executive and was 
managed by executive leadership which 
provided day-to-day control over the divisions’ 
operations within the strategic guidelines and 
delegated authorities determined by the 
Board. Under the new Group structure that 
took effect from 1 April 2013, similar 
arrangements are in place. The internal control 
system is designed to meet the Group’s 
particular needs and the risks to which it is 
exposed. It should be appreciated that, 
however effective a system of internal control 
is, it can provide only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The ﬁ ndings of the annual assessment 
of the Group’s system of internal controls 
undertaken by the Audit Committee, as 
detailed on pages 54 to 55, were presented to 
the Board. Where weaknesses in the 
operation of internal controls were identiﬁ ed, 
the Audit Committee considered 
management’s response to them. The Audit 
Committee has continued to pay particular 
consideration to the management of customer 
contracts and received detailed reports on 
major contracts from management and the 
external auditor. The Board is satisﬁ ed that the 
information that it received throughout the year 
on internal controls and the information from 
the annual assessment on internal controls 
was sufﬁ cient to enable it to review the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
controls. The Board is satisﬁ ed that, where the 
need to improve internal controls was 
identiﬁ ed during the year, appropriate actions 
have been and are being taken.
Risk management
The Board has responsibility for determining 
the nature and extent of the signiﬁ cant risks it 
is willing to take in achieving the strategic 
objectives and has established a structured 
approach to identifying, evaluating, managing, 
monitoring and reporting on key risks facing 
the Group.
The Risk Committee has accountability for 
creating and overseeing the risk management 
processes and procedures, and provides 
written reports to the Board and the Audit 
Committee on the key risks facing the Group. 
The Risk Committee formulates strategy and 
policy based on risk appetite and risk 
exposure. It also monitors the mitigating 
actions put in place by the relevant operational 
managers to address the identiﬁ ed risks. 
The Chairman of the Risk Committee presents 
a report at each Audit Committee meeting to 
provide an update of the key risks and new 
and emerging risks identiﬁ ed by the Group’s 
businesses. This provides assurance that the 
risks faced by the businesses are appropriate 
and mitigation plans are in place.
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee 
reviews annually the risk management 
process and periodically conducts external 
reviews.
Further information on the Board’s approach 
and appetite for risk is set out in the Risks and 
Uncertainties section on pages 33 to 40.
Remuneration Committee
Details of the Remuneration Committee and 
its policies, together with information on the 
remuneration and share interests of directors, 
are set out in the Remuneration Report on 
pages 57 to 7 2. The Remuneration Report 
should be read in conjunction with this 
Corporate Governance Report, of which 
it forms an integral part.
Contracts Committee
The Contracts Committee considers certain 
tenders and contracts that require Board 
approval but which are due for submission 
at a time when there is no scheduled Board 
meeting. The terms of reference of the 
Contracts Committee are available on the 
Group’s website. 
Meetings of the Contracts Committee must 
comprise at least one executive director, 
the Chairman (or in his place the Senior 
Independent Director) and at least one 
other non-executive director.
The Contracts Committee met on ﬁ ve 
occasions during the year.

Retiring with effect from the 2013 AGM. 
I have chaired the Nominating Committee since 17 July 2009. 
I am pleased to present this Report of the Nominating 
Committee which explains our role and our principal activities 
during the year.
As detailed on page 44, given the reduced size and complexity 
of the Group following the disposal of the Invensys Rail division, 
we do not currently intend to replace the non-executive director 
positions of Francesco Caio and Pat Zito.
We have a cycle of events for annual consideration, 
which included the consideration of the Board evaluation 
recommendations, which was externally conducted for the 
ﬁ rst time in respect of the year 201 1/12. Those recommendations 
were considered and implemented during the current year. 
Further details are described more fully below, and I hope this 
report is useful in describing the ongoing work of the 
Nominating Committee. 
 
Membership
All of the members of the Nominating Committee are 
independent non-executive directors save for myself. 
Meetings
The Nominating Committee held one meeting during the year 
and details of members’ attendance are set out on page 45. 
Effectiveness of the Nominating Committee 
As detailed on page 48, an internal evaluation was conducted 
during the year which conﬁ rmed that the Nominating 
Committee was operating effectively. An area of focus for the 
Nominating Committee over the coming year will be to consider 
succession planning and the skills, experience and geographic 
diversity of the Board.
Role
The Nominating Committee has a number of responsibilities as 
set out in its terms of reference which are available on the 
Group’s website. In summary the key roles are to:
• review the Board structure, size and composition (including 
the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity) compared 
with its current position and make recommendations to the 
Board with regard to any changes;
• consider succession planning with regard to the Board and 
senior leaders; and 
• make recommendations to the Board regarding the 
appointment, reappointment and retirement of directors.
Activities of the Nominating Committee 
Set out below are the key matters considered by the 
Nominating Committee during 2012/13 and subsequently.
Consideration of Board evaluation recommendations 
Following the internal Board evaluation, the recommendations 
were reviewed and objectives for 2013/14 were agreed by 
the  Nominating Committee in May 2013. These are set out 
on  page 48.
Governance matters
We dealt with a number of annual governance matters, 
including consideration of the independence of the non-
executive directors. We also conducted a review of our terms 
of  reference, the outcome of which concluded no changes 
were required. 
Diversity
In response to the Davies Report on “Women on Boards” we 
have previously conﬁ rmed our aim to increase the proportion of 
female representation on the Board by 2015. Following the 
2013 AGM over 20% of the Board will be female. We recognise 
the importance and beneﬁ ts of diversity and will continue to 
take this into account in our recruitment processes whilst 
ensuring that candidates are selected on merit and ensuring 
that there is an appropriate range and balance of skills, 
experience and background on the Board.

Re-election of directors
On the recommendation of the Nominating Committee, the 
Board has proposed that all directors seek re-election at the 
2013 AGM other than Francesco Caio and Pat Zito who 
informed the Board that they did not wish to seek re-election. 
Succession planning
Succession planning is a key area of discussion for the 
Nominating Committee. We reviewed the capability of our 
leadership team and considered the succession plans for the 
executive directors. This included reviewing development plans 
and career opportunities across the Group.
The chart below details the Chairman and non-executive 
directors and their terms of ofﬁ ce. The Nominating Committee 
reviews this information to help plan the membership of the 
Board to ensure we have the appropriate skill sets, relevant 
experience and diversity on the Board and its committees. 
As detailed on page 47 , the Board agreed (on the 
recommendation of the Nominating Committee) that the 
appointment of Paul Lester be extended for a further three-year 
term. The Nominating Committee also conﬁ rmed that Bay 
Green would retire as  Chairman of the Audit Committee and 
be replaced by Deena Mattar with effect from 17 May 2013. 
Mr Green will continue as a member of the Audit Committee. 
Further, with effect from the 2013 AGM, Paul Lester and Deena 
Mattar will join the Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee respectively.
The retirement of Francesco Caio and Pat Zito was accepted 
and it was decided not to replace these positions given the 
reduced size and complexity of the Group. Over the next year 
the Nominating Committee will review the Board composition 
including the skills, experience and geographic diversity of 
the   Board, particularly in light of the new strategic focus of  
the  Group.

Retiring with effect from the 2013 AGM.
I have chaired the Audit Committee since 2006 and I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to explain its work.
I invite all members of the Board to meetings of the Audit 
Committee. Executives from the Group’s ﬁ nance team 
(including the Chairman of the Risk Committee), as well as 
representatives of the external auditor and the internal audit 
partner (as required) join our meetings. Consequently, our 
meetings are well attended.
A description of our activities during the year is set out on 
pages  54 to 56 but I would like to preface th is with a few 
introductory remarks.
After ﬁ nalising the ﬁ nancial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2013, I am retiring as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee and Deena Mattar is taking on this role. I shall 
continue as a member of the Audit Committee for the ﬁ nancial 
year 2013/14. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my 
colleagues on the Audit Committee for their contributions and 
support over the period of my Chairmanship. As explained 
earlier, I encourage all members of the Board to attend the 
Audit Committee meetings given that it provides a real insight 
into the ﬁ nancial operation of the Group. As a result, the Audit 
Committee also beneﬁ ts from the contributions of other 
directors who are not actual members of the Audit Committee. 
During my tenure as Chairman, the Group’s ﬁ nancial 
management has made great progress. I have worked with 
several Chief Financial Ofﬁ cers of the Group and it has been 
both interesting and helpful that each comes with slightly 
different priorities and perspectives which taken together 
have undoubtedly given the Audit Committee a more holistic 
approach in meeting its objectives.
The working relationship with the senior executives in the 
Finance team has also been excellent with detailed reporting 
and timely and comprehensive responses to any requests for 
additional information by the Audit Committee. Continuous 
improvements are being made to the Group’s internal control 
and risk framework.
I should acknowledge the helpful contributions from the 
external and internal auditors who have also made themselves 
available on request for discussion whether or not as part of the 
Audit Committee. 
Deena and I have worked closely together on the Audit 
Committee since Deena joined the Group with a view to the 
change of Chairmanship being a seamless event. The Audit 
Committee will beneﬁ t from her very practical ﬁ nancial 
background and experience of chairing such committees. 
She has my best wishes for her new role.
Membership
All of the members of the Audit Committee are independent 
non-executive directors.
I am a qualiﬁ ed chartered accountant and Fellow of the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (FCA) and 
have worked in ﬁ nancial roles for over 30 years. My full 
biography is set out on page 43 together with those of the other 
members of the Audit Committee. As part of my commitment 
to the Audit Committee, I attend technical update seminars on 
a regular basis. 
Deena is also a FCA. She was formerly Group Finance Director 
at Kier Group plc. 
The Board is satisﬁ ed that at least one member of the Audit 
Committee has recent and relevant ﬁ nancial experience as 
required for corporate governance purposes.
Meetings
The Audit Committee held ﬁ ve scheduled meetings during 
the year and details of members’ attendance are set out 
on page 45.
The chart below shows how we spent our time and our 
activities are described in detail on pages 54 to 56.

In addition, I meet periodically with the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer 
and Group Controller for business updates with particular 
emphasis on ﬁ nancial performance. In advance of each Audit 
Committee, I meet with key executives and the external auditor 
to ensure that the reporting and discussion will appropriately 
address the Audit Committee agenda matters. At the time of 
the half-year and full-year results, I have a private meeting with 
the external auditor to ensure that any issues they have 
identiﬁ ed are raised and discussed appropriately at the 
subsequent Audit Committee meeting. Furthermore, the Audit 
Committee has a private meeting with the external auditor at 
least once a year, without management being present, to 
discuss their remit and any issues arising from the audit.

Governance Audit Committee Report
continued
In addition to their periodic attendance at relevant meetings 
where internal audit ﬁ ndings are considered, the Audit 
Committee meets at least once a year without management 
present with the managing partner from Deloitte LLP who 
is responsible for the provision of internal audit services 
to the Group.
Effectiveness of the Audit Committee
The Board evaluation (detailed on page 48) conﬁ rmed that the 
Audit Committee was operating effectively, being diligent and 
providing good judgement. The monitoring of cost savings as a 
result of the reorganisation of the Group will be an area of focus 
for the Audit Committee over the next year. 
Role and responsibilities
The Audit Committee has a number of responsibilities as set 
out in its terms of reference which are available on the Group’s 
website. In accordance with corporate governance guidelines 
the terms of reference of the Audit Committee are reviewed 
annually. 
During 2012/13 the Audit Committee agreed changes to its 
terms of reference (effective 1 April 2013) which reﬂ ected 
provisions of the updated 2012 Code and the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Guidance on Audit Committees. 
In summary the main duties of the Audit Committee are to:
• review and recommend to the Board the ﬁ nancial statements 
and formal announcements relating to ﬁ nancial performance, 
including a review of accounting policies and ﬁ nancial 
reporting judgements;
• examine, on behalf of the Board, the effectiveness of the 
Group’s systems of internal controls and risk management, 
and ensure that the process accords with the Turnbull 
Guidance;
• monitor and review the effectiveness of the Internal Audit 
function;
• oversee the relationship with the external auditor and make 
recommendations to the Board regarding their appointment 
and remuneration; 
• assess the effectiveness of the external audit process; and
• agree the policy on auditor independence and the non-audit 
services policy.
Also, with effect from 1 April 2013 to:
• review the annual report and accounts (when requested by 
the Board) as a whole and to advise whether it is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy;
• ensure that at least once every  10 years the audit services 
contract is put out to tender to enable the quality and 
effectiveness of the existing services to be assessed; and
• report formally to the Board on how the Audit Committee has 
discharged its responsibilities.
The Audit Committee is satisﬁ ed that, during the year under 
review, it has fully discharged its responsibilities under its terms 
of reference.
Activities of the Audit Committee 
Set out below are the key matters considered by the Audit 
Committee during 2012/13.
Financial reporting
The Audit Committee reviewed the form and content of the 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012 and the half-year ﬁ nancial 
report prior to their publication to provide assurance that the 
disclosures made in the ﬁ nancial statements were properly set 
in context. As part of this process, the Audit Committee 
received reports from management and the external auditor. 
Reports that the Audit Committee received from the Group 
Controller included the following areas for review:
• Comparison of results between management and ﬁ nancial 
accounts;
•  A reconciliation with the most recent forecast approved by 
the Board;
•  A ﬁ nancial overview of the results;
•  Signiﬁ cant items in the Group Financial  Statements that 
require critical accounting judgements, estimates and 
assumptions with regard to construction and long-term 
 service provision contracts, impairment of goodwill, pension 
and post-retirement beneﬁ ts, development costs, provisions 
and contingent liabilities;
•  An update of key areas of focus for the Audit Committee 
including in particular analysis of major long -term 
contracts,  research and development, and intangible 
development costs;
•  Dividends and distributable reserves; and
•  Liquidity risk and the basis for preparing the Group accounts 
on a going concern basis.
In their reports to the Audit Committee, the external auditor 
provided their audit opinion along with their audit ﬁ ndings that 
were of signiﬁ cance in relation to the audit of the ﬁ nancial 
statements included in the Annual Report and Accounts 2012 
and for the half-year ﬁ ndings a review of the ﬁ nancial position 
and results of the operations. The Audit Committee reviewed 
these reports with the external auditor.
Internal controls
During the year we have examined the key elements of the 
internal control processes and provided assurance to the 
Board on the effectiveness of the internal control environment. 
Set out below are a number of the activities that have been 
completed in our review of ﬁ nancial, operational and 
compliance controls.
• We considered the results of internal control self-assessment 
returns from the businesses and reviewed management 
responses to any identiﬁ ed weaknesses.
• We received a report from the external auditor which set out 
their key observations on the internal control environment 
that had arisen during their annual audit, along with 
management’s remediation plans to strengthen further the 
internal controls within the Group.
• At most meetings we receive a summary of the ﬁ nancial 
control audits performed by Internal Audit, including the key 
recommendations. The audits include reviews of processes 
relating to accounting and ﬁ nance, revenue, project 
management and contracting, capital expenditure, 
procurement, inventory, payroll and general computer 
controls. Last year we reported that particular attention had 
been given to ensuring a timely remediation of any audit 
recommendations; this rigour has continued this year with 
updates provided at each meeting.
Corporate Governance continued
54 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 • We reviewed arrangements under which employees can, 
on a conﬁ dential basis, raise concerns about potential 
irregularities in ﬁ nancial reporting or other matters, and the 
arrangements for follow-up actions. 
• Signiﬁ cant variances between results and internal forecasts 
are considered and where such variances are indicative of 
control failings, management actions to address weaknesses 
are reviewed.
• We monitor key controls through a governance, risk and 
compliance application known as the “Internal Control 
Framework”  (ICF) which is a software application for the 
monitoring of key ﬁ nancial controls. This was implemented in 
April 2012 to strengthen the overall control environment 
through the early identiﬁ cation of control weaknesses. 
Completion of monthly assessments is comprehensive and 
demonstrates good compliance.
• We continue to focus on system tools to tighten our internal 
controls, for example establishing an automated ledger link 
between general ledgers and sub-ledgers in our ERP 
systems in the businesses to the Group’s ﬁ nancial 
consolidation system that ensures a full audit trail and no 
allowance for manual entries.
• The Audit Committee receives a regular and comprehensive 
review of internal controls and accounting matters in advance 
of each results announcement.
The Board’s review of the risk management process and its 
statement on internal control is contained on page 50.
Risk management
As the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing risk 
management processes and reporting systems on behalf of the 
Board, presentation of an update from the Chairman of the Risk 
Committee has become a regular cadence. A standardised 
approach to the completion of project risk registers has 
facilitated reporting to the Audit Committee and enabled more 
sophisticated and meaningful reports. In advance of each Audit 
Committee meeting, I now meet privately with the Chairman of 
the Risk Committee to review progress and key matters to be 
presented in the report to the Audit Committee.
As well as reviewing the major risks in more detail, we 
monitored the mitigation actions put in place by management. 
The role of the Risk Committee is described fully on pages 33 
and 35 and the risk management and review process is 
outlined on pages 34 and 35. A summary of the principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the Group is presented on 
pages 3 5 to 38.
External auditor
Ernst & Young LLP has been the Company’s auditor since 
October 1999. During the year we reviewed the qualiﬁ cation of 
the audit team, the rotation policies, auditor independence and 
their ﬁ rm-wide procedures and credentials, together with the 
effectiveness of the audit process. This assessment included 
feedback from the Group’s senior ﬁ nance management which 
was co ordinated through completion of a questionnaire 
distributed to ﬁ nance managers which sought feedback 
on the audit process.
We also considered Ernst & Young LLP’s own annual 
transparency report which provides information on the 
structure and governance of the audit ﬁ rm and outlines their 
processes relating to audit quality and auditor objectivity. 
Following the results of the assessment we remained satisﬁ ed 
with the effectiveness and performance of Ernst & Young LLP 
and recommended to the Board their reappointment which will 
be considered at the 2013 AGM.
Consistent with market practice, Ernst & Young LLP’s audit 
services to the Group are provided annually through terms of 
engagement which we reviewed. These terms do not include 
any contractual obligations under which the directors would be 
prevented from appointing a different ﬁ rm.
As part of the annual assessment of the external auditor we 
discuss whether there would be any beneﬁ t from a change 
in  auditor or a competitive tendering process. The Audit 
Committee remains satisﬁ ed with the services provided by 
Ernst & Young LLP , and does not propose to undertake a 
tender in the coming year. In light of the recommendation 
included in the updated 2012 Code for FTSE 350 companies 
to  put their audit out to tender at least every  10 years, it is the 
Group’s intention to carry out a tender during 2014/15.
We also discussed the proposed audit plan with the auditor and 
agreed key initiatives to drive cost efﬁ ciencies without impairing 
the service quality. In reviewing the external audit fee, we 
compared the fee with market rates. Long-term contracting 
continues to be a key area of focus in the audit. 
Non-audit services 
One of our responsibilities is to ensure the independence of our 
external auditor is not impaired in the provision of any non-audit 
services. We have a policy in place which governs the non-
audit services that can be appropriately performed by the 
external auditor. This is set out  on page  56.
During the year we receive a quarterly report on non-audit 
services which we review at our scheduled meetings.
In the year, Ernst & Young LLP was engaged to provide 
transaction assurance services in relation to the disposal of the 
Invensys Rail division (for a fee of £1.3 million) and the proposed 
return of cash to shareholders (for a fee of £0.3 million). They 
continued to provide services under the global tax compliance 
and legal entity rationalisation programmes, both of which 
commenced in prior years. Other potential suppliers were 
originally considered for these programmes, but the external 
auditor’s knowledge of the Group, and the efﬁ ciencies that 
could be achieved as a result, were key factors for their 
engagement with this work. 
Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 55
Governance Audit Committee Report
continued
Non-audit services policy
Under this policy the external auditor is prohibited from 
undertaking any work that is considered to threaten its 
independence or objectivity in its role. Prohibited work 
speciﬁ cally includes bookkeeping services, the design and 
implementation of ﬁ nancial information systems, appraisal or 
valuation services, actuarial or legal services and any other 
work that would involve the external auditor in preparing 
ﬁ nancial information that is included or disclosed in the 
audited ﬁ nancial statements, or in making judgements or 
taking decisions on behalf of management.
The external auditor is permitted to undertake work in other 
areas as long as it is the most suitable supplier of the service 
and the terms and conditions of the engagement, including 
the level of the fee, do not impair its objectivity or 
independence. Under the policy, the Audit Committee 
pre-approves the use of the external auditor for routine 
non-audit services, subject to a quarterly and annual 
monetary cap. Routine non-audit services include advice on 
accounting, auditing and ﬁ nancial reporting matters; 
assurance over internal accounting and risk management 
procedures; non-statutory audit (including reviews of interim 
ﬁ nancial information); project assurance and advice on 
accounting process improvement; due diligence in 
connection with business acquisitions and disposals; 
corporate income tax and indirect tax compliance and 
advisory services; and tax services in respect of business 
acquisitions and disposals. Speciﬁ c approval is required from 
the Audit Committee for any of these services that would 
result in the pre-approved monetary cap being exceeded, 
and for any other services that are not included in the list of 
pre-approved services. 
When determining whether the external auditor is the most 
suitable supplier of a particular service, management and the 
Audit Committee take into account the cost-effectiveness of 
the service and the external auditor’s knowledge of the Group. 
Ernst & Young LLP has policies and procedures in place to 
ensure that the highest standards of objectivity, 
independence and integrity are maintained and these 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. The audit engagement partner must 
approve any non-audit services offered to the Group. This 
ensures that the objectives of the proposed engagement are 
not inconsistent with the objectives of the audit; allows the 
identiﬁ cation and assessment of any related threats to Ernst 
& Young LLP’s objectivity; and assesses the effectiveness of 
available safeguards to eliminate such threats or reduce them 
to an acceptable level. Ernst & Young LLP do not carry out 
non-audit services where no satisfactory safeguards exist.
Internal audit
The majority of internal audit work for the Group continues to be 
outsourced to Deloitte LLP . The Group maintains a small 
Internal Audit function  to manage the outsourcing contract, 
undertake certain assignments and follow  up internal audit 
recommendations. This function reports to the Group 
Controller but the internal audit managing partner has a direct 
reporting line to me also. At least once a year I meet privately 
with the internal audit managing partner as well as his meeting 
the Audit Committee without the attendance of management.
Internal Audit has reported regularly to the Audit Committee on 
the results of internal control audits undertaken under a rolling 
plan agreed in advance. Internal control issues are monitored 
by the Audit Committee to resolution.
Internal Audit operates to an annual plan for ﬁ nancial control 
audits in conjunction with central continuous monitoring of 
these controls using the Group’s ICF application. The internal 
audit plan is risk -based in the audit of ﬁ nancial controls, 
long-term contracts and other operational audits. The internal 
audit plan is integrated into an overall assurance matrix for 
the Group. 
The effectiveness of the Internal Audit function was assessed 
during the year using a similar questionnaire approach to that 
adopted for the external auditor. The feedback has been shared 
with Deloitte LLP . The results concluded that the function was 
effective and performed in accordance with relevant 
professional standards. The Audit Committee agreed that 
questionnaires will be completed by the businesses as a matter 
of course after each audit to collect continuous feedback.
During the year the Audit Committee reviewed and approved 
an updated Internal Audit Charter.
Other matters
• As supporters of the promotion of good payment practice, 
we recommended to the Board that the Company sign up to 
the UK Government’s Prompt Payment Code.
• As sponsor of a programme to reduce the number of legal 
entities in the Group to simplify the structure and reduce 
operating costs, we continue to monitor progress through 
six-monthly updates. Since commencement of the 
programme in 2011, there has been a signiﬁ cant reduction in 
the number of entities in the Group and cost savings realised.
• There has been a focus on the employee expense process 
and monitoring of compliance to policy.
• We reviewed and approved for recommendation to the 
Board, amended delegated authorities which set limits 
of approval for certain matters to Group management 
and the divisions.
• We observed closely the monitoring of major projects and, 
through the Group Controller and external auditor, received 
detailed reports on such projects. 
• To ensure that the preparation of the annual report and 
accounts takes account of current best practice we 
considered guidance issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council and comments made by shareholder bodies on the 
adequacy of our disclosures. This review process has been 
in place for a number of years and will continue.
• The Audit Committee received brieﬁ ngs from the Group 
Controller and Chief Legal Ofﬁ cer about developments in 
ﬁ nancial reporting standards, compliance matters and best 
practice to ensure we continue to focus on the right areas.

56 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Dear Shareholder 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our 
Remuneration Report for 2012/13 which will be 
proposed for approval by advisory vote at the 2013 AGM. 
We have followed closely the widespread debate on the issue 
of executive pay during the last year and, in the spirit of 
transparency, we have made signiﬁ cant enhancements to the 
Remuneration Report for 2012/13 which reﬂ ect the proposals 
from the Department of Business, Innovation & Skills (BIS). 
As I write, the BIS proposed revised directors’ remuneration 
reporting regulations are subject to Parliamentary assent and it 
is anticipated that they will come into force on 1 October 2013, 
so we are not in a position to reﬂ ect the ﬁ nal regulations at this 
time. However, we have endeavoured to comply with the spirit 
of the draft regulations by making additional disclosures, 
including:
•  a single number for the remuneration of each executive 
director;
•  an enhanced Remuneration Policy Table which provides 
greater detail on each element of pay, including the link to 
strategy, performance metrics and changes in the year;
•  a chart detailing what reward executive directors could 
receive for achieving minimum, target and maximum levels 
of performance; and
•  a table providing a ﬁ ve-year analysis of the pay of the 
Chief Executive.
We are conscious of the complexity that these additional 
disclosures present. We have strived to make the Remuneration 
Report as easy as possible to digest and provide our 
shareholders with the information required to assess the 
decisions made by the Remuneration Committee in a 
straightforward manner. 
Our remuneration strategy has remained consistent at Invensys 
over many years. The Remuneration Committee believes that 
pay should reﬂ ect performance with a high proportion of total 
reward based on growth in proﬁ t and the creation of 
shareholder value. 
As outlined in the Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 8 and 
9, the Company has had a transformational year. This has been 
reﬂ ected in the remuneration outcomes for executive directors 
for 2012/13 with annual bonuses close to maximum payout. 
With regard to the 2010 LTIP Award, this will vest at 47 .2% for 
the Chief Executive. This vesting reﬂ ects average performance 
over a three-year period to 31 March 2013, which has included 
some disappointments as well as successes. 
There will be no base salary increases for the executive 
directors for 2013/14. The decision to freeze executive directors’ 
salaries was taken, on the recommendation of the Chief 
Executive, against the background of the restructuring of the 
Group resulting from the sale of the Invensys Rail division.
Our reward policy is aligned with our broader strategic goals 
 as follows:
• A high proportion of remuneration is directly linked to the 
annual and long-term performance of the Group. Base 
salaries are, on the whole, set at levels which are around 
market -median for the sectors and countries in which we 
operate. High levels of reward can only be achieved by 
delivering our strategic ﬁ nancial performance goals;
• A clear line of sight between leaders’ rewards and the 
business for which they are responsible; and
• A personal element to leaders’ annual incentive measures to 
ensure a focus on the delivery of key pre-determined 
strategic objectives.
The table on page 6 0 provides further detail on the link between 
our strategy and remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee welcomes the opportunity that 
this Report provides to explain our remuneration policy and to 
receive feedback from our shareholders. The Remuneration 
Committee noted that the Remuneration Report 2011/12 
received a 97 .7% vote in favour at the 2012 AGM. However, we 
consider carefully all shareholder views expressed. In the lead 
up to the 2012 AGM, shareholders and their representative 
bodies raised two points on which I would like to take this 
opportunity to comment:
• The Remuneration Committee’s decision to increase the 
maximum bonus potential for the Chief Legal Ofﬁ cer to 200% 
of base salary for super-stretch performance and 100% for 
target performance. This decision was taken to provide 
equity and consistency across the incentive framework for 
the three executive directors and to reﬂ ect Victoria Hull’s 
contribution to the Group; and
• The fact that additional payments were made to the former 
Chief Executive (Ulf Henriksson who left the Group in March 
2011) in May 2012 in relation to a release and waiver of claims 
he might have had against the Company. This payment was 
approved by the Remuneration Committee to expedite 
negotiations with Mr Henriksson, and to provide the 
necessary legal protection for the Company.
On reﬂ ection, the Remuneration Committee remains satisﬁ ed 
that the two decisions outlined above were appropriate and in 
the best interests of the Company.
In general, the Remuneration Report 2011/12 was well received 
and, in particular, there were supportive comments in relation to 
the Remuneration Committee’s decision not to make bonus 
payments to executive directors for 2011/12, given the overall 
disappointing ﬁ nancial performance of the Group. This was 
despite the Remuneration Committee’s assessment that this 
was largely due to legacy issues and that the executive 
directors had met or exceeded their personal performance 
targets for the year. The fact that the Remuneration Committee 
has approved the payment of near maximum bonus payments 
for 2012/13 recognises the transformational year for Invensys 
and demonstrates our strong link between pay and 
performance.
Going forward we will review our remuneration strategy to 
ensure we continue to incentivise the delivery of strong ﬁ nancial 
results and the creation of shareholder value.

Base salary  
Base salaries have been frozen at prior year levels for the three 
executive directors for 2013/14:
•  Chief Executive – £669,500;
• Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer – £370,800; and
• Chief Legal Ofﬁ cer – £350,200.
Annual incentives
Bonus payments for 2012/13 were close to maximum, reﬂ ecting the 
transformational year for Invensys:
•  Maximum bonus payment was 200% of base salary based 
on  the  achievement of super-stretch performance;
•  Executive directors received bonus payments of 198.6% of 
salary  for 2012/13, of which 98.6% of salary will be paid in 
deferred shares; and
• Structure of bonus plan unchanged for 2013/14.
Long-term incentives
With regard to the Long Term Incentive Plan 2007 (LTIP):
•  2010 Award will vest at 47 .2% for the Chief Executive as a result 
of the EPS-based element being close to the maximum vesting 
level and the TSR-based (total shareholder return) element 
providing zero vesting; and
•  An LTIP award will be made in 2013/14 with a value of 200% of 
salary for the executive directors, using EPS and TSR 
performance measures on a similar basis to previous awards.
The tables below provide a summary of the key remuneration outcomes 
for 2012/13 and the structure for 2013/14.

Governance
All members are independent non-executive 
directors, other than Sir Nigel Rudd, the 
Chairman of the Company. At the invitation of 
the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, other non-executive directors also 
attend meetings. The executive directors, 
Chief Human Resources Ofﬁ cer and the Vice 
President Total Reward are invited to attend 
meetings, other than when their own 
remuneration is being considered. The 
Chairman of the Company does not attend 
when his fee is under review.
To ensure that the Group’s remuneration 
practices remain market competitive and 
compliant, advice during the year was received 
from Kepler Associates, the independent 
consultants to the Remuneration Committee, 
on issues relating to the remuneration 
arrangements for the executive directors 
and  other senior leaders in the Group. 
Kepler Associates was appointed by the 
Remuneration Committee in 2010. Their 
reporting relationship is to the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, although they work 
with management in supporting the 
Remuneration Committee. During the year, 
they have provided advice to the 
Remuneration Committee on a broad range of 
issues including executive base salaries, total 
remuneration market positioning, incentive 
design and corporate governance issues as 
they relate to remuneration. The role of Kepler 
Associates is to provide independent advice to 
the Remuneration Committee and they have 
no delegated authority to make any decisions 
on behalf of the Remuneration Committee. 
Kepler Associates does not provide any other 
advice to the Company. Fees paid to Kepler 
Associates for advice to the Remuneration 
Committee during 2012/13 were £88,720. A 
copy of the terms of appointment of Kepler 
Associates is available on the Group’s website. 
Kepler Associates is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and 
adheres to its code of conduct.
New Bridge Street (part of Aon Hewitt Limited) 
provided the Remuneration Committee with 
data in relation to total shareholder return 
(TSR) and ranking information for the 2007 
Long Term Incentive Plan (2007 LTIP). The 
Remuneration Committee was provided with 
legal advice from Freshﬁ elds Bruckhaus 
Deringer LLP , who are also lawyers to the 
Company.
The Remuneration Committee met on ﬁ ve 
occasions during the year and details of 
members’ attendance are set out on page 45. 
One of the meetings included a strategy 
session which focused speciﬁ cally on the 
appropriateness of the remuneration policy for 
the following ﬁ nancial year.
Communication with shareholders is given a 
high priority and the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee held discussions 
with shareholders on relevant matters during 
the course of the ﬁ nancial year.
Effectiveness of the Remuneration 
Committee
The internal Board evaluation (detailed on 
page  48) conﬁ rmed that the Remuneration 
Committee was operating effectively, focused 
and providing good judgement. One of the 
recommendations from the evaluation was that 
the Remuneration Committee should review 
the remuneration strategy for appropriateness 
in light of the reorganised Group.
Role 
The Remuneration Committee has a number 
of responsibilities as set out in its terms of 
reference which are available in full on the 
Group’s website. In summary the key 
responsibilities are to:
• recommend to the Board the broad policy 
for the remuneration of the Chairman, 
executive directors, Company Secretary, 
the Group Leadership Team (GLT) and 
certain leaders below the GLT whose 
remuneration is above a certain level and, 
within the terms of this agreed policy, 
approve individual remuneration packages;
• approve the targets for any performance-
related incentives and approve the total 
annual payments made under such plans;
• review the design of all share incentive plans 
and determine the performance conditions;
• ensure that contractual terms on 
termination, and any payments made, are 
fair to the individual and the Group, that 
failure is not rewarded and that the duty to 
mitigate loss is recognised; 
• oversee any major changes in employee 
beneﬁ t structures throughout the Group; 
and
• select independent consultants to advise 
the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee is satisﬁ ed that 
it has fully discharged its responsibilities under 
its terms of reference.
The fee arrangements for non-executive 
directors are a matter for the Chairman of the 
Company and the executive directors of the 
Board and further detail is set out on page 6 8. 
Activities of the Remuneration 
Committee 
The key matters considered by the 
Remuneration Committee during 2012/13 
were to:
• review executive directors’ and GLT 
remuneration, including base salary and 
incentive arrangements;
• approve the outturn of performance targets 
for the Executive Bonus Plan for the prior 
year and the structure and performance 
targets for the current year;
• approve annual awards under the 2007 LTIP 
and the Restricted Share Plan (RSP);
• assess performance conditions relating to 
executive share awards under the 2007 LTIP 
vesting during the year;
• recommend the change to the 2007 LTIP 
rules to allow, at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee, awards to vest 
early rather than only in compassionate 
circumstances; 
• approve termination packages for leavers 
within the GLT;
• approve a settlement with HMRC relating to 
the former Chief Executive;
• approve supplementary incentive 
arrangements for senior leaders in the 
Invensys Rail division aimed at rewarding 
successful completion of the sale of the 
division;
• agree the treatment of LTIP awards for 
executives leaving with the sale of Invensys 
Rail and through reorganisation of the 
Group; 
• consider the implications of the proposed 
return of cash and share consolidation on 
share awards;
• undertake the annual review of its terms of 
reference and the annual assessment of 
independent adviser services and costs; 
and
• monitor discussions around executive pay 
including the revised remuneration reporting 
requirements published by BIS.

leaders at a level and in a manner that is capable 
of attracting, retaining and motivating high-calibre 
people; and
• Being market-competitive in the context of our 
reward packages.
To enable Invensys to deliver strong Group 
performance through sustainable growth:
• At Group-level, focus on EPS and cash ﬂ ow;

Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Policy is to provide 
competitive remuneration for the delivery 
of target performance, while rewarding 
exceptional personal and Group performance 
with upper quartile levels of remuneration. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that 
the total reward package provides a strong link 
to, and a good balance between, annual and 
long-term performance. 
In setting the Remuneration Policy, the 
Remuneration Committee is cognisant of the 
need to balance risk with reward and remains 
satisﬁ ed with its reward practices. The 
Remuneration Committee considers risk 
each year and has discretion to adjust the 
calculation of any ﬁ nancial outturns for 
incentive purposes if it considers that 
disproportionate risk has been taken to 
deliver performance targets.
 Base salary
The Remuneration Committee determines the 
level of base salary for each executive director 
annually. For 2011/12, the Remuneration 
Committee commissioned a full total 
remuneration benchmarking report from 
Kepler Associates which provided relevant 
comparator pay analyses across a range of 
international companies which competed with 
the Group and also benchmarked pay against 
FTSE companies of similar market 
capitalisation and/or revenue. For 2012/13 and 
2013/14, the Remuneration Committee asked 
Kepler Associates to provide external market 
data on the level of base salary increases 
amongst comparator companies to further 
inform its decisions as, given the restructuring 
of the Group, the timing was not thought 
appropriate to conduct a full benchmarking 
exercise. 
The Remuneration Committee additionally 
considers speciﬁ c factors relating to the 
individual (including personal performance), 
internal relativities, wage inﬂ ation elsewhere 
in the Group and more general market 
movements, and overall affordability. 
In determining base salary, the Remuneration 
Committee is mindful of the pay and 
conditions of employees in the rest of the 
Group and has received relevant data from 
the Chief Human Resources Ofﬁ cer to support 
its decisions. In establishing individual salary 
levels, the Remuneration Committee is 
conscious that it should pay no more than is 
necessary to retain and motivate the 
executive, while ensuring business objectives 
are fulﬁ lled. There is no automatic annual base 
salary adjustment. 
There will be no base salary increases for the 
executive directors for 2013/14. This was 
proposed by the Chief Executive to support 
the cost savings being achieved through the 
Group restructuring. 
The Remuneration Committee considers the 
current base salary levels appropriate to meet 
its objectives of incentivising the executive 
directors and maintaining competitive pay 
levels. The next salary review date for the 
executive directors will be during 2014/15.
 Annual incentive arrangements
Performance-related bonuses may be paid to 
executive directors and senior leaders under 
the Executive Bonus Plan (EBP). The EBP 
provides annual incentives to encourage the 
achievement of pre deﬁ ned annual ﬁ nancial 
objectives and personal targets to focus on 
the most critical measures of business 
success, while rewarding executives for 
outstanding performance. In this way, the EBP 
seeks to align the interests of shareholders 
and participants.
For 2012/13 and 2013/14, the Remuneration 
Committee approved the following 
performance calibration for the EBP:
Threshold
10%
of target 
payout 
Target
100%
of target 
payout
Stretch
150%
of target 
payout
Super-stretch
200%
of target

The bonus payment available to executive 
directors for target performance is 100% of 
base salary, resulting in a maximum bonus 
opportunity for the achievement of super-
stretch performance of 200% of base salary 
for 2012/13 and 2013/14.
 Executive Bonus Plan 2012/13
The performance conditions for executive 
directors for 2012/13 are set out in the table 
below: 
Underlying
EPS
50% 
Free cash 
ﬂ ow
25%
Personal
performance
25%
In line with the EBP rules, the salary used 
for bonus calculation purposes is the salary 
effective from 1 April 2012 (adjusted for any 
promotion increases). 
In respect of 2012/13 actual performance, the 
element of executive directors’ bonus based 
on underlying EPS paid at the super-stretch 
level of 200% of target payment and the 
element based on free cash ﬂ ow paid at just 
below super-stretch. Also, in recognition of the 
performance of the executive directors in this 
transformational year for the Group, in which 
their personal goals were met in full, all three 
executive directors received the super-stretch 
level of payment for personal performance.
In aggregate, the bonus payment to the 
executive directors in relation to 2012/13 
performance was 198.6% of base salary. 
 The 2012/13 bonus earned in excess of 100% 
of target for incumbent members of the GLT 
is paid in deferred shares (in accordance with 
the rules of the Deferred Share Plan), which 
are transferred to the individual after three 
years (for executive directors) or two years 
(other GLT members). 
In relation to the 2012/13 bonus, the executive 
directors will receive deferred shares with a 
value of 98.6% of base salary in June 2013, 
vesting in June 2016. A payment equal to 
100% of base salary (i.e. 100% of target for 
the executive directors), will be paid in cash 
(subject to statutory tax withholdings) in 
June 2013. 
Having reviewed the results achieved against 
the ﬁ nancial performance targets set for 
2012/13, the Remuneration Committee is 
satisﬁ ed that the targets set were challenging. 
Executive Bonus Plan 2013/14
The targets for executive directors for 2013/14 
are set out in the table below:
Underlying
EPS
50% 
Free cash

The Remuneration Committee has carefully 
reviewed the ﬁ nancial and personal 
performance targets to be applied for the 
EBP for 2013/14 and, after considering 
external benchmarks, is of the opinion that 
they are set at appropriately stretching levels. 
Bonus payments may also be inﬂ uenced 
through the exercise of discretion by the 
Remuneration Committee. Any bonus earned 
in excess of target by GLT members will be 
paid in deferred shares as set out previously. 
Deferred shares are only forfeitable in the 
event of dismissal for cause.
62 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013  
 Long-term incentive arrangements
The 2007 LTIP was approved by shareholders 
at the 2007 AGM and since then the Company 
has made annual awards under this plan. The 
maximum annual award level for executive 
directors and other participants is normally 
200% of base salary, although the 
Remuneration Committee has discretion 
to make awards in excess of this level in 
exceptional circumstances.
Vesting of awards is based on meeting 
stretching performance targets over a 
three-year performance period and, subject 
to meeting all relevant conditions, shares will 
normally be released to participants as soon 
as possible following the third anniversary of 
the award. The satisfaction of all performance 
targets is subject to external veriﬁ cation.
For awards to be granted in 2013/14, the 
Remuneration Committee considered all 
relevant factors and determined that the two 
components of the award, measuring TSR 
and EPS, continue to provide a focus on both 
comparative shareholder returns and 
delivering stretching internal ﬁ nancial targets. 
In the opinion of the Remuneration Committee 
these TSR and EPS targets are appropriately 
stretching.
With regard to the EPS part of the awards that 
were granted in 2012/13, the EPS CAGR 
target would normally use the EPS for the prior 
year as the base (i.e. EPS for 2011/12). The 
Group’s reported EPS for 2011/12 was 
depressed due to the loss of proﬁ t associated 
with certain projects as discussed in the 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012 and the 
Remuneration Committee therefore decided 
that the 2011/12 reported EPS did not form an 
appropriate base on which to apply the CAGR 
target for the purpose of LTIP performance 
measurement. Reported underlying EPS for 
2011/12 was 13.4p. In determining the 
adjusted base EPS ﬁ gure of 17 .2p for awards 
granted in 2012/13, the Remuneration 
Committee took account of the:
• historical EPS performance of the Group;
• exceptional impact which certain projects 
had on proﬁ tability in 2011/12; and
• need to set performance conditions which 
are both stretching and achievable.
The use of an adjusted base EPS ﬁ gure of 
17 .2p for awards granted in 2012/13 means 
that the CAGR target is signiﬁ cantly more 
stretching than it would be using the 
underlying EPS for 2011/12 of 13.4p.
With regard to the base EPS ﬁ gure for 2013/14 
LTIP awards, the Remuneration Committee 
conﬁ rmed the use of reported underlying EPS 
for 2012/13 for continuing operations (i.e. 8.5p) 
as the earnings for Invensys Rail are reported 
as discontinued operations.
Following the completion of the return of cash 
and share capital consolidation relating to the 
sale of the Invensys Rail division, the 
Remuneration Committee will consider the 
impact of these events on the targets for 
subsisting LTIP awards. 
For 2012/13 and 2013/14 the performance criteria for the LTIP awards to executive directors measured over a three-year period are set out below:
Award Performance measure Outline of performance measure T arget calibration
50% of award Total shareholder

Governance Remuneration Report continued
The Remuneration Committee will in all 
cases retain discretion to ensure that, as 
an additional condition for the vesting of 
any shares in respect of the TSR or EPS 
component of the award, the underlying 
overall performance of the Group has been 
satisfactory. Factors that will be taken into 
account will include consistency of earnings 
and the Group’s cash position. Vested awards 
will include an additional number of shares 
representing the value of any dividends that 
would have been paid on those vested shares 
had they been held throughout the vesting 
period. The performance conditions do not 
apply to 30% of an award for participants 
below GLT level. This is to address speciﬁ c 
recruitment and retention issues facing the 
Group. For awards granted in 2012/13 and 
2013/14, for the GLT members who are not 
executive directors, the percentage of shares 
under award to which performance conditions 
do not apply will be 20% of the award or less 
to better reﬂ ect the ability of these senior 
executives to inﬂ uence Group performance.
If a participant is dismissed for cause before 
shares are released, they will be forfeited. 
If a participant’s employment ceases due 
to ill-health, disability or any other reason 
determined at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee, the ﬁ nancial 
performance tests will be measured at the 
normal vesting date but can be accelerated 
at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee. Subject to the outcome of the 
ﬁ nancial performance tests, the award will 
then be pro rated based on the period of 
service, save that the Remuneration 
Committee may moderate the application of 
the pro rata reduction if it considers that the 
participant’s contribution to the business 
would not be properly recognised if the award 
was scaled down. If a participant resigns, their 
award will lapse unless the Remuneration 
Committee exercises its discretion. 
Previously, the Remuneration Committee 
only  had discretion to accelerate vesting in 
compassionate circumstances. However, at 
the General Meeting of the Company held in 
December 2012, a change to the 2007 LTIP 
leaver terms was approved so that, at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee, 
awards can vest early in such circumstances 
that the Remuneration Committee considers 
appropriate. 
In the event of a change of control during the 
performance period, performance will be 
measured at the latest possible date before 
the change of control takes place to determine 
the proportion vesting based on performance. 
The proportion of the award that may be 
released will then be time pro rated. Subject to 
performance conditions, the Remuneration 
Committee has discretion to disapply the 
impact of time pro rating and to permit up to 
100% of awards to vest on a change of control 
if, due to exceptional business circumstances 
(to be assessed by the Remuneration 
Committee), returns to shareholders are 
considered to be at a superior level.
2010 Award under the 2007 LTIP
For awards granted under the 2007 LTIP in 
2010 (2010 Award) the performance condition 
was measured over the three-year period to 
31 March 2013. Following determination of the 
TSR (provided by an independent third party) 
and EPS performance conditions, the 
Remuneration Committee determined that the 
threshold level of vesting for the TSR portion of 
the 2010 Award had not been achieved; this 
portion of the 2010 Award (50% of the total 
award for executive directors) will therefore 
lapse. With regard to the EPS portion of the 
2010 Award (50% of the total award for 
executive directors), the 2010 Award granted 
to the Chief Executive will vest at 94.4%. 
Therefore 47 .2% will vest in aggregate as a 
proportion of the initial award. 
In respect of the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and 
Chief Legal Ofﬁ cer, their 2010 Awards were 
granted prior to their appointment as executive 
directors and performance conditions did not 
apply to 30% of their awards; this portion of 
shares vested following the third anniversary of 
the date of grant. Of the 70% of the 2010 
Award subject to a performance test, the TSR 
element (35% of the total award) lapsed and 
the EPS element (35% of the total award) will 
vest at 94.4%. Therefore 63.0% will vest in 
aggregate as a proportion of the initial award. 
Pension arrangements
The Chief Executive receives a cash 
allowance  in lieu of pension with a value 
of  30% of base salary.
As both the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and the 
Chief Legal Ofﬁ cer joined Invensys prior to 
the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan being closed to 
new participants in 2004, both continue to 
participate in a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan for part 
of base salary. These deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
arrangements are based on a speciﬁ ed salary 
and are partly funded externally through 
a registered pension scheme and partly 
reserved for within the Company. The 
speciﬁ ed salaries covered by the deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t arrangements are £280,000 and 
£321,360 with regard to the Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer and Chief Legal Ofﬁ cer respectively. 
The pension beneﬁ t on the difference between 
actual salary and the level covered by the 
deﬁ ned beneﬁ t arrangements is delivered 
through a cash allowance with a value of 
30% of that difference. 
Other beneﬁ ts
Other beneﬁ ts provided for executive directors 
include the provision of a cash allowance in 
place of a company car, typical life assurance/
permanent health insurance beneﬁ ts, private 
medical insurance and annual health checks. 
In addition, the Company pays certain 
third-party fees incurred for UK and US tax 
ﬁ lings and relevant immigration matters for the 
Chief Executive who is a US citizen.
Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
The Company operates its RSP to grant 
executive leaders (other than executive 
directors) restricted share awards, nominal/nil 
price options or cash awards over Invensys 
shares. Release of shares is generally subject 
to continued employment at the relevant date, 
although shares may be released early on a 
pro rated basis in deﬁ ned good leaver cases 
or for any other reason at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
64 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013  
Savings Related Share Option Scheme
The Company operates its Savings Related 
Share Option Scheme (the Scheme) in the UK 
and certain other countries. Participants are 
granted an option to purchase Invensys 
shares at a discounted price set at the date of 
invitation, using the proceeds of a savings 
account to which they make monthly 
contributions (of up to £250) for a three-year 
period. Executive directors are eligible to 
participate in the Scheme, which operates in 
the UK within speciﬁ c tax legislation. The 
Scheme is not subject to performance 
conditions. An offer was extended under the 
Scheme to eligible employees in 2009/10 and 
2011/12. Awards granted in 2009/10 matured 
in September 2012 and participants were 
entitled to purchase their shares under option 
at the original option price of £1.75 per share. 
Following the completion of the sale of 
Invensys Rail, participants at Invensys Rail (in 
the UK and overseas) holding awards granted 
in 2011 were permitted by the Scheme rules to 
exercise their options early, using the savings 
they had made from the commencement of 
the 2011 contract. Participants were permitted 
to purchase a pro rated number of shares 
under option at the original option price of 
£2.46 per share.
Dilution limits
The Company has at all times complied with 
the dilution limits set out in the rules of its share 
plans (principally a limit of 10% in 10 years). In 
the 10-year period to 31 March 2013, awards 
made under the Company’s share schemes 
represented 4.0% (2012: 4.2%) of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital. 
Shares to satisfy the deferred share element 
of  the Executive Bonus Plan and the RSP are 
purchased in the market and therefore do not 
count towards the dilution limits.
If the proposed return of cash to shareholders 
and subsequent share consolidation takes 
place as planned, this will have an impact on 
the share dilution limits outlined above.
Share Ownership Guidelines
The Remuneration Committee believes that the interests of executives should be closely aligned 
with those of shareholders and, to support this, executives are required to build up and maintain 
a shareholding over time under the Share Ownership Guidelines. The qualifying interests are 
shown in the adjacent table. Under the guidelines, executives should retain at least 50% of the 
shares (100% of shares for executive directors) vesting under any of the executive share 
incentive plans or the payment of annual incentives in shares (other than to meet any tax 
obligations), until such time as the minimum level of qualifying interest is reached. Executives are 
not required to take additional steps beyond the vesting of share incentives to accumulate their 
qualifying interest.

Notes
1 The shareholding is the balance of shares held as at 13 May 2013 and the value of the shareholding is based on the share price on the same day which was 396.1p (this being the last practicable date 
before publication of the Annual Report and Accounts 2013). Deferred shares which have been awarded to Mr Edmunds and Ms Hull (as set out on page 7 1) are not included in the shareholding balance 
as, under the Share Ownership Guidelines, these only count as a qualifying interest when the award vests; however, this is under review as deferred shares are only forfeitable in the event of dismissal 
for cause.
2 During his time as an executive director of the Company, Mr Edmunds has not sold any Invensys shares resulting from the vesting of executive awards (other than for tax withholding purposes). 
It is Mr Edmunds’ current intention to reinvest the proceeds resulting from the proposed return of cash in Invensys shares. This will ensure that he continues to move towards his 200% qualifying interest.

Governance Remuneration Report continued
External directorships
The executive directors are permitted to hold 
not more than one external non-executive 
directorship in order to broaden their 
experience for the beneﬁ t of the Company. 
Such appointments are subject to approval 
by the Board and the executive director may 
retain any fees paid in respect of such 
a directorship. 
None of the executive directors held external 
directorships during the year.
Tax loans
It is the Company’s policy that if, as a result 
of the Company recharging a proportion of 
an executive’s employment costs to a US 
business, the executive incurs temporary 
double taxation by UK and US tax authorities, 
a US subsidiary of the Group may advance 
a loan to the executive equal to the amount 
of such double taxation, pending a refund 
from HMRC. 
Mr Edmunds incurred both US and UK tax 
liabilities in respect of his employment duties 
undertaken for the Company in the US in 
2009. Invensys Systems, Inc. advanced a loan 
to Mr Edmunds on 24 May 2012 in respect of 
temporary double taxation equal to £78,498. 
Part of the loan (£12,966) was repaid by Mr 
Edmunds during the year. The balance of the 
loan was repaid to Invensys Systems, Inc. on 
13 May 2013 following HMRC refunding the 
amount to Mr Edmunds. 
As described in the 2012 Remuneration 
Report, in 2009/10 Ulf Henriksson (a former 
Chief Executive) incurred both US and UK tax 
liabilities in respect of his employment duties 
undertaken for the Company in the US in 
2009. Invensys Systems, Inc. advanced a loan 
to Mr Henriksson in June 2010 equal to 
£312,691. This loan is still outstanding and 
will be repayable to Invensys Systems, Inc. 
on HMRC refunding the amount to 
Mr Henriksson.
Former Chief Executives
Under the terms of a settlement agreement 
concluded with a former Chief Executive, Ulf 
Henriksson (who retired from the Board on 
24 March 2011), and as disclosed in the 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012, the 
Company agreed to be responsible for the 
cost of any settlement with HMRC regarding 
certain non-business use by Mr Henriksson of 
a company driver and car/fuel beneﬁ ts which 
potentially gave rise to a personal taxable 
beneﬁ t. In accordance with this arrangement, 
the Company has during 2012/13 paid 
£123,689 to HMRC in full settlement of these 
liabilities for all relevant years.
In respect of the loan advanced to Mr 
Henriksson in relation to UK and US double 
taxation (as detailed previously), a taxable 
beneﬁ t of £12,507 arose representing the 
notional interest charge on the loan.
In April 2013, the Company received a request 
from a former Chief Executive, Mr Allen Yurko 
(who resigned from the Company in July 
2001), for the payment of expenses relating to 
his relocation back to the US, anticipated in 
June 2013. This request for the payment of 
such expenses is based on correspondence 
with the Company in June 2001. The 
Company is considering its response 
to this claim in light of the time elapsed.
Service contracts
Policy
The Code and guidelines issued by institutional investors recommend that notice periods of no more than 12 months be set as an objective for 
executive directors and that any payments to a departing executive director should be determined having full regard to the duty of mitigation, other 
than in the case of termination for cause or where a contract contains speciﬁ c termination payment provisions. It is the Company’s policy to 
achieve these objectives wherever possible. It is the Company’s intention that new executive service contracts continue to contain provisions 
allowing the Company to terminate employment by making a payment in lieu of notice and allowing contractual offset for future earnings.
Speciﬁ c contracts
Set out below is a summary of the main provisions of the service contracts of the executive directors:

David Thomas
Victoria Hull
17 May 2011

12 months
Other than in the case of summary termination, the Company may terminate the 
executive director’s service contract by making a payment in lieu of notice equal 
to the value of the base salary and contractual beneﬁ ts (including a pension 
allowance of 30% of base salary) they would have received during their notice 
period. Any payment due under these provisions may be made to them in equal 
monthly instalments and the Company may reduce the payment by 50% if the 
director obtains alternative employment. 
The executive directors’ service contracts entitle them, in the event of a material 
adverse change to their title, responsibilities or status following a change of 
control of the Company, to terminate their employment and receive a payment 
equal to the payment in lieu of notice.

Governance 3 Chairman and non-executive 
directors
Chairman’s appointment, terms and fee
Sir Nigel Rudd, who was appointed a 
non-executive director and Deputy Chairman 
on 1 January 2009, was appointed Chairman 
of the Company on 17 July 2009 (the terms of 
which were governed by a contract dated 
3  December 2008). Following the extension 
of  his appointment as Chairman for a further 
three-year term, he now serves under a 
contract dated 18 December 2012 (which 
contains the same terms as set out in his 
original contract). The contract requires, 
except in the case of dismissal for cause, 
12-months’ notice by either party. On early 
termination, at the request of the Company, 
any compensation would be subject to 
mitigation.
Sir Nigel Rudd spends, on average, two days 
per week in his role as Chairman. The 
Company funds the cost of a car and driver 
based on two -ﬁ fths of the annualised cost of 
the provision of such services. 
Sir Nigel Rudd’s fee is £270,000 per annum 
and he participates in the same arrangement 
as the other non-executive directors, whereby 
£8,000 of his fee per annum is paid in shares.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for reviewing the Chairman’s fee. The 
Chairman is not involved in any decision on his 
own remuneration. The fees currently paid to 
the Chairman and the other non-executive 
directors are subject to the limits set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association. 
Following consideration of the Chairman’s fee 
at a meeting of the Remuneration Committee 
held in May 2013, it was decided not to 
increase the Chairman’s fee for 2013/14.
Non-executive directors’ appointments, 
terms and fees
Non-executive directors serve the Company 
under letters of appointment that do not 
contain any notice period and are initially 
appointed for a term of three years. In 
accordance with the Code all directors (other 
than those retiring) seek re-election annually 
by shareholders.
Non-executive directors do not participate in 
any bonus or performance-related plans or 
any of the Company’s share incentive plans or 
pension schemes. Appointments of non-
executive directors are terminable without 
payment or compensation by either the 
Company or the director giving written notice.
Fees for non-executive directors other than the 
Chairman are determined by a committee of 
the Board comprising the Chairman and the 
executive directors. They are subject to the 
limits set out in the Articles of Association and 
are determined by taking account of time 
commitments and responsibilities, together 
with comparative market rates and 
benchmarking data. The fee structure for the 
non-executive directors is set out below:
Non-executive directors’ fees
Basic fee £52,000 
1
Additional fee for chairing 
committees
– Audit £14,000
– Remuneration £10,000
Additional fee for Senior 
Independent Director
£10,000
Note
1 Basic fee includes £8,000 paid in shares. The Remuneration 
table on page  69 includes that part of the fee used to purchase 
shares and the shares are included in Directors’ interests also 
on page  69.
The portion of the fee paid in shares helps to 
align the interests of the non-executive 
directors with those of shareholders. Each 
non-executive director commits to retain their 
shares for the period of their directorship.

Notes
1  The conditional awards shown in the table are the maximum number (excluding shares representing accrued dividends) of ordinary shares that can vest subject to satisfaction of the relevant 
performance conditions.
2 Following consideration of the performance conditions of the 2009 Award, the Remuneration Committee determined that the threshold underlying EPS CAGR and TSR performance had not been met 
and shares subject to these targets lapsed. In respect of Ms Hull’s and Mr Thomas’ 2009 Awards these were granted prior to their appointment as executive directors and 30% of the  Award was not 
subject to performance conditions; therefore, in aggregate, Ms Hull’s and Mr Thomas’ 2009 Awards vested at 30%. A further 3,303 and 1,088 shares representing accrued dividends were issued to 
Ms  Hull and Mr Thomas.
3 Awards granted to Ms Hull and Mr Thomas under the 2007 LTIP in 2010 were made prior to their appointment as executive directors and therefore 30% of these awards are not subject to performance 
conditions.  Following consideration of the performance conditions for the 2010 Award, the Remuneration Committee has determined (as outlined on page 6 4) that the threshold TSR performance has 
not been met and this portion of the 2010 Award will lapse; the EPS portion of the 2010 Award will vest at 94.4%. Therefore, in aggregate, 47.2% of the initial award will vest for Mr Edmunds and 63.0% 
will vest for Ms Hull and Mr Thomas. 
4 The award granted to Ms Hull under the 2007 LTIP in 2011 was made prior to her appointment as an executive director and therefore 30% of this award is not subject to performance conditions.
5 The award granted to Mr Thomas under the 2007 LTIP in 2011 was made prior to his appointment as an executive director but during his appointment as Acting Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and 100% of this 
award is subject to performance conditions.
6 Award granted as nominal price option and, as such, can be exercised during a three-month period following the vesting date.
Remuneration Report continued
70 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Restricted Share Plan (RSP)

Notes
1  The ﬁ gures above are in respect of beneﬁ t entitlements within both the Invensys Pension Scheme and the Supplementary Pension Arrangement. Both Mr Thomas and Ms Hull contribute at 13% 
of pensionable salary for beneﬁ ts in the Invensys Pension Scheme (up to the Scheme earning limit of £137 ,400 for 2012/1 3) but that no contributions are payable for beneﬁ ts in the Supplementary 
Pension Arrangement.
2  The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the Invensys Pension Scheme’s standard cash equivalent transfer value basis, as set by the Scheme’s Trustees. As required by the different 
regulations, allowance for the current 1% reduction applied to transfer values is made in the transfer values required under the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 but no allowance is 
made for this reduction in the transfer values required under the Listing Rules.
3  All beneﬁ ts are due at age 60.
Remuneration Report continued
72 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Directors’ Report 
The directors submit their Report and the 
audited accounts for the year ended 
31  March 2013 as set out on pages  78 to 
15 1 and page 15 6. This Report should be 
read in conjunction with the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 44 to 56.
Principal activities
The principal activities for the year are 
contained in the Business Review on 
pages  15  to 40. The principal subsidiaries 
which contributed to the Group’s proﬁ t or 
net  assets in the year are listed on page 15 6.
Business Review
The Company is required by the Companies 
Act 2006 to set out in this Report a fair review 
of the business of the Group during the 
ﬁ nancial year ended 31 March 2013 and the 
position of the Group at the end of the year. 
This review is contained in the Business 
Review section of the Annual Report and 
Accounts 2013 on pages 15 to 40 with further 
commentary and speciﬁ c areas of note 
incorporated into the sections shown in the 
adjacent table.
The Business Review contains the information 
required for a management report as set out in 
the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTRs) 
and takes account of the best practice 
guidance contained in the Accounting 
Standards Board’s Reporting Statement 
“Operating and Financial Review”.
Dividend
The Board has recommended the payment of 
a ﬁ nal dividend for the year of 2.85 pence per 
share which, subject to approval by 
shareholders at the AGM on 25 July 2013, will 
be paid on 2 August 2013 to shareholders on 
the register at 21 June 2013. With an interim 
dividend of 1.75 pence per share paid during 
the year, the total dividends payable in respect 
of the year ended 31 March 2013 are 4.6 
pence per share (2012: 4.4 pence per share). 
The amount paid per share could increase 
dependent upon the share consolidation as 
detailed below.
If the return of cash to shareholders and 
subsequent share capital consolidation are 
approved by shareholders and take place as 
planned, the Board has recommended that 
the total amount of the ﬁ nal dividend will 
remain the same, £23 million, but will be paid 
on the smaller number of shares in issue 
resulting from the share consolidation. 
Therefore the amount paid per share would 
increase and details of  these changes will be   
 set out in the circular  to shareholders 
regarding the return of  cash expected to be 
issued on or around 21  May 2013.

Board of directors
The current directors of the Company and 
their biographical details are given on pages 
42 and 43. A statement of their remuneration 
and interests in the ordinary shares of the 
Company are set out in the Remuneration 
Report on pages  69 to 7 2.
Francesco Caio and Pat Zito will not be 
seeking re-election at the 2013 AGM and will 
retire from the Board at the close of that 
meeting.
The rules governing the appointment and 
retirement of directors are contained in the 
Company’s Articles of Association, which 
provides that any director appointed during 
the year holds ofﬁ ce only until the next AGM 
and is then eligible for election by the 
shareholders and that, in any case, one -third 
of the directors (or if their number is not a 
multiple of three the number nearest to one 
third) shall retire from ofﬁ ce and, if they wish, 
put themselves up for re-election by the 
shareholders. However, in accordance with 
the Code, all directors (other than Mr Caio and 
Mr Zito) will seek re-election by shareholders 
at the 2013 AGM. 
The Chairman’s Letter and Notice of AGM 
explains the Board’s reasons for and 
recommendations regarding the re-election of 
directors.
The powers of the directors are determined by 
UK legislation and the Articles of Association 
of the Company, together with any speciﬁ c 
authorities that may be given to the directors 
by shareholders from time -to -time, such as 
the power to allot shares and the power to 
make market purchases of the Company’s 
shares. Further information regarding matters 
reserved for the Board is set out in the 
Corporate Governance Report on page 45. 
Directors’ indemnity and insurance
The Company maintains directors’ and 
ofﬁ cers’ liability insurance which provides 
appropriate cover for legal actions brought 
against its directors or ofﬁ cers.
Acquisitions and disposals
On 10 May 2012 Invensys acquired 100% of 
the share capital of PHW Inc., a privately held 
manufacturer of cab signalling systems and 
other safety electronic train control systems 
for  the North America mainline and mass 
transit industries for a cash consideration of 
£12 million.  The net assets acquired were 
approximately £11 million. 
On 15 October 2012 the Group acquired 
Spiral Software, a planning, scheduling and 
crude oil management software company, 
headquartered in the U K , for a cash 
consideration of £38 million. The net assets 
acquired were approximately £24 million. 
On 28 November 2012 the Group 
announced  the proposed disposal of the 
Invensys Rail division for a cash consideration 
of £1,742  million to Siemens. The transaction 
completed on 2 May 2013.

Governance Directors’ Report continued
Capital structure
Details of the issued share capital, together 
with details of movements in the issued share 
capital of the Company during the year, are 
shown in Note 26 on page  12 7.
Further to the announcement on 28 November 
2012, the directors are in the process of 
implementing a return of cash and intend to 
return £625 million of cash to shareholders. 
Information on the return of cash will be set out 
in a circular to shareholders which will be 
issued as soon as practicable. The return of 
cash is subject to the approval of Invensys 
shareholders at a General Meeting which is 
expected to take place in June 2013. It is 
intended that shareholders (other than in the 
US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan 
and the Republic of South Africa) will be able 
to elect to receive their cash as income, capital 
or deferred capital or a combination of the 
three. Following the return of cash, it is 
proposed that a share capital consolidation 
take place which, subject to market 
ﬂ uctuations,  will result in the share price being 
returned to approximately the same level as 
before the return of cash.
The Company operates an employee beneﬁ t 
trust in Jersey called the Invensys No.2 
Employee Beneﬁ t Trust (EBT) which may be 
used to deliver ordinary shares in the 
Company under certain executive share 
schemes, as appropriate. The EBT has an 
independent trustee which waives its rights 
to  dividends and to vote on the shareholding. 
Details of executive share schemes and 
shares held by the EBT are set out in Notes 26 
and 28 on page  12  7 and pages 1 28 to 13 2 
respectively.
Shares acquired through the Company’s 
executive share plans rank pari passu with 
other shares in issue and have no special 
rights or restrictions, save that certain share 
awards involve retention periods after vesting. 
Further information is set out in Note 28 on 
pages 1 28 to 13 2. The non-executive directors 
use a proportion of their fees to purchase 
shares in the Company which may not 
normally be transferred during a director’s 
period of ofﬁ ce. 
At the 2012 AGM, the directors were 
authorised to issue relevant securities up to an 
aggregate nominal amount of £26.8 million 
(approximately one -third of the issued ordinary 
share capital as at 22 May 2012). In addition, 
the directors were authorised to allot an extra 
one -third of the issued share capital in respect 
of a fully pre-emptive rights issue. Renewal 
was also sought for the directors’ authorisation 
to allot relevant securities and to allot equity 
securities for cash (up to a maximum 
aggregate nominal amount of £4.1 million) on a 
pre-emptive basis. The directors did not use 
this authority during the year under review, 
other than to issue shares to satisfy awards 
under the Company’s share incentive plans. 
The directors will seek to renew allotment 
authorities at the 2013 AGM in line with 
guidelines issued by the Association of 
British Insurers.
In addition, the Company was authorised at 
the 2012 AGM to purchase in the market up 
to  81,229,074 ordinary shares, representing 
approximately  10% of the issued share capital 
of the Company. This authority was not used 
by the Company and will not be renewed at 
the 2013 AGM.

1  The percentage interests stated are as disclosed at the date 
on which the interests were notiﬁ ed in accordance with 
DTR 5.
2  This interest is a contract for difference and does not carry 
any voting rights.
Supplier payment policy
It is the policy of the Group that subsidiary 
companies should develop long-term 
relationships with suppliers and establish 
terms of trade consistent with established 
practice in their country of operation, and to 
ensure that suppliers are aware of the terms 
of payment and that such terms are followed. 
This policy is consistent with the UK 
Government’s Prompt Payment Code, 
to which the Company is a signatory. 
Details of the Code can be found at:
www.promptpaymentcode.org.uk
The Company is a holding company and 
has no trade creditors.
Employee policy and development 
Invensys has a range of active policies that 
extend from business compliance, as reﬂ ected 
in our Code of Conduct, to developing the full 
capabilities of our people. We continue to 
focus on promoting diversity and equal 
opportunities in areas ranging from selection 
and recruitment to training and development 
so that we can meet the needs of our 
businesses and customers around the world. 
If necessary, reasonable adjustments will be 
made for the beneﬁ t of disabled employees. 
People with disabilities are given full and fair 
consideration for employment and 
subsequent training (including, if needed, 
retraining for alternative work where 
employees have become temporarily or 
permanently disabled), career development 
and promotion on the basis of their aptitudes 
and abilities.
The Group recognises the need to consult and 
systematically provide information on matters 
that impact our employees. To satisfy that 
need, the Group provides employees with 
published ﬁ nancial and economic information 
through its consultative procedures and 
through groups such as the Invensys 
European Employees’ Forum, as well as 
engagement with national works councils and 
trade unions. Invensys encourages 
employees’ involvement in the Company’s 
performance through the Invensys Savings 
Related Share Option Scheme. Invensys also 
encourages the involvement of technical, 
professional and managerial level employees 
in the Group’s performance through the 
Invensys Performance Management System, 
which reinforces the links between the Group’s 
business goals, the employee’s contribution 
and his/her remuneration. Greater detail on 
these topics and further information 
concerning employees including the Employee 
Engagement Survey, and social and 
community issues is set out in the Corporate 
Responsibility Report, which begins on 
page 28.
Charitable and political contributions 
The Board is of the view that it is not 
appropriate for the Company to make 
charitable donations at this time. However, 
many of the Group’s subsidiaries are inﬂ uential 
companies and important employers in their 
own countries or localities, and it is therefore 
believed to be in the best interests of the 
Group for those companies’ community or 
charitable involvement to be maintained at 
reasonable levels. During the year, Group 
donations to charities and community causes 
worldwide were £0.2 million (2012: £0.2 
million), with UK charities receiving £nil 
(2012: £nil). 
74 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 At the 2012 AGM, shareholders passed a 
resolution, on a precautionary basis, to 
authorise the Company to make political 
donations and/or incur political expenditure (as 
such terms are deﬁ ned in sections 362 to 379 
of the Companies Act 2006), in each case in 
amounts not exceeding £25,000 in aggregate. 
The deﬁ nitions used in the Companies Act 
2006 are broad in nature and this authority 
was sought to ensure that any activities 
undertaken throughout the Group, which 
could otherwise be construed to fall within 
these provisions, could be undertaken without 
inadvertently infringing them. Shareholders 
will be asked to renew this resolution at the 
2013 AGM.
No political donations were made during the 
year under review.

The Group carries out research and 
development in support of its activities. During 
the year, expenditure on the research and 
development of new products and processes 
for continuing operations amounted to 
£79  million (2012: £74 million).
Signiﬁ cant agreements
The Company is required to disclose any 
contractual or other arrangements which it 
considers are essential to its business. 
Invensys’ critical relationships are with its 
major customers and its suppliers of services, 
components and raw materials, as discussed 
in the Business Review on pages 1 5 to 40. 
Whilst the loss of, or disruption to, certain of 
these arrangements could temporarily affect 
the operations of the Group, none of these 
arrangements are considered to be essential.
The Company is also required to disclose any 
signiﬁ cant agreements that take effect, alter or 
terminate on a change of control of the 
Company. Pursuant to Schedule 7 of the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008, the directors disclose that in the event of 
a change of control in the Company: (i) the 
banking facilities described in Note 21, totalling 
£600 million at 31 March 2013, could cease to 
be available to the Group; (ii) a Master Service 
Agreement dated 15 May 2007 , made with 
Genpact International, LLC for the provision of 
outsourced business services in relation to 
certain ﬁ nance, IT and related functions, would 
become terminable at the option of the 
Company; and (iii) a Master Service 
Agreement dated 3 July 2009, made with 
Cognizant Technology Solutions U.S. 
Corporation for the provision of certain 
research and development services to the 
Invensys Operations Management division, 
would become terminable at the option of 
the Company.
The executive directors’ service contracts 
contain provisions which would take effect in 
the event of a change of control. In the event of 
a material adverse change to their title, 
responsibilities or status following a change of 
control of the Company, they would be entitled 
to terminate their employment and receive a 
payment equal to the termination payment set 
out in the Remuneration Report on page 6 6. 
The service contracts of a small number of 
other key employees also contain provisions 
entitling them to terminate employment and 
receive compensation in the event of a change 
of control.
Auditor
In accordance with section 418(2) of the 
Companies Act 2006, each of the directors at 
the date of approval of this Report conﬁ rms 
that, so far as they are aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware, and that the 
directors have taken all the steps that they 
ought to have taken as directors in order to 
make themselves aware of, and to establish 
that the auditor is aware of, any relevant audit 
information. Ernst & Young LLP has expressed 
willingness to continue in ofﬁ ce as auditor and, 
in accordance with the recommendation of the 
Audit Committee, resolutions proposing its 
reappointment and to authorise the directors 
to determine its remuneration will be proposed 
at the 2013 AGM.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM of the Company will be held on 
Thursday 25 July 2013 at 11.00am at The 
Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, Broad 
Sanctuary, Westminster, London SW1P 3EE. 
The Chairman’s Letter and Notice of AGM 
gives full details of the meeting and the 
resolutions to be proposed.
Post balance sheet event
On 28 November 2012 Invensys signed an 
agreement to sell Invensys Rail to Siemens for 
a gross cash consideration of £1.7 billion. The 
consideration comprised £1.3 billion in 
exchange for the shares of Invensys Rail and 
£0.4 billion paid to Invensys’  UK Pension 
Scheme. The transaction completed on 2 May 
2013 and will be accounted for in the year 
ending 31 March 2014.
On 2 May 2013 on receipt of the proceeds 
from the sale of Invensys Rail, Invensys paid 
£225 million into a reservoir trust in favour of 
the Invensys UK Pension Scheme. The 
Reservoir Trust Deed contains a mechanism 
for future payments to be made from the 
reservoir trust to either the  Pension  Trustee or 
the Company dependent on the funding 
position of the Scheme, commencing in 2018. 
Following this payment, and the receipt by the 
UK Pension Scheme of the £400 million 
payment on the sale of Invensys Rail, the 
deﬁ cit reduction payments of £40-47 million 
per annum previously agreed with the trustees 
ceased. It is anticipated that no further 
contributions will be payable into the Scheme 
for the foreseeable future.
The Group proposes to return cash to 
shareholders of £625 million (around 76 pence 
per share) from the proceeds of the sale, 
subject to the approval of Invensys 
shareholders at a General Meeting which is 
expected to take place in June 2013.  It is 
proposed that the return of cash will be 
followed by a share capital consolidation.  The 
return of cash will be accounted for in the year 
ending 31 March 2014 as a reduction in 
retained earnings.
Following the completion of the sale of 
Invensys Rail on 2 May 2013, the Group’s 
revolving credit facility was reduced by 
£100 million to £150 million. The Group’s 
guarantee facility remains £350 million.

Governance Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in 
Respect of the Preparation of the Accounts  
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law and 
those International Financial Reporting 
Standards adopted by the European 
Union or, in the case of the Company’s 
Financial Statements, United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
Company law requires the directors to prepare 
Company and Group Financial Statements for 
each ﬁ nancial year. Under that law the 
directors must not approve the Financial 
Statements unless they are satisﬁ ed that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Company and Group and of their proﬁ t or 
loss for that period. In preparing the Company 
and Group Financial Statements, the directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
• present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
• provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the speciﬁ c requirements 
in applicable accounting standards is 
insufﬁ cient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s 
ﬁ nancial position and ﬁ nancial performance; 
and
• state that the Company and the Group have 
complied with applicable accounting 
standards, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the Financial Statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufﬁ cient to show and explain the transactions 
of the Company and of the Group and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the ﬁ nancial position of the Company and of 
the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
Financial Statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group, and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Group’s business activities, together with 
the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are 
set out in the Business Review on pages 1 5 to 
40. The ﬁ nancial position of the Group, its cash 
ﬂ ows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 22 to 26. Note 19 to the Financial 
Statements includes: the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its 
capital; its ﬁ nancial risk management 
objectives; details of its ﬁ nancial instruments 
and hedging activities; and its exposure to 
credit risk and liquidity risk. The principal 
risks  and uncertainties facing the Group, 
along  with mitigating actions, are set out 
on  pages 35 to 40.
The Group remains generally in a sound 
ﬁ nancial position with net cash, banking 
facilities totalling £500 million in place until 
2017 , and well-established relationships with 
key customers and suppliers.  Following the 
completion of the sale of Invensys Rail on 
2  May 2013, the Group’s total banking facilities 
of £500 million comprise a cash facility 
of  £150  million and a guarantee facility 
of  £350  million.
The directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the annual Financial Statements.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We conﬁ rm that to the best of our knowledge:
a)  the Group Financial Statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2013, prepared in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted for use in 
the European Union or, in the case of the 
Company’s ﬁ nancial statements, United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial position and 
proﬁ t of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation 
as a whole; and
b)  the Business Review includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

Independent auditor’s report to the shareholders of Invensys plc
We have audited the Group Financial Statements of Invensys plc for the 
year ended 31 March 2013 which comprise the consolidated income 
statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of changes in 
equity, consolidated cash ﬂ ow statement and the related Notes 1 to 36. 
The ﬁ nancial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
set out on page  76, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the Group Financial Statements and for being satisﬁ ed that they give a 
true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the Group Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Group Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the Group Financial Statements sufﬁ cient to give 
reasonable assurance that the Group Financial Statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁ cant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the Group Financial Statements. In addition, we read all 
the ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial information in the Annual Report and 
Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁ nancial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for  our  report. 
Opinion on Group Financial Statements
In our opinion the Group Financial Statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 March 2013 and of its proﬁ t for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the ﬁ nancial year for 
which the Financial Statements are prepared is consistent with the 
Group Financial Statements; and
• the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out 
on pages 44 to 56 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to ﬁ nancial reporting processes and 
about share capital structures is consistent with the Group Financial 
Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁ ed by law are not 
made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit; or
• a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the 
Company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the directors’ statement, set out on page 7 6, in relation to going 
concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code speciﬁ ed for our review; and
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company Financial 
Statements of Invensys plc for the year ended 31 March 2013 and on 
the information in the Remuneration Report that is described as having 
been audited.

Group Financial Statements
1 General information 
The Group Financial Statements of Invensys plc for the year ended 31 March 2013 were authorised for issue in accordance with a 
resolution of the directors on 15 May 2013 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by Wayne Edmunds and David 
Thomas. Invensys plc is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in England & Wales whose shares are publicly traded.
Invensys Group comprises continuing operations and discontinued operations. Invensys Rail has been classiﬁ ed as discontinued 
following the decision to sell the division in the current year, and the sale completed subsequent to the year end (Note 35). Discontinued 
operations also include additional costs incurred relating to prior year disposals. Operations presented as discontinued are explained in 
Note 10.
During the year ended 31 March 2013, Invensys consisted of the following divisions: Invensys Operations Management, Invensys 
Controls and Invensys Rail. The principal activities of each of the divisions are as follows:
Continuing operations
• Invensys Operations Management – is a technology, software and consulting business that creates and applies technologies to enable 
the safe and efﬁ cient operation of industrial and commercial operations such as oil reﬁ neries, fossil fuel and nuclear power plants, 
petrochemical works and other manufacturing sites.
• Invensys Controls – designs, engineers and manufactures products, components, systems and services used in appliances, heating, 
air conditioning/cooling and refrigeration products across a wide range of industries in residential and commercial markets.
Discontinued operations
• Invensys Rail – provided software-based signalling, communication and control systems that enabled the safe and efﬁ cient operation 
of trains in mainline and mass transit networks across the world.
The Group was managed on the above basis during the year. Further detail on the activities of each of the above divisions is given in the 
Business Review section of this Annual Report and Accounts. The basis on which the Group will be managed going forward is explained 
in the Our Business at a Glance and Our Business Model sections.
2 Accounting policies
Statement of compliance
The Group’s consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out the policies and measurement bases that have been applied in preparing the Financial 
Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013. The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling and all amounts are 
rounded to the nearest million (£m) unless otherwise indicated.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous ﬁ nancial year except as follows:
The Group has adopted the following amended IFRSs during the year. All have been endorsed for use in the EU.
IFRS 1 Amendments to IFRS 1 – Severe Hyperinﬂ ation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-Time Adopters 
IFRS 7 Amendments to IFRS 7 – Disclosures: T ransfers of Assets 
IAS 12 Amendments to IAS 12 – Deferred T ax: Recovery of Underlying Assets 
Adoption of these standards has not had any material effect on the Financial Statements of the Group.  
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated Financial Statements comprise Invensys plc and its subsidiaries for the ﬁ nancial year to 31 March each year. The Group 
does not currently have any material associates. The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the 
Parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intragroup balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired during the year are consolidated up to, or from, the date control passes.
Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the business combination is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree. For each business combination, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree is measured either at fair value or at the 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identiﬁ able net assets. Consideration transferred includes any contingent consideration measured 
at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or 
liability, will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in proﬁ t or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent 
consideration that qualiﬁ es for classiﬁ cation as equity is not remeasured until it is ﬁ nally settled. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed.
Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the net identiﬁ able assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the balance sheet. If the 
cost is lower than the net identiﬁ able assets acquired, the difference is recognised in proﬁ t or loss.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued
2 Accounting policies continued
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses 
control over a subsidiary, it:  
•  derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary;
•  derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest;
•  derecognises the cumulative translation differences, recorded in equity;
•  recognises the fair value of the consideration received;
•  recognises the fair value of any investment retained;
•  recognises any surplus or deﬁ cit in proﬁ t or loss; and
•  reclassiﬁ es the parent’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to proﬁ t or loss or retained 
earnings, as appropriate.  
If a subsidiary with a non-controlling interest incurs losses, the non-controlling interest’s share in those losses is attributed 
to  non -controlling interests in equity even if that results in a deﬁ cit balance.
Exceptional items  
Exceptional items are material items of income and expense that are separately disclosed to assist in the understanding of the Group’s 
ﬁ nancial performance and in making projections of future results. Such items may be operating or non-operating in nature. Exceptional 
items are presented separately on the face of the income statement and analysed in the Notes to the Financial Statements.
Foreign currencies  
The presentational currency of the Group and functional currency of Invensys plc is sterling.
The Financial Statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries are prepared using their functional currency. The functional currency is 
generally the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. 
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences arising are recognised in the income statement unless:
a)  the monetary assets or liabilities to which they relate form the hedging instrument in a cash ﬂ ow hedging relationship that qualiﬁ es for 
hedge accounting; or
b)  the monetary assets or liabilities to which they relate form part of a net investment in a foreign operation; in which case they are 
recognised directly in equity.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the 
date of the initial transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated at the rates prevailing when the fair value 
was determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period, except for exchange 
differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
Financial statements of foreign operations
The trading results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during the year. Assets and 
liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, including goodwill, are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. All resulting exchange differences are recognised directly in a separate component of equity. On disposal of a foreign operation, any 
cumulative exchange differences held in equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement, as part of the proﬁ t or loss on sale.
Translation differences that arose before the date of transition to IFRSs (1 April 2004) were deemed to be zero at that date. As a result, 
if  a  foreign operation is sold, there is no exchange difference recognised in the income statement relating to the period prior to that date.
Revenue 
Composition of revenue
Revenue comprises the invoiced value of goods and services supplied by the Group excluding intragroup transactions and sales taxes. 
Revenue relating to construction contracts, including long-term service provision contracts, represents the value of work performed 
during the year determined by reference to the stage of completion of the contract. Discounts given to customers against list prices, such 
as trade or volume discounts, are deducted in arriving at the value of revenue. Settlement discounts are reported as an expense in the 
income statement.
Recognition of revenue and proﬁ ts  
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic beneﬁ ts will ﬂ ow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. The speciﬁ c methods used to recognise the different forms of revenue earned by the Group are set out below.
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the signiﬁ cant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer 
(including a distributor or a wholesaler) and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured. For sales of software solutions, revenue is 
recognised when a signed contract exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, no signiﬁ cant vendor obligations remain and collection 
of  the sales proceeds is considered probable. Revenue is recognised on software sales made via a distributor or systems integrator when 
there is an agreement in place between Invensys and the distributor or systems integrator, and the distributor or systems integrator has 
provided evidence of onward sale of the licence to an end user. A contract to deliver goods, including software solutions, that requires 
signiﬁ cant production, modiﬁ cation, customisation or integration of the goods, is accounted for in its entirety as a construction contract.
Proﬁ t is recognised at the time of sale. Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 87
Group Financial Statements
Construction contracts and rendering of services  
Revenue from construction contracts and long-term service provision contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion 
of  contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally determined by the proportion that contract costs incurred to date bear to 
the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion. If the nature of a particular 
contract means that costs incurred do not accurately reﬂ ect the progress of contract activity, an alternative approach is used such 
as  the  achievement of pre determined contract milestones.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included in revenue from construction contracts when certain criteria are 
met. Variations are included when the customer has agreed to the variation or acknowledged liability for the variation in principle. Claims 
are included when negotiations with the customer have reached an advanced stage such that the customer is certain to accept the 
claim. Incentive payments are included when a contract is sufﬁ ciently advanced that it is probable that the performance standards 
triggering the incentive will be achieved.
Proﬁ t attributable to contract activity is recognised if the ﬁ nal outcome of such contracts can be reliably assessed. On all contracts, 
full  provision is made for any losses in the year in which they are ﬁ rst foreseen.
Revenue from services provided on a short-term or one-off basis is recognised when the service is complete.
When a transaction combines a supply of goods with the provision of a signiﬁ cant service, revenue from the provision of the service is 
recognised separately from the revenue from the sale of goods by reference to the stage of completion of the service unless the service 
is  essential to the functionality of the goods supplied, in which case the whole transaction is treated as a construction contract. Revenue 
from a service that is incidental to the supply of goods is recognised at the same time as the revenue from the supply of goods.
Research and development
All research expenditure is expensed as incurred. Development expenditure is expensed as incurred unless it meets the criteria for 
recognition as an intangible asset (see policy on Other intangible assets).
Pension costs and other post-retirement beneﬁ ts
For deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans, the service cost of providing retirement beneﬁ ts to employees during the year is charged to operating proﬁ t or 
loss in the year. The cost of providing beneﬁ ts under the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected 
unit credit actuarial valuation method. The full cost of providing amendments to beneﬁ ts in respect of past service that vest immediately 
is  also charged to operating proﬁ t or loss in the year. The expected return on the assets, of the schemes during the year, based on the 
market value of scheme assets at the start of the ﬁ nancial year is included within Other ﬁ nance charges – IAS 19. This also includes a 
charge representing the expected increase in liabilities of the schemes during the year, arising from the liabilities of the scheme being one 
year closer to payment. Differences between actual and expected returns on assets during the year are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income in the year, together with experience gains or losses arising on the scheme liabilities and differences from 
changes in assumptions. The net surplus or deﬁ cit on deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension schemes is reported on the balance sheet within the 
pension asset or liability.
The value of any deﬁ ned beneﬁ t asset recognised is restricted to the present value of any economic beneﬁ ts available in the form of 
refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan. When the Group is committed to making minimum funding 
payments to a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan, and the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeds the liability in respect of the plan as 
measured under IFRSs, a provision is recognised for any part of the resulting surplus that would not be recoverable.
For deﬁ ned contribution schemes the amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs is the contributions payable 
in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown either as accruals or 
prepayments in the balance sheet.
Goodwill 
On a business combination the identiﬁ able net assets are assessed and adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies of the 
business acquired into alignment with those of the Group. The excess of the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of consideration 
transferred and the amount recognised for any non-controlling interest in the acquiree over the identiﬁ able net assets acquired is included 
in intangible assets as goodwill. 
Any costs of integrating the acquired business are taken to the income statement.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may be impaired, and it is subsequently carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The Group’s policy on testing 
assets for impairment is set out under  “Impairment of non-ﬁ nancial assets ” on page  88.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the business sold.
Other intangible assets  
Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of intangible 
assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value at acquisition date. The cost of separately acquired intangible assets, including 
computer software, comprises the purchase price and any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for use. Amortisation begins 
when an asset is available for use and is calculated on a straight-line basis to allocate the cost less residual value of assets over their 
estimated useful lives using the following annual rates or useful lives:    
Development costs 10 to 25%
Computer software costs 10 to 25%
Patents, trademarks and licences Shorter of period of the agreement or 15 years
Customer-related intangible assets 6-8 years 88  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
2 Accounting policies continued
Useful lives are examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. No intangible assets 
other than goodwill are considered to have indeﬁ nite useful lives.
Expenditure incurred on development projects is capitalised as an intangible asset if it meets the recognition criteria set out in IAS 38, 
Intangible Assets. These require it to be probable that the expenditure will generate future economic beneﬁ ts and can be measured 
reliably. To meet these criteria, it is necessary to be able to demonstrate, among other things, the technical feasibility of completing the 
intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.
Costs incurred in the preliminary stage of a development project are considered to be research costs, and are recognised in the income 
statement as incurred. These costs are incurred to determine the product concepts and alternatives, evaluate the alternatives and related 
risks, assess the technical feasibility of concepts, make the ﬁ nal selection from the possible alternatives and prepare the high level design 
and project planning. The costs incurred in the following development stage for substantially new or improved products are assessed 
against the IAS 38 criteria and considered for recognition as an asset when they meet those criteria. These costs are generally incurred in 
developing the detailed product design, software conﬁ guration and software interfaces; the coding of software, building of prototypes 
and integration of the software with hardware; and testing and releasing the product to manufacture and pilot production.
Development expenditure directed towards incremental improvements in existing products does not qualify for recognition as an 
intangible asset.
In general the costs of developing software products that are sold in packaged form and not integrated and sold with hardware are not 
recognised as intangible assets. The uncertainties associated with the functionality of these products mean that technical feasibility is 
achieved only immediately prior to or after ﬁ eld trial tests at customer sites. As a result minimal or no costs are considered to meet the 
IAS 38 criteria for recognition.
An intangible asset acquired in a business combination is recognised separately from the goodwill arising on the business combination 
if  the asset’s fair value can be measured reliably, regardless of whether the asset had been recognised previously by the acquiree.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost 
of property, plant and equipment comprises purchase price and directly attributable costs.
Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated to their residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives at 
the following rates applied to original cost:
Freehold land nil
Freehold buildings 2 to 2.5%
Leasehold properties Over the period of the lease
Plant and equipment 7 to 35%
Useful lives and residual values are examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Impairment of non-ﬁ nancial assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that any non-ﬁ nancial asset (excluding goodwill) may be 
impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually whether or not there is any indication of impairment. If there is an indication of 
impairment, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount the asset is written down to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset. 
If the asset does not generate cash inﬂ ows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets the recoverable 
amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined.
The calculation of an asset’s value in use uses a discount rate that reﬂ ects the asset speciﬁ c risks and the time value of money.
Leased assets
Assets held under ﬁ nance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at fair value or, if lower, the present value 
of the minimum lease payments. Capitalised leased assets are subsequently depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the asset’s 
useful life. Obligations related to ﬁ nance leases, net of ﬁ nance charges in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate within 
liabilities. Lease payments are apportioned between the ﬁ nance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Other leases are classiﬁ ed as operating leases. Lease payments, including any premium paid at the outset of the lease, made under 
operating leases are recognised as an expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at its inception date 
and an assessment of whether the fulﬁ lment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a speciﬁ c asset, or assets, or the 
arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies:
a)  there is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement;
b)  a renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the lease term;
c)  there is a change in the determination of whether fulﬁ lment is dependent on a speciﬁ ed asset; or
d)  there is a substantial change to the asset. Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 89
Group Financial Statements
Where a reassessment is made, lease accounting commences or ceases from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise 
to  the reassessment for scenarios a), c) or d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario b).
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. Provision is made for obsolete and slow-moving items. 
Cost comprises the cost of raw materials, determined on a ﬁ rst-in, ﬁ rst-out cost basis, and an appropriate proportion of labour and 
manufacturing overheads based on normal operating capacity, to reﬂ ect the costs incurred in bringing the product to its present location 
and condition.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, call deposits and other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three 
months or less.
Cash and short-term deposits at the balance sheet date are offset against bank loans and overdrafts where formal rights of set-off exist 
and there is an intention to settle on a net basis.
Taxation 
Income tax on proﬁ t or loss
Income tax on the proﬁ t or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax
The current tax payable is based on taxable proﬁ t for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Taxable 
proﬁ t differs from proﬁ t reported in the income statement as it excludes items that are never taxable or deductible, or which are taxable or 
deductible in other years. The Group’s current tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the ﬁ nancial statements and the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred income 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁ t will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
No deferred income tax asset or liability is recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries 
where the Group is able to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. Such assets and liabilities are also not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets other than goodwill or liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
proﬁ t nor the accounting proﬁ t. A deferred income tax asset is recognised on the initial recognition of goodwill arising in a business 
combination if the carrying amount of the goodwill is less than its tax base and the deferred income tax asset qualiﬁ es for recognition. 
No deferred income tax liability is recognised as a result of the initial recognition of goodwill.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufﬁ cient taxable proﬁ t will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised 
deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufﬁ cient 
taxable proﬁ t will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.
Financial instruments
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments
The Group primarily uses forward foreign currency contracts to manage its exposures to ﬂ uctuations in foreign exchange rates. These 
instruments are accounted for as hedges when they are designated as hedges at the inception of the contract. The Group does not hold 
or issue derivative ﬁ nancial instruments for ﬁ nancial trading purposes.
All derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts 
are calculated by reference to forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity proﬁ les.
The designation of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments as hedges is carried out according to the Group’s risk management policies. Hedges 
fall into three categories:
a)   Fair value hedges, which hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability;
b)   Cash ﬂ ow hedges, which hedge exposure to variability in cash ﬂ ows that is attributable to either a particular risk associated with 
a  recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction, or the foreign currency risk of a ﬁ rm commitment; and
c)   Net investment hedges, which hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations due 
to  changes in exchange rates. 90  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
 2 Accounting policies continued
The accounting treatment for these categories is as follows:
Fair value hedges 
When a hedging instrument is remeasured at fair value, any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. Any gain or loss 
on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and similarly 
recognised in the income statement.
Cash ﬂ ow and net investment hedges
The portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity. Any ineffective 
portion of the gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. When a hedged cash ﬂ ow related to a hedged item results in the 
recognition of a non-ﬁ nancial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial 
measurement of the asset or liability. For all other cash ﬂ ow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to 
the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the income statement. In the case of a net investment hedge, 
this takes place on disposal.
Where borrowings are used to hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign operations, the portion of the gain or loss on the borrowings 
that is determined to be an effective hedge, in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, is 
recognised in equity. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments that do not qualify as hedges 
are recognised in the income statement.
Derivative instruments held by the Group’s pension and post-retirement beneﬁ t schemes are accounted for within the schemes 
themselves and are reﬂ ected in the Group Financial Statements within the amounts reported for those schemes.
Other ﬁ nancial assets
Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment. Trade and other receivables are 
discounted when the time value of money is considered material. Any change in their value is recognised in the income statement.
Debt instruments 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable issue costs. 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method. This cost is computed as the amount initially recognised minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative 
amortisation of any difference between the initially recognised amount and the maturity amount. Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. 
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement through the amortisation process and when the liabilities are derecognised.
Financial guarantee contracts  
A ﬁ nancial guarantee contract is a contract issued by the Group that requires the Group to make speciﬁ ed payments to reimburse the 
holder of the guarantee for a loss it incurs because a speciﬁ ed debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original 
or  modiﬁ ed terms of a debt instrument. In a very limited number of cases, the Group has issued such contracts to guarantee certain 
borrowings by third parties.
Financial guarantee contracts are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of: (a) the estimated outﬂ ow 
of  resources required to meet any present obligation under the contract (in accordance with IAS 37 , Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets) ; and (b) the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised (in accordance 
with IAS 18, Revenue).
Derecognition of ﬁ nancial instruments
A ﬁ nancial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing ﬁ nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing 
liability are substantially modiﬁ ed, such an exchange or modiﬁ cation is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment of ﬁ nancial assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a ﬁ nancial asset or group of ﬁ nancial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost
Assets carried at amortised cost, such as loans and receivables, are impaired if there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has 
been incurred. The loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash ﬂ ows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the ﬁ nancial asset’s original effective 
interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an 
allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
The assessment considers whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for ﬁ nancial assets that are individually signiﬁ cant, 
and individually or collectively for ﬁ nancial assets that are not individually signiﬁ cant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of 
impairment exists for an individually assessed ﬁ nancial asset, the asset is included in a group of ﬁ nancial assets with similar credit risk 
characteristics and that group of ﬁ nancial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for 
impairment and for which an impairment loss is recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If the amount of a recognised impairment loss decreases in a subsequent period, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. The reversal is recognised in the 
income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 91
Group Financial Statements
For trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or 
signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the 
invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired debts are derecognised when 
they are assessed as uncollectible.
Share-based payment
The Group operates various equity-settled and cash-settled share schemes.
For equity-settled share options and share awards, the services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of 
the share options. The fair value is calculated at grant date using a valuation model and recognised in the consolidated income statement, 
together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of 
the number of options that will eventually vest. Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when 
estimating the fair value. Market conditions are those conditions that are linked to the share price of the Company.
For equity-settled share award schemes, the fair value is calculated based on the share price at the grant date and, where applicable, 
any  market vesting conditions, and expensed over the vesting period based on the number of shares expected to vest. No expense is 
recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition; 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisﬁ ed, provided that all other 
performance or service conditions are satisﬁ ed.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modiﬁ ed, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms 
had not been modiﬁ ed, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any modiﬁ cation that increases 
the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneﬁ cial to the employee as measured at the date of 
modiﬁ cation.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for 
the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the 
employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the 
date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modiﬁ cation of the original award, as described in the 
previous paragraph.
For cash-settled share awards, the services received from employees are measured at fair value and recognised in the consolidated 
income statement as an expense over the vesting period with recognition of a corresponding liability. The fair value of the liability is 
remeasured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income 
statement.
Treasury shares
Own equity instruments which are re-acquired (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in proﬁ t or 
loss  on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Treasury shares are purchased and held by 
the  Employee Share Trust to meet future distributions of shares to employees under the Group’s various share option and share 
award  schemes.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued
2 Accounting policies continued
The revision of IAS 19 is expected to have an impact on the amounts recognised in proﬁ t or loss and other comprehensive income for the 
Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans. Under the revision, the return on plan assets recognised in proﬁ t or loss within ‘Other ﬁ nance 
charges  – IAS 19’ will be calculated using a plan’s discount rate, rather than its expected rate of return on plan assets. Assuming that the 
discount rate is lower than the expected rate of return on plan assets, this will result in an increase in the net charge recognised as ‘Other 
ﬁ nance charges  – IAS 19’ within proﬁ t or loss. The extent of the impact will depend on the discount rates and expected rates of return on 
plan assets that apply when the revision is ﬁ rst adopted in the ﬁ nancial year ending 31 March 2014. There will be a corresponding change 
in the amount recognised in other comprehensive income, so that the net impact on total comprehensive income will be nil. Had the 
revised IAS 19 been effective in the current period, there would have been no net impact on ‘Other ﬁ nance charges – IAS 19’, however 
an  additional charge to operating proﬁ t would have been incurred in respect of administration costs.
Other than the revision of IAS 19 noted above, the directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations 
will  have a material impact on the Group Financial Statements in the period of initial application.
3 Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning the 
future in a number of areas. Actual results may be different from those estimated using these judgements and assumptions. The key 
sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements that have a signiﬁ cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁ nancial year are discussed below.
Construction and long-term service provision contracts  
Invensys Operations Management and Invensys Rail undertake projects that frequently span more than one accounting period and are 
accounted for as construction or long-term service provision contracts. The Group’s accounting policies for these projects require 
revenue  and costs to be allocated to individual accounting periods and the consequent recognition at period end of contract assets or 
liabilities for projects still in progress. The application of these policies requires management to apply judgement in estimating the total 
revenue and total costs expected on each project. Such estimates are revised as a project progresses to reﬂ ect the current status of the 
project and the latest information available to management. Project management teams perform regular reviews to ensure the latest 
estimates are appropriate.
The amount of revenue relating to projects accounted for as construction or long-term service provision contracts recognised within 
continuing operations in the year ended 31 March 2013 was £747 million (2012: £652 million), and within discontinued operations 
£539 million (2012: £581 million). The net amount due from contract customers on projects in progress at 31 March 2013 was £21 million 
(2012: £56 million including Invensys Rail). Further details of amounts due from and to contract customers are included in Note 16.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the ‘value in use’ of the 
cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating a value in use amount requires management to make an estimate of 
the expected future cash ﬂ ows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present 
value of those cash ﬂ ows. The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 March 2013 was £297 million (2012: £289 million including Invensys 
Rail). Details of the key assumptions used in testing for impairment and the sensitivity of the calculations to any reasonably possible 
change in those assumptions are given in Note 12.
Pension and post-retirement beneﬁ ts
The cost of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans and other post employment medical beneﬁ ts is determined using actuarial valuations. 
The  actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, 
mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to signiﬁ cant 
uncertainty. The net pension liability at 31 March 2013 was £427 million (2012: £426 million including Invensys Rail). Further details, 
including an analysis of the sensitivity of the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) and Invensys Pension Plan (US) to changes in the principal 
assumptions, are given in Note 25.
Development costs
Costs incurred in developing new products are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for other intangible assets. 
These costs arise mainly in the Invensys Operations Management and Invensys Rail divisions. Determining the amounts to be capitalised 
requires management to make assumptions and estimates regarding the expected future cash generation of new products and the 
expected period of beneﬁ ts. At 31 March 2013, the carrying amount of capitalised development costs was £68 million (2012: £155 million 
including Invensys Rail). Further details including an explanation of impairment losses recognised are given in Note 13.
Provisions and contingent liabilities
The Group currently recognises provisions for a number of liabilities including environmental claims and onerous lease contracts. 
The  amounts recognised for provisions represent the best estimate of the probable outﬂ ow of resources embodying economic beneﬁ ts 
that will be required to settle these liabilities. No provisions are recognised for contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are possible 
obligations whose existence will be conﬁ rmed only by uncertain future events, or current obligations that are not recognised because 
it  is  not probable that they will result in an outﬂ ow of resources embodying economic beneﬁ ts or because the amount of the obligation 
cannot be measured with sufﬁ cient reliability.
The determination of whether a liability should be disclosed as a contingent liability or recognised as a provision requires judgements 
to be made on the existence of a present obligation and the probability of future events. When a provision is required, the amount 
recognised is determined using judgements and assumptions, based on current knowledge, to estimate the amount and timing of future 
cash outﬂ ows arising from the liabilities. At 31 March 2013, the estimated amount of liabilities requiring provisions was £186 million 
(2012: £139 million including Invensys Rail). Further details are given in Note 24. Details of the Group’s contingent liabilities are set out 
in Note 29. Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 93
Group Financial Statements
4 Operating segment information
For management purposes, in the year ended 31 March 2013 the Group was organised into divisions based on their products and 
services and had three reportable segments : Invensys Operations Management, Invensys Rail and Invensys Controls. There have been 
no changes to the composition of these operating segments during the year; however, Invensys Rail has been classiﬁ ed as a 
discontinued operation and was sold subsequent to the year end date (Note 35). 
Descriptions of the products and services provided by these divisions are set out in Note 1. Operations presented as discontinued are 
explained in Note 10.
Operating results of each of these divisions are monitored separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and 
performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated primarily on operating proﬁ t or loss before exceptional items as identiﬁ ed 
in the consolidated income statement. Restructuring costs and impairment losses on operating assets, which are reported in the 
consolidated income statement as exceptional items, are also monitored at the segment level.
Other exceptional items, together with foreign exchange gains or losses, ﬁ nance costs, ﬁ nance income, ﬁ nance charges relating to 
pension arrangements under IAS 19, Employee Beneﬁ ts and income tax are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to 
operating segments.
Segment net assets/(liabilities) comprise amounts considered to be net operating assets/(liabilities) used for operating performance 
assessment. Items not included in these net operating assets/(liabilities) are identiﬁ ed in the reconciliation on page  95.
These segments are monitored by divisional chief executives and reviewed by the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer.

(iv) Factors that may affect future tax charges
The Group is subject to several factors which affect the tax charge including the levels and mix of proﬁ tability in different jurisdictions and 
the availability of tax losses.
(v) Franked investment income group litigation order
In December 2006 Invensys ﬁ led a claim in the High Court for compensation arising from the payment of advance corporation tax and 
from satisfying liabilities to corporation tax arising from the receipt of dividends from non UK resident subsidiaries. Invensys contends that 
these tax liabilities were incurred in breach of its EU community law rights. Invensys is part of a Group Litigation Order with 24 other 
corporates from whom two test cases were selected to proceed to trial on a representative basis.
In December 2006 the European Court of Justice issued its guidance to the UK High Court on the compatibility of certain UK tax 
provisions within EU community law. The test cases returned to the UK High Court for the full hearing in July 2008, with the UK High 
Court issuing its judgement on 27 November 2008. 
The UK High Court judgement in November 2008 found in favour of the claimants on certain key aspects of the claim. The judgement 
concluded, inter alia, that dividends received from EU subsidiaries should be, and should have been, effectively exempt from UK taxation. 
It also concluded that certain dividends received from EU subsidiaries before 5 April 1999 and, in some limited circumstances, after 1993 
from outside the EU, should have been treated as franked investment income, with the consequence that advance corporation tax need 
not have been paid.
The case was heard by the Court of Appeal in October 2009 and the judgement was handed down on 23 February 2010. The Court 
of Appeal has determined that various questions should be referred back to the European Court of Justice for further clariﬁ cation. In 
addition, the Court determined that the claim should be restricted to six years and not cover claims dating back to 1973. A hearing took 
place in February 2012 at the ECJ on the questions referred from the Court of Appeal. The issue of time limits was heard by the Supreme 
Court in February 2012 and, in May 2012, the Supreme Court decided in favour of the principal test claimant that claims submitted before 
8 September 2003 can go back to 1973. However, for claims issued on or after 8 September 2003 (which is relevant for Invensys), only 
a majority of Supreme Court judges supported the taxpayer’s arguments that their right to recover any wrongly paid tax should extend 
back to 1973. A further reference to the ECJ has therefore been made. It is expected that the overall process may take several years 
to complete. 100  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
9 Taxation continued
The ECJ judgement of 13 November 2012 conﬁ rms that the UK treatment of EU dividends was discriminatory and produces the same 
outcome for third country dividends from 1994 in certain circumstances. The judgement also conﬁ rms that the claim can cover dividends 
from all indirect as well as direct EU subsidiaries and also ACT paid by a superior holding company.
The case is now likely to revert to the UK High Court to apply the November 2012 ECJ judgement and the date of the trial is awaited.
Given the complexity and uncertainty over the issues raised it is not possible to predict the amounts and ﬁ nal outcome with any 
reasonable certainty. Therefore no contingent asset has been recognised in the Group Financial Statements.
10 Discontinued operations
On 28 November 2012, the Board announced that it had entered into an agreement with respect to the sale of Invensys Rail to Siemens. 
This followed a strategic review by the Board of the Group’s businesses which resulted in a decision to implement a strategy aimed at 
refocusing the Group around its industrial software, systems and control equipment business and, accordingly, to dispose of its Invensys 
Rail business. The disposal would also provide funds to address the Group’s UK pension position, enable a capital return to shareholders 
and provide funds for investment in the retained group. Invensys Rail was classiﬁ ed as a disposal group held for sale at 28 November 
2012, at which date the group was available for immediate sale subject to completion of the terms of the sale agreement, and the sale 
was considered to be highly probable. With effect from that date, no depreciation or amortisation has been charged on the non-current 
assets of Invensys Rail and those assets have been measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell. 
The sale of Invensys Rail was completed subsequent to the year end (Note 35), and the group is presented as a discontinued operation 
and disposal group held for sale (Note 22) in the  Financial  Statements.
Discontinued operations comprise Invensys Rail, and additional costs incurred in respect of disposals in prior years.

number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held as treasury shares which are treated as cancelled, and the proﬁ t after 
taxation and non-controlling interests for continuing operations, discontinued operations and total Group as shown above.
An additional earnings per share calculation for continuing operations has been included since the directors consider that this gives 
useful additional indications of underlying performance. 
The diluted earnings per share has been calculated in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per Share without reference to adjustments 
in  respect of certain share options which are considered to be anti-dilutive. 102  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Goodwill acquired in business combinations has been allocated to four cash generating units (CGUs). IMServ is a part of Invensys 
Operations Management, but management continues to monitor IMServ’s goodwill separately. These four CGUs represent the lowest 
level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Annual impairment test
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill is 
tested separately for each CGU or group of CGUs that represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is allocated and 
monitored for internal management purposes. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from  “value in use ” calculations 
using cash ﬂ ow projections over a ﬁ ve-year period.
The key assumptions for the  “value in use ” calculations are:
• revenue volumes; 
• revenue prices;
• operating costs;
• growth rate assumptions for years four and ﬁ ve of the cash ﬂ ow projections;
• growth in perpetuity applied to calculate the terminal value; and
• discount rate.
Expected revenue volumes, revenue prices and operating costs are those included in the most recent ﬁ nancial annual operating plans 
and three-year strategic plans approved by the Board. Annual operating plans are detailed ﬁ nancial forecasts covering the ﬁ rst year of the 
Group’s three-year strategic plan. The key assumptions underlying the forecasts for the CGUs over the period of the annual operating 
and strategic plans are order growth, taking account of the level of historic growth and expected future developments in markets and 
operations, and macroeconomic forecasts for the territories and industries in which they operate. Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 103
Group Financial Statements
Cash ﬂ ows for years four and ﬁ ve are projected at a growth rate appropriate for the relevant CGUs. These growth rates take into 
consideration forecast GDP growth rates for the countries of operation, expected market growth rates for those regions and the levels of 
growth achieved historically by the CGUs and forecast in the periods covered by the three-year strategic plan. Lower growth rates are 
applied in perpetuity to calculate the terminal values of the CGUs. These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the 
relevant markets. A long-term discount rate is derived for the CGUs by adjusting the Group’s weighted average cost of capital to reﬂ ect 
the relative level of risk associated with the cash ﬂ ow projections. The discount rate is a pre-tax rate. These discount rates and growth 
rates are as follows:

1  In perpetuity.
In all cases the recoverable amounts of these CGUs were in excess of their carrying values and no impairment arose in the year 
(2012: £nil).
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
With respect to the assessment of ‘value in use’ of all CGUs, except IMServ, management believes that no reasonable change in any of 
the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of those CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount. With respect to IMServ the 
details are tabulated below:
Amount by which the CGU’ s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount (£m) 2.3
Key assumption T erminal growth rate Discount rate
Value of key assumption 2.3% 10.7%
Amount by which the value assigned to the key assumption must change in order for the
 CGU’ s recoverable amount to be equal to its carrying amount (% points) 0.6% 0.6%
The assumptions for the terminal growth rate would change if the long term GDP for market growth differs from the actual growth. The 
discount rate would change if there is a change to the Group’s weighted cost of capital caused by a change in market rates or the risk 
proﬁ le of the Group. 104  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

There was £nil million (2012: £1 million) depreciation charged in the year in respect of assets held under ﬁ nance leases.
Included in plant and equipment at 31 March 2013 was an amount of £9 million (2012: £12 million) relating to expenditure for plant and 
equipment in the course of construction.
Impairment losses of £3 million in the year ended 31 March 2013 relate to the write-down of buildings and equipment as part of the Group

related to the write-down of buildings and equipment associated with restructuring projects undertaken in Invensys Controls and 
£2 million for the write-down of land and buildings in Corporate). The recoverable amounts of these assets were estimated based

Trade receivables are recorded net of an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods. The average credit 
period taken on sale  of goods is 49 days.
The allowance that has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods is £9 million (2012: £11 million). 
This  allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience and future recoverability. The net reversal in the year 
of  previously recognised impairment losses as a result of irrecoverable receivables balances is £1 million (2012: £nil).
Trade and other receivables are predominantly non-interest bearing. Other receivables include amounts owed by associated 
undertakings, interest receivable, refundable deposits, refunds due in respect of VAT, sales and payroll taxes, commissions earned 
and insurance recoveries.

As a result of changes to tax legislation, dividends received from subsidiaries on or after 1 July 2009 are largely exempt from UK tax but 
may be subject to dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate. The gross 
temporary differences of those overseas subsidiaries affected by such potential taxes is £50 million (2012: £34 million). No deferred 
income tax liability is recognised on these temporary differences as the Group is able to control the timing of reversal and it is probable 
that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable proﬁ t will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
As at 31 March 2013, the Group had income tax losses, capital losses, pension and other retirement beneﬁ t obligations and other 
deductible temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred income tax assets were recognised amounting to 
£8,120 million (2012: £8,196 million). The Group’s pension, other retirement obligations and other deductible temporary differences 
have no expiry date restrictions. The expiry date of income tax losses and capital losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law 
of the various territories in which the losses arose. A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which these restrictions apply is 
set out below:

1 Of the total capital losses in the  Group, £6 billion are carried forward in the UK.
The standard rate of UK corporation tax has reduced to 23% from 1 April 2013. Deferred tax not recognised has therefore been 
calculated using the standard rate of corporation tax of 23% (2012: 24%). Further reductions to the standard rate are proposed to reduce 
the rate to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. As this legislation was not substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, it has not been 
reﬂ ected in these  Financial  Statements. The impact of the rate change to 20% would reduce the total unrecognised deferred income tax 
assets by £195 million.

Group Financial Statements
19 Financial risk management and ﬁ nancial instruments
The Group’s principal ﬁ nancial instruments comprise bank facilities for cash advances, guarantees, leases, cash and cash equivalents, 
other ﬁ nancial assets, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables. The Group also enters into derivative transactions, 
primarily forward currency contracts. This note explains the nature and extent of the risks arising from ﬁ nancial instruments; how those 
risks arise; the objectives, policies and processes used by the Group for managing the risks; and the methods used to measure the risks.
Overview of treasury policy
The Group manages its exposure to risks arising from its use of ﬁ nancial instruments by the application of its treasury policy.
The Group’s treasury policy is approved by the Board and seeks to ensure that:
• appropriate ﬁ nancial resources are available for the maintenance and development of the Group’s divisions;
• the ﬁ nancial risk of currency, interest rate and counterparty credit exposure is understood, measured and managed appropriately; and
• the Treasury department operates as a cost centre and that no speculative transactions are undertaken.
There have been no signiﬁ cant changes in the Group’s exposures to risk, and its approach to managing those exposures, in the year 
ended 31 March 2013. This is not expected to change as a result of the disposal of Invensys Rail.
The Group’s policy in respect of the major areas of treasury management is set out below.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difﬁ culty in meeting its ﬁ nancial obligations as they fall due. 
Operating within the strict controls of the Group’s treasury policy, the Treasury department manages this risk, ensuring that sufﬁ cient 
funding and liquidity is available to meet the expected needs of the Group together with a prudent level of headroom to allow for cash ﬂ ow 
and bank guarantee variability. In addition to the free cash ﬂ ow of the Group, Invensys adopts a ﬂ exible approach to liquidity management 
using a mixture of long-term debt facilities and short-term cash deposits. Funding is provided by a £250 million bank facility which 
matures in March 2017 , as described in Note 21(ii). The undrawn level of this facility together with the Group’s cash balances, as set 
out  in  Note 20, are the key measures of the Group’s liquidity.
Bank guarantees issued by the Group as set out in Note 21(ii) represent a potential liquidity requirement. This risk is mitigated by issuing 
guarantees under the committed syndicated loan facility and holding sufﬁ cient liquidity to cover the forecast cash requirements of 
guarantees issued under uncommitted facilities.
Liquidity management is centralised through cash pooling arrangements and inter-company funding structures, under the control of 
the  Treasury department. In countries where cash pooling arrangements are not in place, cash balances are monitored to ensure that 
surplus amounts are repatriated and deﬁ cits adequately funded. The Treasury department maintains sufﬁ cient back-up liquidity in the 
form of available cash balances and committed facilities.
Standard business practices include the strict application of credit control procedures to ensure the collection of cash from customers 
in  accordance with agreed credit periods and terms that result in positive cash ﬂ ows over the life of a construction or long-term service 
provision contract whenever possible.
The following table summarises the maturity proﬁ le of the continuing Group’s ﬁ nancial liabilities at 31 March 2013 and total Group at

Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to risk arising from the effect of changes in ﬂ oating interest rates on the level of interest it receives on its cash 
deposits, and pays interest on its facility drawings.
As at 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012, the Group had no signiﬁ cant borrowings. 
The interest rate proﬁ les of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term borrowings are set out in Notes 20 and 21 
respectively. All other ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities of the Group are non-interest bearing and a statement has been made to that effect 
in  the relevant balance sheet notes.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis       
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on the three main trading currencies 
of  the Group, with all other variables held constant, on the Group’s proﬁ t before tax (through the impact on ﬂ oating-rate cash and 
borrowings). There is no impact on the Group’s equity. The same assumptions have been used for the years ended 31 March 2013 
and  31 March 2012.

Currency risk
Transaction exposure
Currency transaction exposure arises when business units face revenue  or costs in a currency other than their own. The incidence of this 
risk varies across the Group and is subject to change. However, the majority of revenue  and costs will usually be in the functional 
currency of the business unit undertaking the transaction. Where this is not the case and the exposure is signiﬁ cant, it is the Group’s 
policy for business units to hedge their exposures. The Group predominantly uses forward currency contracts to manage transaction 
exposure.
The Group is also subject to exchange risk when making bids, particularly on major contracts, where movements against the speciﬁ c 
exchange rate assumed within a bid would lead to a change in the anticipated margin on the contract should the bid be successful. 
If  it  is  likely that the bid will be successful, and the resulting foreign currency exposure would be signiﬁ cant, then the currency risk will 
be  hedged.
Translation exposure
The majority of the Group’s operating capital is employed in overseas locations and is denominated in foreign currencies, particularly US 
dollars. As a consequence, changes in exchange rates affect both net asset values and reported results.      Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 111

Credit risk 
The Group is exposed to risk if a counterparty to a ﬁ nancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Such a risk arises 
principally in relation to receivables due from customers and cash deposited with banks or other ﬁ nancial institutions.
The Group monitors the identity of the counterparties with whom it deposits cash and transacts other ﬁ nancial instruments so as to 
control exposure to any territory or institution. As far as it is both feasible and practical to do so, cash is held centrally by the Treasury 
department. Risk is assessed using ratings from major credit rating agencies.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to ﬁ nancial assets is represented by their respective carrying values as at the balance sheet 
date (see Note 19(i) on page  112). Credit risks arising from acting as guarantor are disclosed in Note 29.
It should be noted that the Group has exposure of approximately £80 million with one major customer spread over several contracts.
Details of collateral held as security and other credit enhancements in respect of receivables are given in Note 15.
Based on past experience, the directors believe that there is no signiﬁ cant credit risk associated with receivables that are neither past due 
nor impaired. The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties, and performs credit veriﬁ cation procedures on all major 
customers. Receivable balances, including uninvoiced receivables reported as amounts due from contract customers, are monitored on 
an ongoing basis.
The Group has not renegotiated the terms of any signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial assets such that those assets would have been past due or 
impaired had the terms not been renegotiated.
Capital management
Capital is managed under the Group’s treasury policy. The policy sets out a strategy for the long-term funding of the Group, with the 
objective of ensuring the Group has access to appropriate sources of funding to support its businesses, as and when required. Key 
aspects of the policy are:
•  the Group’s debt capacity is determined as part of the annual strategic review process;
•  appropriate contingency levels are maintained to cover unforeseen events;
•  ﬁ nancing is obtained from multiple sources, for example capital markets, bank debt and cash resources;
•  funds are raised from various geographical locations;
•  the Group aims to maintain a consistent credit rating;
•  the Group aims to maintain strong relationships with its banks and rating agencies; and
•  interest cover and other ﬁ nancial ratios (principally the ratio of EBITDA to total borrowings and net ﬁ nance costs) are maintained at 
appropriate levels, and compliance with covenant arrangements is tested semi-annually.
Funding is arranged centrally and managed by the Treasury department. The Treasury department can make use of a number of 
approved funding instruments, including bilateral bank facilities, syndicated bank facilities, public bonds or loan notes, private placements 
and commercial paper programmes. New long-term funding requires approval under the Group’s Board Delegated Authority Levels, with 
facilities in excess of £100 million requiring Board approval. 112  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
19 Financial risk management and ﬁ nancial instruments continued 
The main credit facility in place at 31 March 2013 provides liquidity for the Group until March 2017 and supports the current strategy 
of  the Group. This facility, including the related covenant arrangements, is described further in Note 21(ii). Investigations are regularly 
undertaken to review ﬁ nancing requirements and the availability of funding to meet these. In considering these, the Board takes 
into  account the cost of any ﬁ nancing compared to the beneﬁ ts, which include terms and conditions, the cost of funding and 
repayment  schedules.
There were no signiﬁ cant changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the years ended 31 March 2013 and 
31 March 2012.
The Group’s capital structure is as follows:
As at 31 March Notes

(i) Classiﬁ cation and fair values of ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities
The following table sets out the classiﬁ cation, carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities. The fair value 
is deﬁ ned as the amount at which a ﬁ nancial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed and willing 
parties. Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash ﬂ ows at prevailing interest rates 
translated at year end exchange rates. Provisions have been included where there is a contractual obligation to settle in cash.
The fair value of ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities at 31 March was:

The fair values of the ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to 
estimate the fair values:
•  loans and receivables: trade and other receivables; cash and cash equivalents; provisions and trade and other payables: the directors 
consider that the carrying amount of these ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value ;
•  short and long-term bank and other loans; ﬁ nance leases: fair values are evaluated based on interest rates ; and
•  derivative ﬁ nancial instruments: foreign exchange swaps and forwards: fair values are derived using forward pricing and swap models. 
The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and foreign exchange spot and forward rates.
The Group has, in the ordinary course of business, provided indemnities to banks in respect of performance guarantees issued to 
customers. The fair value of such indemnities is not material, as the likelihood of any liability arising from them is considered remote.
At 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012, the Group had no arrangements in place to guarantee borrowings by third parties.  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 113

Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of ﬁ nancial instruments by valuation technique:
• Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
• Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a signiﬁ cant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly 
or indirectly
• Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a signiﬁ cant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable

The notional principals and fair values of derivatives from discontinued operations are not signiﬁ cant to the Group.
Foreign exchange swaps and forwards used to hedge transaction exposure
The Group uses foreign exchange swaps and forwards to hedge currency exposure arising from sales and purchases made by the 
Group’s business units in currencies other than their own functional currency. The notional principal of such derivatives from continuing 
operations (which typically have a term of less than one year), in the year ended 31 March 2013 was £115 million (2012: £256 million).
These instruments are designated and effective as cash ﬂ ow hedges. £1 million relating to hedged cash ﬂ ows that have not yet impacted 
the income statement have been deferred and recognised in equity at 31 March 2013 (2012: £nil). £nil (2012: £nil) has been transferred to 
the income statement in respect of hedge relationships where the underlying sales or purchases have been recognised during the year 
ended 31 March 2013.
As a result of the sale of Invensys Rail , the underlying forecast transactions which were previously hedged are no longer expected to 
occur. Therefore £8 million has been transferred to the income statement during the year ended 31 March 2013 in respect of 
discontinued cash ﬂ ow hedges (2012: £nil). This amount is included within proﬁ t from discontinued operations.
Ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement from continuing operations
No amounts were recognised in the income statement relating to the ineffectiveness of cash ﬂ ow hedges (2012: £nil). 114  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Foreign exchange swaps and forwards used to hedge translation exposure      
The Group uses foreign exchange swaps and forwards to match the currency proﬁ le of its net debt to that of its net assets, revenue and 
earnings, and ensures that it has sufﬁ cient cash available to meet its payment obligations by currency as they fall due. The fair value of 
such derivatives (which typically have a term of less than one year) is £3 million (2012: £nil). 
Changes in the fair value of these derivatives resulted in a loss of £3 million in the year ended 31 March 2013 (2012: £nil). These are 
taken  directly to the income statement.
The currency assets and liability positions resulting from entering into these derivatives at 31 March were:

exposure of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents balances to credit risk refer to Note 19.
Restricted cash and short-term deposits
The Group has operations in a number of territories including China, Brazil and India which place restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries 
to lend money to other Group entities outside those territories. However, distributions to the Group are permitted from realised reserves. 
At 31 March 2013 , restricted cash and cash equivalents held in such territories totalled £51 million (2012: £58 million).
Cash and cash equivalents include £10 million (2012: £12 million) of collateral held in the ordinary course of business to provide security 
for local bonding facilities. £22  million cash and cash equivalents is classiﬁ ed as held for sale in respect of discontinued operations of 
which £12 million is held as collateral (2012: £17 million).

Terms and conditions of the above ﬁ nancial liabilities are as follows:
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are on average normally settled on 50-day terms. Interest payable on the Group’s borrowing 
facility is settled quarterly. Other payables include sales taxes, social security and payroll taxes, payroll creditors, customer advances 
(not related to construction contracts), payments received from customers in advance of work performed on construction contracts and 
commissions payable. They are non-interest bearing. The majority of non-current other payables will mature in more than one year but 
in less than two years; there is a small proportion that will mature in over ﬁ ve years. The maturity proﬁ le of trade and other payables 
classiﬁ ed as ﬁ nancial liabilities is given in Note 19.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of both current and non-current trade and other payables approximates to their 
fair value. Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 117

Warranties are provided for in the normal course of business based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past claims. 
Such costs are generally incurred over the product life cycle. The actual amount of costs that will be incurred will depend upon the level 
and nature of future claims.
Restructuring provisions cover committed costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred within one year of the balance 
sheet date.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount can be determined reliably. This 
generally coincides with a commitment to a formal plan or, if earlier, on divestment or closure of inactive sites. These costs are expected 
to be incurred over the next 30 years.
Provisions for onerous contracts relate to lease rentals in respect of vacant property and the costs of other onerous contracts. An 
onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic 
beneﬁ ts expected to be received under it. The provisions represent the best estimate of the unavoidable costs remaining under the 
current contractual terms of the contracts. These liabilities are expected to crystallise largely within the next 15 years.
Other provisions principally relate to legal claims, claims under workers’ compensation or similar employee disability beneﬁ t schemes and 
other miscellaneous obligations. These liabilities are expected to crystallise largely within the next  10 years. The costs are estimated 
based on the expected outcome of the legal claim or obligation. The amount of the ﬁ nal liability and timing of payment, if any, is 
dependent upon the ﬁ nal outcome of any litigation or other negotiation involved.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of provisions equates to their fair value. 118  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

25 Pensions and post-retirement beneﬁ ts
(i) Deﬁ ned contribution schemes
The Group operates 31 deﬁ ned contribution schemes. Pension costs in respect of deﬁ ned contribution schemes represented 
contributions payable in the year and amounted to £19 million (2012: £19 million). At 31 March 2013, there were £nil (2012: £nil) 
of  outstanding contributions included in payables. 
(ii) Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes – general
The Group operates 50 funded and unfunded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension and post-retirement schemes. Contributions to the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of the independent actuary of the relevant scheme. There are two main 
funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes in the UK and US, together with other smaller schemes in the rest of the world. The Invensys Pension 
Scheme (UK) is ﬁ nal salary in nature. The Invensys Pension Plan (US) ceased to be a ﬁ nal salary scheme following its closure to future 
accrual and the freezing of beneﬁ ts for existing members with effect from 1 November 2009.
The principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK employees who have deﬁ ned beneﬁ ts is the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK). 
The  Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) is a funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme. The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the 
Group. These assets are managed by trustees, who are required to act in the best interests of the scheme’s beneﬁ ciaries. The Trustee 
Board is made up of nine directors, four nominated by the Company and ﬁ ve by the members. The Company is responsible for 
appointing the Chairman from the Board. The last full actuarial valuation of the scheme for funding purposes was carried out with a 
valuation date of 31 March 2011 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method for valuing the liabilities. A further full 
actuarial valuation was carried out with a valuation date of 31 October 2012 as part of the requirements for the disposal of Invensys Rail. 
This did not impact the current year funding plan. More detail on future funding is provided in Note 25(x). The assumptions that had the 
most effect on the results of the March 2011 valuation for funding purposes are those relating to the discount rate and inﬂ ation on scheme 
liabilities and mortality assumptions.
There are numerous schemes operated by overseas subsidiaries. Of these, the largest, Invensys Pension Plan (US), is assessed annually 
by an actuary, and the other overseas deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes are normally assessed periodically by independent actuaries in 
accordance with local practice. 
The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement beneﬁ t plans, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical 
beneﬁ ts to retired former employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in the US. These schemes are generally unfunded.
The last full valuations of all schemes on an IAS 19 basis have been updated to 31 March 2013 to reﬂ ect market conditions and material 
events in the plans. 
(iii) Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes – major assumptions
The major assumptions made when valuing the liabilities of funded and unfunded schemes under IAS 19 are as follows:
As at 31 March 2013 the major ﬁ nancial assumptions are:
Funded schemes

 3.50  n/a  3.17  2.54 
1  The pension increase assumption disclosed for the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) is in line with RPI, subject to a ﬂ oor of 3.0% and a ceiling of 5.0%.
2  The inﬂ ation rate for the UK schemes is based on RPI. An additional inﬂ ation rate assumption for CPI is required for the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK), one Other Funded scheme and one 
Other Unfunded scheme to reﬂ ect the UK Government’s change of the inﬂ ation measure used to determine minimum pension increases which impacts on some of the pension increases 
within these schemes. This has been assessed as 2.50% for the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK), 2.50% for the Other Funded scheme and 2.50% for the Other Unfunded scheme.

within these schemes. This has been assessed as 2.50% for the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK), 2.60% (reﬂ ecting a longer duration) for the Other Funded scheme and 2.50% for the Other 
Unfunded scheme.        Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 119
Group Financial Statements
The demographic assumptions which were applied for the main schemes are as follows:
Invensys Pension Scheme (UK)
Standard SAPS actuarial mortality tables S1PA were applied. Based on scheme experience, the probability of death at each age was 
multiplied by 103% for males and 113% for females. Future improvements in life expectancy have been allowed for in line with the 
standard CMI model projections subject to a long -term trend of 1.00% for males and females. These mortality tables are consistent 
with  those agreed by the trustees for the 31 March 2011 formal valuation of the scheme. 
By way of illustration, the impact of the application of these mortality tables on the expected longevity of pensioners is shown below:
Years
Retiring today at age 65: Male 22.0
Female 23.4
Retiring in 20 years at age 65: Male 23.4
Female 24.9
Invensys Pension Plan (US)
The mortality table adopted was the RP 2000 Table for combined employee/annuitants, projected to 2020 using projection scale AA.
Sensitivities
Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) and Invensys Pension Plan (US)
The two largest schemes within the Group are the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) (representing 76% of gross liabilities of all deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t schemes) and the Invensys Pension Plan (US) (17%). The principal sensitivities, with all other variables held constant, for these 
two  schemes are illustrated below:

1  The movement of assets in this table shows the estimated impact on asset values arising from a change of market conditions consistent with the change in discount rate and inﬂ ation 
assumptions shown.
2  This sensitivity assumes that a 0.1% increase in future inﬂ ation expectations results in a 0.1% increase in all inﬂ ation-related pension increase assumptions. As a result of the upper and 
lower limits on the majority of inﬂ ation related pension increases, a given change in the inﬂ ation assumption may result in a smaller change in pension increase assumptions, and hence 
smaller change in the liabilities (particularly where such a change in inﬂ ation is large).
3  This illustrates the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to a 0.1% change in all bond yields. The discount rate used to determine the liabilities is based on AA corporate bond yields. 120  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

(vii) Impact of IFRIC 14
During the year, the Group was committed to make payments to the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) under a deﬁ cit funding contribution 
schedule agreed with the trustees. Where the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeded the liability in respect of the 
scheme as measured under IFRSs, and would therefore, when paid, have given rise to a surplus as measured under IFRSs, a provision 
was recognised for any part of that surplus that would not be recoverable. Any surplus on the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) ultimately 
repaid by the trustees would currently be subject to a 35% tax charge prior to being repaid, so a liability for this tax is recognised at the 
relevant balance sheet date. At 31 March 2013, the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeded the liability of the scheme 
under IFRSs, and consequently the irrecoverable element of the pension surplus is £4 million (2012: £34 million). The future funding 
requirements of the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) are disclosed further in  Note 25(x).

As required by IAS 19, liabilities for each scheme are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. This is an 
accrued beneﬁ ts valuation method that discounts the best estimate of future cash ﬂ ows and makes allowance for projected earnings. 124  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
25 Pensions and post-retirement beneﬁ ts continued
If the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) were to be wound up, the relevant employers would be responsible, under section 75 of the 
Pensions Act 1995 to fund the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) up to the levels of the cost of buying out the beneﬁ ts for all scheme 
members with an insurer. This cost would be considerably more than the value placed on the ongoing liabilities for accounting purposes. 
The deﬁ cit in the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) calculated on a winding up basis was approximately £2.2 billion as at 31 October 2012, 
the date of the last actuarial valuation prepared as part of the requirements for the disposal of Invensys Rail.

2  The change in mix of plan assets in the Invensys Pension Plan (US) results from an improved allocation of assets previously included within ‘other’ and does not represent a change to the 
underlying investment strategy of the plan.
The expected return on each asset class has been determined on the basis of market expectations for the rate of return on each asset 
class over the life of the related obligation, at the balance sheet date. In respect of the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK), Government and 
Corporate Bond indices have been used to set the expected rate of return on bonds, and a risk premium has been applied to determine 
the expected long-term rate of return on equity investments. Similar processes are applied to other schemes.
The investment strategy determined by the trustees of the Invensys Pension Scheme continues to reﬂ ect the mature nature of the 
scheme with assets predominantly invested in bonds or bond-like investments. Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 125

1  Following the disposal of Invensys Rail on 2 May 2013, the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) deﬁ cit reduction payment of £41 million will no longer be paid. Other regular contributions will also 
be reduced.
Regarding rates of contributions for future years, following the triennial valuation of the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) (valuation date 31 
March 2011), contributions to the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) will be made at the rate of 19.8% of pensionable salaries up to the date 
of the next triennial valuation. Following the sale of the Invensys Rail division as detailed in Note 35, a contribution of £400 million has been 
made to the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) and a further payment of £225 million has been made into a reservoir trust. As a result of 
these payments, the previous deﬁ cit reduction payments of £40-47 million per annum have ceased and it is anticipated that no further 
deﬁ cit reduction contributions will be payable into the scheme.
Under the Invensys Pension Plan (US), contributions will be made at the level required to meet the minimum requirements set forth by the 
Pension Protection Act of 2006 and related regulations. From time to time, discretionary amounts are contributed to enhance the security 
of participants’ beneﬁ ts based on other considerations, including available cash ﬂ ow and the Company’s tax position.

27 Nature and purpose of other equity reserves 
The analysis of the balance and movement on other equity reserves is shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
The  nature and purpose of these reserves are as follows:
Share premium account
This reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value.
Capital reserve
Previously the Group merger reserve, this reserve was created on the merger of BTR plc and Siebe plc in February 1999 and is 
non -distributable. 
Special reserve
This reserve represents the balance remaining after the elimination of the deﬁ cit in the reserves of the Parent Company following the 
capital reduction on 22 January 2009 . The reserve will remain, pending the settlement or consent of creditors (or contingent creditors) 
of  the Parent Company in existence at the date of the capital reduction. The reserve is non-distributable.
Cash ﬂ ow hedge reserve
This reserve records, for each hedged item in an effective cash ﬂ ow hedge, the cumulative change in fair value of the expected future 
cash ﬂ ow on the hedged item from the inception of the hedge relationship.
Foreign exchange reserve
The foreign exchange reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the ﬁ nancial statements of foreign 
subsidiaries. It is also used to record the foreign exchange on net investments in these subsidiaries.
28 Share-based payment plans
(i) Measurement of fair value
Share awards
An ‘adjusted market value’ method of valuation, based on market value at grant date and market-based performance conditions, 
has  been used to calculate the fair value of all share awards granted during the year.
Share options
The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to calculate the fair value of all share options granted during the prior year. 
These  options were granted under savings related share option schemes for which vesting is not dependent on market conditions.
Expected volatility was based on both historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous  10 years and on the implied 
volatility of traded options of the Group’s shares. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s 
best  estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Share-based payment expense
The Group recognised total expenses of £10 million (2012: £5 million) related to share-based payment transactions during the year, of 
which £10 million (2012: £4 million) related to equity-settled and £nil (2012: £1 million) related to cash-settled transactions. The carrying 
amount of the liability relating to the cash-settled awards at 31 March 2013 is £1 million (2012: £1 million).
The Company operates various share schemes under which options and awards have been granted and are outstanding as set 
out  below:
(ii) Executive share options
The Company’s executive share option schemes have expired and are no longer in use. All remaining options lapsed or were exercised 
in  the year ended 31 March 2012, and none remained outstanding in the year ended 31 March 2013. Executive share options included 
options granted under the Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme and the option granted to the former Chief Executive, 
Ulf Henriksson, under a separate arrangement on 1 June 2004. 
Details of relevant options outstanding as at 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012 are detailed below. No options were granted in the year.

(v) Explanation of long-term incentive schemes for senior employees 
2007 Invensys Long Term Incentive Plan (2007 LTIP)
Grant details
A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to executive directors and senior executives at nil (or nominal) cost. 
Depending on the country in which the participant is resident, the award would be delivered using one of the following mechanisms: 
(a) a nominal or nil price option which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal or nil payment (unless the Company determines otherwise); 
(b) a conditional share award; or (c) a cash award (granted in respect of a nominal number of shares). Awards are normally subject to a 
three-year performance period, commencing on the start of the ﬁ nancial year in which the date of award falls. There is no retention period.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
Awards are subject to two independent performance conditions. For executive directors: (a) 50% of an award is based on growth in the 
Company’s TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index; and (b) 50% of an 
award is based on the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the Group’s Earnings Per Share. For Group Leadership Team members 
who are not executive directors: (a) 40% of an award is based on growth in the Company’s TSR relative to the constituent companies of 
the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index; and (b) 40% of an award is based on the CAGR in the Group’s Earnings Per 
Share. There are no performance conditions applying to the remaining 20% of an award. For all other participants: (a) 35% of an award is 
based on growth in the Company’s TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index; 
and (b) 35% of an award is based on the CAGR in the Group’s Earnings Per Share. There are no performance conditions applying to the 
remaining 30% of an award. The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to ensure that, as a condition for the vesting of any TSR/
EPS shares, the underlying overall performance of the Group has been satisfactory. Factors that will be taken into account will include 
consistency of earnings and the Group’s cash position over the performance period.
Service requirements: 
If a participant is dismissed for cause before shares are released, the award will be forfeited. If a participant resigns, their award will lapse 
unless the Remuneration Committee exercise their discretion. If a participant’s employment ceases for good leaver reasons or any other 
reason determined at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, the ﬁ nancial performance tests will be measured at the normal 
vesting date and, subject to the outcome of the ﬁ nancial performance tests, the award will be pro-rated based on the period of service 
and released on the normal vesting date.
Scheme use
The 2007 LTIP is used as the Group’s main share-based long-term incentive plan under which share awards are granted. The ﬁ rst grants 
under this plan were made in the year ended 31 March 2008.
Invensys Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
Grant details
A restricted share plan, whereby awards, to be satisﬁ ed by the transfer of existing issued shares or in cash, are granted to certain senior 
employees at no cost. The vesting period for awards is determined separately for each award. Vesting periods normally fall between one 
and three years. 
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: 
Awards are not subject to speciﬁ c performance conditions apart from continued employment throughout the vesting period and 
satisfactory personal performance.
Service requirements: 
Release of shares is generally subject to continued employment at the relevant date, although shares may be released early, on a 
pro-rata basis, in deﬁ ned good leaver cases or for any other reason at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
The plan is operated predominantly for senior executives in special circumstances, such as recruitment and retention situations. 132  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
28  Share-based payment plans continued
Deferred Share Plan (DSP)
Grant details
Any bonus earned under the Executive Bonus Plan (EBP) from 2007/08 onwards in excess of target performance was paid in deferred 
shares, with any bonus earned up to the target performance being paid in cash. The shares would be released to the individual after 
three years, in the case of executive directors, and two years for all other participants. All awards are satisﬁ ed by the transfer of existing 
issued shares. 
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: 
The amount of shares granted is set by reference to the performance targets speciﬁ ed for the executive in the EBP .
Service requirements: 
Save where a participant is dismissed for cause before the relevant release date, shares under award will be released to participants on 
the release date, unless the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion should decide on a different release date.
Scheme use
From 2008/09 onwards, where applicable, bonus in excess of target performance will only be paid in deferred shares to executive 
directors and members of the Group Leadership Team. Bonus payments for all other members of the EBP are paid entirely in cash.

31  Analysis of business combinations and business disposals
(i) Business combinations
Year ended 31 March 2013
On 10 May 2012, Invensys Rail acquired 100% of the share capital of PHW Inc. (PHW), a privately held manufacturer of cab signalling 
systems and other safety electronic train control systems for the North American mainline and mass transit industries for a cash 
consideration of £12 million. The Group acquired PHW as part of the continuing process to broaden the range of technologies and 
solutions that Invensys Rail is able to sell to its global customer base. PHW provides complementary Positive Train Control (PTC) 
onboard products. 
On 15 October 2012, Invensys Operations Management acquired 100% of the share capital of Spiral Software (Spiral), a privately held 
company based in Cambridge, United Kingdom, for cash consideration of £38 million. Spiral Software provides integrated solutions 
ranging from crude assay management to reﬁ nery supply chain optimisation. The acquisition of Spiral strengthens Invensys Operations 
Management’s position in the hydrocarbon processing industry and extends the reﬁ nery optimisation solutions that it offers to its 
customers.
The acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and the Group Financial Statements include the 
results of PHW and Spiral from their date of acquisition to 31 March 2013.

Trade and other receivables includes trade receivables of £1 million. The gross contractual amount of trade receivables is £2 million. 
£1 million of the trade receivables has been impaired and it is expected that £1 million of the remaining contractual amount can be 
collected.
The goodwill shown above is attributed to the expected synergies and other beneﬁ ts arising from combining the assets and activities 
of  PHW with those of the Group. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Costs relating to the acquisition are negligible and have been expensed through operating proﬁ t in the year ended 31 March 2013.
Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, additional amounts of up to £6 million will become payable to the former owners of PHW 
dependent on the attainment of certain agreed performance targets subsequent to the acquisition of PHW by the Group, as well as their 
continued employment. These amounts will be expensed as incurred, to the extent that payment is probable. £1 million has been 
expensed in the year.
From the date of acquisition to 31 March 2013, PHW contributed a proﬁ t of £1 million to the net proﬁ t before tax of discontinued 
operations and revenue of £8 million. These amounts are included in the Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013. 
Had PHW been part of the Group for the whole of the year ended 31 March 2013, the proﬁ t and revenue of the Group for the year would 
not have been materially different from the amounts shown in the Group Financial Statements. 136  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Costs relating to the acquisition of Spiral of £1 million were expensed in the year ended 31 March 2013 through operating proﬁ t and are 
included in exceptional items in the income statement.
Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, additional amounts of up to £5 million will become payable to the former owners of Spiral 
dependent on the attainment of certain agreed performance targets subsequent to the acquisition of Spiral by the Group, as well as their 
continued employment. These amounts will be expensed as incurred, to the extent that payment is probable. £1 million has been 
expensed in the year.
From the date of acquisition to 31 March 2013, Spiral contributed a loss of £1 million to the net proﬁ t before tax of the Group and revenue 
of £4 million. These amounts are included in the Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013. Had Spiral been part of 
the Group for the whole of the year ended 31 March 2013, the proﬁ t of the Group would not have been materially different and the impact 
on the revenue of the Group for the year would have been £8 million.

to his US employment duties in 2010/11 and 2011/12. Invensys Systems Inc. advanced £78,498 on 24 May 2012 to Mr Edmunds, being 
an amount equal to the expected refunds due from HMRC. As at 31 March 2013 an amount of £65,532 remained outstanding, with the 
balance being repaid to Invensys Systems Inc. on 13 May 2013 following HMRC refunding the amount to Mr Edmunds.

35 Events after the balance sheet date
Sale of Invensys Rail
On 28 November 2012, Invensys signed an agreement to sell Invensys Rail to Siemens for a gross cash consideration of £1.7 billion. 
The consideration comprised £1.3 billion in exchange for the shares of Invensys Rail and £0.4 billion paid to Invensys’s UK Pension 
Scheme. The transaction completed on 2 May 2013 and will be accounted for in the year ending 31 March 2014.
Payment to reservoir trust in favour of Invensys’s UK Pension Scheme
On 2 May 2013 on receipt of proceeds from the sale of Invensys Rail, Invensys paid £225 million into a reservoir trust in favour of 
Invensys’s UK Pension Scheme. The Reservoir Trust Deed contains a mechanism for future payments to be made from the reservoir 
trust  to either the pension trustee or the Company dependent on the funding position of the scheme, commencing in 2018. Following 
this  payment, and the receipt by the UK Pension Scheme of the £400 million payment on the sale of Invensys Rail, the deﬁ cit reduction 
payments of £40 – 47 million per annum previously agreed with the trustees ceased. It is anticipated that no further contributions will be 
payable into the scheme for the foreseeable future.
Return of cash
The Group proposes to return cash to shareholders of £625 million (around 76 pence per share) from the proceeds of the sale, subject 
to  the approval of Invensys shareholders at a General Meeting which is expected to take place in June 2013. It is proposed that the return 
of cash will be followed by a share capital consolidation. The return of cash will be accounted for in the year ending 31 March 2014 as 
a  reduction in retained earnings.
Bank facilities
Following the completion of the sale of Invensys Rail on 2 May 2013, the Group’s revolving credit facility was reduced by £100 million 
to  £150 million. The Group’s guarantee facility remains at £350 million.

We have audited the Parent Company Financial Statements of Invensys 
plc for the year ended 31 March 2013 which comprise the Parent 
Company balance sheet and the related Notes 1 to 15. The ﬁ nancial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our  audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in  an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
set out on page 7 6, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the Parent Company Financial Statements and for being satisﬁ ed that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Parent Company Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the Parent Company Financial Statements sufﬁ cient to 
give reasonable assurance that the Parent Company Financial 
Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of signiﬁ cant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the Parent Company Financial 
Statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial 
information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited ﬁ nancial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on Parent Company Financial Statements
In our opinion the Parent Company Financial Statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 
31 March 2013;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the ﬁ nancial year for 
which the Financial Statements are prepared is consistent with the 
Parent Company Financial Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company Financial Statements and the part of the 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁ ed by law are not 
made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group Financial Statements of 
Invensys plc for the year ended 31 March 2013.

1 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards. The 
policies are consistent with the previous year except for the adoption of the amendment to FRS 29 (IFRS 7) Disclosures – Transfers of 
Financial Assets, which has not had any material effect on the Financial Statements of the Company.
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
All exchange differences are included in the proﬁ t and loss account for the year. 
Pension costs and other post-retirement beneﬁ ts 
For deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans, the service cost of providing retirement beneﬁ ts to employees during the year is charged to operating proﬁ t or 
loss in the year. The cost of providing beneﬁ ts under the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes is determined separately for each scheme using the 
projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. The full cost of providing amendments to beneﬁ ts in respect of past service that vests 
immediately is also charged to operating proﬁ t or loss in the year. The net surplus or deﬁ cit on deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension schemes is 
reported on the balance sheet within the pension asset or liability.
For deﬁ ned contribution schemes the amount charged to the proﬁ t and loss account in respect of pension costs is the contributions 
payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown either as accruals 
or  prepayments in the balance sheet.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less provisions for impairment where a permanent diminution in value has been 
identiﬁ ed.
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Debt instruments 
Borrowings are stated at net proceeds received after deduction of issue costs. The issue costs of debt instruments are amortised over 
the life of the instrument using the effective interest rate method.
Taxation 
Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date 
where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the 
future. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different to those in 
which they are included in the ﬁ nancial statements.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable 
proﬁ ts from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred income tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing 
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payment 
The Company operates various equity-settled and cash-settled share schemes. For equity-settled share options, the services received 
from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options. The fair value is calculated at grant date using a 
valuation model and recognised in the proﬁ t and loss account, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity, on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of options that will eventually vest. Vesting conditions, 
other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. Market conditions are those conditions that are 
linked to the share price of the Company. 
For equity-settled share award schemes, the fair value is calculated based on the share price at the grant date and, where applicable, 
any  market vesting conditions, and expensed over the vesting period based on the number of shares expected to vest. No expense is 
recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition; 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisﬁ ed, provided that all other 
performance or service conditions are satisﬁ ed. 
The ﬁ nancial effect of share options and awards over its equity shares granted to employees of subsidiary undertakings are recognised 
by the Company in its individual ﬁ nancial statements. In particular, the Company records an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with 
a credit to equity equivalent to the FRS 20 cost in subsidiary undertakings.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modiﬁ ed, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms 
had not been modiﬁ ed, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any modiﬁ cation that increases 
the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneﬁ cial to the employee as measured at the date of 
modiﬁ cation. 
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for 
the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the 
employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the 
date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modiﬁ cation of the original award, as described in the 
previous paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally.
Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 143
Parent Company Financial Statements
For cash-settled share awards, the services received from employees are measured at the fair value of the liability and recognised in the 
proﬁ t and loss account on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date 
and at the date of settlement with changes in fair value recognised in the proﬁ t and loss account.
In accordance with the transitional arrangements in FRS 20 (IFRS 2), Share-based Payment, the requirements of FRS 20 have not been 
applied to equity instruments granted on or before 7 November 2002 and those vesting before 1 January 2005. 
Treasury shares
Own equity instruments which are re-acquired (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in proﬁ t or loss 
on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Treasury shares are purchased and held by the 
Employee Share Trust to meet future distributions of shares to employees under the Group’s various share option and share award 
schemes.
Dividend income  
Revenue is recognised when the Company’s right to receive payment is established.
2 Proﬁ t attributable to the Parent Company
The proﬁ t dealt with in the accounts of the Parent Company, Invensys plc, is £54 million (2012: £95 million). In accordance with the 
exemption granted under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate proﬁ t and loss account for the Company has not been 
presented.
3 Fees for audit and other services
Fees paid to the Company’s auditor for the audit of the Financial Statements were £0.1 million (2012: £0.1 million). 
Fees paid to the Company’s auditor for non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the Company Financial Statements 
of Invensys plc because the Group Financial Statements are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.

8 Financial instruments
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 29, Financial Instruments: Disclosure, for the Parent Company 
Financial Statements.
9 Pensions and post-retirement beneﬁ ts  
The Company operates one unfunded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme. The last full valuation of the scheme on an FRS 17 (IAS 19) basis 
has been updated to 31 March 2013, to reﬂ ect market conditions and material events in the plan.
The Company also participates in the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK), which is the principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK 
employees. The Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) is a funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme. However, the Company is unable to separately 
identify on a consistent and reasonable basis its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme to 
which it participates, mainly because of the difﬁ culty in obtaining accurate information for disposed companies and the subjective nature 
of any allocation basis. Therefore, the Company accounts for this scheme as a deﬁ ned contribution scheme, in accordance with the 
provisions of FRS 17 . The scheme is currently in deﬁ cit on an IAS 19 basis using the projected credit actuarial valuation method to 
determine the scheme’s liabilities. Details of the scheme, its deﬁ cit and its princip al sensitivities are included in Note 25 to the Group 
Financial Statements in accordance with the accounting and disclosure requirements of IAS 19, which are generally equivalent to those 
of FRS 17 .
Pension costs in respect of the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) represented contributions payable in the year and amounted to £nil 
(2012: £nil). At 31 March 2013, the outstanding contributions included in creditors were £nil (2012: £nil).

Standard SAPS actuarial mortality tables S1PA were adopted. Based on scheme experience, the probability of death at each age was 
multiplied by 103% for males and 113% for females. Future improvements in life expectancy have been allowed for in line with the 
standard CMI model projections subject to a long -term trend of 1.00% for males and 1.00% for females. These mortality tables are 
consistent with those agreed by the Trustees for the 31 March 2011 formal valuation of the scheme.

12 Commitments and contingencies
Contingent liabilities
The Company has given performance guarantees to certain subsidiaries (and certain former subsidiaries prior to disposal) in the normal 
course of business. Counter-indemnities have been received from purchasers in the case of guarantees given in favour of former 
subsidiaries. 
These performance guarantees include guarantees in respect of lease obligations. As at 31 March 2013, provisions in the Group 
accounts included £7 million (2012: £9 million) in respect of leases guaranteed by the Company.
At the balance sheet date, the directors are not aware of any circumstances that may give rise to a liability to the Company under 
performance guarantees.
The Company is not engaged in nor (so far as the directors are aware) has pending, or is threatened by, or has against it any legal or 
arbitration proceedings which may have a signiﬁ cant effect on its ﬁ nancial position.
13 Share-based payment plans
The Company operates various share schemes under which options and awards are made to employees of the Company and 
employees of its subsidiary undertakings. In respect of the Company’s employees, the options and awards granted and outstanding are 
detailed below. Details for all options and awards granted and outstanding, including those in respect of the employees of subsidiary 
undertakings, are contained in Note 28 to the Group Financial Statements.
(i) Measurement of fair value
Share awards
An ‘adjusted market value’ method of valuation, based on market value at grant date and market-based performance conditions has 
been used to calculate the fair value of all share awards granted during the year.
Share-based payment expense
The Company recognised £10 million (2012: £4 million) related to equity settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
(ii) Executive share options
The Company’s executive share option schemes have expired and are no longer in use. All remaining options lapsed or were exercised 
in  the year ended 31 March 2012, and none remained outstanding in the year ended 31 March 2013. Executive share options included

(iv) Explanation of long-term incentive schemes for senior employees
 Invensys 2007 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan (2007 LTIP)
Grant details
A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to executive directors and senior executives at nil (or nominal) cost. 
Depending on the country in which the participant is resident, the award would be delivered using one of the following mechanisms: 
(a)  a  nominal nil price option award which is a right to acquire shares for a nil or nominal payment (unless the Company determines 
otherwise); (b) a conditional share award; or (c) a cash award (granted in respect of a nominal number of shares). Awards are normally 
subject to a three-year performance period, commencing on the start of the ﬁ nancial year in which the date of award falls.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
Awards are subject to two independent performance conditions. For executive directors: (a) 50% of an award is based on growth in the 
Company’s TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index; and (b) 50% of an 
award is based on the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the Group’s Earnings Per Share. For Group Leadership Team members 
who are not executive directors: (a) 40% of an award is based on growth in the Company’s TSR relative to the constituent companies of 
the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index; and (b) 40% of an award is based on the CAGR in the Group’s Earnings Per 
Share. There are no performance conditions applying to the remaining 20% of an award. For all other participants: (a) 35% of an award is 
based on growth in the Company’s TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index; 
and (b) 35% of an award is based on the CAGR in the Group’s Earnings Per Share. There are no performance conditions applying to the 
remaining 30% of an award. The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to ensure that, as a condition for the vesting of any TSR/
EPS shares, the underlying overall performance of the Company has been satisfactory. Factors that will be taken into account will include 
consistency of earnings and the Group’s cash position over the performance period.
Service requirements: 
If a participant is dismissed for cause before shares are released, the award will be forfeited. If a participant resigns their award will lapse 
unless the Remuneration Committee exercise their discretion. If a participant’s employment ceases for deﬁ ned good leaver reasons or 
any other reason determined at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee the ﬁ nancial performance tests will be measured at the 
normal vesting date and, subject to the outcome of the ﬁ nancial performance tests, the award will be pro-rated based on the period of 
service and released on the normal vesting date.
Scheme use
The 2007 LTIP is used as the Group’s main share-based long-term incentive plan under which share awards are granted. The ﬁ rst grants 
under this plan were made in the year ended 31 March 2008.
Invensys Restricted Share Plan (RSP) 
Grant details
A restricted share plan, whereby awards, to be satisﬁ ed by the transfer of existing issued shares or in cash, are granted to certain senior 
employees at no cost. The vesting period for awards is determined separately for each award. Vesting periods normally fall between one 
and three years. 
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
Awards are not subject to speciﬁ c performance conditions apart from continued employment throughout the vesting period and 
satisfactory personal performance.
Service requirements:
Release of shares is generally subject to continued employment at the relevant date, although shares may be released early, 
on  a  pro -rated basis, in deﬁ ned good leaver cases or for any other reason at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
The plan is operated predominantly for senior executives in special circumstances, such as recruitment and retention situations.
Deferred Share Plan (DSP)
Grant details
Any bonus earned under the Executive Bonus Plan (EBP) from 2007/08 onwards in excess of target performance was paid in deferred 
shares, with any bonus earned up to the target performance being paid in cash. The shares would be released to the individual after 
three years, in the case of executive directors, and two years for all other participants. From 2008/09 onwards, the DSP is only used for 
executive directors and members of the Group Leadership Team; in all other respects the same terms apply as outlined in the previous 
paragraph. All awards are satisﬁ ed by the transfer of existing issued shares.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
The amount of shares granted is set by reference to the performance targets speciﬁ ed for the executive in the EBP .
Service requirements:
Save where a participant is dismissed for cause before the relevant release date, shares under award will be released to participants on 
the release date, unless the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion should decide on a different release date.
Scheme use
From 2008/09 onwards, where applicable, bonus in excess of target performance is only paid in deferred shares to executive directors 
and members of the Group Leadership Team. Bonus payments for all other members of the EBP are paid entirely in cash. Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 www.invensys.com 151

14 Deferred income tax assets
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that proﬁ t will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
A deferred income tax asset has not been recognised on temporary differences of £33 million with a tax value of £8 million 
(2012: £31 million with a tax value of £7 million) in respect of pension obligations.
The Company has unrecognised income tax losses of £51 million with a tax value of £12 million (2012: £51 million with a tax value of 
£12 million) available for offset against future proﬁ ts.
The Company has unrecognised capital losses of £50 million (2012: £50 million) that are only available for offset against future capital 
gains. These capital losses may be carried forward indeﬁ nitely.
The standard rate of UK corporation tax has reduced to 23% from 1 April 2013 and is expected to reduce to 20% with effect from 
1 April 2015. The impact of the rate change to 20% would reduce the total unrecognised deferred income tax assets by £4 million.
15 Events after the balance sheet date
Return of cash
The Group proposes to return cash to shareholders of £625 million (around 76 pence per share) from the proceeds of the sale of Invensys 
Rail, subject to the approval of Invensys shareholders at a General Meeting which is expected to take place in June 2013. It is proposed 
that the return of cash will be followed by a share capital consolidation. The return of cash will be accounted for in the year ending 
31  March 2014 as a reduction in retained earnings.
Bank facilities
Following the completion of the sale of Invensys Rail on 2 May 2013, the Group’s revolving credit facility was reduced by £100 million 
to  £150 million. The Group’s guarantee facility remains at £350 million. 152  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Our market -leading Wonderware real-time

Annual General Meeting
The AGM is the Company’s principal forum for communication with 
private shareholders. Investors holding shares in the Company through 
a nominee service should arrange to be appointed as a corporate 
representative or proxy in respect of their shareholding in order to attend 
and vote at the meeting. The 2013 AGM will be held on Thursday 25 July 
2013 at 11.00am at The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, Broad 
Sanctuary, Westminster, London SW1P 3EE.
ShareGift
Shareholders with small holdings of shares who do not wish to 
sell  such  shares because the sales commission applied would be 
disproportionate to the sale price may consider donating them to 
charity. The Orr Mackintosh Foundation operates a charity share 
donation scheme, ShareGift.
ShareGift can be contacted at 17 Carlton House Terrace, 
London SW1Y 5AH or by telephone on +44 (0)20 7930 3737 
or online at www.sharegift.org
Dividend
The Board has recommended a ﬁ nal dividend of 2.85 pence per share, 
amounting to £23 million, which brings the total dividends payable in 
respect of the year ended 31 March 2013 to 4.6 pence per share (2012: 
4.4 pence per share), an increase of 5%. The amount paid per share 
could increase dependent upon the share capital consolidation as 
detailed below.
If the return of cash to shareholders and subsequent share capital 
consolidation are approved by shareholders and take place as planned, 
the Board has recommended that the total amount of the ﬁ nal dividend 
will remain the same, £23 million, but will be paid on the smaller number 
of shares in issue resulting from the share consolidation. Therefore the 
amount paid per share would increase and details of these changes will 
be set out in the circular to shareholders to be issued regarding the 
return of cash.
Shareholder Information  158  Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Shareholder Information continued
The Company decided to introduce a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) 
in 2011, which enables shareholders to reinvest their dividends directly 
into Invensys shares. For further information on the DRIP please contact 
Equiniti. The Company will issue a consolidated tax voucher to those 
shareholders who receive dividends direct to their bank accounts. This 
will be issued in December of each year when the interim dividend (if 
any) is normally paid, unless shareholders advise the registrars in writing 
that they wish to receive a separate tax voucher with each dividend 
payment. Institutions and other companies that hold shares in the 
Company will continue to receive a tax voucher for each dividend 
payment.
As dividends are currently only paid in sterling, for overseas 
shareholders with small shareholdings it may not be economically 
viable for them to convert sterling payments into their local currency. 
Shareholders can, should they so wish, arrange for their dividends to 
be paid to a charity in the UK. ShareGift is a UK registered charity which 
takes unwanted shares and donations and uses the proceeds to make 
donations to a wide range of other UK registered charities.
In order to donate outstanding dividend payments to charity, 
shareholders need to send a signed letter of authority to Equiniti asking 
them to make all outstanding payments payable to ShareGift or another 
charity. If not ShareGift, the charity’s full name and address needs to be 
included.
For future dividends, if shareholders wish for these to be paid direct to 
ShareGift, this needs to be clearly stated in their letter of authority. For 
all other charities, shareholders will need to include the charity’s bank 
account details to enable the payments to be made by Equiniti via 
BACS.
Identity theft
Criminals may steal your personal information, putting your 
shareholding at risk. Tips on protecting your shareholding:
• Ensure all your certiﬁ cates are kept in a safe place or hold your shares 
electronically in CREST via a nominee 
• Keep all correspondence from the registrars which shows your 
shareholder reference number in a safe place, or destroy 
correspondence by shredding 
• If you change address, inform the registrars. If you receive a letter

Warning to shareholders
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their 
shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters which imply a connection to the 
company concerned. These are typically from overseas-based 
 “brokers ” who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what often 
turn out to be worthless or high-risk shares in US or UK investments.
They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive ; the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) has found that the average amount lost by 
investors is £20,000, with around £200 million lost in the UK each year. 
It is not just the novice investor who has been duped in this way: many 
of the victims had been successfully investing for several years. 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, 
offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free reports about the 
Company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
• Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation 
and make a record of any other information they give you (e.g. 
telephone number, address, etc.) 
• Check that they are properly authorised by the FCA before getting 
involved. You can check at 
www.fca.org.uk/ﬁ rms/systems-reporting/register 
• The FCA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised overseas 
ﬁ rms who are targeting or have targeted UK investors, and any 
approach from such organisations should be reported to the FCA, so 
that this list can be kept up-to-date and any other appropriate action 
can be considered 
• If you deal with an unauthorised ﬁ rm, you would not be eligible to 
receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme. The FCA can be contacted on their Consumer Helpline on 
0800 111 6768 and more information can be found on the FCA 
website www.fca.org.uk/consumers/protect-yourself/
report-an-unauthorised-ﬁ rm
• Inform the Company’s registrars on 0871 384 2036. They are not able 
to investigate such incidents themselves but will record the details 
and pass them on to the Company and liaise with the FCA 
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company endorses will be 
included in Company mailings.

The business: 
We are Britain’s largest  
operator in the installation and 
maintenance of domestic central 
heating and gas appliances 
employing around 9,500 
engineers. We also provide 
comprehensive maintenance 
and breakdown services for 
electrical white goods, home 
wiring and, through our Dyno 
brand, drains, plumbing and 
home security services. 
The market and our position:  
We have seen a rise in 
competition in the contract 
cover market, from insurance 
and other energy companies. 
We have ensured we are 
offering customers greater 
choice by growing our range of 
products outside the original 
central heating care range. Our 
performance in the emergency 
‘on demand’ market remains 
strong with over 65% of call outs 
converting to a contractual 
product. As energy prices rise 
and concern about emissions 
increases, new technologies 
become more attractive, and 
interest in home energy 
efficiency increases. So we 
expect customer demand to 
grow significantly for more 
integrated propositions. In 2008 
we supported British Gas 
Residential in the launch of a 
bundled product, Dual Fuel 
Extra, and aim to expand such 
cross-selling during 2009.
The business: 
We are the biggest energy 
supplier in Britain’s domestic 
market. Operating under our 
British Gas brand (Scottish Gas 
in Scotland), we had 15.6 million 
gas and electricity customer 
accounts at the end of 2008, 
representing just over 40% of 
the gas market and 20% of the 
electricity market.
The market and our position:  
British Gas Residential operates 
in the fully competitive energy 
supply market in Britain. 
Competitive positioning is based 
on brand recognition, the range 
of product propositions on offer, 
customer service quality, and 
retail price. The market has 
strong regulatory oversight.  
The deteriorating economic 
environment and unprecedented 
volatility in wholesale energy 
prices has led to increased focus 
on energy bills and the need for 
additional support for those 
defined as fuel poor. 
British Gas has the largest 
programme in Britain to support 
vulnerable and in-need 
customers. Our range of 
fixed-price products has proved 
popular with customers seeking 
stability and certainty in their 
future energy bills. We now have 
over 3.5 million customers on 
fixed-price deals.
www.britishgas.co.uk www.britishgasbusiness.co.uk www.britishgas.co.uk
The business: 
We are Britain’s leading supplier 
of energy to businesses, from 
small to medium-sized 
enterprises (SME) through to 
large industrial and commercial 
users. We offer a range of 
options from open tariffs to 
fixed-price contracts, and by  
the end of 2008 we had over  
1 million customer supply points.
The market and our position:  
The business market is highly 
sophisticated and there has been 
a rise in intermediaries – advisers 
who help customers manage the 
impact of volatile energy prices. 
With the prospect of tighter 
regulation around businesses’ 
carbon emissions, we will be 
offering help to our customers to 
cut their energy usage and 
reduce their carbon footprint. 
British Gas Business has a loyal 
customer base in part due to 
our dedicated account manager 
service, which provides a 
personalised customer service. 
Our recent acquisition of BMSi 
(an installer of specialist control 
systems to improve energy 
efficiency in commercial 
buildings) has added to the 
range of services that we  
can offer.
The business: 
British Gas New Energy (BGNE) 
was established in 2007 to  
offer low-carbon solutions to 
customers. We now supply 
more energy efficiency products, 
such as insulation, than any 
other UK utility. We provide 
advice on saving energy and 
install a range of renewable and 
low-carbon microgeneration such 
as solar panels and heat pumps. 
We also provide two industry 
leading green energy tariffs.
The market and our position:  
Many consumers understand 
that better energy efficiency  
and using cleaner energy are 
priorities in tackling climate 
change. This also remains a high 
political priority, with increasing 
Government policies to reduce 
carbon emissions from homes 
and businesses. We have 
responded to this evolving 
market by developing a range of 
low-carbon customer solutions. 
During 2008, more than half a 
million customers completed  
our Energy Savers Report. The 
energy efficiency measures we 
provided to homes delivered 
lifetime carbon savings of 17.87 
million tonnes. We acquired  
a business that designs and 
installs solar photovoltaic 
systems and a low-carbon 
consulting business. We gained 
exclusive distribution rights for 
several combined heat and 
power technologies and invested 
in one of these developers.

The business: 
We provide energy and 
energy-related services to 
residential and business 
customers in Texas and the 
north and east of the United 
States, as well as across 
Canada. We own and operate 
approximately 3,000 natural gas 
wells in Alberta while in Texas, 
we own three gas-fired power 
plants and have power 
purchase agreements totalling 
813MW of wind power.
The market and our position:  
North America has seen a year 
of change during 2008; energy 
markets have been affected by 
volatile wholesale gas prices 
and the economic downturn. On 
top of this, deregulation 
continues to be a hot topic with 
potential changes to carbon 
legislation under the new 
Obama administration. We are 
continuing to invest to grow and 
in 2008 acquired upstream gas 
assets from Rockyview and 
TransGlobe Energy in Canada. 
We also added to our customer 
base in the United States 
through the purchase of 
Strategic Energy. This makes 
Direct Energy one of North 
America’s largest energy and 
energy-related services 
providers with more than 5 
million customer relationships.

  including joint ventures and associates, stated net of interest and taxation,  
and before exceptional items and certain re-measurements
The business: 
We are involved in power 
generation, energy management 
and retail energy supply in 
Europe, with operations in 
Belgium, Germany, The 
Netherlands and Spain.
The market and our position:  
The European energy landscape 
is continuing its slow 
transformation, with ongoing 
merger and acquisition activity, 
significant evolution of wholesale 
markets, and increased 
unbundling activity, most notably 
in Germany and The Netherlands. 
Regulatory changes have also led 
to further unbundling and 
restructuring in Belgium, where in 
January 2009 we increased our 
shareholding in the generation 
and supply company SPE to  
a controlling 51%.
We are well positioned to take 
advantage of opportunities that 
may emerge in Europe. However 
the pace of deregulation is key 
and the returns will need to  
be competitive with other 
opportunities across the Group. 
The business: 
We source gas and electricity 
from our own production and 
from third parties, mainly to 
supply British Gas Residential 
and British Gas Business. Our 
gas fields can supply around 
29% of our UK gas requirements, 
and we produce around 58% of 
our peak electricity requirements 
from our seven gas-fired power 
stations, four wind farms and 
major contracts.
The market and our position:  
Both oil and gas prices saw 
record highs during 2008, and 
the UK power market tightened 
sharply with capacity shortfalls 
due to station outages in the UK 
fleet. We are investing in new 
gas assets by acquiring more 
fields in the North Sea, and  
also in developing our power 
generation and renewables 
fleet. Our Langage power 
station (one of the UK’s cleanest 
fossil-fuelled power plants) is 
due to begin operation in 2009, 
and our investment programme 
to develop renewable energy 
from offshore and onshore wind 
farms is progressing. We have 
enough import capacity at the 
Isle of Grain liquefied natural  
gas (LNG) terminal to supply 
over 10% of our annual gas 
requirement, and have also 
announced our intention to 
acquire a 25% stake in the 
nuclear generator British 
Energy, which would add 
significantly to our portfolio.
The business: 
Centrica Storage operates the 
Rough storage facility which is 
the largest in the UK providing 
approximately 70% of current 
UK storage capacity. It consists 
of a partially depleted gas field 
under the North Sea, supported 
by a gas processing terminal at 
Easington, which we also 
manage. We sell gas storage 
and other services to Centrica 
Energy and a range of third 
parties. Centrica Storage  
also operates the Langeled 
terminal receiving Norwegian 
gas from the world’s longest 
undersea pipeline.
The market and our position:  
With the UK rapidly becoming 
more dependent on imported 
gas, increasing the country’s 
gas storage capacity is essential 
in order to ensure security of 
supply. To meet these future 
requirements and develop 
Centrica Storage into a 
multi-asset, multi-product 
business we are planning to 
convert the largely depleted 
Bains gas field (near our 
Morecambe Bay fields) into  
a storage facility and have  
also acquired the onshore 
Caythorpe gas storage project 
in East Yorkshire. 
In February 2009 we announced 
our intention to create an 
additional 60bcf gas storage field 
in the UK North Sea following the 
acquisition of a 70% share in the 
Baird gas field.

Chairman’s 
Statement
Performing well  
in a difficult year
Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
Against this backdrop Centrica’s financial performance in the year 
was good, with the higher upstream profits providing a partial 
hedge to the inevitable decline in retail profits during this time. We 
also made further progress on our strategic agenda which places 
Centrica on a much stronger footing both at home and abroad.
The sharp rises in world energy prices necessitated two retail price 
increases for UK consumers. We concentrated on providing some 
protection for our customers by reducing our operating costs 
through efficiency improvements, transforming the level of service 
we offer and increasing the support we provide to our vulnerable 
customers. Cost rigour was also evident across the rest of the 
Group as we reduced like-for-like operating costs against 2007.
In September we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding 
with EDF to acquire a 25% stake in the British Energy nuclear 
business. This potential investment is intended to provide a 
long-term hedge against volatile commodity prices and a platform 
for longer-term involvement in new nuclear power generation as a 
valuable source of growth. Beyond this we made further acquisitions 
of gas reserves in the North Sea and in North America. We also 
announced our intention, subject to successful studies, to build 
additional gas storage facilities which will help provide important 
additional security of supply for the UK.
In the year we delivered excellent results in our growth businesses. 
British Gas Business and British Gas Services once again reported 
strong growth in revenue and operating profit. In North America the 
economic climate proved challenging but the business held up well 
and also delivered a good performance.
In Europe we strengthened our presence by acquiring a controlling 
interest in SPE in Belgium. However in The Netherlands, where the 
market continues to favour integrated incumbents, Oxxio did not 
perform well and we have written down its carrying value.
Dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing a final dividend of 8.73 pence 
per share to be paid in June 2009, bringing our full year dividend  
to 12.2 pence, an increase of 5.4%. This is in line with our policy  
of delivering sustained real growth in the ordinary dividend.
Board changes
In March we announced the appointment of Mark Hanafin as 
Managing Director Centrica Energy and Europe, replacing Jake 
Ulrich. I would like to thank Jake for the dedication he has shown 
since the formation of Centrica in 1997 and the material 
contribution he has made in building our portfolio of gas, power 
and storage assets. Mark joined us from Shell where he was 
president and chief executive officer of Shell Energy North America.
“  We remain focused on 
delivering stability and 
growth in Centrica  
for the benefit of our 
customers, employees 
and shareholders.”
Centrica performed well in 2008, during what was a very difficult year 
for energy supply businesses. We witnessed previously unseen levels 
of volatility in wholesale gas and power prices. Oil prices rose to 
almost $150 per barrel and then fell back to below $50 as the high 
levels of global oil demand, which had been causing a tight supply 
position, reversed quite rapidly due to the recessionary impact of the 
global financial crisis. 06

In February 2009 we announced some changes to the business 
structure within Centrica and to the Executive Committee and  
the Board. We have combined British Gas Residential, British Gas 
Business and British Gas Services into a single customer-focused 
British Gas retail operation to maximise the value and growth 
potential. Phil Bentley assumes responsibility for the combined 
business with immediate effect. Phil remains a Director of  
Centrica plc.
Deryk King, President and Chief Executive Officer of Direct Energy 
and a member of Centrica’s Executive Committee, has decided  
to retire and will leave his position with Direct Energy in July 2009, 
and subsequently depart from Centrica at the end of 2009. Deryk 
has built a very successful business for Centrica in North America 
over the last eight years. Deryk will be succeeded by Chris Weston 
who will take over as President and Chief Executive Officer of  
Direct Energy on 1 July 2009, after a period of handover. Over  
the last three years Chris transformed the operating and financial 
performance of British Gas Services and previously he headed up 
British Gas Business, our commercial energy supply operation. Chris 
will also join the Board of Directors of Centrica plc on 1 July 2009.
Paul Walsh, a Non-Executive Director of Centrica will step down 
from the Centrica Board at the Annual General Meeting on 11 May 
2009. Paul joined the Board in March 2003. The search for a 
replacement has commenced.
Our employees
In February 2009, British Gas was recognised by The Sunday 
Times as one of the ‘20 Best Big Companies to Work For’ which  
is a significant achievement. Our employees remain central to  
the success of Centrica, particularly during these times of great 
uncertainty and change. I want to thank them for the dedication, 
commitment, loyalty and professionalism which they continue  
to display.
The future
The economic landscape, dominated by the global financial 
squeeze, continues to worsen and Centrica is not immune to the 
effects of this. Energy markets remain volatile and erratic, placing 
pressure on parts of our business and on our customers.
In these challenging conditions the task of management will be  
to ensure we provide good service and competitive prices to all, 
support for the most vulnerable, a fair return and reward for our 
shareholders and long-term environmentally friendly sources of 
energy supply for the countries that we serve.
In the Chief Executive’s review, Sam Laidlaw outlines the progress 
made to date against the strategic priorities of the Group and the 
direction and actions that will be taken as we look forward in  
2009. In these unpredictable times, Centrica is well positioned,  
with a solid set of energy and services businesses and a strong 
financial position. I am confident that under Sam’s leadership the 
management team will remain focused on delivering stability and 
growth in Centrica for the benefit of our customers, employees  
and shareholders.

Chief 
Executive’s 
Review
It has been a year of extraordinary turbulence in the 
commodity markets. During the first half of the year we 
experienced volatile and rapidly rising global oil and gas 
prices driven primarily by growing demand in Asia. In the 
second half the sharp contraction of credit markets caused 
a collapse of worldwide oil demand and the oil price.  
By the end of the year this started to feed through into  
a softening of the wholesale gas price. Although Centrica 
has navigated well through this market upheaval our 
profitability has been impacted with the upstream 
benefiting at the expense of downstream margins.
Only five years ago the energy environment in which we operate 
was very different to the one that we are in today. Then, wholesale 
gas markets were reasonably stable, security of supply was a 
distant concern with the UK self-sufficient in gas and exporting  
its excess to the continent – and new nuclear power was not 
universally welcome.
A great deal has changed.
Even though energy prices have softened as a result of the 
recession, the long-term trend remains upwards driven by  
the industrialisation of Asia, the increased costs of oil and gas 
extraction, political uncertainties surrounding sources of supply  
and the need to decarbonise our economies to meet the challenge 
of climate change. In the UK, domestic oil and gas production 
continues to decline and our import dependency is growing 
sharply. The power generation fleet is ageing and needs replacing 
with low-carbon technologies. In the US the new Obama 
administration has placed a high priority on meeting the challenge 
of climate change which, as in Europe, will place an additional but 
necessary cost on the consumer.
Taken together the triple challenges of ensuring security of supply, 
minimising climate change and providing affordable energy pose 
profound questions for the whole of the energy industry. There are 
no easy – or cheap – answers, although energy efficiency has a 
vital role to play. What is clear is that unprecedented levels of 
investment will be required over the next two decades to meet 
these challenges.
Gas
The UK is increasingly reliant on imports. Some 35% of UK gas 
was imported in 2008, and it is estimated that 70% will be imported 
by 2015. Demand for gas remains at high levels globally, despite 
the economic recession and the UK has to compete in the global 
marketplace. So Centrica is investing in new gas assets in the 
British and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea.
We are also investing in contracts and UK infrastructure to enable 
us to import increasing amounts of liquefied natural gas (LNG).  
In January 2009, we received the largest shipment of LNG ever 
delivered to the UK. But LNG is also a global product and the  
UK and Europe are competing with Asia and North America for 
LNG supplies.
Going forward, as additional LNG production comes on-stream 
and an increasing number of players enter the market, we will be 
pursuing a range of sourcing strategies.
Price volatility and supply constraints can be eased through storing 
gas bought during periods of low demand. The UK has relatively 
limited storage – we have around 16 days of gas storage compared 
to about 77 in Germany and 88 in France – and so this is another 
area in which Centrica is investing.
Power
The European Union and national governments are imposing  
strict limits on CO2 emissions and stretching targets for the use  
of renewable energy. The European Renewables Directive, for 
example, will bind the UK to a 15% renewables target by 2020.  
The UK Government has suggested that this is likely to mean up  
to 30–35% of electricity could come from renewable sources 
compared with less than 5% today. According to the Government,  
this will require around £100 billion of investment.
However, renewables alone will not be able to fill the medium- 
term supply gap. The alternatives are gas, coal or nuclear  
power stations.
We are close to completing the first gas-fired power station to be 
built in the UK for almost five years, at a cost of £400 million and 
expect this to begin commercial operation later in 2009. We also 
“  Centrica once again 
delivered a good financial 
performance in a year

test for the business.”

firmly believe that a vital longer-term contributor to energy security 
in a low-carbon world is new nuclear capacity. Much of the existing 
nuclear generation fleet will be retired over the next 15 years, and 
the replacement process has a very long lead time so decisions 
need to be made today. Our Rights Issue in December has 
provided the resources to enable us to be actively involved  
in this market.
Centrica’s strategy needs to be able to address the complex issues 
that the industry faces, and to do so in ways that can deliver 
sustainable value for our shareholders. This requires us to manage 
all of the risks and opportunities we are facing with a clear vision 
and an understanding of where our corporate responsibilities lie. 
Our strategy must be able to respond appropriately to the needs of 
our vulnerable customers, to ensure the health and safety of our 
customers and employees, as well as meeting the challenges of 
security of supply and climate change.
I believe that it can, and that in seeking to create an integrated 
energy company, operating upstream by developing new sources 
of gas and power, and downstream with strong brands and 
innovative propositions, we have a robust approach to meeting  
the challenges ahead.
We have continued to operate the business in line with the strategic 
priorities we set at the end of 2006, and report on those over the 
next pages. In short the increasing extent of vertical integration in 
Centrica, the emphasis on operational excellence, the reduction of 
our cost base and the improvement in our customer service meant 
that we ended 2008 with a stronger business and momentum for 
the future.
PRIORITy 1 – T RANSFORM BRITISh GAS
British Gas Residential is the core of our business, and  
it needs to deliver consistently high levels of service and 
profitability if we are to succeed. 
The transformation, therefore, aims to: 
•  improve our price competitiveness, service levels and 
product offer
•  reduce our costs through ‘best-in-class’ productivity 
while remaining a great place to work
• achieve long-term margins of 6–7%
The progress we’ve made 
During 2008 our customer service improved significantly. Average 
time to answer and to handle calls reduced further and our 
proportion of industry complaint levels fell by nearly a third over  
the year. Compared to 2007 we also increased the percentage  
of customer enquiries which were resolved on the first call and 
substantially reduced the transactional exceptions associated with 
the new billing system. These service improvements enabled further 
progress to be made on our cost reduction initiatives. Our operating 
cost base in 2008 was over £200 million lower than in 2006.
In October Ofgem published the initial findings of its probe into  
the energy supply industry in Britain. The report concluded that 
effective competition exists between the major suppliers. However, 
it did make recommendations to reduce certain retail price 
differentials, particularly relating to former incumbent electricity 
suppliers who charge different prices for in-area and out-of-area 
customers. It also suggested a reduction in tariffs for those 
customers with a prepayment meter, to more accurately reflect the 
additional cost involved in supplying those customers. British Gas 
complied with this recommendation in a matter of a few weeks. 
What’s next 
We have created a strong foundation here over the last two years 
and now is the time to take British Gas to the next stage of its 
evolution. Building on our already strong brand in the UK we are 
seeking to deepen the customer relationship by combining the 
energy and services propositions. This will offset the gradual decline 
over time in the use of gas by consumers in the UK as we move to  
a lower carbon economy, and take full advantage of the increasing 
demand for energy efficient products and services. To best achieve 
this we will combine British Gas Residential, British Gas Business 
and British Gas Services into a single customer-focused 
organisation. This will enable us to launch new bundled products 
under the British Gas brand, products that customers want, to 
increase customer loyalty, to further reduce costs and to target even 
more efficiently the substantial support we already provide for our 
vulnerable customers. Phil Bentley, the current Managing Director of 
British Gas Energy, will run this new organisation. Chris Weston, 
current Managing Director of British Gas Services, will take over 
leadership of the Direct Energy business from Deryk King in July 
2009.

PRIORITy 2 – ShARPEN ThE ORGANISATION 
AND REDUCE COSTS
We operate in a highly competitive market – for customers 
at national level and for global sources of energy.
In order to compete in the long term, our organisation has 
to be as lean and efficient as possible, with the people and 
structures that enable us to make the best use of the skills 
and resources we have.
The progress we’ve made 
In July Mark Hanafin joined Centrica as Managing Director Centrica 
Energy and Europe. This further strengthened the executive team. 
Various initiatives in the year across the Group meant that we finished 
2008 as a leaner organisation without affecting our ability to grow. 
This helped to reduce our Group like-for-like operating costs by  
£40 million, despite the inflationary pressures, particularly in the 
offshore services environment.
What’s next 
We have a strong leadership team in place and improved capital 
allocation, risk management and cost control processes, which will 
enable us to drive superior financial and operational performance. 
Going forward, we consider operating cost advantage to be a key 
competitive differentiator for Centrica and we will be relentless in 
the pursuit of further cost reductions, while enabling growth across 
the business. 
PRIORITy 3 – R EDUCE RISK Th ROUGh 
INTEGRATION
We need to produce more of the energy that we sell. In the 
UK, we are only able to supply 29% of our gas requirements 
from our own gas fields and 58% of our peak electricity 
demand from our own generation facilities. The remainder 
has to be bought in highly volatile world markets.
The progress we’ve made 
During the year, we made good progress. We acquired additional 
gas assets in the British and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea.  
In March we increased our equity stake in the assets originally 
acquired from Newfield in 2007 and in October we completed our 
acquisition of assets in the Heimdal area of the North Sea. At the 
end of the year we announced an agreement to acquire an 
additional interest in the Peik gas field in the UK and in January 
2009 we agreed to take additional equity in the York gas field. These 
deals provided us with both producing gas assets and valuable 
exploration and development prospects.
During the year Centrica Storage announced two important 
potential gas storage projects. In March we began engineering 
studies to explore the potential to convert the Bains gas field in the 
Morecambe Bay area into a storage field with a capacity of up to 
20 billion cubic feet (bcf). In September we acquired the Caythorpe 
onshore gas field and began the process of converting it into  
a storage field capable of holding up to 7.5bcf of stored gas.  
In February 2009 we announced our intention to create an 
additional 60bcf gas storage field in the UK North Sea following  
the acquisition of a 70% share in the Baird gas field. 
In power generation we completed the Lynn and Inner Dowsing  
wind farm development off the Lincolnshire coast, the largest 
operational offshore wind farm development in the world. In Devon, 
the construction of the Langage gas-fired power station continued, 
although the contractor has experienced some delays and we now 
expect the station to become operational towards the end of 2009. 
In September we announced the signing of a Memorandum of 
Understanding with EDF to acquire a 25% share in the British 
Energy business. This would add significantly to our upstream 
position and provide us with a long-term hedge against volatile 
wholesale power prices, with access to power where the price  
is not impacted by the cost of oil and gas, and an opportunity  
to grow through new build nuclear construction in the UK.
The proceeds from the successful £2.16 billion Rights Issue 
towards the end of the year provide us with the capital required to 
complete the British Energy transaction and make further material 
progress in increasing the upstream asset base and reducing risk.
Our strategic  
priorities 11
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
What’s next 
We will continue to expand our power generation fleet as part of the 
overall upstream hedge to reduce the exposure to the increasing 
volatility in power prices and spreads. Here we will seek to cover an 
increasing amount of our UK electricity demand load and to grow and 
better align our generation mix with that of our competitors and the 
wider market. As part of this, our discussions with EDF , regarding us 
potentially acquiring 25% of British Energy are continuing. We will also 
pursue external financing to allow us to develop and build on our wind 
farm portfolio, and additional options to grow the size of our 
conventional gas-fired fleet of power stations.
In gas we are continuing to push ahead on reducing our exposure to 
the short-term volatility in wholesale gas prices by acquiring additional 
gas assets and striking gas contracts. In pursuing this we will focus 
most of our asset acquisition activity on the UK and Norwegian 
sectors of the North Sea while also continuing to evaluate LNG 
opportunities. Building closer relationships with National Oil 
Companies, to secure competitive long-term sources of gas for  
our customers, remains firmly on the agenda. 
PRIORITy 4 – BUIl D ON OUR GROWTh 
Pl ATFORMS
Centrica’s growth businesses in the UK, Europe and  
North America have great potential for increasing the 
Group’s profitability.
We are focusing on new opportunities, such as providing 
low-carbon products and services, and increasingly on 
integration in the North American business. This will see us 
concentrate on the geographies and service areas in which 
we are already strong, and support the retail businesses 
through the construction and acquisition of new power assets.
The progress we’ve made 
The financial results in the year show real progress with this priority. 
In British Gas Business and British Gas Services we grew revenue, 
operating profit and customer numbers, while delivering ongoing 
cost efficiencies. In North America we faced a difficult economic 
environment. However here too we increased customer numbers 
and delivered a strong financial result, partially due to favourable 
exchange rate movements. Our acquisition in June of Strategic 
Energy doubled the size of our commercial and industrial (C&I) 
energy supply business and made us the third largest commercial 
supplier of energy in North America. In Europe, in January 2009 we 
completed the acquisition of an additional 25.5% of SPE, giving us a 
valuable controlling stake of 51%. Unfortunately Oxxio, our business 
in The Netherlands, recorded a disappointing loss*. We have taken 
action to stem losses here, including replacing management.
What’s next 
The reorganisation in British Gas provides us with an opportunity  
to increase the overall value of our customer base by expanding  
the overlap between our energy and services businesses through 
bundled offerings under a single brand. In North America we will 
also integrate further by building on the platform we have already 
established and tightening the focus on key geographies. In doing 
this we will establish a centralised service platform which enables 
us to compete more efficiently. With better focus will come a 
greater degree of integration, primarily through the selective 
acquisition and construction of gas and power assets, to provide 
growth opportunities and support for the retail businesses.
In summary 
Following a record 2007 , the financial performance in 2008 was 
good despite a much harsher environment. We made strong 
progress against the strategic priorities we set out at the end of 
2006. The outlook for the global economy remains very challenging 
and in the UK 2009 could be particularly difficult for many of  
our customers, both residential and commercial. We will continue  
to place our customers’ needs at the forefront of our agenda, 
alongside our determination to deliver increasing long-term value  
for our shareholders.

Indicators
Measuring  
our performance
“  These key performance indicators provide us with  
a way of robustly measuring the Group’s progress over 
the long term.” Sam Laidlaw, Chief Executive
Adjusted basic earnings per share (EPS)
EPS is an industry standard determining corporate profitability  
for shareholders. 2007 was an exceptional year as a result of 
favourable commodity prices experienced in the first half of 2007 
which drove profitability in the residential supply business.
Target/commitment – To deliver growth in adjusted EPS  
over a three-year period. This measure is used as one of the 
performance conditions in the Long Term Incentive Scheme, 
outlined on page 46.
FINANCIAl KPIs
Dividends per share
Dividends per share indicate the level of earnings distributed  
to Company shareholders.
The 2008 dividend shows an increase of 5.4% on the  
2007 dividend. 
Target/commitment – To deliver real growth per annum.
*
  Earnings per share and dividend per share figures have been restated to reflect the bonus 
element of the Rights Issue. Details of the Rights Issue are provided in notes 5, 29 and 30.
Total shareholder return (TSR)
The Board continues to believe that to realise the Company’s 
long-term strategic goals, TSR is a valuable key performance 
indicator to assess the Company’s performance in the delivery  
of shareholder value.
Centrica has outperformed the FTSE 100 Index by 43% over  
a five-year period. 
Target/commitment – TSR is utilised as a measure of 
performance in the Company’s Long Term Incentive Scheme, 
outlined on page 46.
This measure of performance is calculated as profit before exceptional 
items and certain re-measurements for the year, attributable to equity 
shareholders of the parent company, divided by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue during the year.
Source: The measure of adjusted EPS is reported on the Group Income 
Statement, part of the audited Financial Statements.
This is the total dividend per share (excluding special dividends) paid  
in respect of each financial year.

Statements.
Total shareholder return measures the return to shareholders in terms of 
the growth of a £100 investment in the Company’s shares, assuming that 
dividends and returns of capital are reinvested. We compare our TSR with 
those of the other 99 members of the FTSE 100 at the start of each 
performance period.

NON-FINANCIAl KPIs
Customer satisfaction
Being responsible and responsive to the needs of our millions  
of customers is central to our business strategy. Once again 
British Gas Services enjoyed strong net promoter scores (NPS) 
and in 2008, Direct Energy increased its NPS score to 6.9% as  
a result of a range of front-line improvements. British Gas’ retail 
energy score reduced in common with the rest of the industry, 
despite significant improvements to customer service. This is 
likely to be a result of two price rises in 2008. 
Target – Continued focus on improving customer service and 
building our brand reputation remains a priority. We will look to 
continue improving on our Direct Energy score and to reverse  
the trend in British Gas customer satisfaction. 
*
  In 2008 we aligned Direct Energy’s NPS calculation with the UK’s. We have recalculated  
Direct Energy’s NPS for 2007 using this methodology.
Employee engagement
We need the commitment of our employees to succeed. 
Measuring commitment and the factors that drive it are now  
the main focus of our employee engagement process, as this 
enables us to benchmark results more robustly. In 2008, there 
was a 94% response rate to our employee engagement survey. 
Commitment scores reached 57% Group-wide. This was well 
above the European average (48%). Engagement scores 
(reported in previous years) also rose to 4.11 in 2008 compared 
to 3.96 in 2007.
Target – The next full survey is in 2010 with a target  
commitment score of 62%. An interim survey will be run  
in 2009 with a target of 60%.
Carbon intensity
Centrica’s power generation fleet has the lowest carbon intensity 
of any major energy supplier in Britain. We maintained this 
leadership position in 2008 when 377 grammes* of carbon dioxide 
were emitted for every kilowatt hour of power we produced.
Our 2008 performance exceeded the 2012 target and we are 
now focusing on the more challenging 2020 target.
Target – To reduce our UK power generation carbon intensity  
to 350g CO2/kWh by 2020.
*
  Carbon intensity figures are based on the average annual emissions from all wholly owned 
UK power generation assets and all other power generation assets from which Centrica is 
entitled to output under site-specific contracts in the UK.
^ 2008 data subject to final verification.
†  Verified 2007 figure restated.
Net promoter score 2008
The net promoter score (NPS) measures customers’ responses to  
the question ‘How likely would you be to recommend us as an energy 
supplier to a friend or relative (0-10)?’ The score is calculated by the 
percentage of customers defined as promoters (scoring 9-10) minus  
the percentage defined as detractors (scoring 0-6).
Source: Internal calculations combining figures for residential,  
business and services divisions. Net promoter scores are collected  
through customer feedback forms and telephone interviews  
conducted by a third party supplier. 
The Centrica employee survey measures how people, from every team at 
all levels across the Group, feel about working for us. Questions include: 
Would you tell others this is a great place to work? Do you ever think about 
leaving? Does the Company inspire you to do your best? 
Source: The survey is managed by an external supplier.
Carbon intensity measures the volume of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted per 
unit of electricity generated. Investing in low-carbon generation, such as 
high-efficiency gas-fired power stations and offshore wind farms, is a key 
part of our business strategy.

Review 
BRITISH GAS RESIDENTIAL
The focus on delivering good customer service, reducing our cost 
base, maximising value from the customer base and providing an 
attractive environment for employees  
has been central to the ongoing transformation of British Gas 
Residential.
British Gas Residential delivered a good financial performance 
during a year of unprecedented volatility in commodity prices. 
Wholesale gas prices peaked in September, having doubled over 
the previous 12 months, before falling over the balance of the year. 
The rapid rise in wholesale energy prices during the first half of the 
year required price rises to customers in January and July in order 
to maintain reasonable profitability. Although there was a short-term 
increase in customer churn, sales of energy accounts remained 
high, with our Fixed Price 2011 proposition proving particularly 
popular in the third quarter of the year. At the end of 2008 we  
were serving 15.6 million accounts, of which 3.6 million had the 
reassurance of a fixed price product. In January 2009, as a result  
of a recent fall in wholesale energy prices and with energy bought 
at high prices in 2008 being partially used up, we announced a 
reduction of 10% in our standard gas tariffs and the introduction  
of a prompt payment discount for our credit customers.
The reorganisation of our business around customers and their 
needs is also having a positive impact. As a result of efficiency 
savings made through the focus on these lines of business we 
announced a reduction in the standard retail tariff for prepayment 
customers in November. This made us the first supplier to comply 
with the key recommendations of the Ofgem probe, published  
in October. 
British Gas also continued to demonstrate industry leadership in 
supporting those customers less able to pay their fuel bills. Energy 
suppliers reached a voluntary agreement with Government in April 
2008 to increase their collective spend on social programmes. 
British Gas has the largest commitment of all suppliers, £34 million 
during 2008/9, and with over 500,000 customers on our Essentials 
tariff, the UK’s largest social tariff, we will spend more than  
double this amount to support the most vulnerable or in-need  
of our customers. 
In July we launched our priority response product in conjunction 
with British Gas Services, Dual Fuel Extra. This gives around 
500,000 of our highest consuming energy customers access to our 
priority response emergency central heating breakdown product. 
Early analysis indicates that this is increasing the loyalty of this 
group of customers.
Compared to 2007 the volume of incoming calls was 22% lower, 
reflecting improved internal processes and increased resolution of 
customer queries during the first contact which has reduced the 
level of repeat calls. These improvements also resulted in our share 
of Ombudsman’s complaints falling to 25%, lower than our overall 
energy market share. After the price rise announced in July there 
was a temporary deterioration in our average speed to answer 
telephone calls. However by December these were back down  
to levels seen earlier in 2008. 
In February 2009 British Gas was recognised by The Sunday Times 
as one of the ‘20 Best Big Companies to Work For’, for the first 
time, an extremely pleasing and important accolade for a business 
where employee engagement is central to performance.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
Revenue in the year was up by 20% to £7,769 million (2007:  
£6,457 million) as a result of the effect of higher average selling 
prices during the period, which were partially offset by slightly  
lower customer numbers.
With rapidly escalating wholesale gas prices, operating profit* was 
down by 34% to £379 million (2007: £571 million). This translated to 
a 4.9% margin (2007: 8.8%) and profit was reasonably even across 
the two halves of the year. Commodity costs increased 
year-on-year by 43% to £4,799 million (2007: £3,352 million) and 
there were also increases in transmission and metering costs of 7% 
to £1,862 million (2007: £1,734 million). The Carbon Emissions 
Reduction Target (CERT) replaced the Energy Efficiency 
Commitment (EEC) in April, doubling the obligation on UK energy 
suppliers. In September the Government announced its intention to 
expand the industry CERT target by a further 20% bringing the 
overall three-year target to £3.4 billion, and also announced the 
Community Energy Saving Programme (CESP), aimed at both 
suppliers and generators, which is expected to cost the industry 
£350 million over the next three years. 
Operating costs fell by 9% to £729 million (2007: £800 million). 
Savings were made in our sales and support functions and in our 
call centres following lower incoming call volume. Net charges for 
bad debts were broadly unchanged as credits resulting from 
progress made in our debt collection processes and the ongoing 
improvements in the billing system allowed us to offset an 
underlying increase in bad debt costs. However, given the current 
economic pressures facing our customers and the higher retail 
tariffs, we expect our bad debt charge to increase in 2009.
Looking forward as we combine British Gas Residential, British Gas 
Services and British Gas Business, we expect to offer attractive 
energy efficiency products to customers, further increase customer 
loyalty and continue to reduce our cost base.

BRITISh GAS BUSINESS
Innovative propositions, such as dedicated account 
managers, have helped British Gas Business to grow by 
maintaining high levels of customer service, customer 
satisfaction and customer retention.
Despite challenging wholesale energy market conditions, British 
Gas Business delivered a very strong financial result and  
continued to grow its overall customer base. By the end of 2008  
we were supplying over 1 million customer supply points. This 
included the addition of two small customer blocks. In October  
we successfully tendered for 37 ,000 SME electricity accounts,  
of which 26,000 had been retained at the year end, as part of 
Ofgem’s supplier of last resort process, following the collapse of 
E4B. In November we added a further 39,000 electricity accounts 
through the acquisition for £3.5 million of BizzEnergy’s customer 
base from the administrators of this privately owned energy 
supplier. In October we also announced the acquisition of BMSi, 
which increases our presence in the UK’s expanding commercial 
energy-related services market.
Revenue for the year was up by 26% to £3,063 million (2007: 
£2,431 million), reflecting tariff increases and higher contract 
renewal rates following the increases experienced in wholesale 
input energy costs, combined with higher average customer 
numbers and increased consumption in both gas and power.
Service levels across the business remain high. First time resolution 
of customer queries continued to improve, resulting in fewer repeat 
calls and higher satisfaction levels across the commercial customer 
base. Customer retention in both larger commercial and SME 
customers also remained high. For the fourth year running British 
Gas Business was recognised as one of the UK’s Top 50 ‘Best 
Workplaces’ by the Financial Times.
Operating profit* for the year increased by 19% to £143 million 
(2007: £120 million). This was due to the maintenance of our gross 
margins and the identification of further operating cost efficiencies, 
including the renegotiation of our commercial broker fee structure. 
As a result our operating costs as a percentage of gross margin 
decreased to 62% (2007: 72%).

BRITISh GAS SERVICES 
By responding to new customer needs with new  
products and better service delivery, British Gas Services 
has increased its customer base and financial performance. 
It is a growth business that is growing strongly.
British Gas Services delivered a strong overall performance  
in 2008 as we continued to reinforce and grow the business 
through high levels of customer service and a greater contribution 
from the growing range of products beyond the original central 
heating care range. 
Revenue was up by 5% at £1,349 million (2007: £1,279 million)  
with particularly strong customer growth in our Plumbing and 
Drains and Home Electrical Care products, up by 6% and 11% 
respectively. By the end of the year we had increased the total 
number of customer product relationships by 5% to 8.1 million 
(2007: 7.6 million).
Our continued investment and commitment to high levels of 
customer service remained key to this growth. The overall level  
of service at our call centres and customer retention rates across 
most of our product range remained above prior year levels and the 
effectiveness of our engineers also improved. We introduced a new 
self-service online facility for our customers to book their annual 
service visits, and uptake to date has been encouraging. Service 
levels at our new National Distribution Centre (NDC), which 
underpins our overnight parts delivery commitment, have been 
high at 99%.
During the year we extended our range of services with the 
introduction of new insurance-based products that provide cover 
for water supply pipes and more general home emergencies.  
By December we had sold over 130,000 of these products. Our 
performance in the on-demand market remains strong, with over 
65% of these customers subsequently converting to a contractual 
product. We also supported the launch of a bundled product,  
Dual Fuel Extra, in conjunction with British Gas Residential, which 
should enable us to deepen our relationship with those customers 
most valuable to British Gas.
Despite worsening economic conditions our Central Heating 
Installations business maintained activity at near 2007 levels, with 
111,000 installations. Following the restructuring of this business 
and a major operation to minimise overheads and supply costs  
we improved operating profit substantially.
Overall operating profit* increased by 29% to £195 million (2007: 
£151 million), reflecting the continued strong growth of our higher 
margin secondary care products, improved efficiency and cost 
reductions across the business. Over the year targeted initiatives 
delivered £25 million of cost reductions. Operating costs as a 
percentage of gross margin decreased to 69% (2007: 74%) and  
the operating margin percentage rose to 14.5% (2007: 11.8%).

EUROPEAN ENERGy
We are involved in power generation, energy management 
and retail energy supply in mainland Europe, where the 
development of a fully competitive energy market would 
provide significant growth opportunities.
Our European businesses experienced tough wholesale market 
conditions during 2008, reporting an operating loss* of £56 million 
(2007: operating profit* £17 million).
In Belgium, SPE continued to grow its customer base and now 
supplies over 1.5 million customers (2007: 1.4 million). Earnings, 
after tax and interest, of £8 million were in line with last year. In 
January 2009 we completed our acquisition from GdF of their 
25.5% stake in SPE for an initial price of €515 million, giving us  
a controlling stake of 51%. On 23 February 2009 the first tranche  
of the PE2 agreement came into effect, giving SPE access to  
a further 250MW of nuclear power and triggering the payment  
to GdF of deferred consideration of €70 million (£65 million). 
Additional deferred consideration of up to €35 million is also 
payable contingent upon the approval of the second tranche  
of PE2, under which SPE would acquire access to an additional 
285MW of discounted power output.
In The Netherlands, Oxxio faced highly volatile commodity prices 
and struggled to compete against vertically integrated incumbent 
players. Customer numbers fell slightly as a result and underlying 
trading results were weak. In addition, we experienced operational 
challenges, with the business suffering a billing backlog and 
overruns in procurement costs, both of which resulted in significant 
additional charges within the 2008 results. The operating loss* for  
the year was £63 million (2007: operating profit* £3 million). We have 
taken action to address the internal issues within the business, 
including putting a new management team in place, and progress 
has now been made in improving operational performance. In light 
of the 2008 loss, the carrying value of the goodwill associated  
with Oxxio has been written down by £45 million. This has been  
charged as an exceptional item which totalled £67 million, the 
remaining £22 million being a write-down of a receivable relating  
to historic overpayments of energy revenue tax where recovery is 
now uncertain.
In Spain and Germany changes during the year to the regulatory 
regimes were helpful to our businesses. In Spain the high voltage 
regulated tariff was removed allowing Centrica Energía, one of  
only three 100% green suppliers in the country, to make further 
progress in the high voltage power market. In Germany the 
restructure of the historic gas supply areas and the implementation 
of a new gas balancing regime were helpful.

BRITISh GAS NEW ENERGy
As the UK moves towards a low-carbon future British Gas 
New Energy was established to develop a range of 
low-carbon solutions for homes and businesses. We 
provide energy efficiency and microgeneration products 
and services to customers.
During 2008, we continued to expand the range of products and 
services that we can offer our customers. In January we acquired a 
minority equity stake in Ceres Power Holdings plc and entered into 
a development and distribution agreement. Ceres is developing  
a fuel cell domestic boiler which generates electricity at the  
same time as producing heat. In September we entered the 
microgeneration market though our acquisition of Solar 
Technologies, an installer of solar photovoltaic technology.  
We expect the Government to introduce a feed-in tariff in 2010 
which will strengthen this market by providing financial incentives 
for small-scale low-carbon generation. 
In October we acquired Semplice Energy Limited, a low-carbon 
solutions company which offers consulting, design and systems 
integration to help businesses reduce their energy usage and use 
cleaner energy. We also entered into technology partnerships with 
Disenco, a developer of a micro combined heat and power 
appliance, and VPhase, a developer of energy saving products.
British Gas New Energy sought to raise awareness of energy 
efficiency through the successful ‘Green Streets’ campaign, where 
streets in the UK competed against each other to see which could 
save the most energy.
We also continue to deliver British Gas’ regulatory obligations in 
energy efficiency under the Government’s Carbon Emissions 
Reduction Target (CERT) programme. In 2008, the energy 
efficiency measures we provided to homes delivered lifetime 
carbon savings of almost 18 million tonnes.
“  The Green Streets campaign  
is a unique social experiment  
in energy and carbon savings.”

CENTRICA STORAGE
Gas storage is an integral part of the upstream supply 
chain, and a hedge against wholesale price volatility. 
Centrica – and the UK – does not have enough storage 
capacity and so we are investing in more.
Centrica Storage delivered a good financial performance in the 
year, against a backdrop of narrower year-on-year summer/winter 
gas price spreads. As a result of these narrower spreads, revenue 
in the period was down 14% to £280 million (2007: £327 million) 
primarily driven by a lower achieved standard bundled unit (SBU) 
price of 43.8 pence (2007: 57.4 pence). This was partially offset by 
additional revenue of £26 million generated from the sale of cushion 
gas in the last quarter of the year, although this did result in lower 
additional space sales and fewer gas optimisation opportunities.  
As a result of this lower revenue and an increased cost of fuel gas, 
operating profit* fell by 19% to £195 million (2007: £240 million).
Operationally the Rough field performed strongly in 2008, with 
injection and production availability of 99%. In the first half of the 
year we upgraded the two offshore compression trains for the field 
which enhanced injection rates. Since completing the acquisition  
in 2003 the continued investment has enabled us to create the 
financial equivalent of more than 80 million additional SBU sales  
in 2008. During the year the Easington terminal passed five years 
without a lost time incident and Centrica Storage’s overall accident 
rate of below one lost time incident per million man hours 
compares very favourably with industry benchmarks. 
In July approval was granted by Ofgem to modify the standard 
storage contract to include prepaid entry capacity rights. Centrica 
Storage now offers a range of products that give customers the 
choice of day ahead or within day withdrawal nominations as well  
as a choice of trading point and firmness.
During the year Centrica Storage also announced its involvement  
in two major new build storage projects. In March we announced 
the proposed conversion of the Bains gas field into a gas storage 
facility, with a potential capacity of up to 20bcf. In September we 
acquired Caythorpe Gas Storage Limited, which has planning 
permission to convert the onshore Caythorpe gas field to a gas 
storage facility, with a capacity of up to 7.5bcf. If completed, both  
of these projects would become operational by the winter of 
2011/12, and will provide increased levels of flexibility, optionality 
and security through a multi-asset model.
In February 2009 a third new gas storage project was announced. 
Centrica Storage, in conjunction with Perenco, intends to convert 
the largely depleted Baird gas field into a facility that would have 
capacity to hold approximately 60bcf, just over half the capacity  
of Rough, the UK’s largest gas storage facility.

involvement in two major 
new build storage projects 
in 2008.” 20
CENTRICA ENERGy
Centrica Energy is the part of the business that ensures 
security of supply for our customers. It is building the 
upstream operation that is vital for an integrated energy 
company, by investing in new sources of gas and power.
Centrica Energy delivered a strong financial performance in 2008, 
during a year when the average UK month-ahead gas price was  
at a record high of 61.4 pence per therm (p/th), more than double 
that experienced during 2007.
Gas production and development
Operating profit* in the gas production business increased to 
£1,164 million from £429 million in 2007. This performance was 
driven by an increase in overall hydrocarbon production volumes 
and higher achieved average sales prices. Gas sales volumes 
increased by 7% to 2,418 million therms (mmth) (2007: 2,260mmth) 
as we benefited from consistent Morecambe production and an 
increased contribution from the Rose and Statfjord fields. In total, 
hydrocarbon volumes increased by 8% to 46.8 million barrels of  
oil equivalent (mmboe) (2007: 43.3mmboe). Due to the higher 
wholesale market gas price the average gas selling price achieved 
rose to 59.1p/th (2007: 30.4p/th). Volume-related production costs 
increased broadly in line with production levels. Other production 
costs increased more rapidly due to the greater level of exploration 
and seismic activity and increased field operating costs, driven by 
the impact of recent acquisitions and industry cost inflation.
During the year we built on our existing asset base, announcing 
several additional equity investments in both UK continental shelf 
and Norwegian shelf assets. In March we increased our equity 
holding in the Grove and Seven Seas fields, acquired in 2007, to 
92.5% and 90% at a cost of £36 million. After further development 
we expect to recognise around 32 billion cubic feet equivalent 
(bcfe) of reserves. In October we completed the acquisition of the 
Norwegian gas assets held by Marathon in the Heimdal area of  
the Norwegian North Sea for net consideration of £162 million.  
An additional investment of £125 million is expected to be required 
in order to recognise the total reserve potential of 154bcfe over  
the next four years. In December we announced an agreement  
to acquire an additional 66.67% equity holding in the UK portion  
of the Peik field for £20 million. Asset pre-emption rights and 
approvals were cleared in January 2009 and after further capital 
investment of around £140 million we expect to recognise 72bcfe  
of reserves.
As part of our ongoing capital investment programme we spent 
£108 million in 2008 on our existing gas asset portfolio and also 
approved significant additional development plans at an aggregate 
cost of over £200 million over the next three years. These include 
development at the Grove field where commercial gas was 
delivered from the first of a four-well programme during the fourth 
quarter of 2008 and the second well was successfully tested during 
January 2009. Our success in this highly complex procedure 
underlined the growing skill base which exists within Centrica in this 
environment. Drilling of the remaining two wells will continue during 
the first half of 2009. Further programmes during 2009 include the 
sanctioned development of the Seven Seas field, and the Babbage 
field where we have a 13% interest. In total we have recognised an 
additional 105bcfe of proven and probable reserves as a result of 
our UK acquisitions and developments.
During the year we also invested £43 million in our focused 
exploration programme. This included producing new seismic 
imaging around both the Morecambe Bay area and our licence 
blocks in Norway and Nigeria.
Power generation
The power generation segment delivered an operating profit* for 
the year of £7 million (2007: £46 million). Overall the financial 
performance of the fleet was held back by a forward sales contract 
which expires at the end of the first quarter of 2009, and unplanned 
outages at the South Humber Bank, Peterborough and Spalding 
power stations. This restricted our ability to capture higher market 
spark spreads during a period when the system supply margins 
remained tight.
Operationally, despite these outages, the average load factor 
across our conventional gas-fired power stations increased to 65% 
(2007: 55%) and the total power generated from our power portfolio 
rose to 23.4 terawatt hours (TWh) (2007: 19.8TWh).
By the end of the year we had completed the major construction 
work at the 180 megawatt (MW) Lynn and Inner Dowsing offshore 
wind farm development, where five of the six arrays are now 
exporting directly to the National Grid. We expect to be exporting 
from the final array in the first quarter of 2009, following a repair to 
the subsea cable. The successful in-house delivery of this project 
illustrates our ability to manage and derive value from large-scale 
complex engineering projects in this area.

In October we gained Government approval for a proposed 
250MW offshore wind farm project off the Lincolnshire coast and 
are now evaluating tenders to confirm the project economics before 
making any further investment decisions. We also commenced a 
process to assess the potential for refinancing a portion of the 
current asset base and establishing joint venture partnerships 
going forward.
The 885MW Langage gas-fired power station project, the UK’s first 
major power station development for almost five years, remains on 
budget. We now expect the plant to commence full commercial 
operation towards the end of 2009.
Industrial and commercial
This segment reported an operating loss* of £329 million (2007: 
£179 million operating profit*). The higher gas price environment 
experienced during 2008 resulted in input costs for these contracts 
increasing materially, while the index-linked pricing mechanisms 
also restricted the upward movement in the sales prices achieved. 
Despite a softening of gas prices during the fourth quarter of the 
year customer demand remained high, with volumes sold for the 
year increasing by 10% to 2,493mmth (2007: 2,260mmth). 
Energy procurement
During the year we continued to seek gas supply contracts to 
diversify the price indexation and further build the contractual 
hedge position in Centrica. We successfully re-indexed an  
existing contract and also negotiated additional medium-term 
supply contracts; in total around 4 billion cubic meters (bcm)  
of gas per annum.
In November we commissioned our liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
import capacity at the Isle of Grain with a Q-flex tanker delivering 
approximately 193,000 cubic metres of LNG. This was the largest 
LNG tanker ever to be landed in the UK. Our annual import 
capacity of 3.4bcm positions us well for the increasing availability  
of LNG supply.
Accord trading
Accord delivered a strong operating profit* of £37 million, up 
significantly on the prior year (2007: £9 million), during an extremely 
volatile period for wholesale energy prices.

Operating  
Review
continued 
Direct Energy
DIRECT ENERGy
Direct Energy continues to offer strong growth potential 
and now accounts for 27% of the Group’s revenue. 
Expertise in energy procurement, retail services, growing 
upstream gas and power generation businesses, along  
with our balance sheet strength, position us well to take 
advantage of future opportunities.
Direct Energy delivered a strong set of results in 2008 despite a 
difficult economic and commodity environment. Revenue in the 
year was up 46% at £5,824 million (2007: £3,992 million), mainly  
as a result of the acquisition of Strategic Energy, greater activity  
in wholesale auctions, higher selling prices in retail energy, and  
the positive impact of the stronger US and Canadian currencies. 
Operating profit* was up 15% at £215 million (2007: £187 million), 
and was up by 4% on a constant currency basis as growth in the 
commercial and industrial business more than offset negatives in 
home and business services.
Mass markets energy
Mass markets energy delivered a good performance given the 
tough market conditions. In Canada customer numbers grew  
by 3% as we gained market share in Alberta where we have  
now switched 250,000 customer accounts from the regulated  
tariff to competitive products, and operating margins expanded  
in both Ontario and Alberta.
In the US North East customer numbers grew by 20% to more than 
400,000 as we continued to grow our gas and power businesses  
in New York and increased our market share in Ohio and in 
Connecticut. We also benefited from an unusual combination of 
high demand and low wholesale gas prices in the cold weather 
during the latter part of the year, which resulted in stronger profits* 
during this time.
Texas customer numbers fell by 4% in the year and total demand 
dropped by over 15% as benign weather and conservation efforts 
by customers in the face of higher prices impacted average 
consumption per customer. An increase in Texas retail prices in 
June, and more stable commodity costs in the second half of the 
year resulted in improved performance compared to the first half, 
although the fall in competitor tariffs put pressure on the Texas 
business towards the end of the year and forced us to reduce 
prices early in 2009. Texas was also adversely impacted by two 
one-off issues. During the second quarter transmission congestion 
caused spikes in intra-day electricity balancing costs and in 
September Hurricane Ike damaged Houston’s power infrastructure, 
causing a temporary but sharp reduction in demand. Despite these 
issues, Texas delivered operating margins of 9% in 2008.
Revenue for the year was up 9% to £2,652 million (2007: £2,437 
million) and operating profit* grew 11% to £137 million (2007:  
£123 million). On a constant currency basis both revenue and 
operating profit* were broadly flat.
Commercial and industrial energy
Electricity sales in the year were almost double those in 2007, 
primarily as a result of the Strategic Energy acquisition and 
supported by organic growth in the existing businesses. Together 
with higher contract prices, and the favourable exchange rate, this 
resulted in revenue more than doubling to £2,015 million (2007: 
£978 million). On a constant currency basis revenue was up 88%. 
We now supply over 200,000 meter points, which positions us  
as the third largest commercial and industrial energy supplier in 
North America.
In the second half integration costs for Strategic Energy cancelled 
out the synergy benefits. However the integration is now essentially 
complete and we are on target to exceed the US$15 million of 
annual cost synergies announced at the time of the acquisition.  
As some of our competitors struggled in the tighter credit 
environment we also made significant progress in the second half 
in expanding margins to recover the higher cost of credit support. 
As a result operating profit* for this business was up substantially 
year-on-year at £11 million (2007: £1 million).
h ome and business services
It was a difficult year for our services business, as the severe 
slowdown in US housing construction, which was 35% down  
on 2007, had a material impact on the US business. Our level of 
installations of equipment in new homes in the US fell by 13% and 
our backlog of sales awaiting installation fell by 25%. In response 
we cut costs sharply and continued to increase our emphasis on 
protection products, where customer numbers increased by 11%.
In Canada our customer base for protection products increased by 
5%, mainly due to strong sales of total home protection plans. 
Revenue was slightly up by 7% at £375 million (2007: £351 million) 
and operating profit* was marginally down year-on-year at  
£16 million (2007: £17 million). On a constant currency basis 
revenue was down 1% and operating profit* was down 20%.

Overall operating profit* was up 11% year-on-year at £51 million 
(2007: £46 million) and on a constant currency basis was up 2%. 
This small underlying increase reflected higher upstream gas  
profits offset by a reduction in power margins. 
Our Texas power stations were affected by increasing capacity 
margins and lower spark spreads, which occasionally made it  
more economic to purchase power than to generate it. Together 
with a two-week unplanned outage at our Bastrop plant, this 
caused power generation volumes to drop by 7% to 4.7TWh  
(2007: 5.1TWh). We also encountered transmission congestion  
in West Texas which reduced power prices at times to very low 
levels, adversely impacting the profitability of our wind power 
purchase agreements. 
Natural gas production volumes increased by 23% to 365mmth 
(2007: 297mmth) following rapid development of current reserves 
and the acquisitions of Rockyview Energy and the Canadian  
assets of TransGlobe Energy earlier in the year. The business also 
benefited in the first half from high gas prices on the portion of 
sales not forward sold, but on the current forward curve faces 
lower prices on open volumes in 2009.

Corporate 
Responsibility 
Review
Managing a 
sustainable business
Centrica is a major provider of essential services, a company that 
affects – and is affected by – the physical, social and ethical environments 
in which it works. A responsible approach to managing the associated 
risks and opportunities is integral to the successful delivery of the 
Company’s strategy. Corporate responsibility (CR) is, therefore, central  
to the delivery of sustainable value for our shareholders. 
During 2008, we have continued to review, understand and manage the social, 
environmental and economic impact of our operations. Sometimes this approach 
means taking decisions which put longer-term considerations before short-term 
ones, and it may mean that we choose not to undertake business which would be 
profitable but would be contrary to our values. 
Such decisions require strong leadership and governance. They also require a clear 
strategy and clear values that are applied consistently throughout the business; and 
the ability to measure the impact of our choices in order to understand what we 
should do. Just as in any other part of the business.
Our strategy
Our CR strategy is to ensure the sustainability of our business by managing the  
risks and seizing the opportunities presented to us in areas where we have a  
direct impact. A successful approach can help us win business advantage and 
deliver value to our shareholders. Conversely, if we fail, we face reputational and 
financial risks.
Our key impact areas are: 
• climate change and the environment 
• serving our customers 
• health and safety
• valuing our people
• our local impact 
• our supply chain
We have spent – and continue to spend – considerable effort on refining 
performance indicators for these areas to give us the management information  
we need. 
We seek to achieve a leadership position in areas such as climate change, health 
and safety and social programmes which are at the heart of our business and can 
help us be distinctive and deliver competitive advantage. In all of them we monitor 
the implementation of our policies through appropriate performance indicators and 
clear targets. We report on them over the following four pages. 
These impact areas also help to frame our engagement with government, regulators, 
investors, customers, employees and other key stakeholders in each of our operating 
regions. Profound debates are taking place about climate change and the security  
of energy supply and it is part of our corporate responsibility to have opinions and 
contribute fully to those debates. 
The understanding provided by the impact areas enables us to develop positions  
of advocacy on issues ranging from the development of the EU’s renewable energy 
strategy and fuel poverty in the UK, to the operation of the global energy market. 
We need to understand our impact on society in the broadest possible sense.  
And that understanding must then be reflected in what we do and how we do it.

Lea Dersh Ip an D gOvernance 
I am pleased that our Board-level Corporate Responsibility 
Committee (CRC) continues to receive strong commitment from  
our senior leadership and provides strategic oversight to our  
CR approach. The CRC was strengthened in late 2007 with  
the inclusion of a second Non-Executive Director and the Chief 
Executive within its membership. A senior manager is also now 
accountable for CR performance in each business. This structure 
has been increasingly effective in challenging the business units  
to address their CR risks and opportunities. The Committee  
meets four times a year and ensures that our day-to-day business 
operations respond to the opportunities and mitigate the risks 
posed by CR issues. 
process monitoring
Through continual challenge at CRC, we believe we have robust 
risk management and internal audit processes for our Group CR 
exposure and that our controls in high hazard activities are good. 
During 2008, we integrated non-financial key performance 
indicators (KPIs) into Group business performance metrics and  
the internal audit process.
Overseas governance
Direct Energy’s Executive Committee enhanced CR governance  
by establishing its own CR Committee with responsibility for 
overseeing North American business-specific issues. This 
commitment to CR helped Direct Energy achieve recognition in a 
list of the Top 50 Most Responsible Corporate Citizens in Canada.
Our Group-wide business principles (listed on page 6) on corporate 
conduct continue to underpin all our actions. Following a 2007 
programme to communicate these to our UK employees, Direct 
Energy introduced them during 2008. In 2009 we will focus on 
embedding these further through our risk and internal audit processes. 
Where we have identified areas of higher risk, such as our operations 
in Nigeria, we are using the business principles to guide our 
corporate behaviour and to ensure that we commit to the highest 
standards of ethical conduct.
Developing our management culture
Also during 2008, we launched our Leadership Behaviours 
programme across the Group. This has been developed to support 
our leaders in understanding how they can improve our business, 
inspire our people and deliver exceptional customer service. These 
behaviours are currently being embedded into all our processes 
including training and development, performance management, 
recruitment and talent management. Assessing subsequent 
behavioural change is a challenge for the next 12 months.

Centrica is playing a crucial role in creating a sustainable 
low-carbon future, whilst securing energy supplies over the long 
term. We formed British Gas New Energy (BGNE) in 2007 as a 
commercial response to the challenge of global climate change.
Our climate change and environment strategy is to lead the market 
in responding to growing consumer demand for low-carbon 
products and services; maintain our low-carbon position on power 
generation; and work with our employees and suppliers to reduce 
the environmental impact of our operations. 
Our work in these areas has been recognised for the 
second year running by our inclusion in the leadership  
index of the Carbon Disclosure Project.
Leading the consumer market for low-carbon products  
and services
The UK has a binding target to reduce CO2 emissions by 80%  
by 2050 with a corresponding target of 15% of all energy coming 
from renewable sources by 2020. Smaller scale renewable 
technologies have a significant role to play in helping to achieve 
these aims and during the year BGNE made a number of 
acquisitions to help develop our capability in microgeneration.
These investments will enable us to install solar photovoltaic 
technology in the UK; develop combined heat and power systems 
for residential properties based on solid oxide fuel cell technology; 
and offer consulting services to help businesses reduce their 
energy usage. We will continue to look for acquisition opportunities 
to increase our range of low-carbon products and services.
We continue to offer green energy tariffs, although encouraging 
take-up of these remains challenging. 
We have signed onto Ofgem’s Green Supply Guidelines 
which define a Green Tariff as one that must deliver an 
additional environmental benefit. This will raise the 
standard of industry products, ensure genuine benefits  
for the environment and provide transparent and  
consistent information to reduce consumer confusion 
around tariff labelling.
In North America, Direct Energy is working with the Canadian 
government to develop a standard for carbon offset calculations 
from energy efficiency projects.
Within British Gas, our 18-month-long Green Streets competition 
between eight communities has highlighted practical solutions for 
consumers to make their homes more energy efficient.
We have also linked our expertise in energy efficiency to our 
programme of work with vulnerable customers. These  
customers are some of the main recipients of energy-saving 
products which we supply under our carbon emission reduction 
target (CERT) obligations. 
British Gas is already the UK’s leading supplier of A-rated 
high-efficiency boilers. The energy efficiency products 
provided under CERT in 2008, which included the 
distribution of 48 million low-energy light bulbs to our 
customers, equated to a lifetime carbon saving of 17.87 
million tonnes of carbon dioxide. By the end of 2008 we  
had completed 50% of our three-year CERT target.
Maintaining our low-carbon position
We aim to invest in low-carbon generation. This currently includes 
high-efficiency gas-fired power stations and offshore wind farms, 
but we are also actively pursuing an interest in nuclear power 
through a proposed acquisition of 25% of British Energy.  26
Our new efficient gas-fired power station at Langage, Devon will 
generate its first power in 2009. And our offshore wind farm 
development at Lynn and Inner Dowsing – currently the largest of its 
type in the world – has now been commissioned. In October 2008, 
we also obtained consent for the Lincs wind farm development.
In North America, commercial operation began at the 170MW

electricity produced will be purchased by Direct Energy under  
a seven-year power purchase agreement. 
During 2008 we further reduced our carbon intensity in  
line with our target of achieving a figure of 350g CO2/kWh 
by 2020. In 2008, the energy we supplied had the lowest 
carbon emissions of any major supplier in Britain. 
r educing our operational footprint
We are also focused on reducing our own operational carbon 
footprint and are creating an understanding and culture among  
our employees appropriate for a business leading the way towards 
a low-carbon future. In 2008, British Gas joined our upstream 
assets in achieving certification to ISO 14001 from the British 
Standards Institute. This Standard covers our 26,000 employees  
in the UK, highlighting their commitment to and awareness of  
our environmental management systems. We aim to complete 
certification across Direct Energy by the end of 2010.
Employee engagement as a result of internal communication 
campaigns and the work of locally based ‘Green Teams’ of 
employee champions has cut UK office energy consumption 
by 7.23% exceeding our target of 5%. In 2008, 14% less 
waste was sent to landfill when compared to 2007 and 64% 
of our UK waste was recycled, exceeding both our targets 
in these areas. 
In 2008 Direct Energy’s Climate Change Committee approved  
a carbon footprint management programme that addresses the 
greenhouse gas emissions of the North American fleet, business 
travel and facilities. Direct Energy reduced emissions by an 
estimated 7%, although these reductions are mainly attributable  
to a slowing economy and fewer business miles travelled.

have benefited from British Gas support in 2008
We are committed – and have long been committed – to providing 
proactive help to our vulnerable customers and to working alongside 
the UK Government to seek ways of alleviating fuel poverty. 
Since 2005 we have pursued a range of initiatives to support older 
customers and those who are disabled or on income-related 
benefits. We made a voluntary public commitment not to 
disconnect anyone we knew to be vulnerable and we provide 
extensive debt advice to help those struggling to pay their  
energy bills.
Poverty and vulnerability are also important issues in our North 
American markets, although the concept of fuel poverty is not as 
prominent as it is in the UK. Direct Energy has tailored a number of 
programmes for different regions, such as ‘Neighbor to Neighbor’ 
in Texas and the ‘Seniors Discount Tariff’ in Ohio to provide support 
for vulnerable customers. 
Fuel poverty became an increasingly significant issue in the UK 
during 2008 with the latest figures from National Energy Action 
estimating fuel poverty in Great Britain is currently affecting more 
than 5 million households. But many of its causes – in particular 
low income compounded by unemployment – are beyond our 
control as an energy supplier. Instead we are focusing our 
resources where we can have the most impact. Through British 
Gas’ partnership with five charities, we are improving the way we 
identify vulnerable customers and are looking to provide better 
means of targeting those most in need to make our programmes 
more effective.
In July 2008 we were obliged to increase tariffs for domestic  
gas and electricity as a result of sharply increased wholesale 
energy prices. The price rise focused the attention of the media 
and UK Government on our approach to those hardest hit by the 
increases. Our approach to supporting our more vulnerable 
customers is an example of how we are prepared to take decisions 
which put longer-term considerations before short-term ones, and 
refuse to act in ways that would be contrary to our values. 
To help customers with these price rises and as part of our CERT 
obligations, British Gas will install energy efficient products in many 
customers’ homes over the three years from April 2008, delivering 
an estimated value of over £1 billion – the largest such initiative in 
the UK. In addition, our planned investments to secure energy from 
a diverse range of sources aim to mitigate the effects of future 
volatility in wholesale prices.
Energy suppliers reached a voluntary agreement with Government 
in April 2008 to increase their collective spend on social 
programmes. British Gas has the largest commitment of all

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
We launched a new Essentials tariff in July 2008 which protected 
vulnerable customers from the price rise until April 2009 and 
provided free energy efficiency measures to reduce their 
consumption. Our more recent Essentials Advance initiative, 
offering vulnerable and in-need customers free energy efficiency 
measures and a £50 rebate once measures are installed, is in line 
with the Government’s ‘save money, save energy’ programme. 
By the end of 2008, there were more than 526,000 accounts  
on our Essentials tariff for vulnerable and in-need customers, 
a 55% increase compared to 2007. 
In total, we provided support to an estimated 1.4 million vulnerable 
or in-need customers during 2008 and remain committed to 
playing a leading role in this area.

The health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers 
and the communities in which we live and work is a top priority. 
Despite our continued focus in this area, a British Gas engineer 
was tragically involved in a fatal incident during the year. Our 
thoughts and deepest sympathies are with his family.
A new health, safety and environment (HS&E) sub-committee of the 
Executive has been set up to determine the policies, targets and 
KPIs we need to meet our strategic vision and objectives for HS&E. 
Health and safety is a standing item on the agenda of all 
Executive Committee meetings and business quarterly 
performance review meetings with the Chief Executive.
Following a detailed internal examination of our management 
systems, we believe that we have effective processes for managing 
the condition of our plant and equipment. Accident rates in our 
upstream assets are low.
However, while trends in many of our businesses show 
improvements, our overall lost time injury (LTI) rates are high, with 
British Gas Services accounting for more than 80% of our accidents. 
To decrease injury rates, British Gas Services has launched a major 
programme of safety improvements, including a high profile internal 
awareness campaign. 
Our main occupational health issues in the UK are related to 
musculoskeletal disorders and mental health. We are currently 
reviewing our procedures and introducing new KPIs to improve  
our reporting in this area. We are also exploring a proposal to 
develop a Group-wide approach to managing these issues and 
their impact on our business. We remain committed to improving 
overall health and safety performance that will enable us to 
benchmark more positively with other leading companies in

We want to ensure that we attract and retain the best talent and 
offer an environment in which all our employees can flourish.
e mployee engagement
We want Centrica to be a great place to work and our engagement 
survey helps us to measure employee attitudes and opinions. 
Overall, there was a 94% response rate to the 2008 survey, 
up from 84% in 2007. Scores for employee commitment 
have increased across most business units by an average 
of more than 3%. This is well in excess of UK benchmarks 
and also above both European and global benchmarks.
We are aiming to hold the next full engagement survey in 2010, 
where we are targeting a commitment of 62%. An interim survey 
will be held in 2009 as a ‘temperature check’. 
Diversity and inclusion
We are committed to pursuing both equality and diversity in all  
our activities and continue to work with external organisations  
to share best practice and identify performance improvement 
opportunities. 
Our sixth ‘Equal Pay Review’ concluded that Centrica’s reward 
processes and implementation, including performance assessment, 
were not subject to gender bias. Female representation within 
Centrica’s senior leadership team is currently 24% against a

Services Academy has a dedicated Diversity and Inclusion team 
tasked with improving the representation of female engineering 
recruits and those from ethnic minorities. The team was recognised 
by Personnel Today, winning the 2008 award for ‘Diversity in the 
Workplace’. Direct Energy has a Diversity and Inclusion Council to 
oversee strategy in North America. 
We also continue to support initiatives to provide employment 
opportunities for people from under-represented groups, including 
those with a disability, carers and lone parents. We recently joined 
other top employers in the UK Government’s flagship National 
Employment Partnership, working with Jobcentre Plus to speed up 
recruitment, highlight vacancies and boost on-the-job training. Our 
existing partnership with Jobcentre Plus has recruited more than 
200 people over the past two years.

Corporate 
Responsibility 
Review
continued
r ecruitment and retention
In an economic downturn, providing work can be a significant act 
of corporate responsibility. 
British Gas is trebling its recruitment of apprentice gas 
engineers over the coming years creating more than 1,000 
new jobs. This will also see the business invest £30 million 
in training across its network of five UK Engineering 
Academy training centres.
We continued to make progress in attracting and retaining 
employees and increasing productivity and morale through 
effective employee engagement. Unplanned employee attrition 
reduced across most business units, including British Gas 
Residential where the reduction was 16%. 
In 2008 there were significant changes in our graduate recruitment 
and development process. An improved marketing and assessment 
strategy achieved better access to the highest calibre graduates and 
a new placement rotation process met business needs and graduate 
aspirations. The Summer Placement Programme, which provides 
ten-week work placements grew to equal size and also became  
a significant route to the main graduate programme.
Centrica was named as a Top 50 graduate recruiter by  
both Oxford and Cambridge Universities and the Summer 
Placement Programme was a finalist in the 2008 National 
Council for Work Experience Awards. 
Our approach to flexible working is seen by employees and managers 
alike as a key factor in both the attraction of staff and a reason for  
their staying. A research project undertaken by Cranfield University 
highlighted that flexible working is an important business tool, 
improving recruitment, retention and overall employee engagement.  
It is also embedded in our culture with 65% of respondents to the 
2008 research saying that they worked flexibly and more than 29% 
having formal flexible working arrangements in place.

Generation Green programme
We aim to work with the communities in which we operate for  
our mutual benefit. We do this by understanding local social and 
environmental issues and by taking action to address those issues. 
We also build strong community relations through our support for 
local organisations and by encouraging our own employees to get 
involved in a range of volunteering opportunities. For example, 
more than 180 engineers from British Gas Services gave up their 
o w n 	 t i m e 	 t o 	 i n s t a l l 	 a r o u n d 	 1 3 0 	 bo i l e r s 	 f or 	 c u s t om e r s 	 i n 	 n e e d 	 a c r o s s	
the country.
On a wider scale, over 8,000 UK schools have signed up  
to the British Gas Generation Green programme. Schools 
can win prizes such as solar panels and energy audits by 
collecting ‘leaves’ which reward measures to tackle climate 
change. The next phase of the programme encourages our 
employees to volunteer in the schools to build stronger 
links with local communities.
In India, British Gas is working with agency partners EXL and WNS 
to build relations with local communities. For example, with EXL we 
have co-funded the creation of a new secondary school for 280 
pupils near Delhi. 
In Nigeria, where youth unemployment is a key issue, we are 
developing community investment and skills acquisition programmes, 
which have already enabled 25 young people to study at the Maritime 
Academy of Nigeria. Our focus on stakeholder dialogue here, and  
at other operations such as our UK wind farm developments, has 
helped us to resolve issues at the earliest opportunity and ensure all 
risks are taken into account and managed effectively.

supplier contracts
As a large international company, we have responsibilities for  
the application of appropriate business practice throughout our 
supply chain.
Following sign-off of our Responsible Procurement and Supplier 
Management Policy in December 2007, we developed robust 
foundations for embedding responsible procurement into our 
procurement and supplier management processes. Our approach 
is to integrate the identification of non-financial risks in our supply 
chain into our ‘business as usual’ procurement process. This 
includes incorporating corporate responsibility clauses in contracts 
with suppliers. 
During the year we hosted two workshops with 18 of our 
strategic suppliers to communicate our new policy and  
to create a platform to discuss and share best practice  
on supply chain responsibility. 
All suppliers responded positively to our approach and provided 
useful insights on how other companies are implementing and 
embedding responsible procurement.

Group operating profit* from continuing operations was broadly flat at £1,942 million 
(2007: £1,949 million). Increases in gas production and development due to higher 
volumes and selling prices were offset by reductions in the industrial and commercial

cash flow is primarily due to an outflow of cash collateral associated with margining 
agreements, an increase in cash taxes paid and increased working capital that 
resulted from the higher retail prices. 
The net cash outflow from investing activities increased to £1,122 million (2007:  
£964 million). This included expenditure on the new Langage power station in  
Devon, and on completing the Lynn and Inner Dowsing wind farm development, as 
well as the acquisitions of Strategic Energy in the US, the Caythorpe onshore storage

primarily due to the impact of the Rights Issue, partially offset by 
non-cash negative movements in the mark-to-market value of 
hedging derivatives and actuarial losses on our pension schemes.
e xceptional items
Exceptional charges of £67 million were incurred relating to Oxxio, 
our business in The Netherlands. £45 million of this was an 
impairment charge to write down the carrying value of the goodwill 
that arose upon acquisition of Oxxio. The goodwill has been 
assessed as having a lower value as a result of lower expectations 
for future growth in customer numbers and for future margins due 
to the structure of the competitive market in The Netherlands. The 
remaining £22 million of the exceptional charge is a write-down of a 
receivable relating to historic overpayments of energy revenue tax 
by Oxxio. Uncertainty as to the timing and amount of the recovery 
of this receivable make it no longer appropriate to recognise the 
receivable as an asset. 
certain re-measurements
In our business we enter into a portfolio of forward energy contracts 
which include buying substantial quantities of commodity to meet  
the future needs of our customers. A number of these arrangements 
are considered to be derivative financial instruments and are  
r eq u i r ed 	 t o 	 b e 	 f a i r - v a l u ed 	 u n d er 	 I A S 	 3 9 . 	 F a i r 	 v a l u i n g 	 m ean s 	 th a t 	 w e	
apply the prevailing forward market prices to these contracts. The 
Group has shown the fair value adjustments separately as certain 
re-measurements as they are unrealised and non-cash in nature. The 
profits* arising from the physical purchase and sale of commodities 
during the year, which reflect the prices in the underlying contracts, 
are not impacted by these re-measurements.
The statutory results include charges to operating profit relating  
to these re-measurements of £1,415 million (2007: net credit of 
£ 2 3 5	m i l l i o n ) ,	p r i m a r i l y	f r o m	m a r k i n g - t o - m a r k e t	s o m e	c o n tr a c ts	
relating to our energy procurement activities. As gas and power 
were delivered under these contracts, net out-of-the-money mark-
to-market positions were unwound generating a net credit to the 
Income Statement in the period of £10 million (2007: net credit of 
£3 5 2	m i l l i o n ) .	A s	f o r w a rd	p r i c e s	d e c r e a s e d	i n	th e	s e c o n d	h a l f	o f

capacity and storage contracts. 
The net loss of £1,415 million on the re-measurement of energy 
contracts largely represents unrealised mark-to-market loss 
created by gas and power purchase contracts which are priced 
above the current wholesale market value of energy. This loss is 
calculated with reference to forward energy prices and therefore 
the extent of the overall economic profit or loss arising over the life 
of these contracts is uncertain and is entirely dependent upon the 
level of future wholesale energy prices. 
Business combinations and capital expenditure
During the year, in Canada we acquired Rockyview Energy and 
100% of the Canadian gas assets of TransGlobe Energy, and in the 
US we acquired Strategic Energy, an electricity supplier. We also 
acquired interests in gas and oil assets in the Heimdal area of the

Principal  
Risks and 
Uncertainties
Managing  
our risks
“  Centrica, like all businesses, faces a number  
of risks and uncertainties that could affect the 
delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives.”
  Nick Luff, Group Finance Director 
We place considerable importance on internal controls and have  
a robust risk management process, which is designed to identify, 
manage and mitigate business risk in order to support the creation 
of long-term, sustainable returns for shareholders. This process is 
described in more detail in the Corporate Governance Report on 
pages 41 to 42.
Described below are the principal risks and uncertainties the Group 
can foresee. It is not an exhaustive list, some future risks may be as 
yet unknown and other risks, currently regarded as immaterial, 
could turn out to be material. 
gLOBa L ec OnOMIc c On DItIO ns 
A general reduction in business activity resulting from the current 
downturn in the global economy could lead to a loss of income for 
the Group. Current credit market conditions mean that financial 
institutions are applying more stringent lending criteria and the 
availability of debt is low by historical standards. This could make it 
more costly for us to raise funds to take advantage of opportunities. 
Our business performance could also be impacted by increased 
exposure to the default of wholesale counterparties, including 
financial institutions and customers with bad debts, as economic 
conditions in the UK and North America worsen. 
Our risk management process has helped identify and manage  
the increased financial risks. We have placed particular emphasis 
on ensuring that sufficient liquidity is available to allow the Group  
to realise its growth ambitions; the Rights Issue has helped with  
this objective. There has also been an increased focus on credit 
issues, which may impact us if our customers and suppliers have 
liquidity problems, and on the cash required to manage the  
margin arrangements associated with the commodity trading  
we undertake. 
We expect the current economic conditions to continue for some 
time and will continue to seek to mitigate the risks that arise while 
identifying and exploiting opportunities. 
e Xterna L Mar Ket Fact Ors 
e xposure to movements in commodity prices 
A significant proportion of the Group’s profitability depends on our 
ability to manage our exposure to wholesale commodity prices for 
gas, oil, coal, carbon and power, all of which have been very volatile 
during the past year. The price of gas in the UK is particularly 
important, as we produce substantially less gas from our own 
resources than we need to meet retail demand and demand from 
our fleet of gas-fired power stations. The Group must assess the 
risk of procuring commodities at fixed prices to meet uncertain 
levels of demand that are subject to seasonal fluctuations. With 
volatile prices, there is a risk that surplus commodity positions 
cannot be sold to the wholesale markets profitably and that any 
commodity short position cannot be covered at a cost that can be 
passed on to customers. The unpredictable nature of commodity 
prices also hampers the calculation of reliable forecasts by the 
Group to support investment decisions, potentially leading to lower 
than expected returns. 
We manage these risks by hedging a proportion of the exposure  
for a number of years ahead, linked to the underlying profiles of our 
customers’ energy requirements. This is done through purchasing 
and developing upstream assets such as gas fields, power stations 
and wind farms, bilateral agreements for gas and power, purchases 
of commodities on recognised exchanges and the use of financial 
instruments such as oil and gas swaps (see note 4 to the Financial 
Statements on page 74). The potential British Energy transaction is 
an example of how we may secure a proportion of our customers’ 
expected energy requirements. 
While hedging may reduce our exposure to wholesale price 
volatility, significant longer-term price increases or decreases may 
require us to change the price at which we sell to our customers  
on variable tariffs. Where we do pass increased commodity prices 
through to our customers or fail to pass on decreased commodity 
prices, those customers may switch to our competitors, which 
could have an adverse effect on our business.
c limate change
Centrica’s approach to climate change will shape our future 
operations and, ultimately, the long-term success of our business. 
Our strategy is to lead the consumer market for low-carbon energy 
products and services; to maintain our low-carbon position in 
power generation, and to reduce the environmental impact of  
our operations.  32
However, operating in a low-carbon economy may present 
significant additional risks. For example, the need to comply with 
recent legislation – such as European Union environmental directives 
and UK renewable energy and energy efficiency targets – may lead 
to higher costs. In addition, there are risks if the legislative framework 
fails to deliver the necessary carbon price over the longer term to 
ensure the viability of investment in new technologies. An ineffective 
UK planning regime could make it difficult to develop new assets 
such as wind farms and other power generation infrastructure. There 
are also risks – and opportunities – in potential investment in nuclear 
power generation as a means of reducing our exposure to volatile 
wholesale gas and electricity prices.
The US approach to carbon legislation could shift following the 
election of President Obama, and we are monitoring the situation 
closely. The move towards energy efficiency could have a positive 
effect on our services business, especially in North America, where 
government subsidies are being made available for this work.
Changing customer behaviour, including a growing demand for 
low-carbon products and services, could result in reduced sales 
volumes. In the medium term, new technologies such as micro 
combined heat and power units, and smart metering, could also 
affect demand and therefore the Group’s earnings. We cannot  
be certain that our strategy will successfully mitigate against the 
risks or enable us to take advantage of opportunities that may 
present themselves.
Further information on our approach to climate change is available 
in the Corporate Responsibility Review on pages 25 and 26.
Level of competitive activity 
We operate in highly competitive energy supply markets, especially 
in the UK and North America, where customers switch suppliers 
based on price and service levels, as well as competitor activity. 
We also operate in the home services market. In the UK, 
competitive pressures are increasing as energy and other service 
providers, such as insurance companies, seek to strengthen their 
market positions. The economic environment in North America is 
also making trading more difficult in this market. 
To retain our competitive position, we combine attractive products 
and propositions with high-quality customer service, maintain  
an efficient cost structure and, for energy supply, buy energy 
competitively. We actively monitor customer satisfaction and 
competitor activity, and respond to changing circumstances by 
developing new customer offerings. We also focus on reducing 
operating costs, as failure to do so could significantly affect  
our business.
r egulatory and political factors 
Energy markets in the UK, North America and Europe are closely 
regulated. Changes to the regulatory regimes could affect our 
ability to meet our financial goals. Changes to the retail supply  
and wholesale industry procedures we have to comply with could 
affect our operating costs. And material increases to the regulated 
charges we pay for use of transmission, distribution and other 
infrastructure would affect our margins if such increases could not 
be passed on to customers. 
Political and consumer concern over rising energy prices and fuel 
poverty led to an Ofgem probe into the UK energy market. This 
concluded that the fundamental structures of a competitive market 
are in place, and that the transition to effective competitive markets 
is well advanced. However, it identified a number of areas where 
this transition should be accelerated. 
This will likely result in further consumer protection measures 
through the supply licence. If the industry does not agree on  
the licence changes, Ofgem could make a reference to the 
Competition Commission. The Government could also intervene 
and introduce measures such as a windfall tax on the Group’s free 
carbon allowances, or price controls for certain customer segments. 
The Government has announced its intention to require the 
deployment of smart metering across Britain, but is still determining 
key details such as the rate of deployment and the industry model 
for metering. This creates risk and uncertainty in terms of our 
contractual and operational arrangements for the provision of 
metering services. An accelerated deployment would result in the 
premature replacement of conventional meters, triggering early 
termination payments by British Gas, not all of which is likely to be 
recovered through customer charges. 
Progress on many aspects of European market liberalisation has 
been limited, though recently announced divestment initiatives by 
certain companies will provide important structural change. 
However, the prospects for effective competition in energy markets 
in continental Europe are impacted by consolidation activity, which 
could affect not only our participation in those markets, but also our 
ability to source and transport gas from Europe to the UK. 
Uncertainty over political or regulatory intervention in energy 
markets in North America could have an impact on the projected 
growth of our operations. President Obama has indicated his 
intention not only to enforce existing legislation, but also to increase 
the reliability of energy supply and the focus on protecting the 
environment. The impact on our business is uncertain. The 2009 
session of the Texas Legislature began in mid-January with the 
issue of regulation of competitive electricity markets, and we have  
a highly skilled team in place to monitor the session which ends in 
June 2009. Ontario shows little sign of moving away from low and 
stable regulated electricity pricing, and is considering introducing 
additional consumer protection measures. Specific reviews 
regarding electricity deregulation are ongoing in a limited number of 
jurisdictions, but energy policy, particularly relating to electricity, 
remains a highly politicised topic throughout North America.
We continue to engage with regulators, government ministers  
and senior officials in all of our markets through targeted  
contact programmes.
security of supply 
As UK gas reserves have declined, the UK energy market has 
become increasingly reliant on gas from Norway and mainland 
Europe, together with liquefied natural gas from other parts of the 
world. Key elements of security of supply, therefore, are access  
to reserves and the reliability of the storage, pipeline and gas 
processing infrastructure. Any break in this supply chain could 
jeopardise the supply to customers and impact the Group’s earnings. 
Similarly, the UK electricity market depends on the reliability of UK 
power stations, in particular ageing nuclear stations, with security 
of supply at risk during periods of outage across the system.

Centrica depends on third parties for gas and power and cannot 
guarantee the security of supply chains, including from the risk of 
terrorist activity or sabotage of power stations or pipelines. 
To respond to this changing environment, we support the 
development of new infrastructure to bring gas to the UK and store 
it. In addition, we will continue to acquire and develop new assets  
in the UK and overseas, and sign long-term supply contracts to 
replace declining gas reserves. We continually review our security 
arrangements to protect these assets. 
Operat IOna L Fact Ors
h ealth and safety 
There are significant health, safety and environmental (HS&E) 
hazards associated with operating our onshore and offshore  
gas production, exploration, gas storage and power generation 
assets. In addition, our service engineers in the UK and North 
America make more than 10 million home visits each year. 
Significant breaches of HS&E regulations could affect the safety  
of individuals, gas and/or power production, and result in the  
Group incurring liabilities which could affect our reputation or 
business performance. 
The Board is responsible for ensuring that Centrica has the 
appropriate culture and arrangements for meeting its HS&E 
responsibilities, and the Chief Executive is accountable to the 
Board for delivery. Our risk management and governance 
processes meet internationally recognised standards; HS&E is  
the first item of every meeting of the Executive Committee; and 
quarterly HS&E performance reports are submitted to the Board, 
specifically including process safety. The Group has also recently 
established a new, senior cross-business HS&E Committee to help 
develop our improvement strategy, and has issued new Group 
HS&E standards which define the expectations against which we 
will audit. We continue to target risk reduction in all our operations. 
Further information on our approach is available in the Corporate 
Responsibility Review on page 27.
uK customer service 
The delivery of good quality customer service is central to our 
business strategy and there is a risk that customers will leave 
British Gas if they experience unacceptable customer service  
or perceive that we are failing to maintain service quality. For 
example, the implementation in 2007 of a new billing system for  
UK residential energy customers led to an unacceptable decline  
in customer service levels and in customer numbers.
We carefully monitor service throughout our retail operations, and 
continued focus in this area has resulted in service improvements 
and fewer customer complaints. 
Brand and reputation 
Our business principles (listed on page 6), apply to all employees 
and business partners, and set out our commitment to operate 
professionally, fairly and with integrity wherever we work in the 
world. Failure to follow these principles could harm our reputation, 
damage our brand and affect both our operational performance 
and financial position. A combination of awareness training and 
targeted controls (including fraud and data protection) is in place  
to encourage and monitor adherence to these principles. 
As part of the demerger in 1997 , Centrica was assigned ownership 
of the British Gas trademarks and related logos for use in Britain. 
BG Group plc has the right to call for a reassignment of this 
intellectual property if control of Centrica is acquired by a third 
party. If, as a result of a change of control, we are unable to 
continue to use the British Gas trademarks and logos, this could 
adversely affect our competitive position. 
Information risk
Effective and secure information systems are essential for the 
efficient management and accurate billing of our customers, 
effective power generation and successful energy trading and 
hedging activities. The confidentiality, integrity and availability of  
our information systems could be affected by factors that include 
human error, ineffective design or operation of key controls or 
through malfunction or deliberate attack. Outages and interruptions 
could affect our ability to conduct day-to-day operations and any 
compromise of the confidentiality of information could impact our 
reputation with current and potential customers. 
There are a number of controls in place to manage this risk 
including network segregation, monitoring, access restrictions  
on storage systems, regular third-party security reviews and 
vulnerability assessments of infrastructure and applications. 
Business continuity plans are in place to help recover from 
significant outages or interruptions. To improve efficiency, we 
continue to invest in our systems supported by strong project 
management to minimise the associated implementation risk.
Outsourcing and offshoring 
We have outsourced several activities, including business-critical 
information technology services and back office and processing 
functions, which support our businesses in the UK and North 
America. Some of the outsourcing contracts are offshore. As with 
any contractual relationship, there are inherent risks to be mitigated, 
and these are actively managed.
The Centrica Executive Committee regularly reviews progress and 
a centre of expertise has been developed to capture and share 
best practice.
upstream asset performance and development
There is a risk that we suffer financial loss due to the unplanned 
breakdown of one or more of our power stations or gas assets.  
We manage this risk through a range of measures including 
technical assessment of the status of our assets, regular  
monitoring of performance and condition and investment to  
deliver the required capability and mitigate risk. 
We also manage a wide range of major capital projects to  
develop our upstream portfolio. The risk profiles of the individual 
projects vary and we are exposed to financial loss to a varying 
degree. We seek to mitigate financial loss through insurance, 
contractual arrangements, partnership arrangements and active 
project management. 
FInanc Ia L Fact Ors 
Liquidity 
Liquidity risk is the risk that we are unable to meet our financial 
obligations as they fall due. This risk is increased by the margin 
cash arrangements associated with some wholesale commodity 
contracts. Managing liquidity risk is particularly important in the  34
Principal  
Risks and 
Uncertainties 
continued
current economic environment where the availability of capital is 
limited. Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity requirements for  
the Group are produced at least monthly and these are assessed 
for different scenarios including the liquidity impact of significant 
changes in commodity prices or a credit rating downgrade.  
Our cash forecasts are reviewed regularly by the Financial Risk 
Management Committee, Centrica Executive Committee and  
the Board. 
The liquidity forecasting and assessments are designed to ensure 
that there is sufficient time for the Group to react to possible future 
cash constraints. This may be done by limiting discretionary cash 
outflows and/or limiting the volume of commodity transactions 
subject to margin cash arrangements. We also have policies to 
maintain a minimum level of committed borrowing facilities and 
ensure that a proportion of debt should be long-term and spread 
over a range of maturities. 
The Rights Issue proceeds and two bond issues in the second half 
of 2008 mean that the Group had significant liquidity at the end of 
the year to mitigate this risk. Potential acquisitions are expected to 
utilise surplus liquidity which is currently available to the Group.
c redit rating 
The current strong credit rating of the Group (long-term debt:  
A 3 	 s t a bl e 	 o u t l o ok 	 ( M o od y ’ s ) , 	 A 	 c r e d it 	 w a t c h 	 n e g a t i v e 	 o u t l o ok 	 ( S & P ) ;	
short-term debt: P-2 stable outlook (Moody’s), A-1 credit watch 
negative outlook (S&P)), means that we benefit from high levels of 
credit from our existing counterparties. Any material deterioration of 
these ratings may increase the cost of funding and could mean that 
we would need to increase our levels of security for existing energy 
procurement and hedging contracts, which could affect our cash 
position, limit our ability to trade in commodity markets and the 
implementation of our hedging strategy. However, sufficient liquidity 
is maintained to limit the immediate financial impact of any credit 
rating reduction. 
In the current economic environment there is also the risk that our 
counterparties may want to restrict the level of credit which they 
make available to us even if our credit rating remains unchanged. 
This could restrict our ability to enter into fixed price commodity 
contracts and increase the commodity risk within the business.
c ounterparty default
As part of our normal operations, we often have significant 
amounts owed to us by energy counterparties and our customers. 
In addition, we often hold large cash balances on deposit with 
financial institutions. In the current business environment, there is 
an increased risk of a counterparty default which may, among other 
things, reduce the Group’s cash flows. 
Our policy is to limit counterparty exposures by setting credit limits 
for each counterparty, where possible by reference to published 
credit ratings. Exposures are measured in relation to the nature, 
market value and maturity of each contract or financial instrument. 
Surplus cash is invested in short-term financial instruments and 
only deposited with counterparties with minimum long-term and 
s h or t - t e r m 	 c r e d it 	 r a t i n gs 	 o f 	 A 3 / A - 	 or 	 P 1 / A 1 	 f r om 	 M o od y ’ s 	 or 	 S & P	
respectively. Energy trading activities are undertaken with 
counterparties for whom specific credit limits are set. Exposures 
are reviewed by the Financial Risk Management Committee. 
pensions 
We maintain a variety of pension schemes including defined benefit 
schemes. The pension fund liabilities are partially matched with a 
portfolio of assets, leaving potential risk around the mortality rate, 
inflation and returns on assets. The schemes contain a high 
proportion of equity assets that are expected to provide a better 
return in the long term than alternative investments such as bonds. 
However, in the short term, the difference between the value of 
liabilities and assets may vary significantly, potentially resulting in a 
large deficit having to be recognised on the Group’s Balance Sheet. 
In the current business environment with volatile bond and unstable 
equity markets there is an increased risk that large deficits may 
arise on our pension schemes. 
In addition, actions by the pension regulators or the trustees,  
and/or any material revisions to existing pension legislation could 
require increased contributions by the Group to the pension fund. 
The next formal triennial valuations for the main schemes are due  
t o 	 b e 	 p e r f or m e d 	 a s 	 a t 	 3 1 	 M a r c h 	 2 0 0 9 . 	 A s 	 p a r t 	 o f 	 t hi s 	 e x e r c i s e 	 t h e	
investment and funding strategies for each of the schemes will be 
reviewed and the trustees and the Company will need to agree  
new contribution schedules. The actuarial valuations of the 
schemes may give higher deficits than have been recognised on 
the Group’s Balance Sheet and this will be the basis for agreeing 
any deficit contributions. The risks associated with the pension 
schemes are regularly reviewed and, in combination with expert 
external advice, action is taken where necessary. 
c urrency fluctuations
Through wholly owned subsidiaries in the United States and 
Canada and wholly owned and partly owned European entities,  
the Group has exposure in US and Canadian dollars and euros. 
Operational and capital expenditure cash flows may also be in 
currencies other than those used by our subsidiaries. The Group’s 
profitability could be adversely affected if the results and cash flows 
associated with these subsidiaries fall or cash outflows rise 
because of currency fluctuations against pounds sterling, the 
reporting currency of the Group. 
Our policy is to use hedging instruments to manage the impact of 
currency fluctuations. US dollar, Canadian dollar and euro balance 
sheet translation exposure is hedged by maintaining foreign 
currency borrowings and/or derivative financial liabilities which 
approximate to the net asset value of the foreign operations. 
Other material foreign currency cash flow exposures are hedged 
where there is sufficient certainty that the cash flows will occur. 
Where there is significant uncertainty over the timing of such 
exposures, the senior treasury and finance management decide on 
the appropriate hedging activity required on a case-by-case basis. 
Interest rate fluctuations
The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates which affect 
the amount of interest paid on borrowings and the return on our 
cash investments. Our policy is to manage interest rate risk on 
long-term borrowings while ensuring that the exposure to fixed

Governance 
continued 
The Board of Directors is committed to the highest 
standards of corporate governance and believes that  
such standards are critical to overall business integrity  
and performance. 
This report explains how the Company applies the 
principles of the 2006 Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (the Code). 
Board of Directors  
The Directors consider that the Board effectively leads and 
controls the Group. The powers of the Directors are set out  
in the Company’s Articles of Association (Articles), which are 
available on the Company’s website. To accommodate recent 
changes in company law, the Company adopted a new set of 
Articles at the 2008 Annual General Meeting. 
The Board has a schedule of matters specifically reserved for its 
approval, which is also available for inspection on the Company’s 
website. In particular, the Board is responsible for: 
 changes in the capital structure of the Company; 
 development of strategy and major policies; 
 the appointment and removal of Directors and the  
Company Secretary; 
 reviewing management performance;  
 interim dividend payments and recommendation of final 
dividends; 
 approval of the annual operating plan, the financial statements 
and major acquisitions and disposals; 
 the Group’s corporate responsibility arrangements including 
health, safety and environmental matters;  
 the Group’s corporate governance and system of internal 
control; and 
 matters not in the ordinary course of business. 
 
The Chairman and each Non-Executive Director has provided 
assurance to the Board that they remain fully committed to their 
respective roles and can dedicate the necessary amount of time  
to attend to the Company’s affairs.

Board meetings  
The Board holds regular scheduled meetings throughout the  
year. Unscheduled supplementary meetings also take place as 
and when necessary. During the year, the Company had nine 
scheduled meetings and three unscheduled supplementary 
meetings. A committee of the Board, set up solely to consider  
and approve technical aspects of the Company’s Rights Issue, 
met on three further occasions during the year.  
The Board continually monitors the development of the Group’s 
strategy and one of its meetings is specifically devoted to this. 
Comprehensive papers are presented to, and discussed by,  
the Board during this review. During the year, the Board  
undertook a full review of the Group’s overall strategy with the 
assistance of an independent external consultant. 
Details of attendance by Directors at Board and committee 
meetings during 2008 are set out in the table above. 
Directors who were unable to attend specific Board or committee 
meetings reviewed the relevant briefing papers and provided  
their comments to the Chairman of the Board or committee,  
as appropriate.  
Board constitution and appointments 
The Board is made up of an appropriate balance of Executive  
and independent Non-Executive Directors. The roles of Chairman 
and Chief Executive are separate. This established division of 
responsibility is formalised in writing and has been approved  
by the Board. 
The Non-Executive Directors play a key governance role and  
bring an external dimension to the Board’s deliberations through 
their range of knowledge, experience and insight from other 
sectors. As part of its annual review of corporate governance,  
the Board considered the independence of each Non-Executive 
Director (other than the Chairman) against the criteria specified  
in the Code and determined that each remained independent.  
During the year the Non-Executive Directors, including the 
Chairman, met independently of management on a regular basis.  
A formal, rigorous and transparent process is followed during  
the selection and subsequent appointment of new Directors to  
the Board. This process is described in the section on the 
Nominations Committee on page 40. On 14 July 2008, Mark 
Hanafin was appointed to the Board as Managing Director, 
Centrica Energy and Europe and he will be seeking reappointment 
as a Director of the Company at the 2009 Annual General Meeting 
(AGM). Mark Hanafin replaced Jake Ulrich, who resigned from the 
Board on 12 May 2008. On 26 February 2009, the Chairman 
announced a number of changes to the composition of the Board. 
Chris Weston, who is currently Managing Director of British Gas 
Services will be appointed to the Board on 1 July 2009 and will 
assume responsibility for the Company’s North American business 
following Deryk King’s retirement. Chris Weston will therefore seek 
reappointment to the Board at the 2010 Annual General Meeting. 
Phil Bentley will assume responsibility for the newly combined 
British Gas business and will remain a member of the Board. Paul 
Walsh, who has served as a Non-Executive Director since March 
2003, will retire from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM.  
A search for a suitable replacement has commenced.

In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Board 
considered and authorised each Director’s reported actual and 
potential conflicts of interest during the year. Each Director 
abstained from approval of their own reported conflicts. The Board 
will continue to monitor and review potential conflicts of interest on 
a regular basis.  
In accordance with the Code and the Company’s Articles,  
all Directors are subject to reappointment by shareholders at the 
first AGM following their appointment to the Board and thereafter 
are subject to reappointment every third year. Non-Executive 
Directors are initially appointed for a three-year term and, subject 
to review and reappointment by shareholders, can serve up to a 
maximum of three such terms. Upon the recommendation of the 
Nominations Committee, Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Andrew 
Mackenzie will be proposed for reappointment at the 2009 AGM, 
each to serve a three-year term. The Code states that any length 
of service beyond six years for a Non-Executive Director should be 
subject to particularly rigorous review and should take into account 
the need for progressive refreshing of the Board. In view of this, 
Helen Alexander, who joined the Board in January 2003, is and  
will in future seek reappointment to the Board on an annual basis.  
Full details of Directors’ service contracts, emoluments and  
share interests are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 
44 to 55. Directors’ biographies including their Board committee 
membership are set out on pages 36 and 37. 
Directors’ indemnities and insurance 
In accordance with the Articles, the Company has granted a deed 
of indemnity, to the extent permitted by law, to each Director and 
the General Counsel & Company Secretary. The Company also 
maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for its Directors 
and officers. 
Board evaluation 
The Board conducted a formal evaluation of its own performance 
and that of its committees and individual Directors. The evaluation 
was carried out with the assistance of an independent external 
facilitator, Egon Zehnder International, in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2008.  
The 2008 Board evaluation process followed up on the previous 
year’s effectiveness review and the Board considered whether 
sufficient improvements had been made on the identified issues. 
The 2008 Board evaluation focused on the following key themes:  
board structure, organisation and dynamics; efficiency and 
effectiveness; strategic review and debate; risk management and 
governance; review of specific decisions made in 2008; business 
performance; people; and key issues for 2009. 
 
The facilitator carried out the evaluation process using a 
comprehensive questionnaire, which was considered and 
completed by each of the Directors and the General Counsel & 
Company Secretary. In addition to this, the Senior Independent 
Director chaired a meeting of the independent Non-Executive 
Directors in the absence of the Chairman to appraise the 
Chairman’s individual performance. 
A consolidated report of the output from the evaluation exercise 
was prepared by the facilitator and this was presented to the 
Board for review and consideration. 
The evaluation report concluded that the Board and its 
committees continue to operate effectively although a small 
number of actions and improvements were identified. In particular, 
the Board identified the following enhancements, which will be 
incorporated into the future Board programme to ensure that the 
operation of the Board and its committees continue to improve: 
 greater visibility of senior management by the Board; 
 greater focus on global issues and succession in North America; 
 site visits; and 
 post investment reviews. 
The Chief Executive’s performance is reviewed regularly by the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive reviews the performance of  
the other Executive Directors. In addition, the Remuneration 
Committee assesses the performance of the Executive Directors  
in connection with its determination of senior management 
remuneration levels as explained in the Remuneration Report on 
pages 44 to 55. 
The Board and its committees will continue to review critically 
their procedures, effectiveness and development throughout the 
year ahead.  
Board development 
All new Directors appointed to the Board receive a comprehensive 
induction briefing tailored to meet their individual needs. Ongoing 
development and training is provided to Directors at Board 
meetings and, where appropriate, committee meetings. During the 
year, Directors received regular updates and presentations on 
changes and developments to the business, and to the legislative 
and regulatory environments in which the Group operates. 
In particular, the Board was briefed on the following key issues 
during 2008: 
 Companies Act 2006 provisions – especially Directors’ conflicts 
of interest; 
 commodity market and hedging strategy; 
 health, safety and environmental developments;  
 tax strategy and governance; and 
 smart metering and meter reading developments. 
 
The Directors have full access to the advice and services of the 
General Counsel & Company Secretary. They also have the option 
to seek independent professional advice in respect of their duties 
at the Company’s expense. 
Board committees 
The Board has delegated authority to its committees to carry out 
certain tasks as defined in each committee’s respective terms of 
reference. During the year, the Board conducted a comprehensive 
review of each of its committees’ terms of reference against best 
practice and approved revised terms. The written terms of 
reference for the Audit, Remuneration, Nominations, Corporate 
Responsibility, Executive and Disclosure Committees are available 
on the Company’s website and hard copies are available  
upon request.  
All of the independent Non-Executive Directors are members of 
the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees. The Board 
considers that this membership structure provides a consistency 
of membership within each of these principal committees and 
avoids undue reliance on particular members. Minutes of 
committee meetings are made available to all Directors on a timely 
Centrica p38-42.indd   39 Centrica p38-42.indd   39 10/3/09   15:47:13 10/3/09   15:47:13 40

Nominations and Corporate Responsibility Committees provide 
updates to the Board at subsequent Board meetings. 
A chart setting out the Company’s Board and Executive 
Committee structure is set out below. 
Details of each committee, including membership, are set out  
in the following committee reports: 
Audit Committee 
The members of the Audit Committee are Paul Rayner (Chairman), 
Helen Alexander, Mary Francis, Andrew Mackenzie and Paul 
Walsh. In accordance with the Code, Paul Rayner is identified as 
having recent and relevant financial experience. The Board has 
determined that each member of the Committee is independent 
and that the membership meets the requirements of the Code. 
The key function of the Audit Committee is to review the 
effectiveness of the Company’s financial reporting and internal 
control policies together with the procedures for the identification, 
assessment and reporting of risks. In accordance with its terms of 
reference, the Committee is authorised by the Board to: 
 monitor the integrity of the Company’s financial statements and 
any formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial 
performance, including a review of the significant financial 
reporting judgements contained within them; 
 review the Company’s internal financial controls, internal control 
and risk management systems; 
 monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
audit function; 
 establish and oversee the Company’s relationship with  
the external auditors, including monitoring their independent 
status; and 
 establish and oversee appropriate whistleblowing and fraud 
prevention arrangements within the Company. 
 
During the year the Committee met on four occasions. At each of 
these scheduled meetings, the Committee met privately with the 
external auditors, and separately with the Head of Internal Audit.  
The Committee received regular comprehensive reports from the 
Head of Internal Audit, senior management and the external 
auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The Committee also 
requested clear objectives, timescale and achievement milestones 
against which performance could be clearly measured in respect 
of all ongoing issues. 
 
 
Governance structure 
 
 
 
 
The Committee considered a number of key issues during the year 
and in particular reviewed: 
 British Gas Residential revenue recognition; 
 risk profile of the Group’s business model and risk mitigation; 
 information technology general controls; 
 management of commodity risk; and 
 ongoing compliance with the undertakings in respect  
of Centrica Storage Limited. 
 
The Board has approved policies that restrict the types of non-
audit work that can be undertaken by the external auditors and 
restrict the employment by the Group of former employees of the 
external auditors. The award of non-audit work, within categories 
that the external auditors are permitted to carry out under the 
Board-approved policies, is subject to pre-clearance by the Audit 
Committee if the fee exceeds specified thresholds. The Group’s 
policy to seek competitive tenders for all major consultancies and 
advisory projects is set out in note 7 to the Financial Statements 
on page 84. In addition, the Committee was provided with reports 
of all non-audit assignments awarded to the external auditors and, 
on a regular basis, a full breakdown of non-audit fees incurred 
during the year. 
In accordance with International Standard on Auditing (UK & 
Ireland) 260 and Ethical Statement 1 issued by the Accounting 
Practices Board, and as a matter of best practice, the external 
auditors have confirmed their independence as auditors of the 
Company, in a letter addressed to the Directors. 
Remuneration Committee 
A report detailing the composition, responsibilities and work 
carried out by the Remuneration Committee during the year, 
including an explanation of how it applies the principles of the 
Code in setting Executive Directors’ remuneration, is included 
within the Remuneration Report on pages 44 to 55.  
Nominations Committee 
The members of the Nominations Committee are Roger Carr 
(Chairman), Helen Alexander, Mary Francis, Sam Laidlaw,  
Andrew Mackenzie, Paul Rayner and Paul Walsh. The 
Committee’s membership is comprised of a majority of 
independent Non-Executive Directors. The primary  
responsibilities of the Committee are to: 
 make appropriate recommendations to the Board for the 
appointment of replacement or additional Directors;  
 devise and consider succession planning arrangements  
for Directors and other senior executives; and

 regularly review the structure, size and composition of the  
Board and make recommendations to the Board with regard  
to any proposed changes. 
The Committee met on three occasions during the year and 
considered the proposed appointment of Mark Hanafin as 
Managing Director, Centrica Energy and Europe to replace  
Jake Ulrich, who resigned from the Board on 12 May 2008. 
In making its appointment recommendations to the Board, the 
Committee reviews the overall balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience on the Board against current and future requirements 
of the Company and, as appropriate, draws up a list of required 
candidate attributes.  
In addition to this appointment, the Committee considered: 
 the reappointment of Directors retiring by rotation at the  
2008 Annual General Meeting;  
 Board and senior management succession planning; and 
 Board constitution changes and appointments. 
 
Corporate Responsibility Committee 
The members of the Corporate Responsibility Committee are  
Mary Francis (Chairman), Phil Bentley, Deryk King, Sam Laidlaw, 
Andrew Mackenzie and Catherine May. 
A report detailing the work carried out by the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee during the year is included within the 
Corporate Responsibility section on pages 24 to 28.  
Executive Committee  
The members of the Executive Committee are the Executive 
Directors and those key senior managers whose biographical 
details are set out on pages 36 and 37. Sam Laidlaw is Chairman 
of the Committee.  
The Committee is responsible for the day-to-day management  
of the Group’s operations within the limits set out in the Group’s 
delegation of authority, which was reviewed and approved by  
the Board during the year. The Committee also has a schedule  
of matters specifically reserved for its approval.  
The Committee has delegated certain tasks to the following  
sub-committees: 
 the Group Risk Management Committee; 
 the Group Financial Risk Management Committee; 
 the Health, Safety and Environment Committee; and  
 the Investment Committee. 
 
During the year, the Committee conducted a thorough review  
of the terms of reference in respect of the Group Financial Risk 
Management, Health, Safety and Environment, and Investment 
Committees and approved revised terms.  
Disclosure Committee 
The members of the Disclosure Committee are Sam Laidlaw 
(Chairman), Nick Luff and Grant Dawson.  
The Committee met on a number of occasions during the year  
and is responsible for implementing and monitoring systems and 
controls in respect of the management and disclosure of inside 
information. The Committee is also responsible for ensuring that  
all regulatory announcements, shareholder circulars, prospectuses 
and other documents issued by the Company comply with any 
applicable legal or regulatory requirements. 
Relations with shareholders 
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining an effective 
investor relations and communication programme as part of its 
ongoing relationship with the Company’s shareholders. The Board 
is proactive in obtaining an understanding of shareholder views on 
a number of key matters affecting the Group. 
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director held regular 
meetings with the Company’s major shareholders during the year. 
A key topic of discussion during the year was the Company’s 
Rights Issue, which was succesfully completed during December 
2008, following approval at the Company’s General Meeting held 
on 21 November 2008.  
The Chairman and the Senior Independent Director attended the 
meetings at which the annual and interim results were presented 
to major investors and analysts. The Chairman also met a number 
of major institutional shareholders during the year to gain a first-
hand understanding of their concerns and key issues.  
The Company’s AGM provides all shareholders with the 
opportunity to further develop their understanding of the Company 
and to ask questions of the full Board on the matters put to the 
meeting, including the Annual Report. At the AGM, the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive present a review of the Group’s business. 
A poll is conducted on each resolution at all Company General 
Meetings. All shareholders also have the opportunity to cast their 
votes in respect of proposed resolutions by proxy, either 
electronically or by post.  
Mary Francis, the Senior Independent Director, is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns that contact through the 
normal channels has either failed to resolve or is deemed 
inappropriate.  
Formal reports of investor feedback are presented to the Board  
at each Board meeting.  
Centrica’s website contains up-to-date information for 
shareholders and other interested parties including share price 
information, news releases, speeches from the AGM, 
presentations to the investment community and a section on 
shareholder services. The Company’s Annual Report and Annual 
Review are also published on the website and these are available 
to shareholders from the date of publication.  
Compliance statement 
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2008, the Company fully 
complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code with 
the exception of provision A.4.3 which currently states that no 
individual should be appointed to a second chairmanship of a 
FTSE 100 company. In July 2008, the Chairman of the Company 
was appointed as chairman of Cadbury plc following its demerger 
from Cadbury Schweppes plc. The Board believes that the 
Chairman’s commitment and contribution to the Company will not 
suffer as a consequence of this appointment. This provision has 
been removed from the new 2008 Combined Code, which the 
Company will report against in 2010. 
Risk management and internal control 
The Board regards the identification and assessment of risks, 
together with the mitigating internal controls, to be fundamental to 
achieving the Group’s strategic objectives. It either directly or 
through its committees, sets objectives, performance targets and 
Centrica p38-42.indd   41 Centrica p38-42.indd   41 10/3/09   15:47:13 10/3/09   15:47:13 42
 
Corporate  
Governance Report

continued 
policies for management of key risks facing the Group. The Board 
has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control 
and risk management which is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the objectives and can 
provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
Across the Group, each business has a Risk Management 
Committee that seeks to identify, assess and advise on the 
management of risks. These assessments are reported to the 
Group Risk Management Committee to develop the Company’s 
overall risk profile including those risks that might affect the 
Company at Group level. Where significant risks have been 
identified, a control infrastructure has been established to ensure 
day-to-day monitoring and management of risks. The Centrica 
Executive Committee reviews the risks identified by the Group Risk 
Management Committee at its monthly meetings to assure itself 
that the significant risks facing the Group are being managed 
appropriately. Centrica Storage Limited, which is subject to 
undertakings given to the Secretary of State for Business, 
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, operates separately but to the 
same standards of internal control and risk management as the 
rest of the Group. The processes of newly-acquired companies 
are integrated with those of the Group. 
At each of its four meetings in 2008, the Audit Committee received 
a Group Risk Report providing an assessment of the key risks 
facing the Company including the adequacy of the associated 
controls. Details of the principal risks and uncertainties are set out 
on pages 31 to 34 of this report. In addition, the Audit Committee 
is provided with the results of internal audit reviews conducted by 
the internal audit function according to a plan approved by the 
Committee. These reports, supplemented by management 
presentations, enable the Audit Committee to track a number of 
issues, monitor performance against objectives and ensure that 
necessary actions are taken to remedy any significant failings or 
weaknesses identified from those reports. The Chairman of the 
Audit Committee reported the issues discussed and conclusions 
reached at the following Board meeting. 
The Board’s review of the system of internal control 
A process of hierarchical self-certification has been established 
throughout the Group whereby the effectiveness of internal 
controls and compliance with Group business principles and 
policies, are assessed. In 2008 the self-certification process was 
completed at half year and full year ends. The results of the annual 
process, together with the conclusions of the internal reviews by 
Internal Audit, informs the annual assessment performed by the 
Audit Committee.  
The Board, with the advice of the Audit Committee, has reviewed 
the effectiveness of the system of internal control, for the period 
from 1 January 2008 to the date of this report, and is satisfied that 
the Group complies with the Turnbull Guidance. The Board will 
continue routinely to challenge management in order to ensure 
that the system of internal control is constantly improving. 
Going concern 
After making enquiries, the Board has a reasonable expectation 
that the parent Company and the Group as a whole has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, the Board continues to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements. Further details 
of the Group’s liquidity position and going concern review are 
provided in note 4 of the Financial Statements on page 78. 
Directors’ responsibility statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing, in respect of each 
financial year, the Annual Report and Group Financial Statements. 
They are also responsible for ensuring that the Financial 
Statements give a true and fair view and that they have been 
properly prepared in accordance with applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted  
by the European Union. 
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and IFRS pursuant to 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulations. The parent Company Financial 
Statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985 and United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice. The Directors’ Report and the Remuneration 
Report have been prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985 and the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules.  
In preparing the Financial Statements the Directors are  
required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent; 
 state whether applicable accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Financial Statements; and 
 prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern  
basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group  
will continue in business.  
 
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the Financial Statements. The Directors 
also confirm that the Directors’ Report contained within the Annual 
Report includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable  
them to ensure that the Financial Statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 1985. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
Disclosure of information to auditors 
Each of the Directors who held office at the date of approval  
of this Directors’ Report confirm that: so far as they are aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware; and they have taken all steps that they 
ought to have taken as Directors to make themselves aware of  
any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.  
The Company has not entered into an auditor liability limitation 
agreement with its auditors during the year.

This report details the Company’s executive remuneration policy 
and includes information on the remuneration of the Directors for 
the financial year ended 31 December 2008. 
Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee 
Throughout 2008, the Remuneration Committee comprised  
Helen Alexander (Chairman), Roger Carr, Mary Francis, Andrew 
Mackenzie, Paul Rayner and Paul Walsh. The Committee  
met five times during the year. The formal terms of reference  
were reviewed during the year and are available on the  
Company’s website. 
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board,  
within formal terms of reference, on the policy and framework  
of executive remuneration and its cost to the Company.  
The Committee is also responsible for the implementation of 
remuneration policy and determining specific remuneration 
packages for each of the Executive Directors. It has access to  
the advice and views of the Group Human Resources Director,  
the Group Reward Director, the Chief Executive, the General 
Counsel & Company Secretary and external consultants.  
At its meetings in 2008, the Committee considered, amongst  
other things, the following: 
 the 2007 Remuneration Report; 
 achievement of performance targets in respect of the 2007 
Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) and the vesting of existing 
awards made under the long-term share-based incentive 
arrangements; 
 levels of base salary; 
 setting award levels and performance targets in respect of the 
2008 AIS and awards made under the long-term share-based 
incentive arrangements; 
 proposed terms of appointment of the new Managing Director 
Centrica Energy and Europe;  
 effectiveness of the AIS;  
 changes to the eligibility criteria of the Sharesave Scheme; and 
 the impact of the extended prohibited period for dealing in 
shares and the subsequent Rights Issue on the operation of the 
Group’s Share Schemes. 
During the year, Kepler Associates (Kepler) acted as independent 
executive remuneration adviser to the Committee, having been 
formally appointed in 2005. Kepler provided advice on executive 
compensation to assist in the formulation of the Committee’s 
recommendations. The Committee also consulted, but did not 
formally appoint, Towers Perrin.  
This report, which will be submitted to the forthcoming AGM for 
approval, explains how the Company has applied the principles  
of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) that 
relate to Directors’ remuneration during the year. No Director is 
involved in the determination of, or votes on, any matter relating  
to his or her own remuneration. 
Executive Directors’ remuneration policy and framework 
It is the role of the Committee to ensure that the Group’s 
remuneration policy and framework provides competitive reward 
for its Executive Directors and other senior executives, taking into 
account among other things, the Company’s performance, the 
markets in which it operates and pay and conditions elsewhere in 
the Group. 
In constructing the remuneration packages, the Committee aims  
to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
compensation for each executive. Accordingly, a significant 
proportion of the remuneration package depends on the 
attainment of demanding performance objectives, both short  
and long term. The AIS is designed to incentivise and reward  
the achievement of demanding financial and business-related 
objectives. Long-term share-based incentives are designed  
to align the interests of Executive Directors and other senior 
executives with the longer-term interests of Centrica’s 
shareholders by rewarding them for delivering sustained,  
increased shareholder value.  
The Committee reviews the packages and varies individual 
elements when appropriate from year to year. Those reviews are 
conducted with the assistance of Kepler and the internal advisers 
to: ensure that the remuneration arrangements continue to provide 
a strong alignment with the achievement of strategic objectives 
and the delivery of value to shareholders; reflect current best 
practice, while meeting the Group’s particular business needs;  
and enable the Group to continue to attract and retain high calibre 
management in a highly challenging business environment. In 
agreeing the level of base salaries and the performance-related 
elements of the remuneration package, the Committee considers 
the potential maximum remuneration that executives could receive. 
The Committee recently conducted a review against the above 
criteria and proposed changes to the future policy and framework 
of executive remuneration arrangements and, in particular, 
consulted with a number of major shareholders regarding changes 
to the operation of the AIS and Deferred and Matching Share 
Scheme (DMSS) going forward, as outlined later in this report. 
These changes become effective during 2009. 
In 2008, executive remuneration comprised base salary, AIS, an 
allocation of shares under the Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS), 
and an allocation of shares under the DMSS. No Executive Share 
Option Scheme (ESOS) grants were made during the year, 
although the Committee retains the discretion to make grants 
under the ESOS in the future if there are exceptional 
circumstances in which it considers it is appropriate to do so.  
A one-off allocation of shares under the Special Long Term 
Incentive Scheme (SLTIS) and a grant of options under the Special 
Executive Share Option Scheme (SESOS) were made to Mark 
Hanafin in accordance with the terms of his engagement. 
A minimum shareholding policy requires the retention of a value  
of shares as follows: the Chief Executive – twice his base salary;  
all other Executive Directors – 1.25 times their base salary;  
and, executives immediately below Board level – base salary. 
Achievement against this requirement for Executive Directors  
is set out in the table on page 51.

Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
 
The Centrica Pension Plan (CPP) which was formerly known as the 
Centrica Management Pension Scheme (CMPS) (a contributory 
final salary arrangement) was closed to new employees on  
30 June 2003. Phil Bentley and Jake Ulrich, having been 
employed prior to this date participated in the scheme during 
2008. Alternative arrangements are made for new employees, 
including Executive Directors, after the closing date referred to 
above. Full disclosure of the pension arrangements for the 
Executive Directors is given on page 55. 
The Committee believes that these arrangements, which are 
further explained below, are important in providing a potential 
remuneration package that will attract, retain and continue to 
motivate Executive Directors and other senior executives in  
a marketplace that is challenging and competitive in both 
commercial and human resource terms. It is currently intended 
that this remuneration policy and framework, which is fully 
endorsed by the Board, will continue for 2009. 
In 2008, the total emoluments of the Executive Directors, detailed 
on page 50, consisted of components in the following proportions: 
Relative proportions of the components of each Executive 
Director’s remuneration (%) in 2008 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note: Salary and benefits are the actual amounts received during 2008, in the case of Mark 
Hanafin since 14 July 2008, his date of appointment; AIS is that paid in respect of 2008 as 
reflected in the emoluments table on page 50; additional payments include interest payments  
as a result of the delayed operation of the DMSS; a salary supplement in lieu of pension paid  
to Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff; a cash payment to Mark Hanafin in lieu of bonus 
payable by his previous employer and a payment to Nick Luff in lieu of provision of a company 
car – see page 50; DMSS and LTIS are the estimated value in accordance with note 2 to the 
Financial Statements on pages 62 to 71, of the awards made in 2008, provided that all 
performance conditions are met in full at the end of the relevant performance periods; and 
pension, for Phil Bentley and Jake Ulrich in the Centrica Pension Plan (CPP), is the increase in 
actual transfer value for 2008 over the notional transfer value for 2007 less the Director’s 
contributions during 2008; pension for Sam Laidlaw is the actual amount of the contribution made 
by the Company to his personal pension. 
The total emoluments of the five senior executives immediately 
below Board level for 2008, calculated on the same basis as  
the emoluments of the Executive Directors detailed on page 50,  
fell into the following bands: 
Bands £000  Number of senior executives

400 – 499 1
 
Components of remuneration 
Base salary 
The Committee establishes a base salary for each Executive 
Director and other senior executives, determined by individual 
performance and having regard to market salary levels for similar 
positions in comparable companies based on information from 
independent sources. Base salaries are reviewed annually. In 
respect of 2009 it has been decided that no base salary increases 
will be awarded to the Executive Directors or to other members  
of the senior management team except where individuals have 
had a significant change to their responsibilities. For members  
of CPP, base salary is the only element of remuneration that  
is pensionable. 
Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) 
At the beginning of each year, the Committee reviews the AIS to 
ensure that it remains competitive in the marketplace, continues  
to incentivise the Executive Directors and other senior executives 
and aligns their interests with those of Centrica’s shareholders. For 
2008, the target and maximum bonus opportunity, together with 
the relative proportions of the components that made up the 
maximum bonus opportunity, were as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As shown in the chart above, a balanced range of measures is 
used to determine overall AIS performance. In 2008, the primary 
financial measure was Group Economic Profit (EP). In addition, 
each Business Unit had a number of business metrics focusing  
on  their key strategic priorities for the year. Example metrics 
include cost reduction targets, project completion and customer 
satisfaction levels. The Committee will also take into consideration 
performance in relation to corporate responsibility including health, 
safety and environmental matters when determining the level of 
bonuses to be paid. In line with current policy, a bonus will be 
forfeited if overall performance is deemed to be unsatisfactory.  
Twenty per cent of annual bonuses paid in respect of 2006 and 
2007 were deferred automatically and invested in the DMSS (see 
pages 46 and 47). To incentivise Executive Directors to focus on 
creating long-term value for shareholders and to deliver sustained 
high performance, the deferral in respect of 2008 and thereafter 
will increase from 20% to 40% of any AIS award for the Chief 
Executive and to 30% for Executive Directors and executives 
immediately below board level. 
In 2009, the maximum and target bonus opportunity will remain 
180% and 90% of base salary respectively for the Chief Executive 
and 150% and 75% of base salary respectively for the other 
Executive Directors.

Deferred and Matching Share Scheme (DMSS) 
An award under the DMSS is normally made to Executive 
Directors and other senior executives in April of each year. 
However, in 2008 the award was delayed due to the Executive 
Directors and other senior executives being subject to prolonged 
dealing restrictions as a result of the Company being in a 
prohibited period under the Company’s Model Code. 20% of the 
AIS paid in April 2008 was, however, deferred automatically at  
that time and subsequently invested in Centrica shares (deferred 
shares) once the Company had ceased to be in a prohibited 
period. Participants were also given the opportunity to invest an 
additional amount in Centrica shares (investment shares) funded 
from the actual bonus paid which, when added to the value of the 
deferred shares, would bring the total amount invested up to 50% 
of the individual’s maximum bonus entitlement in respect of 2007. 
In order to restore participants to the position they would have 
been in had the Company been able to operate the scheme under 
the normal timetable, the Committee determined that the three-
year period during which time the deferred and investment shares 
cannot be withdrawn would be deemed to have commenced in 
April 2008. Deferred and investment shares were matched with 
conditional shares (matching shares), which will only be released 
upon the achievement of a performance target (see table on page 
47). The performance target, is based on performance over three 
financial years and is unaffected by the delayed operation of the 
DMSS.  
For the purposes of matching, the investment shares are  
grossed up for income tax and National Insurance contributions. 
To provide a closer alignment with the interests of Centrica’s 
shareholders, the number of matching shares that are released 
following the satisfaction of the performance condition will be 
increased to reflect the dividends that would have been paid 
during the three-year performance period. In the event of a change 
of control the number of matching shares that vest will be subject 
to time-apportionment in line with best practice.  
Following consultation with major shareholders there will be a 
change to the operation of the DMSS for 2009 and thereafter.  
The performance condition for awards of matching shares will 
remain as three-year growth in EP. However, EP growth will be 
measured on a three-year point-to-point basis going forward, 
rather than a three-year cumulative calculation of growth.  
No changes are being proposed to the maximum bonus 
opportunities, the maximum matching opportunity of 2:1, the 
straight-line vesting criteria or the three-year EP growth target of 
25%. The Company believes that this change will encourage 
executives to invest in the scheme and so align their interests with 
Centrica’s shareholders and help drive long-term performance. 
Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) 
Under the LTIS conditional allocations of shares up to a maximum 
of 200% of base salary may be made to Executive Directors and 
other senior executives.  
In 2008, LTIS allocations equal to 200% of base salary were 
awarded to Executive Directors and, at lower rates, to other senior 
executives. Before approving the maximum permitted allocation 
for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee carefully 
considered the total shareholder return (TSR) and diluted adjusted 
earnings per share (EPS) performance conditions attaching to the 
award to ensure they were sufficiently stretching. Having reviewed 
the challenging growth and cost reduction targets inherent in the 
strategic plan, the Committee concluded that the proposed EPS 
growth target (ie to exceed the Retail Prices Index (RPI) by 30% or 
more over the performance period for full vesting) was sufficiently 
stretching. The maximum number of shares that could be 
transferred to each Executive Director upon satisfaction of the 
performance conditions in full appears on page 53. The release  
of allocations will be subject to the performance conditions as set 
out in the table on page 47.  
To create a closer alignment with the interests of Centrica’s 
shareholders, the number of shares that are released following  
the satisfaction of the performance conditions will be increased to 
reflect the dividends that would have been paid during the three-
year performance period. In the event of a change of control the 
number of shares that vest will be subject to time-apportionment 
in line with best practice. 
Prior to 2006, allocations of shares were made annually to 
Executive Directors and other senior executives under the old 
LTIS, in accordance with the remuneration policy adopted in 2001. 
Such allocations were subject to a performance condition as set 
out in the table on page 47. 
Prior to the release of share allocations under both the old and 
new LTIS arrangements, the Committee reviews whether the 
extent to which the performance conditions have been achieved  
is a genuine reflection of the Company’s financial performance.  
In assessing the extent of satisfaction of the performance 
conditions, the Committee uses data provided by Alithos Limited 
(an independent third party) in respect of comparative TSR and 
audited figures in respect of EPS.

Special Long Term Incentive Scheme (SLTIS) 
During 2008, under the SLTIS a one-off allocation was made to 
Mark Hanafin to replace awards from his previous employer, in 
accordance with the terms of his engagement. The SLTIS rules 
were based on the existing LTIS rules and enable an allocation to 
be made that will vest in two equal tranches on 28 February 2009 
and 2010, respectively. In accordance with the rules of the SLTIS 
there are no performance conditions attaching to the shares other 
than continued employment with the Company. In the event of a 
change of control the number of shares that vest will not be 
subject to time-apportionment. 
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
No grants of options under the ESOS were made during 2008. 
Details of options granted prior to 2008 and still held by Executive 
Directors are shown on page 54. 
If, and to the extent that, performance conditions are satisfied, 
options normally become exercisable three years after the date of 
grant and remain so until the tenth anniversary of grant. 
The EPS performance conditions in respect of options granted 
from 2001 to March 2004 under the ESOS (as set out in the table 
on page 47) could be measured annually for a further two years 
from the third anniversary of the date of grant of the options, with 
the performance conditions increasing proportionately. Having 
reviewed market practice, the Committee removed the provision 
for re-testing of performance measures in respect of all option 
grants from September 2004.  
Special Executive Share Option Scheme (SESOS) 
In 2008, a grant of unapproved options was made under the 
SESOS to Mark Hanafin to replace awards from his previous 
employer, in accordance with the terms of his engagement. The 
SESOS rules were based on the existing ESOS rules. However,  
in accordance with the rules of the SESOS the grant is not subject 
to any performance conditions and is immediately exercisable  
and will remain so until the tenth anniversary of grant. 
Performance conditions under IFRS 
Following the adoption of IFRS in 2005, the Committee agreed, 
having taken advice from Kepler and having consulted with the 
ABI and RREV, to continue with the financial target of EP  
in respect of the AIS and DMSS; and diluted adjusted EPS in 
respect of the ESOS and the new LTIS, both subject to certain 
adjustments to the figures calculated in accordance with IFRS.  
It was agreed that for the purposes of determining performance in 
respect of those schemes, the relevant figures produced under 
IFRS should be adjusted for exceptional items and certain  
re-measurements arising on the application of IAS 32 and IAS 39. 
Rights Issue 
In December 2008 the performance conditions under the LTIS, 
ESOS and the DMSS were reviewed by the Committee and 
appropriate adjustments were made to reflect the dilutive effect  
of the Rights Issue. Previously reported EPS was restated in 
accordance with IAS 33 and dividends per share for the six 
months ended 30 June 2008, and the preceding five years  
were also restated to take account of the bonus element of  
the Rights Issue. TSR was similarly adjusted by a rate of 0.8902, 
being the formally agreed Rights Issue adjustment formula 
determined by dividing the theoretical ex-rights price (238.36p)  
by the closing share price on the last date the shares traded  
cum-rights (267.75p).

Funding of share schemes  
It is the Company’s current intention to satisfy the requirements of 
its share schemes, in a method best suited to the interests of the 
Company, either by acquiring shares in the market or, subject to 
institutional guidelines, issuing new shares or using shares held in 
treasury. To satisfy the release of shares under the LTIS and in 
order to meet the requirements of the ESOS in 2008, newly 
issued shares were used. Shares were bought in the market and 
are held in Trust to satisfy allocations made under the SLTIS and 
SESOS during 2008. 
Pension 
The pension arrangements of the Executive Directors are fully 
disclosed on page 55. 
Other employment benefits 
In common with other senior management, Executive Directors 
are entitled to a range of benefits, including a company car, life 
assurance, private medical insurance and a financial counselling 
scheme. During the year, Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Jake 
Ulrich were also provided with a driver for limited personal 
mileage. Such benefits are subject to financial limits as set  
out in appropriate policies. They are also eligible to participate  
in the Company’s HMRC-approved Sharesave Scheme and 
Share Incentive Plan, which are open to all eligible employees  
on the same basis, providing a long-term savings and  
investment opportunity. 
Service contracts 
It is the Company’s policy that the notice period in Executive 
Directors’ service contracts does not exceed one year. The 
Executive Directors’ service contracts have no fixed term but 
provide that either the Director or the Company may terminate  
the employment by giving one year’s written notice and that the 
Company may pay compensation in lieu of notice.  
In the case of new external appointments to the Board, the 
Committee retains a level of flexibility, as permitted by the Code,  
in order to attract and retain suitable candidates. It therefore 
reserves the right to offer contracts which contain an initial notice 
period in excess of one year, provided that at the end of the first 
such period the notice reduces to one year. The Committee 
exercised this discretion in respect of the appointment of Sam 
Laidlaw on 1 July 2006, Nick Luff on 1 March 2007 and Mark 
Hanafin on 14 July 2008. Each has a service contract that 
contains a notice period of two years, which reduces to one year 
on the second anniversary of their respective date of appointment. 
The notice period contained in Sam Laidlaw’s contract has now 
reduced to one year. 
The dates of the Executive Directors’ service contracts are set out 
in the table on page 50. 
External appointments of Executive Directors 
The Board believes that experience of other companies’ practices 
and challenges is valuable both for the personal development of 
its Executive Directors and for the Company.  
It is therefore the Company’s policy to allow each Executive 
Director to accept one non-executive directorship of another 
company, although the Board retains the discretion to vary this 
policy. Fees received in respect of external appointments are 
retained by the individual Director. 
In 2008, Phil Bentley received £67,250 as a non-executive 
director of Kingfisher plc, Sam Laidlaw received £76,667 as  
a non-executive director of HSBC Holdings plc and Nick Luff 
received £47,000 as a non-executive director of QinetiQ  
Group plc. 
Non-Executive Directors 
Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman do not have 
service contracts. Their appointment is subject to the Articles of 
Association and the dates they joined the Board are shown in the 
table on page 50. Roger Carr’s letter of appointment contains a 
six-month notice period. The Chairman’s fees are approved by 
the Remuneration Committee. The fees of the Non-Executive 
Directors are approved by the Executive Committee, whose 
current members are: the Executive Directors (Sam Laidlaw,  
Phil Bentley, Mark Hanafin and Nick Luff) and five other senior 
executives (Grant Dawson, Deryk King, Catherine May, Anne 
Minto and Chris Weston) all of whose biographies are included  
on pages 36 and 37. 
Centrica’s policy on Non-Executive Directors’ fees takes into 
account the need to attract individuals of the right calibre and 
experience, their responsibilities and time commitment, as 
envisaged in the Code, and the level of fees paid by other 
companies.  
The annual fees currently payable to the Non-Executive  
Directors are:  
Chairman £450,000
Other Non-Executive Directors £60,000
Additional fees: 
Chairman of Audit Committee £18,000
Chairman of Remuneration Committee £12,000
Chairman of Corporate Responsibility Committee £12,000
Senior Independent Director £20,000
 
The fees are normally reviewed every two years and were last 
reviewed in July 2007. The Non-Executive Directors, including  
the Chairman, do not participate in any of the Company’s share 
schemes, incentive plans or pension schemes. 
The Remuneration Report from page 44 to page 49 up to this 
statement has not been audited. From this point until the end of 
the report on page 55, the disclosures, with the exception of the

(i) Of the AIS bonus agreed by the Committee in respect of Sam Laidlaw and other Executive Directors, 60% and 70% respectively is paid in cash and  
is included above. 40% of the agreed bonus for Sam Laidlaw (£419,436) and 30% of the agreed bonus for each Executive Director (range between £86,045 and 
£195,876) is deferred automatically and invested as deferred shares in the Deferred and Matching Share Scheme (DMSS) – see pages 51 and 52. Mark Hanafin was 
appointed to the Board on 14 July 2008 and received AIS pro-rated for the period from his date of appointment, subject to 30% deferral and investment as deferred 
shares, as outlined above. Jake Ulrich retired from the Company on 31 July 2008 and received AIS pro-rated for the period to his date of retirement subject to 20% 
deferral in accordance with the rules of the AIS at that time (AIS figure shown is for the period from 1 January to 12 May 2008, being his date of resignation from the 
Board). Jake Ulrich was not entitled to participate in the DMSS during 2008. 
(ii) Sam Laidlaw is contractually entitled to a salary supplement of 40% of base pay in lieu of any pension provision. This amounted to £362,560 in 2008 (2007: £349,180) of 
which £232,500 (2007: £168,750) was paid directly by the Company into his personal pension plan and is disclosed in the notes on page 55. The balance of £130,060 
(2007: £180,430) is included above under the heading ‘Additional payments’. Mark Hanafin and Nick Luff are contractually entitled to a salary supplement of 40% and 
30% of base pay respectively in lieu of any pension provision. In addition, cash payments to Mark Hanafin in lieu of bonus payable by his previous employer (for the 
period 1 January to 14 July 2008) and Nick Luff in lieu of the provision of a company car are also included above under the heading ’Additional payments’. 
(iii) Executive and past Directors received a taxable interest payment in October 2008 at the rate of 6.25% in respect of the notional interest accrued on the 20% of the 
annual bonus, paid in April 2008 under the AIS, which was deferred automatically at that time in accordance with the rules of the DMSS and held until the DMSS could 
be operated. The purchase of deferred and investment shares and the conditional award of matching shares were made on 13 October 2008.  
(iv) Benefits include all taxable benefits arising from employment by the Company, including the provision of a car (Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Jake Ulrich were also 
provided with a driver for limited personal mileage), financial counselling, medical insurance and life assurance premiums. 
(v) The following are excluded from the table above: 
(a) pensions – see page 55; 
(b) share options – see page 54. No Executive Director exercised share options during the year. The aggregate of the amount of gains made by Executive Directors  
on the exercise of share options for 2007 was £615,839; and 
(c) Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) – see pages 51 and 53. The aggregate value of shares vested to Executive Directors under the LTIS was £587,332 
(2007: £1,000,974). 
(vi) The 2008 total emoluments figure in respect of Mark Hanafin is for the period from 14 July 2008 (being the date of his appointment to the Board) to 31 December 2008. 
(vii) The 2007 total emoluments figure in respect of Nick Luff is for the ten-month period from 1 March 2007 (being the date of his appointment to the Board) to  
31 December 2007. It includes an additional payment of £145,000 (being a salary supplement of 30% of base pay in lieu of any pension provision). 
(viii) The 2008 total emoluments figure in respect of Jake Ulrich is for the period from 1 January 2008 to 12 May 2008 (being the date of his resignation from the Board).  
He was also paid £77,164 under the rules of the AIS in respect of the period 13 May to 31 July 2008, the date he left the Company.

(i) Shareholdings, DMSS matching shares, LTIS and SLTIS allocations shown as at 31 December 2008, incorporate the impact of the Rights Issue, effective from  
15 December 2008. For every eight existing Centrica plc shares held on 14 November 2008, shareholders received the right to buy three new Centrica plc shares at 160 
pence per share. Conditional share awards, including the DMSS matching shares and LTIS allocations, were subject to an adjustment to reflect the dilutive effect of the 
Rights Issue on these awards and were multiplied by a factor of 1.1233.  
(ii) DMSS matching shares and LTIS allocations for Jake Ulrich have been time-apportioned to his date of leaving the Company on 31 July 2008, and adjusted to 
incorporate the impact of the Rights Issue, as outlined in note (i). 
(iii) Shareholdings, DMSS matching shares and LTIS allocations are shown as at 1 January 2008 or in the case of Mark Hanafin, at 14 July 2008, his date of appointment. 
(iv) As at 25 February 2009, the shareholdings of Phil Bentley, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff had each increased by 138 shares acquired through the Share Incentive Plan. 
(v) Executive and past Directors’ shareholdings shown above include those held in the Share Incentive Plan and the deferred and investment shares held in the DMSS. 
Matching shares held in the DMSS and shares held in the LTIS and SLTIS are provided separately in the table above and in more detail in their respective tables on pages 
52 and 53. 
(vi) LTIS allocations for Mark Hanafin include an allocation of 372,382 shares made for the year under the LTIS and subject to the performance conditions set out in the table 
on page 47. An additional 188,260 shares were awarded to Mark Hanafin under SLTIS as part of the terms of his engagement; vesting of these shares will occur in two 
equal tranches, on 28 February 2009 and 2010 respectively, provided that he remains in continued employment with the Company. 
From 1 January 2008 to 25 February 2009, none of the Directors had any interests in the securities of the Company’s subsidiary or 
associated undertakings. During the period from 1 January 2009 to 25 February 2009 there were no changes to the Directors’ interests 
in shares apart from the acquisitions of shares under the Share Incentive Plan as outlined in note (iv) above. 
Executive Directors’ minimum shareholding policy 
As stated on page 44, the Executive Directors are required to hold shares with a value based on a multiple of their base salary. Under 
that policy the Executive Directors have a period of five years in which to achieve their minimum shareholding requirement. The table 
below sets out, in respect of each Executive Director, their individual requirement and achievement as at 31 December 2008 against 
that requirement.

(i) Executive and past Directors’ DMSS allocations are shown as at 31 December 2008 and incorporate the impact of the Rights Issue, effective from 15 December 2008. 
For every eight existing DMSS deferred and investment shares held on 14 November 2008, Executive Directors received the Right (the Rights) to three new Centrica plc 
shares at 160 pence per share. The Rights attaching to deferred shares were automatically tail-swallowed (ie such number of Rights were sold as was necessary to raise 
sufficient funds to take up the balance of unsold Rights), in accordance with the rules of the scheme, and the Rights attaching to investment shares were treated in 
accordance with the instructions of the Executive or past Director, who had the same choices as ordinary shareholders. Conditional share awards, including the DMSS 
matching shares, were subject to an adjustment to reflect the dilutive effect of the Rights Issue and were multiplied by a factor of 1.1233 and their respective market 
prices at allocation were multiplied by a factor of 0.8902. 
(ii) In 2007 and 2008, 20% of gross bonus paid (before the deduction of income tax and National Insurance contributions) was automatically deferred and invested in 
Centrica shares (deferred shares). Participants have the opportunity to make a further investment (investment shares), funded from net annual bonus, so that the 
maximum total investment (on a gross basis) is 50% of the individual’s maximum bonus entitlement for the preceding year. 
(iii) At allocation the calculation of the conditional matching shares is made on a gross basis. Investment shares are grossed up (to reflect the impact of income tax and 
National Insurance contributions) for the calculation of the matching shares so that the deferred and investment shares are matched on the same basis. The number of 
matching shares that vest will be determined on a straight-line basis from a zero match for no growth in economic profit to a two-times match for growth of 25% or 
above over a three-year period. The number of matching shares that will be released following the satisfaction of the performance condition will be increased to reflect the 
dividends that would have been paid during the three-year performance period. Dividends are paid on the deferred and investment shares to the participants on the 
normal dividend payment date. 
(iv) During 2008, operation of the DMSS was delayed due to the Executive Directors and other senior executives being subject to dealing restrictions as a result of the 
Company being in a prolonged prohibited period under the Company’s Model Code. 20% of the annual bonus payable in April 2008 under the AIS was, however, 
deferred automatically at that time and held until the DMSS could be operated. The purchase of deferred and investment shares and the conditional award of matching 
shares were made on 13 October 2008. 
(v) DMSS matching shares awarded to Jake Ulrich on 4 April 2007 have been time-apportioned to his date of leaving the Company on 31 July 2008, and adjusted  
to incorporate the impact of the Rights Issue, as outlined in note (i).

(i) Executive and past Directors’ vested and unvested LTIS and SLTIS allocations are shown, for comparative purposes, as at 31 December 2008 and incorporate the 
impact of the Rights Issue, effective from 15 December 2008. Allocations were subject to an adjustment to reflect the dilutive effect of the Rights Issue and were 
multiplied by a factor of 1.1233 and the respective market price at allocation and vesting date, where applicable, were multiplied by a factor of 0.8902. 
(ii) At the end of the performance period to 31 March 2008, the Company ranked 45th in the relevant comparator group. Consequently, 57.5% of the original allocations 
were released to participants on 3 April 2008. The released shares were subject to income tax at the individual’s marginal rate and National Insurance contributions (NICs) 
at the rate of 1%, based on the unadjusted market value of the shares at the date of vesting. The income tax and NICs liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient 
shares and, accordingly, the Executive Directors only received the net number of shares following disposal, which, to the extent retained and subject to the impact of the 
Rights Issue effective on 15 December 2008, is reflected in the shareholdings as at 31 December 2008 on page 51. 
(iii) At the end of the performance period the Company’s TSR performance will be assessed against that of the relevant LTIS comparator group. If, and to the extent that the 
performance conditions are met, the relevant number of shares will be released to the Directors at the Trustee’s discretion as soon as practicable thereafter. 
(iv) The percentage of the allocation eventually to vest is dependent on the satisfaction of performance criteria over a three-year performance period: half of the shares (EPS 
shares) will be subject to a performance condition based on the Group’s adjusted EPS growth relative to the growth in RPI. EPS growth will be calculated by comparing 
the Group’s adjusted EPS figure for the financial period preceding the date of allocation with that for the financial period three years later; and half of the shares will be 
determined by the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to the other companies comprising the LTIS comparator group – the FTSE 100 at the 
start of the performance period (the TSR shares). At the end of the performance period, the TSR performance condition will be measured, the same calculation made for 
all the other 99 companies in the LTIS comparator group and a ranking list will be compiled. 
(v) The first awards under the new LTIS (approval was sought and given by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2006) were made to participants other than the 
Executive Directors on 3 April 2006 (on the date that allocations would normally be made under the previous LTIS and within the 42-day period following the release  
of the Company’s annual results). The awards to the Executive Directors then in office could only be made after shareholder approval, but in order to align their awards 
with those of other participants, their first awards were deemed to have been made on 3 April 2006 for all purposes of the new LTIS, including the calculation of the 
number of shares, the adjusted EPS and relative TSR performance tests and the three-year vesting period.  
(vi) Shares were awarded to Mark Hanafin under the terms of the SLTIS on 26 September 2008. In accordance with the rules of the SLTIS there are no performance 
conditions attaching to the shares other than continued employment with the Company. In the event of a change of control the number of shares that vest  
will not be subject to time-apportionment. 
(vii) Allocations made to Jake Ulrich on 3 April 2006 (278,849) and 4 April 2007 (295,851), which remained outstanding on 12 May 2008, being the date of his resignation 
from the Board, have been time-apportioned to his date of leaving the Company on 31 July 2008 and adjusted to incorporate the impact of the Rights Issue, as outlined 
in note (i). 
The following graph, provided by Alithos Limited (an independent third party), shows the TSR performance of the Company and that of

(i) Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)  
Options were granted to the Executive Directors under the terms of the ESOS on 31 May 2001, 2 April 2002, 24 March 2003, 18 March 2004, 1 April 2005 and  
3 April 2006. Details of the operation of the scheme are provided on pages 47 and 48. 
(ii) Special Executive Share Option Scheme (SESOS) 
 Options were granted to Mark Hanafin under the terms of the SESOS on 26 September 2008. In accordance with the rules of the SESOS the grant is not subject  
to any performance conditions and is immediately exercisable and will normally remain so until the tenth anniversary of grant. 
(iii) Sharesave Scheme  
The Company operates an HMRC-approved all-employee savings-related share option scheme in the UK. The scheme is designed to provide a long-term savings and 
investment opportunity for employees. 
(iv) Executive and past Directors’ ESOS, SESOS and Sharesave grants and their respective option prices are shown as at 1 January 2008 or in the case of Mark Hanafin, at 
14 July 2008, his date of appointment. 
(v) Executive and past Directors’ ESOS, SESOS and Sharesave grants and their respective option prices are shown as at 31 December 2008, and incorporate the impact  
of the Rights Issue, effective from 15 December 2008. Conditional awards, including ESOS, SESOS and Sharesave grants were subject to an adjustment to reflect the 
dilutive effect of the Rights Issue and the number of shares under option was multiplied by a factor of 1.1233 and the respective option price was multiplied by a factor  
of 0.8902. 
(vi) The Committee exercised its discretion, in accordance with the rules of the ESOS, to permit Jake Ulrich to exercise his options up to six months from the third 
anniversary of the last date on which an option was granted ie at any time before 3 October 2009. All of his options are exercisable except those granted in 2006  
which have not yet met the relevant performance conditions. Under the rules of the Sharesave his outstanding options were exercisable until 31 January 2009. 
The closing price of a Centrica ordinary share on the last trading day of 2008 (31 December) was 266 pence. The range during the  
year was 207.50 pence (low) and 316 pence (high), (355 pence prior to adjustment for the bonus element of the Rights Issue).

Directors’ pensions 
Of the five Executive Directors who served during 2008, Phil Bentley and Jake Ulrich are members of the Centrica Pension Plan (CPP) 
which was formerly known as the Centrica Management Pension Scheme (CMPS). Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff, who all 
joined the Company in recent years, are not members of any of Centrica’s pension schemes.  
Centrica Pension Plan (CPP) 
The CPP is a funded, HMRC-registered, final salary, occupational pension scheme. Its rules provide for the following main features: 
 normal retirement at age 62; 
 right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 60 at own request with employer consent, or on leaving 
service at Company’s request after age 55;  
 life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary for death in service; 
 spouse’s pension on death in service payable at the rate of 50% of the member’s prospective pension and, on death after retirement, 
half of the accrued pension. Children’s pensions are also payable; 
 members’ contributions payable at the rate of 6% of pensionable earnings. Contributions made by the Executive Directors who are 
also members of the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme (CUPS) are payable at the rate of 6% of their total pensionable earnings 
above the scheme earnings cap;  
 pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health; 
 pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI (a maximum of 6% applies to 
pension accrued after 6 April 2004); and 
 no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values. 
All registered scheme benefits are subject to HMRC guidelines. As a result of the changes introduced by Centrica following the 2004 
Finance Act, benefits at 6 April 2006 from the registered scheme, the CPP, could not exceed the Lifetime Allowance (£1.5 million for  
the 2006/07 tax year) after taking account of retained benefits from all other sources notified to Centrica at this time. The CUPS 
provides any additional benefits in excess of the maximum amount that could be provided through the CPP on the members’ 
uncapped pensionable earnings. The benefits that arise under CUPS are treated as being subject to the same rules as apply in respect 
of the registered portion of members’ benefits. No individual will receive benefits from Centrica which, when added to their retained 
benefits elsewhere at 6 April 2006, exceed two-thirds of their final pensionable earnings. CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are 
secured by a charge over certain Centrica assets. An appropriate provision in respect of the accrued value of these benefits has been 
made in the Company’s balance sheet.

(i) Accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 62, based on eligible service to, and pensionable salary at, 31 December 2008. The pension 
accrual rates for 2008 for Phil Bentley and Jake Ulrich were 2.65% and 3.71% respectively. 
(ii) The increase in accrued pension has been adjusted to exclude inflation by revaluing the accrued pension as at 31 December 2007 by the rate of inflation (5.0%) and 
deducting this from the accrued pension as at 31 December 2008. The rate of inflation used was 5.0%, the annual rate to 30 September 2008, the date used for pension 
increases under the scheme. 
(iii) Jake Ulrich retired on 31 July 2008. Under the rules of the CPP and CUPS Jake Ulrich (aged 55 years 5 months on leaving) was entitled to an actuarially reduced pension 
on the standard terms for a normal deferred leaver taking payment of their pension before normal retirement age.  
(iv) The reduction in the transfer values less contributions at 31 December 2008 is due to the change in market conditions which determine the calculation of transfer values. 
A change in the transfer value calculation basis was also introduced in September 2008. Had the transfer value been calculated on the accrued pension at 31 December 
2008 but using the calculation basis in force at 31 December 2007, the transfer value of the accrued pension would have amounted to £1,032,100 for Phil Bentley and 
£4,437,900 for Jake Ulrich. The difference in the transfer value less contributions would have amounted to (£399,620) for Phil Bentley and £1,217,155 for Jake Ulrich. 
 
Pay in lieu of pension provision 
Under the terms of their contracts of employment, Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff are entitled to a salary supplement in lieu 
of pension provision. Mark Hanafin and Sam Laidlaw are each entitled to 40% of base salary, while Nick Luff is entitled to 30% of base 
salary. With the exception of £232,500 paid directly by the Company into Sam Laidlaw’s personal pension plan, these amounts are 
disclosed in the Directors’ emoluments table on page 50.

Independent Auditors’ 
Report to the members  
of Centrica plc  
 
Independent Auditors’ report to the members of  
Centrica plc 
We have audited the Group Financial Statements of Centrica plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the Group 
Income Statement, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Cash 
Flow Statement, the Group Statement of Recognised Income and 
Expense and the related notes. These Group Financial Statements 
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the parent Company Financial 
Statements of Centrica plc for the year ended 31 December 2008 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that 
is described as having been audited. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report  
and the Group Financial Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  
as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement  
of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the Group Financial Statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, 
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 
of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, 
in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or in 
to whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group Financial 
Statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group 
Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
We also report to you whether, in our opinion the information  
given in the Directors’ Report (comprising the Directors’ Report – 
Business Review and the Directors’ Report – Governance) is 
consistent with the Group Financial Statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not  
received all the information and explanations we require for our 
audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
Combined Code (2006) specified for our review by the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does 
not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s 
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group Financial 
Statements. The other information comprises only – At a Glance, 
Financial Highlights, the Chairman’s Statement, the Directors’ 
Report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
the Gas and Liquids Reserves, Five Year Record and Shareholder 
Information. We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the Group Financial Statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,  
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group 
Financial Statements. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors  
in the preparation of the Group Financial Statements, and of  
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary  
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the Group Financial Statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group 
Financial Statements. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
 the Group Financial Statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union,  
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008  
and of its result and cash flows for the year then ended;  
 the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of  
the IAS Regulation; and 
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent  
with the Group Financial Statements.

foreign currencies accounting policy set out in note 2. 
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT  
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of 
these consolidated Financial Statements are set out below.  
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years 
presented, unless otherwise stated.  
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the European Union (EU) and therefore comply with 
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
The consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and 
available-for-sale financial assets, and the assets and liabilities of 
the Group pension schemes that have been measured at fair 
value. The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that 
are hedged items in fair value hedges, and are otherwise carried at 
cost, are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable 
to the risks that are being hedged. The principal accounting 
policies adopted are set out below. 
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS 
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the processes of 
applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a 
higher degree of judgement, complexity or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated 
Financial Statements are described in note 3. 
(a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective 
in 2008 
In 2008 an amendment to IAS 39, Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures was issued. The amendment was endorsed by the EU 
on 15 October 2008. The amendment permits entities to reclassify 
certain financial assets held for trading to either the held to 
maturity, loans and receivables or available-for-sale categories.  
The amendment also allows transfers of certain financial assets 
from available-for-sale to loans and receivables. The adoption of 
the amendment has had no impact on the Financial Statements  
of the Group.  
Three interpretations issued by the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for the current 
period. These are IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share 
Transactions, IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements and 
IFRIC 14, IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum 
Funding Requirements and their Interaction. The adoption of these 
interpretations has not led to any changes in the Group’s 
accounting policies and has had no impact on the Financial 
Statements of the Group. 
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations that are 
not yet effective and that have not been early adopted 
by the Group 
At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the 
following standards, amendments to existing standards and 
interpretations which have not been applied in these Financial 
Statements were in issue but not yet effective:  
 IAS 23 (Amendment), Borrowing Costs, effective from 1 January 
2009. The amendment requires an entity to capitalise borrowing 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
production of a qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial 
period of time to get ready for use or sale) as part of the cost of 
that asset. The option of immediately expensing such borrowing 
costs will be removed. The Group will adopt IAS 23 (Amended) 
from 1 January 2009, which will require a change to the Group’s 
existing accounting policy, where such costs are immediately 
expensed. The Group will adopt IAS 23 (Amended) retrospectively 
and apply a commencement date of 1 January 2008 for 
qualifying projects subject to borrowing cost capitalisation. 
Based on current investment plans, the estimated impact of 
adopting IAS 23 (Amended) in 2009 would be to capitalise 
approximately £30 million of borrowing costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition, construction and production of qualifying 
assets, resulting in an increase to the net book value of property, 
plant and equipment by approximately £30 million and a 
reduction to interest expense by approximately £30 million for 
the year ended 31 December 2009. The impact on 
comparatives would be an increase in the net book value of 
property, plant and equipment for borrowing costs capitalised 
and a reduction to interest expense of approximately £10 million; 
 IFRS 8, Operating Segments, effective from 1 January 2009. 
This standard replaces IAS 14, Segment Reporting and requires 
segmental information reported to be based on that which 
Directors use internally for evaluating the performance of 
operating segments. The Group will adopt IFRS 8 with effect 
from 1 January 2009. The impact of adopting IFRS 8 on the 
Group is under assessment; 
 ‘Improvements to IFRSs’ contains amendments to various 
existing standards. The amendments are effective, in most 
cases, from 1 January 2009, or otherwise for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The impact of adopting 
‘Improvements to IFRSs’ will result in the Group reclassifying 
certain derivative financial assets and certain derivative financial 
liabilities from current to non-current in the Group’s Balance 
Sheet with effect from 1 January 2009;    
 IFRS 3 (Revised), Business Combinations, effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 subject to EU 
endorsement. The revised standard continues to apply the 
acquisition method to business combinations with some 
significant changes. For example, all payments to purchase a 
business are to be recorded at fair value at acquisition date,  
with contingent payments classified as debt subsequently re-
measured through the income statement. All acquisition-related 
costs should be expensed. There is a choice on an acquisition-
by-acquisition basis to measure the non-controlling interest in 
Centrica p58-144.indd   62 Centrica p58-144.indd   62 10/3/09   15:48:07 10/3/09   15:48:07 63

the acquiree at either fair value or at the non-controlling 
interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets.  
The Group will adopt IFRS 3 (Revised) prospectively to all 
business combinations from 1 January 2010, subject to  
EU endorsement;  
 IAS 27 (Revised), Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements, effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 July 2009, subject to EU endorsement. The revised standard 
requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling 
interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control 
and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains 
and losses. The revised standard also specifies the accounting 
when control is lost. Any remaining interest in the entity is  
re-measured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised  
in profit or loss. The Group will apply IAS 27 (Revised) 
prospectively from 1 January 2010, subject to EU  
endorsement; and 
 IFRIC 18, Transfers of Assets from Customers, issued on  
29 January 2009, subject to EU endorsement. This 
interpretation clarifies the accounting for agreements in which an 
entity receives from a customer an item of property, plant and 
equipment that the entity must use either to connect the 
customer to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing 
access to a supply of goods or services, such as a supply of 
electricity or gas. It also applies to agreements in which an entity 
receives cash from a customer which must be used to acquire 
or construct the item of property, plant and equipment in order 
to connect the customer to a network or provide the customer 
with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services. IFRIC 18 
requires entities to apply the interpretation prospectively to 
transfers of assets from customers received on or after  
1 July 2009. The impact to the Group of adopting IFRIC 18  
is under assessment. 
 
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the following 
amendments to standards and interpretations in future periods, 
which were also in issue but not effective at the date of 
authorisation of these Financial Statements, will have no material 
impact on the Financial Statements of the Group:  
 IAS 1 (Revised), Presentation of Financial Statements, effective 
from 1 January 2009; 
 IAS 32 (Amendment), Financial Instruments: Presentation and 
IAS 1 (Amendment), Presentation of Financial Statements – 
Puttable financial instruments and obligations arising on 
liquidation, effective from 1 January 2009, subject to  
EU endorsement; 
 IFRS 2 (Amendment), Share Based Payment – Vesting 
Conditions and Cancellations, effective from 1 January 2009; 
 IFRIC 13, Customer Loyalty Programmes, effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008;  
 IFRIC 15, Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, 
effective from 1 January 2009, subject to EU endorsement;  
 IFRIC 16, Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation, 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 October 
2008, subject to EU endorsement;  
 IFRIC 17, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners, effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, subject to 
EU endorsement; 
 IFRS 1 (Amendment), First-time Adoption of IFRS, effective from 
1 January 2009, subject to EU endorsement; and 
 IAS 39 (Amendment), Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items, effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, subject to EU 
endorsement.  
 
(c) Changes of accounting presentation 
The Group has adopted the following change of accounting 
presentation in the year: 
 Centrica Storage enters into gas sales and gas purchases as 
part of its normal trading activity to optimise the performance  
of the storage facility. Sales and purchases relating to this 
optimisation activity are presented net within revenue. Previously 
the Group presented such activity gross within revenue and cost 
of sales with sales reported as revenue and purchases reported 
as cost of sales. The Directors consider the change of 
presentation better reflects the nature of this activity. The impact 
of the change of accounting presentation is to reduce Group 
revenue and cost of sales by £263 million in 2008. The impact 
on comparatives is to reduce Group revenue and cost of sales 
by £70 million. 
 
(d) Income statement presentation 
The Group’s Income Statement and segmental note separately 
identify the effects of re-measurement of certain financial 
instruments, and items which are exceptional, in order to provide 
readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s 
underlying performance, as described below. 
Certain re-measurements 
As part of its energy procurement activities the Group enters into  
a range of commodity contracts designed to achieve security of 
energy supply. These contracts comprise both purchases and 
sales and cover a wide range of volumes, prices and timescales. 
The majority of the underlying supply comes from high volume 
long-term contracts which are complemented by short-term 
arrangements. These short-term contracts are entered into for the 
purpose of balancing energy supplies and customer demand and 
to optimise the price paid by the Group. Short-term demand can 
vary significantly as a result of factors such as weather, power 
generation profiles and short-term movements in market prices. 
Many of the energy procurement contracts are held for the 
purpose of receipt or delivery of commodities in accordance with 
the Group’s purchase, sale or usage requirements and are 
therefore out of scope of IAS 39. However, a number of contracts 
are considered to be derivative financial instruments and are 
required to be fair valued under IAS 39, primarily because their 
terms include the ability to trade elements of the contracted 
volumes on a net-settled basis.  
The Group has shown the fair value adjustments arising on these 
contracts separately in the certain re-measurements column.  
This is because the intention of management is, subject to short-
term demand balancing, to use these energy supplies to meet 
customer demand. Accordingly, management believes the ultimate 
net charge to cost of sales will be consistent with the price of 
energy agreed in these contracts and that the fair value 
adjustments will reverse as the energy is supplied over the life  
of the contract. This makes the fair value re-measurements very 
different in nature from costs arising from the physical delivery  
of energy in the period. 
Centrica p58-144.indd   63 Centrica p58-144.indd   63 10/3/09   15:48:07 10/3/09   15:48:07 64
 
Notes to the  
Financial Statements  
continued 
 
At the balance sheet date the fair value represents the difference 
between the prices agreed in the respective contracts and the 
actual or anticipated market price of acquiring the same amount of 
energy on the open market. The movement in the fair value taken 
to certain re-measurements in the Income Statement represents 
the unwind of the contracted volume delivered or consumed 
during the period, combined with the change in fair value of future 
contracted energy as a result of movements in forward energy 
prices during the year.  
These adjustments represent the significant majority of the items 
included in certain re-measurements. In addition to these, 
however, the Group has identified a number of comparable 
contractual arrangements where the difference between the price 
which the Group expects to pay or receive under a contract and 
the market price is required to be fair valued by IAS 39. These 
additional items relate to cross-border transportation or 
transmission capacity, storage capacity and contracts relating  
to the sale of energy by-products, on which economic value  
has been created which is not wholly recognised under the 
requirements of IAS 39. For these arrangements the related  
fair value adjustments are also included under certain  
re-measurements.  
These arrangements are managed separately from proprietary 
energy trading activities where trades are entered into 
speculatively for the purpose of making profits in their own right. 
These proprietary trades are included in the results before certain 
re-measurements. 
Exceptional items 
As permitted by IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, 
certain items are presented separately. The items that the Group 
separately presents as exceptional are items which are of a non-
recurring nature and, in the judgement of the Directors, need to  
be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature, size or incidence  
in order to obtain a clear and consistent presentation of the 
Group’s underlying business performance. Items which may be 
considered exceptional in nature include disposals of businesses, 
business restructurings, the renegotiation of significant contracts 
and asset write-downs.  
Basis of consolidation 
The Group Financial Statements consolidate the Financial 
Statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each  
year, and incorporate the results of its share of jointly controlled 
entities and associates using the equity method of accounting.  
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the  
year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition or up  
to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, 
associates and jointly controlled entities to bring the accounting 
policies used into line with those used by the Group. 
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses  
are eliminated on consolidation.  
Interests in joint ventures 
A jointly controlled entity is a joint venture which involves  
the establishment of an entity to engage in economic activity, 
which the Group jointly controls with its fellow venturers. Under the 
equity method, investments in jointly controlled entities are carried 
at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net 
assets of the jointly controlled entity, less any impairment in value 
in individual investments. The Income Statement reflects the 
Group’s share of the results of operations after tax of the jointly 
controlled entity. 
Certain of the Group’s exploration and production activity is 
conducted through joint ventures where the venturers have  
a direct interest in and jointly control the assets of the venture.  
The results, assets, liabilities and cash flows of these jointly 
controlled assets are included in the consolidated Financial 
Statements in proportion to the Group’s interest. 
Interests in associates 
An associate is an entity in which the Group has an equity interest 
and over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence. 
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried at 
cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the associate, less any impairment in value in individual 
investments. The Income Statement reflects the Group’s share of 
the results of operations after tax of the associate.  
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. Revenue includes amounts receivable for goods 
and services provided in the normal course of business, net of 
discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales-related taxes. 
Energy supply: Revenue is recognised on the basis of energy 
supplied during the period. Revenue for energy supply activities 
includes an assessment of energy supplied to customers between 
the date of the last meter reading and the year end (unread). 
Unread gas and electricity is estimated using historical 
consumption patterns, taking into account the industry 
reconciliation process for total gas and total electricity usage by 
supplier, and is included in accrued energy income within trade 
and other receivables.  
Proprietary energy trading: Revenue comprises both realised 
(settled) and unrealised (fair value changes) net gains and losses 
from trading in physical and financial energy contracts.  
Storage services: Storage capacity revenues are recognised 
evenly over the contract period, whilst commodity revenues for the 
injection and withdrawal of gas are recognised at the point of gas 
flowing into or out of the storage facilities. Gas purchases and gas 
sales entered into to optimise the performance of the gas storage 
facilities are presented net within revenue. 
Home services and fixed-fee service contracts: Where the Group 
has an ongoing obligation to provide services, revenues are 
apportioned on a time basis and amounts billed in advance are 
treated as deferred income and excluded from current revenue. 
For one-off services, such as installations, revenue is recognised  
at the date of service provision. Revenue from fixed-fee service 
contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the 
contract, reflecting the benefits receivable by the customer, which 
Centrica p58-144.indd   64 Centrica p58-144.indd   64 10/3/09   15:48:07 10/3/09   15:48:07 65

span the life of the contract as a result of emergency maintenance 
being available throughout the contract term. 
Gas production: Revenue associated with exploration and 
production sales (of natural gas, crude oil and condensates) is 
recognised when title passes to the customer. Revenue from the 
production of natural gas, oil and condensates in which the Group 
has an interest with other producers is recognised based on the 
Group’s working interest and the terms of the relevant production 
sharing arrangements (the entitlement method). Differences 
between production sold and the Group’s share of production are 
not significant. Gas purchases and gas sales entered into to 
optimise the performance of gas production facilities are presented 
net within revenue. 
Power generation: Revenue is recognised on the basis of power 
supplied during the period. Power and gas purchases and power 
and gas sales entered into to optimise the performance of power 
generation facilities are presented net within revenue. 
Interest income: Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by 
reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest 
rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset 
to that asset’s net carrying value.  
Cost of sales 
Energy supply includes the cost of gas and electricity produced 
and purchased during the period taking into account the industry 
reconciliation process for total gas and total electricity usage by 
supplier, and related transportation, distribution, royalty costs and 
bought in materials and services.  
Home services’ and fixed-fee service contracts cost of sales 
includes direct labour and related overheads on installation work, 
repairs and service contracts in the period.  
Carbon Emissions Reduction Target programme (CERT) 
UK licensed energy suppliers are set a carbon emission reduction 
target by the Government which is proportional to the size of their 
customer base. The current CERT programme runs from April 
2008 to March 2011. The target is subject to an annual 
adjustment throughout the programme period to take account of 
changes to a UK licensed energy supplier’s customer base. 
Energy suppliers can meet the target through expenditure on 
qualifying projects which give rise to carbon savings. The carbon 
savings can be transferred between energy suppliers. The Group 
charges the costs of the programme to cost of sales and 
capitalises costs incurred in deriving carbon savings in excess of 
the annual target as inventory which is valued at the lower of cost 
or net realisable value and which may be used to meet the carbon 
emissions reduction target in subsequent periods or be transferred 
to third parties. The inventory is carried on a first-in, first-out basis. 
The carbon emission reduction target for the programme period is 
allocated to reporting periods on a straight-line basis as adjusted 
by the annual determination process. 
Employee share schemes 
The Group operates a number of employee share schemes, 
detailed in note 33, under which it makes equity-settled share-
based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant (excluding 
the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions). The fair value 
determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis 
together with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number of awards 
that will vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based 
vesting conditions. 
Fair value is measured using methods appropriate to each of the 
different schemes as follows:

Foreign currencies 
The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds 
sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and  
the Group’s presentational currency. Each entity in the Group 
determines its own functional currency and items included in the 
Financial Statements of each entity are measured using that 
functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially 
recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the functional currency rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are 
included in the Income Statement for the period with the exception 
of exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings that 
provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity. These 
are taken directly to equity until the disposal or partial disposal of 
the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the 
Income Statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a currency other than the functional 
currency of the entity concerned are translated using the exchange 
rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.  
For the purpose of presenting consolidated Financial Statements, 
the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign subsidiary 
undertakings, jointly controlled entities and associates are 
translated into pounds sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. The results of foreign subsidiary undertakings, 
jointly controlled entities and associates are translated into pounds 
sterling at average rates of exchange for the relevant period. 
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the opening 
net assets and the results are transferred to the Group’s foreign 
currency translation reserve, a separate component of equity,  
and are reported in the Statement of Recognised Income and 
Expense. In the event of the disposal of an undertaking with assets 
and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, the cumulative 
translation difference arising in the foreign currency translation 
reserve is charged or credited to the Income Statement  
on disposal.

Notes to the  
Financial Statements  
continued 
 
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings, foreign 
currency swaps and forward exchange contracts used to  
hedge foreign currency net investments in foreign subsidiary 
undertakings, jointly controlled entities and associates are  
taken directly to reserves and are reported in the Statement of 
Recognised Income and Expense. All other exchange movements 
are recognised in the Income Statement for the period. 
Business combinations and goodwill 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase 
method. The cost of the acquisition is measured as the cash paid 
and the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, 
of other assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the 
acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business 
combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under 
IFRS 3, Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at 
the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal 
groups) that are classified as held for resale in accordance with 
IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less 
costs to sell.  
Goodwill arising on a business combination represents the excess 
of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value 
of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, jointly 
controlled entity or associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is 
initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently 
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. If, after 
reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the 
acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is 
recognised immediately in the Income Statement. 
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially 
measured at the minority’s proportion of the net fair value of  
the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.  
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for 
impairment, annually, or more frequently if events or changes  
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be 
impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income 
Statement and is not subsequently reversed.  
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units or groups of cash-
generating units that expect to benefit from the business 
combination in which the goodwill arose. Cash-generating units to 
which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the 
unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit or groups of cash-generating units is less than  
the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis 
of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled  
entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.  
Other intangible assets  
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial 
recognition at cost. Intangible assets include emissions trading 
schemes, renewable obligation certificates and certain exploration 
and evaluation expenditures, the accounting policies for which are 
dealt with separately below. For purchased application software, 
for example investments in customer relationship management 
and billing systems, cost includes contractors’ charges, materials, 
directly attributable labour and directly attributable overheads.  
Capitalisation begins when expenditure for the asset is being 
incurred and activities necessary to prepare the asset for use are 
in progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the 
activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for use are 
complete. Amortisation commences at the point of commercial 
deployment. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. 
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost 
less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated 
impairment losses. The useful lives of intangible assets are 
assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with 
finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and 
assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the 
intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the 
amortisation method for an intangible asset are reviewed at least 
at each financial year end. Changes in the expected useful life or 
the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits 
embodied in the asset are accounted for on a prospective basis by 
changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and 
treated as changes in accounting estimates.  
Intangible assets are derecognised on disposal, or when no future 
economic benefits are expected from their use. 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for 
impairment annually either individually or at the cash-generating 
unit level. Such intangibles are not amortised. The useful life of an 
intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to 
determine whether the indefinite life assessment continues to be 
supportable. If not, the change in the useful life assessment from 
indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.  
The amortisation period for the principal categories of intangible 
assets are as follows: 
Application software up to 10 years 
Licences up to 20 years 
Consents up to 25 years 
Contractual customer relationships up to 20 years 
Identifiable acquired brand  Indefinite 
 
EU Emissions Trading Scheme and renewable  
obligations certificates 
Granted CO2 emissions allowances received in a period are initially 
recognised at nominal value (nil value). Purchased CO2 emissions 
allowances are initially recognised at cost (purchase price) within 
intangible assets. A liability is recognised when the level of 
emissions exceed the level of allowances granted. The liability is 
measured at the cost of purchased allowances up to the level of 
purchased allowances held, and then at the market price of 
allowances ruling at the balance sheet date, with movements in 
the liability recognised in operating profit. Forward contracts for the 
Centrica p58-144.indd   66 Centrica p58-144.indd   66 10/3/09   15:48:07 10/3/09   15:48:07 67

purchase or sale of CO2 emissions allowances are measured at 
fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value 
recognised in the Income Statement. The intangible asset is 
surrendered at the end of the compliance period reflecting the 
consumption of economic benefit. As a result no amortisation is 
recorded during the period.  
Purchased renewable obligation certificates are initially recognised 
at cost within intangible assets. A liability for the renewables 
obligation is recognised based on the level of electricity supplied to 
customers, and is calculated in accordance with percentages set 
by the UK Government and the renewable obligation certificate 
buyout price for that period. The intangible asset is surrendered at 
the end of the compliance period reflecting the consumption of 
economic benefit. As a result no amortisation is recorded during 
the period.  
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is included in the Balance Sheet  
at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions  
for impairment. 
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or 
construction cost and any costs directly attributable to bringing the 
asset into operation. The purchase price or construction cost is 
the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other 
consideration given to acquire the asset. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. Other property, plant and 
equipment, except upstream production assets, are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less 
estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated 
useful lives. The depreciation periods for the principal categories  
of assets are as follows: 
Freehold and leasehold buildings up to 50 years 
Plant 5 to 20 years 
Power stations and wind farms up to 30 years 
Equipment and vehicles 3 to 10 years 
Storage up to 40 years 
 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their 
expected useful economic lives on the same basis as for owned 
assets, or where shorter, the lease term.  
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  
Residual values and useful lives are reassessed annually and,  
if necessary, changes are accounted for prospectively. 
Exploration, evaluation and production assets 
Centrica uses the successful efforts method of accounting for 
exploration and evaluation expenditure. Exploration and evaluation 
expenditure associated with an exploration well, including 
acquisition costs related to exploration and evaluation activities, 
are initially capitalised as intangible assets. Certain expenditures 
such as geological and geophysical exploration costs are 
expensed. If the prospects are subsequently determined to be 
successful on completion of evaluation, the relevant expenditure 
including licence acquisition costs is transferred to property, plant 
and equipment and depreciated on a unit of production basis. If 
the prospects are subsequently determined to be unsuccessful on 
completion of evaluation, the associated costs are expensed in the 
period in which that determination is made.  
All field development costs are capitalised as property, plant and 
equipment. Such costs relate to the acquisition and installation  
of production facilities and include development drilling costs, 
project-related engineering and other technical services costs. 
Property, plant and equipment, including rights and concessions 
related to production activities, are depreciated from the 
commencement of production in the fields concerned, using  
the unit of production method, based on all of the proven and 
probable reserves of those fields. Changes in these estimates  
are dealt with prospectively.  
The net carrying value of fields in production and development  
is compared on a field-by-field basis with the likely discounted 
future net revenues to be derived from the remaining commercial 
reserves. An impairment loss is recognised where it is considered 
that recorded amounts are unlikely to be fully recovered from the 
net present value of future net revenues. Exploration and production 
assets are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.  
Decommissioning costs 
Provision is made for the net present value of the estimated cost  
of decommissioning gas production facilities at the end of the 
producing lives of fields, and storage facilities and power stations 
at the end of the useful life of the facilities, based on price levels 
and technology at the balance sheet date.  
When this provision gives access to future economic benefits,  
a decommissioning asset is recognised and included within 
property, plant and equipment. Changes in these estimates and 
changes to the discount rates are dealt with prospectively and 
reflected as an adjustment to the provision and corresponding 
decommissioning asset included within property, plant and 
equipment. For gas production facilities and offshore storage 
facilities the decommissioning asset is amortised using the unit  
of production method, based on proven and probable reserves. 
For power stations the decommissioning asset is amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the useful life of the facility. The unwinding 
of the discount on the provision is included in the Income 
Statement within interest expense.  
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains,  
a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and 
requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the 
arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets 
and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. Leases are 
classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease 
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Assets 
held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, 
plant and equipment at their fair value, or if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the 
inception of the lease. The obligations relating to finance leases, 
net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included 
within bank loans and other borrowings, with the amount payable 
within 12 months included in bank overdrafts and loans within 
current liabilities. Lease payments are apportioned between 
finance charges and reduction of the finance lease obligation so as 
Centrica p58-144.indd   67 Centrica p58-144.indd   67 10/3/09   15:48:07 10/3/09   15:48:07 68
 
Notes to the  
Financial Statements  
continued 
 
to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.  
Payments under operating leases are charged to the Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the  
relevant lease.  
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets excluding goodwill 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order  
to determine the extent of any impairment loss. Where the asset 
does not generate cash flows that are independent from other 
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset 
with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset concerned.  
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit)  
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately 
as an expense.  
An impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in 
the estimate used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount 
since the last impairment loss was recognised. Where an 
impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount  
of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised 
for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of  
an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately. After 
such a reversal the depreciation or amortisation charge, where 
relevant, is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s 
revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic 
basis over its remaining useful life. 
Non-current assets held for sale  
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for 
sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value 
less costs to sell. No depreciation is charged in respect of non-
current assets classified as held for sale. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held  
for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition  
is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and  
the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in  
its present condition. Management must be committed to the  
sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a 
completed sale within one year from the date of classification. 
Inventories 
Inventories, excluding inventories of gas and oil, are valued on  
a first-in, first-out basis, at the lower of cost and estimated net 
realisable value after allowance for redundant and slow-moving 
items. Inventories of gas and oil are valued on a weighted average 
basis, at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. 
Take-or-pay contracts 
Where payments are made to external suppliers under  
take-or-pay obligations for gas not taken, they are treated as 
prepayments and included within other receivables, as they 
generate future economic benefits. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension 
schemes. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit 
schemes is determined separately for each scheme using the 
projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. Actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. 
They are recognised outside the Income Statement and presented 
in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.  
The cost of providing retirement pensions and other benefits is 
charged to the Income Statement over the periods benefiting from 
employees’ service. Past service cost is recognised immediately to 
the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the 
benefits become vested. The difference between the expected 
return on scheme assets and the change in present value of 
scheme obligations resulting from the passage of time is 
recognised in the Income Statement within interest income or 
interest expense.  
The retirement benefit obligation/asset recognised in the Balance 
Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation of the schemes as adjusted for unrecognised past 
service cost, and the fair value of the schemes’ assets. The 
present value of the defined benefit obligation/asset is determined 
by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest 
rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the 
currency in which the benefits are paid, and that have terms of 
maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are 
charged as an operating expense as they fall due. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, that 
can be reliably measured, and it is probable that the Group will  
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at 
the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to 
present value where the effect is material. Where discounting  
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of  
time is recognised in the Income Statement included within 
interest expense. 
Taxation 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, UK petroleum revenue 
tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or 
recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences 
identified at the balance sheet date, except to the extent that  
the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill  
(if amortisation of goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes) or 
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which  
is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit and loss. 
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying 
amount of the Group’s assets and liabilities and their tax base.  
Deferred tax liabilities may be offset against deferred tax assets 
within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group. Any 
remaining deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis 
of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there 
will be suitable taxable profits, within the same jurisdiction, in the 
foreseeable future, against which the deductible temporary 
difference can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be 
controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised  
or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the  
tax consequences expected to arise from the manner in which  
the asset or liability is recovered or settled. 
Financial instruments  
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the  
Group Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are  
de-recognised when the Group no longer has the rights to cash 
flows, the risks and rewards of ownership or control of the asset. 
Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the obligation under the 
liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
(a) Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice 
amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. Provision 
is made when there is objective evidence that the Group may not 
be able to collect the trade receivable. Balances are written off 
when recoverability is assessed as being remote. 
(b) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a 
deduction from the proceeds received. Own equity instruments 
that are reacquired (treasury shares) are deducted from equity.  
No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own  
equity instruments.  
(c) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current 
balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to 
insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity 
of three months or less. 
For the purpose of the consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash 
and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
(d) Interest-bearing loans and other borrowings 
All interest-bearing loans and other borrowings are initially 
recognised at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs. 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and other 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, except when they are the hedged 
item in an effective fair value hedge relationship where the carrying 
value is also adjusted to reflect the fair value movements 
associated with the hedged risks. Such fair value movements  
are recognised in the Income Statement. Amortised cost is 
calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any 
discount or premium. 
(e) Units issued by The Consumers’ Waterheater  
Income Fund 
Prior to deconsolidation as explained in note 3, units issued  
by The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund which contain 
redemption rights providing unit holders with the right to redeem 
units back to the Fund for cash or another financial asset were 
treated as a financial liability and recorded at the present value  
of the redemption amount. Gains and losses related to changes  
in the carrying value of the financial liability up to the date of 
deconsolidation are included in the Income Statement within 
discontinued operations.  
(f) Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial 
assets that are designated as available-for-sale, which are initially 
recognised at fair value within the Balance Sheet. Available-for-
sale financial assets are subsequently recognised at fair value with 
gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised 
directly in equity and presented in the Statement of Recognised 
Income and Expense, until the asset is disposed of or is 
determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain  
or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the Income 
Statement for the period. Accrued interest or dividends arising  
on available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in the  
Income Statement.  
At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether there is 
objective evidence that available-for-sale financial assets are 
impaired. If any such evidence exists cumulative losses recognised 
in equity are removed from equity and recognised in profit and 
loss. The cumulative loss removed from equity represents the 
difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less 
any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised 
in profit or loss. 
Impairment losses recognised in the Income Statement for equity 
investments classified as available-for-sale are not subsequently 
reversed through the Income Statement. Impairment losses 
recognised in the Income Statement for debt instruments classified 
as available-for-sale are subsequently reversed if an increase in the 
fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event 
occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.

Notes to the  
Financial Statements  
continued 
 
(g) Derivative financial instruments  
The Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions  
for physical delivery of gas, power and oil. A portion of these 
transactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and 
continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of the 
physical commodity in accordance with the Group’s expected 
sale, purchase or usage requirements, and are not within the 
scope of IAS 39. 
Certain purchase and sales contracts for the physical delivery of 
gas, power and oil are within the scope of IAS 39 because they 
net settle or contain written options. Such contracts are accounted 
for as derivatives under IAS 39 and are recognised in the Balance 
Sheet at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are 
taken directly to the Income Statement for the year.  
The Group uses a range of derivatives for both trading and to 
hedge exposures to financial risks, such as interest rate, foreign 
exchange and energy price risks, arising in the normal course of 
business. The use of derivative financial instruments is governed 
by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors. 
Further detail on the Group’s risk management policies is included 
within the Directors’ Report – Governance on pages 41 to 42 and 
in note 4 to the Financial Statements.  
The accounting treatment for derivatives is dependent on whether 
they are entered into for trading or hedging purposes. A derivative 
instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when  
it alters the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the Group  
in line with the Group’s risk management policies and is in 
accordance with established guidelines, which require that the 
hedging relationship is documented at its inception, ensure that 
the derivative is highly effective in achieving its objective, and 
require that its effectiveness can be reliably measured. The Group 
also holds derivatives which are not designated as hedges and are 
held for trading.  
All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date on which the 
derivative is entered into and are re-measured to fair value at each 
reporting date. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair  
value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
Derivative assets and derivative liabilities are offset and presented 
on a net basis only when both a legal right of set-off exists and the 
intention to net settle the derivative contracts is present.  
The Group enters into certain energy derivative contracts covering 
periods for which observable market data does not exist. The fair 
value of such derivatives is estimated by reference in part to 
published price quotations from active markets, to the extent that 
such observable market data exists, and in part by using valuation 
techniques, whose inputs include data, which is not based on or 
derived from observable markets. Where the fair value at initial 
recognition for such contracts differs from the transaction price,  
a fair value gain or fair value loss will arise. This is referred to as a 
day-one gain or day-one loss. Such gains and losses are deferred 
and amortised to the Income Statement based on volumes 
purchased or delivered over the contractual period until such time 
observable market data becomes available. When observable 
market data becomes available, any remaining deferred day-one 
gains or losses are recognised within the Income Statement. 
Recognition of the gain or loss that results from changes in fair 
value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative. 
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains 
or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the 
Income Statement and are included within gross profit or interest 
income and interest expense. Gains and losses arising on 
derivatives entered into for speculative energy trading purposes 
are presented on a net basis within revenue.  
Embedded derivatives: Derivatives embedded in other financial 
instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate 
derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely 
related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts  
are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the 
Income Statement. The closely related nature of embedded 
derivatives is reassessed when there is a change in the terms  
of the contract which significantly modifies the future cash flows 
under the contract. Where a contract contains one or more 
embedded derivatives and providing that the embedded derivative 
significantly modifies the cash flows under the contract, the option 
to fair value the entire contract may be taken and the contract will 
be recognised at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in 
the Income Statement.  
(h) Hedge accounting 
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified  
either as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net 
investments in foreign operations. 
Fair value hedges: A derivative is classified as a fair value hedge 
when it hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of a 
recognised asset or liability. Any gain or loss from re-measuring 
the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately  
in the Income Statement. Any gain or loss on the hedged item 
attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying 
amount of the hedged item and recognised in the Income 
Statement. The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting  
if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised, the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting  
or the Group revokes the designation. Any adjustment to the 
carrying amount of a hedged financial instrument for which the 
effective interest method is used is amortised to the Income 
Statement. Amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment 
exists and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases 
to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk 
being hedged.  
Cash flow hedges: A derivative is classified as a cash flow hedge 
when it hedges exposure to variability in cash flows that is 
attributable to a particular risk either associated with a recognised 
asset, liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. The portion 
of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument which is effective is 
recognised directly in equity while any ineffectiveness is 
recognised in the Income Statement. The gains or losses that are 
recognised directly in equity are transferred to the Income 
Statement in the same period in which the highly probable forecast 
transaction affects income, for example when the future sale of 
physical gas or physical power actually occurs. Where the hedged 
item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts 
taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the 
non-financial asset or liability on its recognition. Hedge accounting 
is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, no longer 
Centrica p58-144.indd   70 Centrica p58-144.indd   70 10/3/09   15:48:08 10/3/09   15:48:08 71

qualifies for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the 
designation.  
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in equity remains in equity until the highly 
probable forecast transaction occurs. If the transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised 
in equity is recognised in the Income Statement. 
Net investment hedges: Hedges of net investments in foreign 
operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any 
gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in 
equity, any gain or loss on the ineffective portion of the hedge is 
recognised in the Income Statement. On disposal of the foreign 
operation, the cumulative value of any gains or losses recognised 
directly in equity is transferred to the Income Statement.  
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS  
AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION 
UNCERTAINTY 
 
(a) Critical judgements in applying the Group’s  
accounting policies 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies  
as described in note 2, management has made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the Financial Statements (apart from those involving 
estimations which are dealt with below). 
Finance lease – Third-party power station  
tolling arrangement  
The Group has entered into a long-term tolling arrangement with 
the Spalding power station. The contract provides Centrica with 
the right to nominate 100% of the plant output until 2021 in return 
for a mix of capacity payments and operating payments. The 
capacity payments comprise both fixed-price and market-priced 
elements and are dependent on plant availability. Centrica holds 
an option to extend the tolling arrangement for a further 8 years, 
notice of which must be provided to the power station operator by 
30 September 2020. If the extension option is exercised, Centrica 
is granted an option to purchase the station at the end of the 
extended tolling period. The option to purchase must be exercised 
by serving notice to the generator between 30 September 2027 
and 30 September 2028. Should Centrica exercise the purchase 
option the generator can exercise an option to retain the station. 
Should both options be exercised the valuation of the options, and 
hence ownership of the asset, will be determined by an expert 
panel, appointed by both parties. Market-based compensation will 
be payable to Centrica if ownership is retained by the generator. 
The Directors have judged that the arrangement should be 
accounted for as a finance lease as the lease term is judged to be 
a major part of the economic life of the power station and the 
present value of the minimum lease payments at inception date of 
the arrangement amounted to a large part of the fair value of the 
power station at that time. Details of the finance lease asset, 
finance lease creditor and interest charges are included in notes 
17, 25 and 10 respectively. 
EU Emissions Trading Scheme  
The Group has been subject to the European Union Emissions 
Trading Scheme (EU ETS) since 1 January 2005. IFRIC 3, 
Emission Rights was withdrawn by the IASB in June 2005, and 
has not yet been replaced by definitive guidance. The Group has 
adopted an accounting policy, which recognises CO2 emissions 
liabilities when the level of emissions exceeds the level of 
allowances granted by the Government in the period. The liability  
is measured at the cost of purchased allowances up to the level  
of purchased allowances held, and then at market price of 
allowances ruling at the balance sheet date. Movements in the 
liability are reflected within operating profit. Forward contracts for 
sales and purchases of allowances are measured at fair value.  
Petroleum revenue tax (PRT) 
The definitions of an income tax in IAS 12, Income Taxes, have  
led management to judge that PRT should be treated consistently 
with other income taxes. The charge for the year is presented 
within taxation on profit from continuing operations in the Income 
Statement. Deferred amounts are included within deferred tax 
assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet. 
The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund  
The Group deconsolidated The Consumers’ Waterheater Income 
Fund (the ‘Fund’) with effect from 1 December 2007, the date of 
an Internalisation Agreement entered into between Centrica and 
the Fund.  
Centrica created the Fund in 2002 to refinance the water heater 
assets acquired with the Enbridge Services acquisition. The Group 
consolidated the Fund in accordance with the requirements of 
SIC-12, Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities, as the 
substance of the agreements put in place by Centrica indicated 
that the Fund was created for and on behalf of the Group. These 
agreements both predetermined the Fund’s activities and provided 
Centrica with operational control, via responsibilities for servicing 
the Fund’s asset portfolio and administering the Fund’s activities.  
In 2006 the Trustees of the Fund appointed an independent Chief 
Executive Officer. The activities undertaken by the Fund started to 
change following this appointment. In 2007 the Trustees of the 
Fund sought further changes in the conduct of the Fund. On  
1 December 2007, the existing Administration Agreement was 
replaced, at the instigation of the Fund, by a new Internalisation 
Agreement, which provides the Fund with access rights to key 
operational data and provides a basis for employees and business 
infrastructure to transfer to the Fund, such that it is capable of 
independent operation from Centrica. Subsequent to this 
agreement the Fund has independently refinanced its activities. 
The Directors believe that the Internalisation Agreement 
represented a change to the original contractual arrangements  
with the Fund, and demonstrates that the Fund has both the 
desire and the ability to manage its own affairs. Accordingly, in  
2007 the Directors judged that the Fund’s activities were no longer 
predetermined such that its activities were being conducted  
on behalf of Centrica, and thus the Fund ceased to represent  
a subsidiary of the Centrica Group. 
The Group deconsolidated the Fund with effect from 1 December 
2007, the date the Internalisation Agreement became effective and 
the date of the resultant loss of control, recognising an exceptional 
profit on disposal amounting to £227 million. The Fund’s activities 
represented a separate major line of business of the Direct Energy 
segment, and contributed materially to Group borrowings. In order 
to provide a clear presentation of the impact of deconsolidating 
the Fund, the results in the prior year have been presented as a

Financial Statements

discontinued operation distinct from continuing operations within 
the Group Income Statement.  
(b) Key sources of estimation uncertainty  
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year,  
are discussed below. 
Revenue recognition – unread gas and electricity meters 
Revenue for energy supply activities includes an assessment of 
energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter 
reading and the year end (unread). Unread gas and electricity 
comprises both billed and unbilled revenue. It is estimated through 
the billing systems, using historical consumption patterns, on a 
customer by customer basis, taking into account weather patterns 
and the differences between actual meter reads being returned 
and system estimates. Actual meter reads continue to be 
compared to system estimates between the balance sheet date 
and the finalisation of the accounts. An assessment is also made 
of any factors that are likely to materially affect the ultimate 
economic benefits which will flow to the Group, including bill 
cancellation and re-bill rates. To the extent that the economic 
benefits are not expected to flow to the Group, the value of that 
revenue is not recognised. The judgements applied, and the 
assumptions underpinning these judgements, are considered to 
be appropriate. However, a change in these assumptions would 
have an impact on the amount of revenue recognised. 
Industry reconciliation process – cost of sales 
The industry reconciliation process is required as differences arise 
between the estimated quantity of gas and electricity the Group 
deems to have supplied and billed customers, and the estimated 
quantity the industry system operator deems the individual 
suppliers, including the Group, to have supplied to customers. 
This difference in deemed supply is referred to as imbalance.  
The reconciliation process can result in either a higher or lower 
value of industry deemed supply than has been estimated as 
being supplied to customers by the Group, but in practice tends to 
result in a higher value of deemed supply. The Group then reviews 
the difference to ascertain whether there is evidence that its 
estimate of amounts supplied to customers is inaccurate or 
whether the difference arises from other causes. The Group’s 
share of the resulting imbalance is included within commodity 
costs charged to cost of sales. Management estimates the level  
of recovery of imbalance which will be achieved either through 
subsequent customer billing or through the developing industry 
settlement process.  
Determination of fair values – energy derivatives 
Derivative contracts are carried in the Balance Sheet at fair value, 
with changes in fair value recorded in either the Income Statement 
or equity. Fair values of energy derivatives are estimated by 
reference in part to published price quotations in active markets 
and in part by using valuation techniques. More detail on the 
assumptions used in determining fair valuations is provided in  
note 28.  
Gas and liquids reserves 
The volume of proven and probable gas and liquids reserves is  
an estimate that affects the unit of production depreciation of 
producing gas and liquids property, plant and equipment as well 
as being a significant estimate affecting decommissioning 
estimates and impairment calculations. The factors impacting gas 
and liquids estimates, and the process for estimating reserve 
quantities, are described on page 143. 
The impact of a change in estimated proven and probable 
reserves is dealt with prospectively by depreciating the remaining 
book value of producing assets over the expected future 
production. If proven and probable reserves estimates are revised 
downwards, earnings could be affected by higher depreciation 
expense or an immediate write-down (impairment) of the asset’s 
book value.  
Decommissioning costs 
The estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the 
producing lives of fields is reviewed periodically and is based  
on proven and probable reserves, price levels and technology  
at the balance sheet date. Provision is made for the estimated cost 
of decommissioning at the balance sheet date. The payment dates 
of total expected future decommissioning costs are uncertain and 
dependent on the lives of the facilities, but are currently anticipated 
to be between 2010 and 2062, with the substantial majority of the 
costs expected to be paid between 2019 and 2030.  
Impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived  
intangible assets  
The Group determines whether goodwill and indefinite lived 
intangible assets are impaired at least on an annual basis in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy described in  
note 2. This requires the determination of the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating units to which goodwill and indefinite lived 
intangibles are allocated. The recoverable amounts are determined 
by either estimating the value in use of those cash-generating units 
or in the case of the Centrica Energy – Gas production and 
development cash-generating unit determining the fair value less 
costs to sell of the cash-generating unit. Value in use calculations 
requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future 
cash flows to be derived from the cash-generating units and to 
choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present 
value of those cash flows. The fair value less costs to sell 
methodology is deemed more appropriate for the Centrica Energy 
– Gas production and development cash-generating unit as it is 
based on post-tax cash flows arising from each field within the 
cash-generating unit, which is consistent with the approach taken 
by management in determining the economic value of the 
underlying assets. Fair value less costs to sell is determined by 
discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated by 
the gas production and development assets within the Centrica 
Energy – Gas production and development cash-generating unit, 
net of associated selling costs, and takes into account 
assumptions market participants would use in estimating fair 
value. Further detail on the assumptions used in determining the 
value in use and fair value less costs to sell calculations is provided 
in note 16. 
An impairment charge of £45 million arose on the European 
Energy – Oxxio cash-generating unit during the course of 2008 
resulting in the carrying amount of goodwill being written down to 
its recoverable amount. Further detail on the impairment is 
provided in note 16.

Impairment of power generation and upstream gas assets 
Power generation and upstream gas assets are assessed for 
indicators of impairment at each reporting date in accordance with 
the Group’s accounting policies as described in note 2. If an 
indicator of impairment exists an assessment of the recoverable 
amount of the asset is required to be made. Indicators of 
impairment for these assets may include, but are not limited to,  
the following: 
 Reductions in reserve estimates or profiles of production; 
 Declines in long-term commodity prices; 
 Increases in capital expenditure or acceleration of known  
capital expenditure; 
 Significant unplanned outages or problems with operational 
performance; and 
 Changes in regulatory or tax environments. 
 
The recoverable amount of power generation and upstream gas 
assets is usually assessed with reference to each individual asset’s 
value in use. The value in use is based on the pre-tax cash flows 
expected to be generated by the asset and is dependent on views 
of forecast generation/production, forecast commodity prices 
(using market prices where available and internal estimates for the 
remainder of the period) and the timing and extent of capital 
expenditure.  
For gas fired power stations, which have a high degree of 
production flexibility, the value in use calculation also includes a 
scenario based statistical assessment of the additional value which 
can be generated from optimising production to take advantage of 
volatile forward prices. Pre-tax cash flows for the first three years 
are based on the Group’s internal Board-approved three-year 
business plans and thereafter are estimated on a consistent basis 
to reflect cash flows up to the date of cessation of operation of the 
asset. Pre-tax cash flows are discounted using an appropriate pre-
tax discount rate which is derived from the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital. The carrying values of the Group’s power 
generation and upstream gas assets are included within note 17. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension 
schemes. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit 
schemes is determined separately for each scheme under the 
projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. Actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. 
The key assumptions used for the actuarial valuation are based on 
the Group’s best estimate of the variables that will determine the 
ultimate cost of providing post-employment benefits, on which 
further detail is provided in note 34.

4.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
 
The Group’s normal operating, investing and financing activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including commodity 
price risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management 
process is designed to identify, manage and mitigate business risk, which includes, among others, financial risk. Further detail on the 
Group’s overall risk management process is included within the Directors’ Report – Governance on pages 41 to 42. 
During 2008, there was significant volatility in commodity prices and a continuing shortage of available credit in the market. In addition, 
many of the markets in which the Group operates are experiencing a slowing of growth or, in some cases, economic contraction. As a 
result of these external market factors, the Group is encountering an increase in commodity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk 
compared with that experienced at the end of 2007. The Group continues to manage these risks in accordance with its financial risk 
management processes and did not incur any additional significant cash costs as a result of the increased commodity, credit or liquidity 
risk experienced in 2008.  
Financial risk management is overseen by the Group Financial Risk Management Committee (FRMC) according to objectives, targets 
and policies set by the Board. Commodity price risk management is carried out in accordance with individual business unit financial risk 
management policies, as approved by the FRMC and the Board. Treasury risk management, including management of currency risk, 
interest rate risk, equity price risk and liquidity risk is carried out by a central Group Treasury function in accordance with the Group’s 
financing and treasury policy, as approved by the Board. The credit risks associated with commodity trading and treasury positions are 
managed in accordance with the Group’s counterparty credit policy. Downstream credit risk management is carried out in accordance 
with individual business unit credit policies.  
(a) Market risk management 
Market risk is the risk of loss that results from changes in market prices (commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates  
and equity prices). The level of market risk to which the Group is exposed at a point in time varies depending on market conditions, 
expectations of future price or market rate movements and the composition of the Group’s physical asset and contract portfolios.  
(i) Commodity price risk management 
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in its energy procurement, downstream and proprietary energy trading activities.  
Energy procurement and downstream activities 
The Group’s energy procurement and downstream activities consist of downstream positions, equity gas and liquids production, equity 
power generation, strategic procurement and sales contracts, market-traded purchase and sales contracts and derivative positions 
taken on with the intent of securing gas and power for the Group’s downstream customers in the UK, Europe and North America  
from a variety of sources at an optimal cost. The Group actively manages commodity price risk by optimising its asset and contract 
portfolios making use of volume flexibility.  
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in its energy procurement and downstream activities because the cost of procuring  
gas and electricity to serve its downstream customers varies with wholesale commodity prices. The risk is primarily that market prices 
for commodities will fluctuate between the time that sales prices are fixed or tariffs are set and the time at which the corresponding 
procurement cost is fixed, thereby potentially reducing expected margins or making sales unprofitable. 
The Group uses specific volumetric limits to manage the exposure to market prices associated with the Group’s energy procurement 
and downstream activities to an acceptable level. Volumetric limits are supported by a Profit at Risk (PaR) methodology in the UK  
and a Value at Risk (VaR) methodology in North America and Europe to measure the Group’s exposure to commodity price risk. PaR 
measures the estimated potential loss in a position or portfolio of positions associated with the movement of a commodity price for  
a given confidence level, over the remaining term of the position or contract portfolio. VaR measures the estimated potential loss for  
a given confidence level, over a predetermined holding period. The standard confidence level used is 95%. 
The Group measures and manages the commodity price risk associated with the Group’s entire energy procurement and downstream 
portfolio. Only certain of the Group’s energy procurement and downstream contracts constitute financial instruments under IAS 39 
(note 2). As a result, while the Group manages the commodity price risk associated with both financial and non-financial energy 
procurement and downstream contracts, it is the notional value of energy contracts being carried at fair value that represents the 
exposure of the Group’s energy procurement and downstream activities to commodity price risk according to IFRS 7, Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures. This is because energy contracts that are financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for on a fair value 
basis and changes in fair value immediately impact profit or equity. Conversely, energy contracts that are not financial instruments 
under IAS 39 are accounted for as executory contracts and changes in fair value do not immediately impact profit or equity, and as 
such, are not exposed to commodity price risk as defined by IFRS 7. So while the PaR or the VaR associated with energy procurement 
and downstream contracts outside the scope of IAS 39 is monitored for internal risk management purposes, only those energy 
contracts within the scope of IAS 39 are within the scope of the IFRS 7 disclosure requirements.

4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
 
The increase in commodity prices in the six months ended 30 June 2008 resulted in significant mark-to-market gains on certain energy 
procurement contracts where the purchase price had been locked in by contract. Commodity prices have since fallen from their levels 
at 30 June 2008, resulting in significant mark-to-market losses for the year on contracts locked-in during the year at the higher prices. 
The net loss of £1,415 million (2007: gain of £235 million) on the re-measurement of energy contracts largely represents unrealised 
mark-to-market loss created by gas and power purchase contracts which are priced above the current wholesale market value of 
energy. This loss is calculated with reference to forward energy prices and therefore the extent of the economic loss arising over the life 
of these contracts is uncertain and is entirely dependent upon the level of future wholesale energy prices. Generally, subject to short-
term balancing, the ultimate net charge to cost of sales will be consistent with the price of energy agreed in these contracts and the fair 
value adjustments will reverse as the energy is supplied over the life of the contract.  
The carrying value of energy contracts used in energy procurement and downstream activities at 31 December 2008 is disclosed in note 
21. A sensitivity analysis that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Group’s financial position and performance to changes in the fair 
value or future cash flows of financial instruments associated with the Group’s energy procurement and downstream activities as a result of 
changes in commodity prices is provided below in section (v).  
Proprietary energy trading 
The Group’s proprietary energy trading activities consist of physical and financial commodity purchases and sales contracts taken  
on with the intent of benefiting in the short-term from changes in market prices or differences between buying and selling prices.  
The Group conducts its trading activities over the counter and through exchanges in the UK, North America and parts of the rest  
of Europe. The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its proprietary energy trading activities because the value  
of its trading assets and liabilities will fluctuate with changes in market prices for commodities.  
The Group sets volumetric and VaR limits to manage the commodity price risk exposure associated with the Group’s proprietary 
energy trading activities. The VaR used measures the estimated potential loss for a 95% confidence level over a one-day holding  
period. The holding period used is based on market liquidity and the number of days the Group would expect it to take to close off  
a trading position.  
As with any modelled risk measure, there are certain limitations that arise from the assumptions used in the VaR analysis. VaR assumes 
that the future will behave like the past and that the Group’s trading positions can be unwound or hedged within the predetermined 
holding period. Furthermore the use of a 95% confidence level, by definition, does not take into account changes in value that might 
occur beyond this confidence level.  
The VaR, before taxation, associated with the Group’s proprietary energy trading activities at 31 December 2008 was £1 million  
(2007: £9 million). The carrying value of energy contracts used in proprietary energy trading activities at 31 December 2008 is disclosed 
in note 21.  
(ii) Currency risk management 
The Group is exposed to currency risk on foreign currency denominated forecast transactions, firm commitments, monetary assets and 
liabilities (transactional exposure) and on its net investments in foreign operations (translational exposure).  
Transactional currency risk 
The Group is exposed to transactional currency risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the underlying functional 
currency of the commercial operation transacting. The Group’s primary functional currencies are pounds sterling in the UK, Canadian 
dollars in Canada, US dollars in the US and euros in Europe. The risk is that the functional currency value of cash flows will vary as a 
result of movements in exchange rates. Transactional exposure arises from the Group’s energy procurement activities in the UK and in 
Canada, where a proportion of transactions are denominated in euros or US dollars and on certain capital commitments denominated 
in foreign currencies. In addition, in order to optimise the cost of funding, the Group has, in certain cases, issued foreign currency 
denominated debt, primarily in US dollars, New Zealand dollars, euros or Japanese yen.  
It is the Group’s policy to hedge all material transactional exposures using forward contracts to fix the functional currency value of  
non-functional currency cash flows. At 31 December 2008, there were no material unhedged non-functional currency monetary  
assets or liabilities, firm commitments or probable forecast transactions (2007: £nil), other than foreign currency borrowings used  
to hedge translational exposures.

Notes to the  
Financial Statements

4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
 
Translational currency risk 
The Group is exposed to translational currency risk as a result of its net investments in North America and Europe. The risk is that the 
pounds sterling value of the net assets of foreign operations will decrease with changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s policy is 
to protect the pounds sterling book value of its net investments in foreign operations, subject to certain targets monitored by the FRMC, 
by holding foreign currency debt, entering into foreign currency derivatives or a mixture of both.  
The Group measures and manages the currency risk associated with all transactional and translational exposures. In contrast, IFRS 7 
requires disclosure of currency risk arising on financial instruments denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the 
commercial operation transacting only. As a result, for the purposes of IFRS 7, currency risk excludes the Group’s net investments in 
North America and Europe as well as foreign currency denominated forecast transactions and firm commitments. A sensitivity analysis 
that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Group’s financial position and performance to changes in the fair value or future cash 
flows of foreign currency denominated financial instruments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates is provided below in 
section (v).  
(iii) Interest rate risk management 
In the normal course of business the Group borrows to finance its operations. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because the 
fair value of fixed rate borrowings and the cash flows associated with floating rate borrowings will fluctuate with changes in interest 
rates. The Group’s policy is to manage the interest rate risk on long-term borrowings by ensuring that the exposure to floating interest 
rates remains within a 30% to 70% range, including the impact of interest rate derivatives. Note 25 details the interest rates on the 
Group’s bank overdrafts, loans and other borrowings by the earlier of contractual re-pricing and maturity date and a sensitivity analysis 
that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Group’s financial position and performance to changes in interest rates is provided 
below in section (v).  
(iv) Equity price risk management 
The Group is exposed to equity price risk because certain available-for-sale financial assets, held by the Law Debenture Trust on behalf 
of the Company as security in respect of the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme, are linked to equity indices (note 34). Investments 
in equity indices are inherently exposed to less risk than individual equity investments because they represent a naturally diverse 
portfolio. Note 34 details the Group’s other retirement benefit assets and liabilities.  
(v) Sensitivity analysis 
A financial instrument is defined in IAS 32 as any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity (effectively the contractual right 
to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity) and a financial liability (effectively the contractual obligation to deliver cash 
or another financial asset to another entity) or equity instrument (effectively a residual interest in the assets of an entity) of another. 
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Group’s financial position and 
performance to changes in market variables (commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates) as a result of changes in the 
fair value or cash flows associated with the Group’s financial instruments. The sensitivity analysis provided discloses the effect on profit 
or loss and equity at 31 December 2008 assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant risk variable had occurred at  
31 December 2008 and been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date to show the effects of reasonably possible changes 
in price on profit or loss and equity to the next annual reporting date. Reasonably possible changes in market variables used in the 
sensitivity analysis are based on implied volatilities, where available, or historical data for energy prices and foreign exchange rates. 
Reasonably possible changes in interest rates are based on management judgement and historical experience. 
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared based on 31 December 2008 balances and on the basis that the balances, the ratio of fixed 
to floating rates of debt and derivatives, the proportion of energy contracts that are financial instruments, the proportion of financial 
instruments in foreign currencies and the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2008 are all constant. Excluded from this 
analysis are all non-financial assets and liabilities and energy contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39. The sensitivity  
to foreign exchange rates relates only to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency  
of the commercial operation transacting, and excludes the translation of the net assets of foreign operations to pounds sterling, but 
includes the corresponding impact of net investment hedges. 
The sensitivity analysis provided is hypothetical only and should be used with caution as the impacts provided are not necessarily 
indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced because the Group’s actual exposure to market rates is constantly changing 
as the Group’s portfolio of commodity, debt and foreign currency contracts changes. Changes in fair values or cash flows based on a 
variation in a market variable cannot be extrapolated because the relationship between the change in market variable and the change in 
fair value or cash flows may not be linear. In addition, the effect of a change in a particular market variable on fair values or cash flows is 
calculated without considering interrelationships between the various market rates or mitigating actions that would be taken by the 
Group. The sensitivity analysis provided below excludes the impact of proprietary energy trading assets and liabilities because the VaR 
associated with the Group’s proprietary energy trading activities has already been provided above in section (i).

4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
 
(b) Credit risk management 
Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a counterparty’s inability or failure to discharge its obligations under a contract. The Group 
is exposed to credit risk in its treasury, trading, energy procurement and downstream activities. During 2008, there has been a 
continuing shortage of available credit in the market. In addition, many of the markets in which the Group operates are experiencing a 
slowing of growth or, in some cases, economic contraction. As a result of these external market factors, the Group is encountering an 
increase in credit risk compared with that experienced at the end of 2007. The Group continues to manage credit risk in accordance 
with its financial risk management processes and has not incurred any additional significant credit losses as a result of the increased 
credit risk.  
Treasury, trading and energy procurement activities 
Counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by category of credit rating, and are subject to approved 
limits. The majority of significant exposures are with A-rated counterparties or better. The Group uses master netting agreements to 
reduce credit risk and net settles payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist. In addition, the Group employs  
a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of bank and parent company guarantees and letters  
of credit.  
100% of the Group’s credit risk associated with its treasury, trading and energy procurement activities is with counterparties in related 
energy industries or with financial institutions. The Group measures and manages the credit risk associated with the Group’s entire 
treasury, trading and energy procurement portfolio. In contrast, IFRS 7 defines credit risk as the risk that one party to a financial 
instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation and requires disclosure of information about 
the exposure to credit risk arising from financial instruments only. Only certain of the Group’s energy procurement contracts constitute 
financial instruments under IAS 39 (note 2). As a result, while the Group manages the credit risk associated with both financial and non-
financial energy procurement contracts, it is the carrying value of financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 (note 28) that represents 
the maximum exposure to credit risk in accordance with IFRS 7 because credit losses associated with contracts that are not 
recognised on the Balance Sheet will not be recognised as such in the Income Statement.  
Downstream activities 
In the case of business customers, credit risk is managed by checking a company’s creditworthiness and financial strength both before 
commencing trade and during the business relationship. For residential customers, creditworthiness is ascertained normally before 
commencing trade by reviewing an appropriate mix of internal and external information to determine the payment mechanism required 
to reduce credit risk to an acceptable level. Certain customers will only be accepted on a prepayment basis.  
In some cases, an ageing of receivables is monitored and used to manage the exposure to credit risk associated with both business 
and residential customers. In other cases, credit risk is monitored and managed by grouping customers according to method of 
payment or profile.  
Note 21 provides further detail of the Group’s exposure to credit risk on derivative financial instruments, note 20 provides detail of the 
Group’s exposure to credit risk on trade and other receivables, note 23 provides detail of the Group’s exposure to credit risk on cash 
and cash equivalents and note 28 provides the carrying value of all financial assets representing the Group’s maximum exposure to 
credit risk.   
(c) Liquidity risk management and going concern 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group can incur significant 
movements in its liquidity position due particularly to the seasonal nature of its business and margin cash arrangements associated  
with certain wholesale commodity contracts.    
The Group’s liquidity position has been particularly volatile during 2008 as significant volatility in commodity prices has seen large 
increases in cash required to fund working capital and margin cash balances. At 31 December 2008, the Group was holding  
£43 million (2007: £93 million) of cash as collateral against counterparty balances, and had pledged £669 million (2007: £118 million)  
of cash as collateral, principally under margin calls to cover exposure to mark-to-market positions on derivative contracts representing  
a net cash outflow during the year of £556 million (2007: £2 million inflow), write-offs of pledged balances of £22 million (2007: £nil), 
acquisition of cash collateral balances held of £33 million (2007: £nil) and exchange adjustments of £100 million (2007: £5 million). 
Generally, cash paid or received as collateral is interest-bearing and is free from any restriction over its use by the holder. To mitigate 
this risk the Group holds cash on deposit and maintains significant committed facilities. 
The Group closely monitors, and has a number of treasury policies to manage its liquidity risk. Cash forecasts identifying the Group’s 
liquidity requirements are produced regularly and are stress-tested for different scenarios including, but not limited to, reasonably 
possible increases or decreases in commodity prices and the potential cash implications of a ratings downgrade. The Group seeks to 
ensure that sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12-month period to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. It is the Group's policy to maintain committed facilities of at least £1,200 million less available surplus cash resources, to raise 
at least 75% of its net debt (excluding non-recourse debt) over £200 million in the long-term debt market and to maintain an average 
term to maturity in the recourse long-term debt portfolio greater than five years.

4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
 
At 31 December 2008, the Group held £2,939 million (2007: £1,130 million) of cash and cash equivalents, had undrawn committed 
bank borrowing facilities of £1,350 million (2007: £1,300 million), plus a committed letter of credit facility for Canadian $200 million 
(2007: C$nil) made available to the Direct Energy business in North America of which Canadian $146 million was drawn at 31 
December 2008 (2007: C$nil), 367% (2007: 321%) of the Group’s net debt over £200 million has been raised in the long-term debt 
market and the average term to maturity of the long-term debt portfolio was 9.3 years (2007: 7.1 years).  
The relatively high level of available cash resources and undrawn committed bank borrowing facilities has enabled the Directors to 
conclude that the Group has sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern. The statement of going concern is included in the 
Directors' Report – Governance, on page 42.  
The Group’s liquidity position at 31 December 2008 was significantly improved by the proceeds of the Rights Issue which completed  
in December 2008. The Rights Issue was undertaken in the expectation of acquiring a 25% stake in Lake Acquisitions Limited, the 
owner of the British Energy Group plc, from Electricité de France S.A. The Group will reassess its liquidity position before committing to  
any acquisition and would seek to finance any transaction with the Rights Issue proceeds, additional debt and, possibly, the sale of 
certain assets. 
Maturities of derivative financial liabilities, trade and other payables, bank borrowings and provisions are provided in notes 21, 24,  
25 and 27, respectively. Details of commitments and contingencies are provided in note 36 and details of undrawn committed bank 
borrowing facilities are provided in note 25.  
5.  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
 
The Group’s objective when managing capital is to maintain an optimal capital structure and strong credit rating to minimise the cost  
of capital. In addition, in a number of areas in which the Group operates, the Group’s strong capital structure and good credit standing 
are important elements of the Group’s competitive position.  
At 31 December 2008, the Group’s long-term credit rating was A3 stable outlook for Moody’s Investor Services Inc. (2007: A3 stable 
outlook) and A negative outlook for Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (2007: A negative outlook).  
The Group monitors capital, using a medium term view of three to five years, on the basis of a number of financial ratios generally used 
by industry and by the rating agencies. This includes monitoring gearing ratios, interest cover and cash flow to debt ratios. The Group  
is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements but as is common for most companies the level of debt that can be raised  
is restricted by the Company’s Articles of Association. Net debt is limited to the greater of £5 billion and a gearing ratio of three times 
adjusted capital and reserves. This restriction can be amended or removed by the shareholders of the Company passing an ordinary 
resolution. The Group’s capital structure is managed against the various financial ratios as required to maintain strong credit ratings.  
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital  
to shareholders, issue new shares, repurchase shares, issue debt or repay debt. 
During the year, the Group raised proceeds of approximately £2,164 million, net of issue costs of approximately £65 million, through  
a three for eight Rights Issue of new ordinary shares at 160 pence per share, representing a bonus to existing shareholders of 0.1233 
ordinary shares per ordinary share held based on the closing share price of 267.75 pence per ordinary share on 21 November 2008, 
the last day the shares traded cum-rights. Centrica and Electricité de France S.A. (EDF) announced that they were in discussions in 
relation to an option for Centrica to acquire a 25% interest in British Energy Group plc. Centrica and EDF continue these discussions. 
Centrica would seek to finance any transaction with the Rights Issue proceeds, additional debt and, possibly, the sale of certain assets. 
If Centrica does not acquire an interest in British Energy Group, Centrica would evaluate the use of funds for other acquisition 
opportunities that meet its vertical integration objective, for general corporate purposes or for returns to shareholders with a view to 
maintaining an appropriate capital structure and maximising long-term shareholder value. On 13 January 2009, Standard & Poor’s 
Rating Services placed the Group’s long-term credit rating on CreditWatch with negative implications reflecting the increased likelihood 
of the Group completing this transaction and the impact on the financial risk of the Group. Standard & Poor’s Rating Services has 
stated that any downgrade of the Group’s credit rating was likely to be limited to one notch.

(i) Inter-segment revenue reflects the level of revenue generated on sales to other Group segments on an arm’s length basis. During the second half of 2008, Gas production and development began to 
sell gas downstream at forward market prices. Prior to this, Gas production and development sold all gas produced at month ahead prices. This change resulted in an additional £54 million of net 
revenue being reported in Gas production and development in 2008 than would have been reported had Gas production and development continued to sell gas downstream at month ahead prices.  
(ii) Inter-segment revenue in the Industrial and commercial segment reflects the sale of upstream gas produced or procured to other Group segments on an arm’s length basis. Prior to 2008, the 
Group’s downstream businesses procured gas directly from Gas production and development or external counterparties.   
(iii) The external revenue presented for Accord energy trading comprises both realised (settled) and unrealised (fair value changes) from trading in physical and financial energy contracts. Inter-segment 
revenue arising in Accord represents the recharge of brokerage fees to other Group segments.  
(iv) Gross segment revenue, inter-segment revenue and Group revenue have been restated to report gas sales revenue of Centrica Storage net of cost of sales to better reflect the nature of the 
transactions as explained in note 2. 
(v) Other operations comprise British Gas New Energy, Group Treasury, Group Property, Information Services and other shared services.

into account factors including expertise, experience and cost. In addition, the Board has approved a detailed policy defining the types 
of work for which the auditors can tender and the approvals required. In the past, the auditors have been engaged on assignments 
additional to their statutory audit duties where their expertise and experience with the Group are particularly important, including tax 
advice and due diligence reporting on acquisitions.

Total tax on profit from continuing operations 1,027 (434) 593 753 60 813
 
(i) The Finance Act 2008 changed the rules concerning loss relief on decommissioning costs and, as a result of this change, the current year deferred tax charge is stated net of a £55 million credit in 
respect of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets.  
(ii) The effect of the decrease of 2% to the standard rate of UK corporation tax from 1 April 2008 on the relevant temporary differences at 31 December 2007 was a credit of £12 million and a further 
credit of £1 million in 2008. No other material amounts arose as a result of changes introduced by the Finance Act 2007. The effect of changes to foreign tax rates on the relevant temporary 
differences at 31 December 2008 was £nil (2007: charge of £3 million).  
 
Tax on items taken directly to equity is disclosed in note 30. 
The Group earns its profits primarily in the UK, therefore the tax rate used for tax on profit on ordinary activities is the standard rate for 
UK corporation tax, which was 28.5% for 2008 (2007: 30%). Additional charges of 21.5% (2007: 20%) are applicable on the Group’s 
UK upstream profits. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in those respective jurisdictions. 
(b) Factors affecting the tax charge for the year 
The differences between the total tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax  
to the profit before tax is as follows:

11. TAXATION CONTINUED 
 
(c) Factors that may affect future tax charges 
The Group earns income from many activities, including oil and gas production in the UK, North America and elsewhere. On average, 
the Group pays taxes at higher rates than the current UK statutory rate of 28% (2007: 30%). The impact of higher rates, including 
petroleum revenue tax and the supplementary charge on UK Continental Shelf profits, is subject to the mix of the Group’s income. In 
the medium term, the Group’s effective tax rate is expected to remain above the UK statutory rate.

Prior year final dividend of 8.59 pence (2007: 7.12 pence) per ordinary share 356 294
Interim dividend of 3.47 pence (2007: 2.98 pence) per ordinary share  144 123
 500 417
The prior year final dividend was paid on 11 June 2008 (2007: 13 June). The interim dividend was paid on 12 November 2008 
(2007: 14 November). The prior year final dividend of 9.65 pence (2007: 8.00 pence) per ordinary share and interim dividend of 3.90 
pence (2007: 3.35 pence) per ordinary share have been adjusted to reflect the bonus element of the Rights Issue in the table above. 
Details of the Rights Issue are provided in notes 5, 29 and 30. 
The Directors propose a final dividend of 8.73 pence per ordinary share (totalling £446 million) for the year ended 31 December 2008. 
The dividend will be submitted for formal approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 11 May 2009. These Financial 
Statements do not reflect this dividend payable, which will be accounted for in shareholders’ equity as an appropriation of retained 
earnings in the year ending 31 December 2009. 
13. EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE 
 
Basic earnings per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of the Company for the year  
of £145 million (2007: earnings of £1,505 million) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of  
4,198 million (2007: 4,126 million). The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding and the dilutive impact for both 
periods presented has been adjusted to reflect the bonus element of the Rights Issue. Details of the Rights Issue are provided in  
notes 5, 29 and 30. The Directors believe that the presentation of adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, being the basic earnings 
per ordinary share adjusted for certain re-measurements and exceptional items, assists with understanding the underlying performance 
of the Group. The reconciliation of basic to adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share is as follows:

Certain re-measurements (notes 2 and 8) included within operating profit comprise re-measurements arising on energy procurement 
activities and re-measurement of proprietary trades in relation to cross-border transportation or capacity contracts. Certain re-
measurements included within discontinued operations in 2007 comprise re-measurement of the publicly traded units of The 
Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund. All other re-measurements are included within results before exceptional items and certain  
re-measurements. 
In addition to basic and adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, information is presented for diluted and adjusted diluted earnings 
per ordinary share. Under this presentation, no adjustments are made to the reported earnings for either 2008 or 2007, however the 
weighted average number of shares used as the denominator is adjusted for potentially dilutive ordinary shares. In 2008, no 
outstanding awards or options are considered to be potentially dilutive for diluted earnings per ordinary share, because doing so would 
decrease the loss per ordinary share. However, potentially dilutive ordinary shares were taken into account when calculating adjusted 
diluted earnings per ordinary share.

(i) Brands include £57 million associated with the Dyno-Rod brand, acquired on the acquisition of the Dyno group of companies during 2004. In accordance with IAS 38 paragraph 88, management has 
ascribed the brand an indefinite useful life because there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the Dyno brand is expected to generate net cash inflows. In reaching this determination, 
management has reviewed potential threats from competition, the risks of technological obsolescence and the expected usage of the brand by management. 
(ii) A £21 million write-down of exploration and evaluation expenditure was recognised in Gas production and development, and a £1 million write-down was recognised in the Direct Energy segment,  
in operating costs to reflect a reduction in the recoverable amount of certain assets to £nil, related to projects that are not commercially viable.   
(iii) A £31 million impairment of emissions allowances was recognised in the Power generation segment, within cost of sales, to reflect a reduction in fair value (less costs to sell) as a result of a decrease  
in market prices, that was partially offset by a reduction in the obligation related to emission allowances of £30m.

(i) During the year, the aggregation of assets in determining the cash-generating units for Direct Energy changed in line with the restructuring of the business into four pan-North American lines of 
business. Direct Energy – Mass markets energy combines Canada mass markets, US North mass markets, Texas Direct mass markets and Texas residential energy, Direct Energy – Commercial and 
industrial energy combines Canada commercial and industrial, US North commercial and industrial and Texas commercial and industrial, and Direct Energy – Home and business services combines 
Canada home services, US home services, Canada business services and US business services. Comparative figures have been restated to reflect the change in the allocation of goodwill to cash-
generating units.   
(ii) Carrying amount of goodwill also contains goodwill from other Direct Energy acquisitions which are not significant compared with the aggregate carrying value of goodwill reported within the cash-
generating unit.   
(iii) Goodwill balances allocated across multiple cash-generating units. The amount of goodwill allocated to each cash-generating unit is not significant compared with the aggregate carrying value of 
goodwill reported within the Group. 
 
(b) Basis on which recoverable amount has been determined 
Value in use calculations have been used to determine recoverable amounts for all of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset 
balances noted above, with the exception of the impairment test for the Centrica Energy – Gas production and development cash-
generating unit, where fair value less costs to sell has been used as the basis for determining recoverable amount.  
(i) Value in use 
The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on the Group’s internal Board-approved three-year business plans.  
The Group’s business plans are based on past experience and adjusted to reflect market trends, economic conditions, key risks, the 
implementation of strategic objectives and changes in commodity prices, as appropriate. Commodity prices used in the planning 
process are based in part on observable market data and in part on internal estimates. The extent to which the commodity prices used 
in the business plans are based on observable market data is determined by the extent to which the market for the underlying 
commodity is judged to be active. Note 28 provides additional detail on the active period of each of the commodity markets in which 
the Group operates.    
Cash flows beyond the three-year plan period have been extrapolated using growth rates in line with historic long-term growth rates  
in the market where the cash-generating unit operates.  
Cash flows are discounted using a discount rate specific to each cash-generating unit to determine the cash-generating unit’s value  
in use, which is then deemed to be its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is compared to the carrying value of each cash-
generating unit’s net assets to determine whether the carrying values of any of the Group’s goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset 
balances are greater than their corresponding recoverable amounts.

(ii) Fair value less costs to sell 
Fair value less costs to sell is used as the basis for determining the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to Centrica Energy – Gas 
production and development. This methodology is deemed to be more appropriate because it is based on the post-tax cash flows 
arising from each field within Centrica Energy – Gas production and development, which is consistent with the approach taken by 
management to evaluate the economic value of the underlying assets. 
Fair value less costs to sell is determined by discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the gas production and 
development assets within Centrica Energy – Gas production and development, net of associated selling costs, taking into account 
those assumptions that market participants would use in estimating fair value. Post-tax cash flows are derived from projected 
production profiles of each field within Centrica Energy – Gas production and development, taking into account forward prices for gas 
and liquids over the relevant period. Where forward market prices are not available, prices are determined based on internal model 
inputs. Note 28 provides additional detail on the active period of each of the commodity markets in which the Group operates.  
The date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of 
hydrocarbons, the production costs, the contractual duration of the licence area and the selling price of the gas and liquids produced. 
As each field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the post-tax cash flows for each field are computed 
using individual economic models and key assumptions as determined by management. Post-tax cash flows used in the fair value less 
costs to sell calculation for the first three years are based on the Group’s internal Board-approved three-year business plans and, 
thereafter, are forecast on a consistent basis. The future post-tax cash flows are discounted using a post-tax nominal discount rate of 
8.5% to determine the fair value less costs to sell of Centrica Energy – Gas production and development. Fair value less costs to sell is 
compared to the carrying value of the Centrica Energy – Gas production and development cash-generating unit to determine whether 
goodwill is impaired. The discount rate used in the fair value less costs to sell calculation is determined in the same manner as the 
discount rates used in the value in use calculations described below, with the exception of the adjustment required to determine an 
equivalent pre-tax discount rate that is not required for the fair value less costs to sell calculation.   
(c) Key rates used in value in use calculations 
(i) Growth rate to perpetuity 
Long-term growth rates are determined using a blend of publicly available historical data and long-term growth rate forecasts published 
by external analysts.  
(ii) Discount rates 
The Group uses surrogates in an attempt to estimate a market assessment of the time value of money and the risks inherent in the 
Group’s business plans in order to discount the forecast cash flows of each of the Group’s cash-generating units. Discount rates are 
derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital by replacing the Group’s beta with the betas of companies comparable to 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units to estimate a cash-generating unit specific weighted average cost of capital. Each cash-
generating unit’s specific weighted average cost of capital is then adjusted to reflect the impact of tax in order to calculate an equivalent 
pre-tax discount rate.  
Long-term growth rates used in the value in use calculations for each of the Group’s cash-generating units are provided in the table 
below together with pre-tax discount rates.

(iii) Inflation rates 
Inflation rates used in the three-year business plan were based on a blend of a number of publicly available inflation forecasts available 
in the UK, Europe, Canada and the US. Inflation rates used for the value in use calculations were as follows: UK and Europe – 2.5%  
in 2009 and 2% in 2010 and 2011, Canada – 2.3% in 2009 and 2% in 2010 and 2011 and the US – 2.9% in 2009 and 2% in 2010

(d) Key assumptions used and summary of results  
(i) British Gas Business 
Key assumptions 
 Gross margin percentage: based on contractual terms for customers on existing contracts and achieved gross margin percentages 
in the period leading up to approval of the business plan for new and renewal customers adjusted to reflect current market conditions 
and higher expected transportation costs.  
 Revenues: based on the average market share achieved immediately prior to the approval of the business plan, adjusted for growth 
forecasts based on sales and marketing activity and recent customer acquisitions, with prices based on forward market curves for 
both gas and electricity. 
 Operating costs: based on a projection of headcount in line with expected activity and salary increases based on inflation 
expectations, with a slight increase in the provision for credit losses experienced historically to reflect the current economic 
environment in the UK.  
 
Summary of results 
The recoverable amount of the British Gas Business cash-generating unit exceeded its carrying value at the impairment test date. 
Reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions listed above would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill to be equal 
to or less than the carrying amount.  
(ii) British Gas Services – Dyno-Rod 
Key assumptions 
 Gross margin percentage: based on achieved gross margins in the period leading up to approval of the business plan.  
 Revenues: based on revenue levels achieved in the period leading up to approval of the business plan adjusted for the impact of 
increased marketing spend and the targeting of key accounts with individual sales staff, with a slight reduction in growth rates to 
reflect the current economic environment in the UK.  
 Operating costs: based on a projection of headcount in line with expected activity and salary increases based on inflation 
expectations. 
 
Summary of results 
The recoverable amount of the British Gas Services – Dyno-Rod cash-generating unit exceeded its carrying value at the impairment  
test date. Reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions listed above would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill 
or indefinite lived intangible asset to be equal to or less than their carrying amounts.  
(iii) Centrica Energy – Gas production and development  
Key assumptions 
 Cash inflows: based on forward market prices for gas and oil for the active period of the market and internal model inputs thereafter, 
with reserve volumes and production profiles based on internal management estimates.     
 Cash outflows: based on planned capital expenditure and the estimated future costs of abandonment.  
 Taxation: based on tax rates expected to be in effect at the point of the forecast cash flow.    
 
Summary of results 
The recoverable amount of the Centrica Energy – Gas production and development cash-generating unit exceeded its carrying value at 
the impairment test date. Reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions listed above would not cause the recoverable amount 
of the goodwill to be equal to or less than the carrying amount. 
(iv) Direct Energy – Mass markets energy 
Key assumptions 
 Gross margin percentage: based on contractual terms for customers on existing contracts and achieved gross margin percentages 
in the period leading up to approval of the business plan for new and renewal customers, adjusted to reflect competitor data, where 
available. Where applicable, regulated gross margin percentages are based on the gross margin percentages included in regulatory 
applications submitted to the Alberta Utilities Commission in Canada.   
 Revenues: based on average market share by individual market sector achieved in the period immediately prior to the approval of the 
business plan, adjusted for expectations of growth or decline based on individual jurisdiction to reflect regulatory or competitive 
differences, including customer propensity to switch, and contractual prices, with non-contractual prices based on forward market 
gas and power curves in Canada and the US. 
 Operating costs: based on a projection of headcount in line with expected activity and salary increases based on inflation 
expectations, with a slight increase in the provision for credit losses experienced historically to reflect the current negative economic 
environment in the US, and, to a lesser extent, Canada.

Summary of results 
The recoverable amount of the Direct Energy – Mass markets energy cash-generating unit exceeded its carrying value at the 
impairment test date. Reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions listed above would not cause the recoverable amount  
of the goodwill to be equal to or less than the carrying amount.  
(v) Direct Energy – Commercial and industrial energy 
Key assumptions 
 Gross margin percentage: based on achieved gross margin percentages in the period leading up to approval of the business plan, 
increased to reflect an expected easing of competitive pressure throughout the plan period and decreased to reflect the current 
negative economic environment in the US, and, to a lesser extent, Canada. 
 Revenues: based on historical growth trends and planned sales activities by individual market sector with an adjustment to reflect an 
increase in volumes driven by the acquisition of Strategic Energy as explained in note 35. Prices are based on forward market curves 
for gas and electricity in Canada and the US.  
 Operating costs: based on expected increases in existing cost base to reflect increased activity as a slightly declining percentage  
of gross margins to reflect expected synergies associated with the acquisition of Strategic Energy as explained in note 35. 
 
Summary of results 
The recoverable amount of the Direct Energy – Commercial and industrial energy cash-generating unit exceeded its carrying value at 
the impairment test date. Reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions listed above would not cause the recoverable amount 
of the goodwill to be equal to or less than the carrying amount.  
(vi) Direct Energy – Home and business services 
Key assumptions 
 Gross margin percentage: based on gross margin percentages achieved in the period leading up to approval of the business plan, 
adjusted to reflect the current economic conditions and housing decline in North America.   
 Revenues: based on historical growth trends by individual market sector adjusted for new product offerings and continued 
penetration into new markets. 
 Operating costs: based on projected headcount and inflationary increases.   
 
Summary of results 
The recoverable amount of the Direct Energy – Home and business services cash-generating unit exceeded its carrying value at the 
impairment test date. Reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions listed above would not cause the recoverable amount of 
the goodwill to be equal to or less than the carrying amount.  
(vii) European Energy – Oxxio 
Key assumptions 
 Gross margin percentage: based on the gross margin percentages achieved in the period leading up to approval of the business 
plan, adjusted to reflect the increase in levels of competition currently being experienced in The Netherlands.   
 Revenues: based on customer account growth achieved in the period leading up to approval of the business plan, adjusted 
downward to reflect the impact of the recent increases in competition, with prices reflecting forward market curves for gas  
and electricity.   
 Operating costs: based on projected headcount and inflationary increases adjusted to reflect recently implemented cost improvement 
programmes and an increase in web enabled customer solutions. 
 
Summary of results 
The recoverable amount of the European Energy – Oxxio cash-generating unit was below its carrying value by £45 million at the 
impairment test date and accordingly an impairment loss of this amount has been recognised in the Income Statement for the year 
ended 31 December 2008 within exceptional operating costs. The impairment loss arose due to a mixture of more competitive markets 
and lower margins in the forecast period due to procurement issues that arose during 2008 with the increased volatility in energy 
markets. The European Energy – Oxxio value in use calculation was based on a discount rate of 10.9% (2007: 10.7%), and assumed 
an average gross margin percentage of 9.0% over the three years with closing customer numbers of approximately 750,000 in all three 
years. At 31 December 2008, the carrying value of the European Energy – Oxxio cash-generating unit was equal to its recoverable 
amount. As a result, a reasonably possible decrease in gross margin percentage or customer numbers, below the levels used in the 
value in use calculation above, would potentially result in the recoverable amount of the European Energy – Oxxio cash-generating unit 
falling below its carrying value, triggering a further impairment loss. If, for example, the value in use calculation assumed gross margin 
percentages 0.5ppts lower, than those used, a further goodwill impairment loss of approximately £32 million would have been 
recorded, while a 5% reduction in customer numbers would have resulted in an additional goodwill impairment loss of approximately 
£23 million.

(2007: £488 million) during the year. Write-downs of inventory of £23 million (2007: £nil) were recognised in gross profit during the year 
to reflect the impact of a reduction in the forward market price of gas on the net realisable value of gas in storage and transportation, 
with £10 million recognised in Direct Energy, £8 million recognised in Centrica Energy and £5 million recognised in Centrica Storage.

20.  TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES CONTINUED 
 
At 31 December 2008 there were £107 million (2007: £87 million) of receivables, net of provisions for credit losses, from residential 
customers and £25 million (2007: £nil) from treasury, trading and energy procurement counterparties that were considered to be 
individually impaired. There were no individually impaired receivables, net of provisions for credit losses, from business customers. 
Receivables from residential customers are generally reviewed for impairment on an individual basis once a customer discontinues their 
relationship with the Group. The provision for credit losses is based on an incurred loss model and is determined by application of 
expected default and loss factors, determined by historical loss experience and current sampling to the various balances receivable 
from residential and business customers on a portfolio basis, in addition to provisions taken against individual accounts. Balances are 
written off when recoverability is assessed as being remote. Movements in the provision for credit losses by class are as follows:

The charge for the impairment of trade receivables is stated net of credits for the release of specific provisions made in previous years, 
relating mainly to residential customers in the UK, which are no longer required. At 31 December 2008 the Group held £23 million 
(2007: £36 million) of customer deposits for the purposes of mitigating the credit risk associated with receivables from residential and 
business customers. Exposure to credit risk associated with receivables from treasury, trading and energy procurement counterparties 
is monitored by counterparty credit rating as follows:

The unrated counterparty receivables are comprised primarily of amounts due from subsidiaries of rated entities, exchanges or clearing 
houses. Receivables from treasury, trading and energy procurement counterparties are managed in accordance with the Group’s 
counterparty credit policy as described in note 4.  
21. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
Derivative financial instruments are generally held for the purposes of proprietary energy trading, treasury management or energy 
procurement. Derivatives held for the purposes of proprietary energy trading are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value 
recognised in the Group’s results for the year before exceptional items and certain re-measurements, with the exception of certain 
derivatives related to cross-border transportation and capacity contracts (note 2). Derivative financial instruments held for the purposes 
of treasury management or energy procurement are also carried at fair value, with changes in the fair value of derivatives relating to 
treasury management reflected in the results for the year before exceptional items and certain re-measurements, and those relating to 
energy procurement reflected in certain re-measurements. In cases where a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, derivatives are 
classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. Notes 2 and 22 provide further 
detail on the Group’s hedge accounting.  
Energy contracts designated at fair value through profit and loss include certain energy contracts that the Group has, at its option, 
designated at fair value through profit and loss under IAS 39 because the energy contract contains one or more embedded derivatives 
that significantly modify the cash flows under the contract (note 2).

Derivative-related credit risk – assets  
Credit risk from derivative transactions is generated by the potential for the counterparty to default on its contractual obligations. 
Therefore, derivative-related credit risk is represented by the positive fair value of the instrument and is normally a small fraction of  
the contract’s notional amount. Credit risk from derivatives is measured and managed by counterparty credit rating as follows:

To manage derivative-related counterparty credit exposure, the Group employs the use of margining and set-off rights in some 
agreements. Under margining agreements, the Group has the right to request that the counterparty pay down or collateralise the 
current fair value of its derivatives position when the position passes a specified threshold. Details of collateral balances held at  
31 December 2008 are provided in note 4.

Certain of the Group’s energy contracts that are accounted for as derivatives are for the physical purchase of energy. In these  
cases, IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a maturity analysis that shows cash outflows on all purchase contracts on an undiscounted basis,

22. HEDGE ACCOUNTING 
 
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified either as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net 
investments in foreign operations. Note 2 details the Group’s accounting policies in relation to derivatives qualifying for hedge 
accounting under IAS 39. The fair values of derivative and primary financial instruments in hedge accounting relationships at  
31 December were as follows:  
  2008   2007 
 
Assets
£m 
Liabilities 
£m

Cash flow hedges  96 369  123 67
Net investment hedges:   
Primary financial instruments – 225  –74
Derivative financial instruments 18 77  –16
 
Fair value hedges  
The Group’s fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements used  
to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate long-term debt due to movements in market interest rates. For qualifying fair 
value hedges, all changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and in the fair value of the hedged item in relation to the risk being 
hedged are recognised as income within net interest expense.

On hedging instruments   81 5
On hedged items attributable to the hedged risk (82) (6)
 (1) (1)
Cash flow hedges  
The Group’s cash flow hedges consist primarily of: (a) physical and financial gas and power purchase contracts used to protect against 
the variability in future cash flows associated with highly probable forecast purchases of gas and power due to movements in market 
commodity prices; (b) forward foreign exchange contracts used to protect against the variability of functional currency denominated 
cash flows associated with non-functional currency denominated highly probable forecast transactions; and (c) interest rate swaps, 
cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements used to protect against the variability in cash flows associated with 
floating-rate borrowings due to movements in market interest rates.  
Gains and losses are initially recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve in equity and are transferred to the Income Statement when 
the forecast cash flows affect the Income Statement. Note 30 details movements in the cash flow hedging reserve. The ineffective 
portion of gains and losses on cash flow hedging are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. During 2008, the Group 
recognised a £4 million loss (2007: £nil) due to cash flow hedge ineffectiveness.  
Net investment hedges  
The Group’s net investment hedges consist of foreign currency debt issued in the same currency as the net investment, foreign 
exchange forwards and cross-currency interest rate swaps used to protect against the variability in the pounds sterling value of the 
Group’s net investments in foreign operations due to movements in the relative strength of foreign currencies to pounds sterling.  
Gains and losses on the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in equity and transferred to the Income Statement on disposal  
of the foreign operation. Gains and losses on the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. 
During 2008, the Group did not recognise any gains or losses due to net investment hedge ineffectiveness (2007: £nil).

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority. The following is an analysis of the deferred

At the balance sheet date the Group had certain deductible temporary differences of £178 million (2007: £376 million) available for 
utilisation against future profits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these temporary differences, due to the 
unpredictability of future profit streams. These assets may be carried forward indefinitely. At the balance sheet date temporary 
differences of £76 million (2007: £62 million) existed in respect of the Group’s overseas investments. The deferred tax liability  
arising on these temporary differences is estimated to be £3 million (2007: £3 million), which has been provided for.  
Current tax assets of £39 million (2007: £40 million) include £20 million (2007: £20 million) of recoverable petroleum revenue tax.

(i) The restructuring provisions relate to significant restructuring programmes undertaken to achieve the Group’s stated cost reduction targets. Included within the provision are costs related to surplus 
properties of £50 million (2007: £51 million) estimated with reference to the expected cost to be incurred to the point of lease termination, including costs for dilapidations and sub-letting. The 
provisions are expected to be utilised between 2009 and 2022. 
(ii) Provision has been made for the estimated net present cost of decommissioning gas production and storage facilities at the end of their useful lives. The estimate has been based on proven and 
probable reserves, price levels and technology at the balance sheet date. The timing of decommissioning payments is dependent on the lives of the facilities but is anticipated to occur between 2010 
and 2062, with the substantial majority of the provision being utilised between 2015 and 2030. The charge to income includes £20 million of notional interest (2007: £13 million).  
(iii) The sales contract loss provision relates to the acquisition of a portfolio of gas customers by the Group. Certain of the contracts acquired were identified as being out-of-the-money at the date of 
acquisition, and the sales contract loss provision was established in respect of them.  
(iv) In previous years, the Group renegotiated certain long-term take-or-pay contracts which would have resulted in commitments to pay for gas that would be in excess of requirements and/or at prices above 
likely market rates. The provision represents the net present cost of estimated payments due to suppliers as consideration for the renegotiations, most of which was settled in 2008, based on the reserves in a 
group of third-party fields. The charge for the year includes £nil of notional interest (2007: £6 million). 
(v) Other provisions include outstanding litigation for a number of items (none of which are individually significant) and provision for National Insurance payable in respect of Long Term Incentive Scheme 
liabilities. The National Insurance provision was based on a share price of 266.00 pence at 31 December 2008 (2007: 319.21 pence after adjusting for the bonus element of the Rights Issue) and is 
expected to be utilised between 2009 and 2014.

28. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  
 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length 
transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties under no compulsion to act. The Group has documented internal policies  
for determining fair value, including methodologies used to establish valuation adjustments required for credit risk.  
The fair values of the Group’s financial instruments, together with the carrying amounts included in the Balance Sheet are analysed

Financial instruments valued at their carrying values 
Due to their nature and/or short-term maturity, the fair values of trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and 
other payables and provisions are estimated to approximate their carrying values.  
Available-for-sale financial assets  
The fair values of available-for-sale financial assets are based on quoted market prices, when available. If quoted market prices are  
not available, fair values are estimated using observable market data.  
Bank overdrafts, loans and other borrowings  
The fair values of bonds are based on quoted market prices. The fair values of bank loans have been determined by discounting cash 
flows with reference to relevant market rates of interest. The fair values of overdrafts and commercial paper are assumed to equal their 
book values due to the short-term nature of these amounts. The fair values of obligations under finance leases have been determined 
by discounting contractual cash flows with reference to the Group’s cost of borrowing.

28.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 
 
Derivative financial instruments and energy contracts designated at fair value through profit and loss 
The fair values of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are determined by reference to closing market rates at the balance 
sheet date. The fair values of energy derivatives are determined using valuation techniques based in part on observable market data 
and in part on internal estimates not currently supported by observable market data. The extent to which fair values of energy 
derivatives are based on observable market data is determined by the extent to which the market for the underlying commodity  
is judged to be active. The Group has judged each of the markets in which it operates as active for the purposes of accounting  
as follows:  
Active period of markets Gas Power Coal Emissions Oil 
UK (years)  2 2 3 2-4 3
North America (years) 5 5 n/a n/a n/a
Europe (years) n/a Up to 5 n/a n/a n/a
The fair values of energy contracts within the scope of IAS 39 that settle inside the active period of the market are based on quoted 
market prices and expected volumes, discounted at a rate of 3% (2007: 6%). The fair values of derivative financial instruments in  
North America and Europe are based primarily on quoted market prices. In the UK, however, certain energy contracts extend beyond 
the active period of the market. The fair values of energy contracts that extend beyond the active period of the market are determined 
by reference in part to published price quotations in active markets and in part by using valuation techniques based on commodity 
prices derived using assumptions that are based on internal market expectations and expected volumes, discounted using a discount 
rate of 3% (2007: 5%).  
The net fair value of energy contracts recorded in the Financial Statements determined using valuation techniques based on non-
observable market variables at 31 December 2008 is a £272 million liability (2007: £322 million liability). The total change in fair value  
of energy contracts estimated using valuation techniques based on variables not supportable by market prices that was recognised  
in the Income Statement during the year ended 31 December 2008 amounted to a gain of £17 million (2007: loss of £100 million). 
While internal market forecasts outside the active period of the market reasonably reflect all factors that market participants would 
consider in setting a price, these expectations are not currently supportable by active forward market quotes. The fair values of these 
contracts would change significantly if the assumptions in respect of gas, power, coal, emissions or oil prices were changed to 
reasonably possible alternatives. The impacts of reasonably possible changes to assumed gas, power, emissions, coal and oil prices 
on the net fair value of the Group’s derivative financial instruments determined using valuation models based on non-observable market 
data are as follows:  
 2008  2007 
Energy price 
Reasonably 
possible 
change 
in variable  
Reasonably

UK gas (p/therm) +/-14 +/-12

UK emissions (€/tonne) +/-4 +/-6
UK oil (US$/bbl)  +/-15 +/-14
 
Increase/(decrease) in fair value  
2008
£m 
 
2007
£m 
UK energy prices – increase/decrease  179/(175) 85/(100)
The impacts disclosed above result from changing the assumptions used for fair valuing energy contracts in relation to gas, power, 
emissions, coal and oil prices to reasonably possible alternative assumptions at the balance sheet date. The fair value impacts only 
concern those contracts entered into which are within the scope of IAS 39 and are marked-to-market based on valuation models using 
assumptions that are not currently observable in an active market. The sensitivity analysis provided is hypothetical only and should be 
used with caution as the impacts provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced because the 
Group’s actual exposure to market rates is constantly changing as the Group’s portfolio of energy contracts changes. Changes in fair 
values based on a variation in a market variable cannot be extrapolated because the relationship between the change in market variable 
and the change in fair value may not be linear.

Where the fair value at initial recognition for such contracts differs from the transaction price a day-one gain or loss will arise. Such 
gains and losses are deferred and amortised to the Income Statement based on volumes purchased or delivered over the contractual 
period until such time as observable market data becomes available (see note 2 for further detail). The amount that has yet to be 
recognised in the Income Statement relating to the difference between the fair value at initial recognition (the transaction price) and  
the amount that would have arisen had valuation techniques used for subsequent measurement been applied at initial recognition,  
less subsequent releases, is as follows:

(i) At a General Meeting of the Company held on 21 November 2008, the authorised share capital of the Company was increased from £275 million to £432 million by the creation of 2,545,000,000 
ordinary shares of a nominal value of 6
14
/ 81 pence each, forming a single class with the existing ordinary shares. 
(ii) On 31 October 2008, the Company announced a Rights Issue, which was approved by shareholders on 21 November 2008, on the basis of three new ordinary shares for every eight ordinary shares 
held at 160 pence per share, all with a nominal value of 6
14
/ 81 pence each. The Company raised proceeds of approximately £2,164 million, net of issue costs of approximately £65 million. The last day 
for acceptance was 12 December 2008 and dealing in new ordinary shares fully paid commenced on the London Stock Exchange on 15 December 2008. 
(iii) Ordinary shares were allotted and issued to satisfy the exercise of share options, share incentive schemes, the Direct Energy Employee Share Purchase Plan and the matching element of the Share 
Incentive Plan as follows: 
 
 2008 2007 
Number 34,889,085 17,259,243
Nominal value (£m) 2.2 1.1
Consideration (£m) (net of issue costs of £nil (2007: £nil)) 38 22
The closing price of one Centrica ordinary share on 31 December 2008 was 266.00 pence (2007: 319.21 pence after adjusting for the 
bonus element of the Rights Issue). 
Centrica employee share ownership trusts purchase Centrica ordinary shares from the open market and receive newly issued shares to 
satisfy future obligations of certain employee share schemes. During the year, the trusts purchased 1.0 million shares (2007: 0.6 
million), received 6.5 million newly allotted shares (2007: 5.3 million) and released 4.5 million shares (2007: 5.3 million shares) to 
employees on vesting. At 31 December 2008, the trusts held 3.6 million shares (2007: 0.6 million shares) at a carrying amount of £10 
million (2007: £2 million). Until such time as the Company’s own shares held by these trusts vest unconditionally, the amount paid for 
those shares, or the value they were issued at, are held as treasury shares and are deducted from shareholders’ equity. The number of 
ordinary shares held in trust for both periods presented has been adjusted to reflect the bonus element of the Rights Issue. Details of 
the Rights Issue are provided in notes 5 and 30.

Merger reserve 
On 17 February 1997 BG plc (formerly British Gas plc) demerged certain businesses (grouped together under GB Gas Holdings Limited 
(GBGH)) to Centrica plc. Prior to demerger, the companies comprising the Centrica businesses were transferred to GBGH, a subsidiary 
undertaking of BG plc. Upon demerger, the share capital of GBGH was transferred to Centrica plc and was recorded at the nominal 
value of shares issued to BG plc shareholders. In accordance with sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985, no premium was 
recorded on the shares issued. On consolidation, the difference between the nominal value of the Company’s shares issued and the 
amount of share capital and share premium of GBGH at the date of demerger was credited to a merger reserve. 
On 15 December 2008, a Rights Issue was completed and 1,392,789,173 new ordinary shares with an aggregate nominal value of 
approximately £86 million were issued for cash consideration of £2,164 million, net of issue costs of £65 million. The Rights Issue was 
effected through a structure which resulted in a merger reserve arising under section 131 of the Companies Act 1985. Centrica plc 
issued shares in exchange for shares in Centrica CB Limited, which subsequently redeemed its no par value redeemable preference 
shares for cash. Following the receipt of the cash proceeds through the structure, the excess of the net proceeds received over the 
nominal value of the share capital issued has been transferred from the merger reserve to other profit and loss reserves.   
Capital redemption reserve 
In accordance with section 170 (1) of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has transferred to the capital redemption reserve an 
amount equal to the nominal value of shares repurchased and subsequently cancelled.  
Revaluation reserve 
During 2005, the revaluation of the Group’s existing interest in Centrica SHB Limited to fair value, following the acquisition by the Group 
of the remaining 40% stake in the company, was recorded as a revaluation reserve adjustment. 
Foreign currency translation and net investment hedging reserve 
The foreign currency translation and net investment hedging reserve comprises exchange translation differences on foreign currency 
net investments, offset by exchange translation differences on borrowings and derivatives classified as net investment hedges under the 
requirements of IAS 39. Exchange gains of £175 million (2007: £48 million) on net investments in overseas undertakings have been 
offset in reserves against exchange losses of £185 million (2007: £32 million) on foreign currency borrowings and other instruments 
used for hedging purposes. 
Cash flow hedging reserve 
The cash flow hedging reserve comprises fair value movements on instruments designated as cash flow hedges under the requirements  
of IAS 39. Note 22 provides further detail on cash flow hedging.

the hedged item affects the Income Statement which is, for the most part, on delivery of physical volumes for energy contracts and the 
accrual of interest for debt contracts.

Profit and loss reserve 
Treasury shares reserve reflects the cost of shares in the Company held in share-based payment plans to meet future obligations  
to deliver shares to employees on vesting. 
Cumulative actuarial gains arising on defined benefit pension schemes recognised in the profit and loss reserve amounted to  
£324 million (2007: £723 million). Cumulative losses of £16 million (2007: gains of £3 million) on available-for-sale financial assets were  
included within the profit and loss reserve.  
Aggregate tax taken directly to reserves amounted to a credit of £208 million (2007: £248 million charge), of which a credit of  
£111 million relates to deferred tax arising on actuarial losses on the Group’s defined benefit schemes (2007: £75 million charge),  
and a credit of £97 million relates to deferred tax arising on gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and cash flow hedges 
(2007: £173 million charge).  
The share-based payments reserve reflects the obligation to deliver shares to employees under the Group’s share schemes in return  
for services provided.

Differences between current tax charged and taxes paid arose principally due to the following factors:  
 UK corporation tax is paid, based on estimated profits, partly during the year and partly in the following year. Fluctuations in profits 
from year to year may therefore give rise to divergence between the charge for the current year and taxes paid; and 
 Petroleum revenue tax payments are based on income realised in the preceding period, with subsequent adjustments to reflect 
actual profits. Variations in production from period to period may therefore lead to temporary differences between tax charged  
and tax paid.

33. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
 
Employee share schemes are designed to encourage participants to align their objectives with those of shareholders. Centrica operates 
eight main employee share schemes: the Deferred and Matching Share Scheme (DMSS), the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS), 
the Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS), Sharesave, the Share Award Scheme (SAS), the Restricted Share Scheme (RSS), the Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP) and the Direct Energy Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP). 
On 15 December 2008 the Company raised proceeds of £2,164 million, net of issue costs of £65 million, through a Rights Issue as 
explained in notes 5, 29 and 30. The number of shares allocated to employees under the Group’s share schemes has been adjusted to 
reflect the bonus element of the Rights Issue. The terms of the Group’s employee share schemes were adjusted such that participants 
of the various plans were no better or worse off as a result of the Rights Issue. Consequently, no additional expense was or will be 
recognised as a result of changes to the Group’s employee share schemes. Details of the adjustments made to the terms of the 
Group’s employee share schemes as a result of the Rights Issue are provided in sections (b) and (c) below.    
(a) Summary of share-based payment plans and movements in the number of shares and options outstanding  
DMSS 
Awards under the DMSS are generally reserved for employees within the senior executive group. The scheme operates over a four-year 
vesting period. Under normal conditions the grant date of the scheme is the first day of each bonus year. This is followed by a vesting 
period of four years, being the bonus year plus a three-year performance period. The fair value of the award reflects the market value of 
the shares at the grant date. The scheme comprises three separate elements: 
(i) Deferred shares 
The scheme requires participants to defer 20% of their annual pre-tax bonus into the scheme. The shares are held in trust over the 
three-year performance period, during which time they cannot be withdrawn. An employee who leaves prior to the vesting date will 
forfeit their right to the shares (except where permitted by the rules of the scheme). All shares held in trust will be eligible to receive 
dividends. The number of shares deferred is estimated from the participant’s maximum bonus and the likelihood of bonus payout  
in the bonus year. Subsequent revisions are made based on the actual bonus paid in the year. 
(ii) Investment shares 
The scheme allows participants to elect to invest an additional amount of their annual bonus into the scheme up to a maximum of 50% 
of their total potential after-tax bonus for the year. This 50% limit includes the amount automatically deferred each year pre-tax. The 
number of shares invested is estimated based on the maximum bonus in year one. The shares may be funded directly from the 
employee or through a release of the employee’s LTIS shares and thus the shares do not attract an IFRS 2 charge. Subsequent to the 
bonus year, the shares are held in trust over the three-year performance period and will vest unconditionally. Participants can withdraw 
the investment shares unconditionally at any point throughout the vesting period, although the related matching shares will be forfeited. 
The shares are eligible to receive dividends.  
(iii) Matching shares 
Deferred and investment shares will be matched with conditional matching shares, which will be released upon the achievement, over  
a three-year performance period, of three-year cumulative Group economic profit performance targets. Group economic profit is 
calculated by taking Group operating profit before exceptional items and certain re-measurements after tax and subtracting a charge 
for capital employed based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. The number of matching shares that will vest will be 
determined on a straight-line basis from a zero match for no growth in economic profit up to a two-times match for growth of 25% or 
more. The number of investment matching shares, subject to the performance conditions, is grossed up to reflect the impact of tax and 
National Insurance. The number of matching shares released following the satisfaction of the performance conditions will be increased 
to reflect the dividends that would have been paid during the three-year performance period. The likelihood of achieving the 
performance conditions is taken into account in calculating the number of awards expected to vest. Estimates are made in year one 
and revised in subsequent years. An employee who leaves prior to the vesting date will forfeit their right to the shares (except where 
permitted by the rules of the scheme).  
The number of shares originally granted and fair value allocated are estimated on the grant date and then adjusted following the 
announcement of the actual annual performance bonus and subsequent investment by participants. Details of the fair values of awards 
granted and related assumptions are included in section (c) below.

ESOS 
Under the ESOS, the Board may grant options over shares in Centrica plc to employees of the Group. Options are granted with a fixed 
exercise price equal to the market price of the shares at the legal date of grant which approximates, or is the same as, the grant date 
for accounting purposes. Awards under the ESOS are generally reserved for employees within the senior executive group. Options 
granted under the ESOS will become exercisable in full on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the growth in earnings 
per share over that period exceeding RPI growth by 18 percent or more. The number of options becoming exercisable is determined  
on a straight-line basis between 40% and 100% if EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by between nine and 18 percent. Options granted 
up to March 2004 permitted retesting of EPS growth annually for a further two years. The exercise of options is subject to continued 
employment within the Group (except where permitted by the rules of the scheme). No performance conditions were included in the fair 
value calculations. Early exercise has been taken into account by estimating the expected life of the options. Details of the fair values of 
awards granted and related assumptions are included in section (b) below. A reconciliation of option movements is as follows:

LTIS 
Under the LTIS, allocations of shares in Centrica plc are generally reserved for employees at senior management level. For awards 
made up to 2005, the number of shares to be released to participants is calculated subject to the Company’s total shareholder return 
(TSR) during the three years following the grant date, compared with the TSR of other shares in the FTSE 100 Index over the same 
period. The number of shares released is reduced on a sliding scale if Centrica’s TSR is ranked between 50th and 25th. Shares are 
released to participants immediately following the end of the period in which TSR performance is assessed, however release of shares 
is subject to continued employment within the Group at the date of release (except where permitted by the rules of the scheme). 
Allocations were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Performance conditions were included in the fair value 
calculations, through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. For awards made from 2006, the vesting of only half of each award  
is made on the basis of TSR performance. For this half of the award, the calculation of TSR performance as compared with the TSR  
of other FTSE 100 Index shares is consistent with awards made to the end of 2005, except that allocations are valued using a Monte 
Carlo simulation model. The number of shares released is determined on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100% if Centrica’s 
TSR is ranked between 50th and 20th. The vesting of the remaining half of awards made since 2006 is dependent on earnings per 
share (EPS) growth. This is considered a non-market condition under IFRS 2. For shares that vest on awards made from 2006 (for both 
TSR and EPS portions), additional shares are awarded or a cash payment is made to reflect dividends that would have been paid on 
the allocations during the performance period. The fair value of the awards is therefore considered to be the market value at the grant 
date. The likelihood of achieving the performance conditions is taken into account in calculating the number of awards expected to 
vest. Details of the fair values of awards granted and related assumptions are included in section (c) below. A reconciliation of 
movements in allocations is as follows:

Sharesave 
Under Sharesave, the Board may grant options over shares in Centrica plc to all UK-based employees of the Group. To date, the 
Board has approved the grant of options with a fixed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price of the shares for the 
three days prior to invitation which is three to four weeks prior to the grant date. Employees pay a fixed amount from salary into a 
savings account each month, and may elect to save over three or five years. At the end of the savings period, employees have six 
months in which to exercise their options using the funds saved. If employees decide not to exercise their options, they may withdraw 
the funds saved, and the options expire. Exercise of options is subject to continued employment within the Group (except where 
permitted by rules of the scheme). Details of the fair values of awards granted and related assumptions are included in section (b)

SAS 
Under the SAS, allocations of shares in Centrica plc are made to selected employees at middle management levels, based on 
recommendation by the Chief Executive and the Group Human Resources Director. There is no contractual eligibility for SAS and  
each year’s award is made independently from previous awards. Allocations are subject to no performance conditions and vest 
unconditionally subject to continued employment within the Group (except where permitted by the rules of the scheme) in two stages – 
half of the award vesting after two years, the other half vesting after three years. On vesting, additional shares are awarded or a cash 
payment is made to reflect dividends that would have been paid on the allocations during the vesting period. The fair value is therefore 
considered to be the market value at date of grant. Details of the fair values of awards granted and related assumptions are included in

RSS 
Awards under the RSS are reserved for certain selected key employees at senior management levels, based on recommendation  
by the Chief Executive and the Group Human Resources Director. Neither the Executive Directors nor the next tier of executive 
management are eligible to participate. There is no contractual eligibility for RSS and each year’s award is made independently from 
previous awards. Allocations are subject to no performance conditions and vest unconditionally subject to continued employment 
within the Group (except where permitted by the rules of the scheme) in one or two stages dependent on the individual awards. On 
vesting, additional shares are awarded or a cash payment is made to reflect dividends that would have been paid on the allocations 
during the vesting period. The fair value is therefore considered to be the market value at date of grant. Details of the fair values of 
awards granted and related assumptions are included in section (c) below.

SIP 
Under SIP, employees in the UK may purchase ‘partnership shares’ through monthly salary deductions. The Company then awards 
one ‘matching share’ for every two purchased, up to a maximum of 20 matching shares per employee per month (since increased to 
22 matching shares from 2009 to reflect the bonus element of the Rights Issue). Both partnership shares and matching shares are held 
in a trust. Partnership shares may be withdrawn at any time, but matching shares are forfeited if the related partnership shares are 
withdrawn within three years from the original purchase date. Matching shares vest unconditionally for employees after being held for 
three years in the trust. Vesting of matching shares is also subject to continued employment within the Group (except where permitted 
by the rules of the scheme). Matching shares are valued at the market price at the grant date. Details of the fair values of awards

34. PENSIONS 
 
Pension schemes 
A substantial majority of the Group’s UK employees at 31 December 2008 were members of one of the three main schemes: the 
Centrica Pension Scheme, the Centrica Engineers’ Pension Scheme and the Centrica Management Pension Scheme (together the 
approved pension schemes). The Centrica Pension Scheme (final salary section) and the Centrica Management Pension Scheme (a 
final salary scheme) were closed to new members from 1 April 2003. The Centrica Pension Scheme also has a career average salary 
section which was closed to new members with effect from 1 July 2008 and replaced by a defined contribution section which is open 
to new members. The Centrica Engineers’ Pension Scheme (final salary section) was closed to new members from 1 April 2006, and  
a career average salary section was added to the scheme at that date. These schemes are defined benefit schemes and are tax-
approved funded arrangements. They are subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the 
qualified actuary certifies the rate of employer contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees 
and proceeds from the schemes’ assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the schemes. 
The Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme is an unfunded arrangement which provides benefits to certain employees whose benefits 
under the main schemes would otherwise be limited by the earnings cap. The Group also has a commitment to provide certain pension 
and post-retirement benefits to employees of Direct Energy Marketing Limited (Canada) under a defined benefit scheme. 
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out at the following dates: the approved pension schemes at 31 March 2006, the 
Unapproved Pension Scheme at 6 April 2008 and the Direct Energy Marketing Limited pension plan at 14 June 2008. These have  
been updated to 31 December 2008 for the purposes of meeting the requirements of IAS 19. Investments have been valued, for this 
purpose, at market value.  
Governance 
The UK schemes are managed by trustee companies where boards consist of both company nominated and member nominated 
directors. Each UK scheme holds units in the Centrica Combined Common Investment Fund (CCCIF), which holds the combined 
assets of the participating schemes. The method of allocation of units is set out in the Trust Deed of the CCCIF. The trustee of  
the CCCIF is a company, Centrica Combined Common Investment Fund Limited (CCCIF Limited) which was incorporated on  
23 September 2002. The trustee of the CCCIF may be appointed or removed by the participant schemes. The board of CCCIF Limited 
comprises six directors, of which three are appointed by Centrica plc (including the chairman and one independent director) and a 
director is appointed by each of the participating schemes. No direct investments are made in securities issued by Centrica plc or any 
of its subsidiaries, property leased to or owned by Centrica plc or any of its subsidiaries or securities of any fund manager or any of their 
associated companies.  
Under the terms of the Pensions Act 2004, the Company and each trustee board must agree the funding rate for its defined benefit 
pension scheme and a recovery plan to fund any deficit against the scheme specific statutory funding objective. This approach was  
first adopted for the triennial valuations completed at 31 March 2006 and will again be reflected in the valuations due to be completed 
at 31 March 2009.   
In addition, the Group has a commitment to provide contributions to defined contribution schemes for certain employees in the UK  
and North America who are not members of one of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes.

The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date have been based on a combination  
of standard actuarial mortality tables, scheme experience and other relevant data, and include a medium cohort allowance for future 
improvements in longevity, as published by the Institute of Actuaries. The assumptions are equivalent to future longevity for members  
in normal health approximately as follows:

Life expectancy at age 65 for a member: 
Male

At 31 March 2006, the date of the most recent actuarial review, the schemes had approximately 31,900 members and beneficiaries 
(20,850 male and 11,050 female). 
The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data. 
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension schemes.

The overall expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average based on the actual plan assets held and the respective expected 
returns on separate asset classes less costs of administering the plan and taxes paid by the plan itself. The returns on separate asset 
classes were derived as follows: the expected rate of return on equities is based on the expected median return over a ten-year period, 
as calculated by the independent company actuary. The median return over a longer period than ten years was not expected to be 
materially dissimilar. The expected rate of return on bonds was measured directly from actual market yields for UK gilts and corporate 
bond stocks. The rate above takes into account the actual mixture of UK gilts, UK corporate bonds and overseas bonds held at the 
balance sheet date. The expected rate of return on property takes into account both capital growth and allowance for expenses, rental 
growth and depreciation. The expected rate of return on cash is comparable to current bank interest rates. 
Included within the schemes’ liabilities above are £24 million (2007: £31 million) relating to unfunded pension arrangements. Included 
within non-current available-for-sale financial assets are £26 million (2007: £30 million) of investments, held by the Law Debenture Trust 
on behalf of the Company, as security in respect of the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme. 
The Company has agreed with the trustees of the Centrica Pension Scheme and the Centrica Management Pension Scheme that it will 
provide collateral equal to the 31 December IAS 19 deficits two months after the relevant financial year or make additional contributions. 
At 31 December 2008, the IAS 19 net deficit on these two schemes totalled £94 million. The agreements provide that a charge over 
assets or letters of credit from a bank with a minimum credit rating of AA will be acceptable collateral for the trustees.

During the year, the Group acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Rockyview Energy Inc. (Rockyview Energy), 100% of 
the membership interests of Strategic Energy LLC (Strategic Energy), a subsidiary of Great Plains Energy Inc., 100% of the Canadian 
assets of TransGlobe Energy Corp. (TransGlobe Energy), 100% of the share capital of Caythorpe Gas Storage Ltd (Caythorpe) and 
interests in a number of non-operated gas and oil assets in Norway (Heimdal assets). Other smaller acquisitions are described in 
section (f).  
The purchase method of accounting was adopted in all cases. The assets and liabilities acquired and their fair values are shown below.  
The residual excess of cash consideration over the net assets acquired on each acquisition is recognised as goodwill in the Financial 
Statements. Unless otherwise stated, the fair values disclosed are provisional because the Directors have not yet reached a final 
determination on all aspects of the fair value exercise. 
(a) Rockyview Energy 
On 14 January 2008 the Group acquired 88.4% of the outstanding common shares of publicly traded oil and gas company Rockyview 
Energy for cash consideration of C$70 million (£35 million) and the remaining 11.6% of the outstanding common shares of Rockyview 
Energy by 19 February 2008 in a series of transactions for additional cash consideration of C$9 million (£5 million). In addition, 
borrowings with a fair value of C$38 million (£19 million) as assumed by the Group as part of the acquisition have been reflected in the 
opening balance sheet of the acquiree. The acquired business contributed a profit after tax of £7 million to the Group for the period 
from 14 January 2008 to 31 December 2008. The book values of the assets and liabilities have been adjusted to align with the fair 
values of the assets and liabilities acquired. The adjustments to recognise other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment at 
fair value mainly relate to the acquired exploration and evaluation assets, and the producing oil and gas field assets. Other adjustments 
were made in respect of the recognition of decommissioning provisions at fair value and deferred tax relating to the fair value 
adjustments. During the year, the Directors reached a final determination on all aspects of the fair value exercise. No material 
adjustments have been made to the fair values disclosed in the 2008 interim Financial Statements.  
(b) TransGlobe Energy 
On 1 May 2008 the Group acquired 100% of the assets of TransGlobe Energy for cash consideration of C$51 million (£26 million). 
TransGlobe Energy is a publicly-traded oil and gas producer based in Calgary, Canada. The acquired business contributed a profit after 
tax of £1 million to the Group for the period from 1 May 2008 to 31 December 2008. The book values of the assets and liabilities have 
been adjusted to align with the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired. Adjustments have been made to property, plant and 
equipment and to other intangible assets to recognise the producing oil and gas field assets and the exploration and evaluation assets 
at their respective fair values.

(c) Strategic Energy 
On 2 June 2008 the Group acquired 100% of the membership interests of Strategic Energy, a subsidiary of Great Plains Energy Inc.,  
for cash consideration of US$309 million (£157 million). Strategic Energy is a US electricity supplier serving non-residential customers  
in eleven states within the US. The acquired business contributed a profit after tax of £9 million to the Group for the period from 2 June 
2008 to 31 December 2008. The book values of the assets and liabilities have been adjusted to align with the fair values of the assets 
and liabilities acquired. Adjustments have been made in respect of other intangible assets, primarily to recognise contractual customer 
relationships and the acquired Strategic Energy brand, to trade and other payables in order to recognise acquired customer contracts 
priced below the market rate at the date of acquisition and to trade and other receivables in order to recognise acquired wholesale 
energy contracts at fair value. Goodwill of £77 million has arisen principally in relation to expected synergies.   
Revisions to the fair values disclosed in the 2008 interim Financial Statements were made in respect of other intangible assets  
(£5 million increase) to reflect updated assumptions and estimates within the intangible assets valuation models, to trade and other 
receivables in order to reflect updated assumptions on the valuation of in-the-money energy procurement contracts (£4 million 
decrease), and to trade and other payables (£9 million increase) in order to recognise a legal liability and to reflect updated assumptions 
on the valuation of out-of-the-money sales contracts. In addition, the acquired in-the-money energy procurement contracts were re-
classified from trade and other receivables to derivative financial instruments. These revisions resulted in an overall reduction in acquired 
net assets of £8 million, with a corresponding increase in goodwill.  
(d) Caythorpe  
On 8 September 2008 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Caythorpe and related assets for cash consideration of  
£71 million. Caythorpe owns a substantially depleted onshore gas field in the UK, together with planning permission and licences for 
conversion to an onshore gas storage facility. The acquired business did not generate any profit or incur any loss from 8 September 
2008 to 31 December 2008. The book values of the assets and liabilities have been adjusted to align with the fair values of the assets 
and liabilities acquired. Adjustments have been made in respect of other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in order 
to recognise the reservoir and related assets at their fair value, as well as the corresponding deferred tax liability, and to provisions for 
other liabilities and charges in order to recognise a decommissioning provision in respect of the existing site. Goodwill of £33 million has 
arisen due to the unique positioning of the acquired business, expected synergies from operating Caythorpe as part of a portfolio of 
storage assets and the recognition of deferred tax as a result of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired differing from their 
tax bases.    
(e) Heimdal assets 
On 31 October 2008 the Group acquired interests in a number of non-operated gas and oil assets in Norway, collectively the Heimdal 
assets, for cash consideration of US$312 million (£194 million). A net amount of £5 million, which has been reflected as a reduction to 
the consideration amount, was due at 31 October 2008 from the vendor. The net amount of £5 million comprised an amount receivable 
from the vendor of £10 million in respect of an adjustment for gas and oil produced and sold prior to the completion date and an 
amount payable to the vendor of £5 million in respect of deferred consideration. As at 31 December 2008, the amount receivable from 
the vendor was fully settled. The £5 million payable to the vendor was settled subsequent to the year end. The US dollar consideration 
amount was hedged between the date the sale and purchase agreement was signed (8 July 2008) and the date the transaction 
completed (31 October 2008). This resulted in a foreign exchange gain of £32 million being realised by the Group, which hedged  
the cash consideration on the acquisition.  
The Heimdal assets comprise a combination of non-operating interests in producing fields, potential development projects and 
exploration opportunities. The acquired business contributed a profit after tax of £3 million from 31 October 2008 to 31 December 
2008. The assets and liabilities acquired have been recognised at their respective fair values. The Group does not have access to the 
vendor’s books and records which would include the assets and liabilities of the Heimdal assets at their pre-acquisition net book values 
and, hence, it is impracticable to disclose the carrying amounts on this basis. Goodwill of £142 million has arisen principally in relation 
to the recognition of deferred tax as a result of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired differing from their tax bases.

(f) Other acquisitions 
The Group also acquired the assets and certain liabilities of Chilltrol Inc. on 29
 
February 2008 (consideration £4 million, goodwill  
£3 million), the assets and certain liabilities of Airco Mechanical Ltd and a number of related companies on 22 July 2008 (consideration 
£7 million, goodwill £4 million), Solar Technologies Group Ltd on 25 September 2008 (consideration £2 million, goodwill £2 million), 
BMSi Ltd on 14 October 2008 (consideration £10 million, which includes contingent consideration of £3 million, goodwill £6 million)  
and Semplice Energy Ltd on 20 October 2008 (consideration £1 million, goodwill £2 million). The acquired businesses contributed  
a profit after tax of £1 million to the Group from their respective dates of acquisition up to 31 December 2008. 
The pro forma consolidated results of the Group, as if the 2008 acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the period, include 
revenue from continuing operations of £21,926 million (compared to reported Group revenue of £21,345 million) and an after tax loss  
of £143 million (compared to reported loss of £144 million). In determining these pro forma consolidated results, an estimate of the pre-
acquisition results relating to the Heimdal assets has not been included as the lack of access to the vendor’s books and records makes 
such an estimate impracticable. The pro forma results have been calculated using the Group’s accounting policies. In preparing the pro 
forma results, revenue and costs have been included as if the businesses were acquired on 1 January 2008 and inter-company 
transactions had been eliminated. This information is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have 
occurred had the purchases actually been made at the beginning of the period presented, or indicative of the future results of the 
combined Group.

The Group procures gas and electricity through a mixture of production from owned gas fields and power stations and procurement 
contracts. Procurement contracts include short-term forward market purchases of gas and electricity at fixed and floating prices. They 
also include gas contracts indexed to market prices and long-term gas contracts with non-gas indexation.  
The total volume of gas to be taken under certain long-term structured contracts depends on a number of factors, including the actual 
reserves of gas that are eventually determined to be extractable on an economic basis. The resulting monetary commitment is based 
on the minimum quantities of gas that the Group is contracted to pay at estimated future prices. 
The estimated commitment to make payments under gas procurement contracts differs in scope and in basis from the maturity 
analysis of energy derivatives disclosed in note 21. Only certain procurement and sales contracts are within the scope of IAS 39 and 
included in note 21. In addition, the volumes used in calculating principal values are estimated using valuation techniques. Contractual 
commitments which are subject to fulfilment of conditions precedent are excluded.

(b) Decommissioning costs 
The Group has provided certain guarantees and indemnities to BG Group plc in respect of the decommissioning costs of the 
Morecambe gas fields. The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Hydrocarbon Resources Limited, have agreed to provide 
security, in respect of such guarantees and indemnities, to BG International Limited, which, as original licence holder for the 
Morecambe gas fields, will have exposure to decommissioning costs relating to the Morecambe gas fields should liabilities not be fully 
discharged by the Group. The security is to be provided when the estimated future net revenue stream from the Morecambe gas fields 
falls below 150% of the estimated cost of such decommissioning. The nature of the security may take a number of different forms and 
will remain in force until the costs of such decommissioning have been irrevocably discharged and the relevant Department of Business, 
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (formerly Department of Trade and Industry) decommissioning notice in respect of the Morecambe 
gas fields has been revoked.

(i) The Group has entered into long-term arrangements with renewable providers to purchase physical power, renewable obligation certificates and levy exemption certificates from renewable sources. 
Payments made under these contracts are contingent upon actual production and therefore the commitment to a minimum lease payment included above is £nil (2007: £nil). Payments made for 
physical power are charged to the Income Statement as incurred and disclosed as contingent rents. 
 
(d) Contingent liabilities 
There are no material contingent liabilities.  
(e) Guarantees and indemnities 
In connection with the Group’s energy trading, transportation and upstream activities, certain Group companies have entered  
into contracts under which they may be required to prepay or provide credit support or other collateral in the event of a significant 
deterioration in creditworthiness. The extent of credit support is contingent upon the balance owing to the third party at the point  
of deterioration.

38. FIXED-FEE SERVICE CONTRACTS 
 
Fixed-fee service contracts are entered into with home services customers in the UK and North America (HomeCare: 100, 200, 300, 
400, HomeCare Flexi: 100, 200, 300, 400, Gas Appliance Care, Gas Appliance Check, Plumbing and Drains Care, Plumbing and 
Drains Care Flexi, Kitchen Appliance Care, Home Electrical Care and Home Electrical Care Flexi in the UK, and Heating Protection, 
Cooling Protection and Plumbing and Drains Protection in North America). These contracts continue until cancelled by either party  
to the contract. These plans incorporate both an annual service element and a maintenance element. 
Fixed-fee service contracts protect purchasers of these contracts against the risk of breakdown of electrical, plumbing, heating, cooling 
and household appliances, resulting in the transfer of an element of risk from contract holders to Centrica. Benefits provided  
to customers vary in accordance with terms and conditions of the contracts entered into, however, generally include repair and/or 
replacement of the items affected. 
The risk and level of service required within the maintenance element of the contracts is dependent upon the occurrence of uncertain 
future events, in particular the number of call-outs, the cost per call-out and the nature of the fault. Accordingly, the timing and amount 
of future cash outflows related to the contracts is uncertain. 
The key terms and conditions that affect future cash flows are as follows: 
 provision of labour and parts for repairs, dependent on the agreement and associated level of service; 
 one safety and maintenance inspection in every year of the agreement (for HomeCare: 100, 200, 300, 400 (excluding electrical 
fixtures), HomeCare Flexi: 100, 200, 300, 400 (excluding electrical fixtures), Gas Appliance Care and Gas Appliance Check in the UK, 
and Heating Protection Plus and Cooling Protection Plus in North America); 
 one safety and maintenance inspection in every continuous two-year period of the agreement (for HomeCare 400 (electrical fixtures 
only), HomeCare Flexi: 400 (electrical fixtures only), Home Electrical Care, Home Electrical Care Flexi, Kitchen Appliance Care, 
Plumbing and Drains Care and Plumbing and Drains Care Flexi); 
 no limit to the number of call-outs to carry out work included within the selected agreement; and 
 caps on certain maintenance and repair costs within fixed-fee contracts.

Notes to the  
Financial Statements

38.  FIXED-FEE SERVICE CONTRACTS CONTINUED 
 
Revenue from fixed-fee service contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, reflecting the benefits 
receivable by the customer which span the life of the contract as a result of emergency maintenance potentially being required at any 
point within the contract term. Cost of sales relates directly to the engineer workforce employed by Centrica within home services, the 
cost of which is accounted for over a 12-month period with adjustments made to reflect the seasonality of workload over a given year. 
The costs of claims under the fixed-fee service contracts will be the costs of the engineer workforce employed by Centrica within home 
services. These costs are accounted for over a 12-month period with adjustments made to reflect the seasonality of workload over a 
given year. No further claims costs are accrued. 
Weather conditions and the seasonality of maintenance can affect the number of call-outs, the cost per call-out and the nature of  
the fault. Centrica’s obligations under the terms of its home services fixed-fee service contracts are based on the following types of 
uncertain future events taking place within the contract period: 
 boiler, radiator, controls, hot water cylinder and pipe work breakdown; 
 gas fire, water heater, wall heater and gas cooker breakdown; 
 hot and cold water pipe, overflow, cold tank, toilet siphon and radiator valve breakdown; 
 washing machine, tumble drier, dishwasher, fridge, freezer, cooker, oven, hob and microwave oven breakdown; 
 fixed electrical wiring system, fuse box, light switch, wall socket, circuit breaker and transformer breakdown; 
 ventor motor, circuit board, direct drive motor and flame sensor breakdown; and 
 evaporator and condenser fan motor breakdown. 
Centrica actively manages the risk exposure of these uncertain events by undertaking the following risk mitigation activities: 
 an initial service visit is performed for central heating care. If, at the initial visit, faults that cannot be rectified are identified, the fixed-
fee service contract will be cancelled and no further cover provided; 
 an annual or biennial safety and maintenance inspection is performed to ensure all issues are identified prior to them developing into 
significant maintenance or breakdown issues; and 
 caps on certain maintenance and repair work are incorporated into fixed-fee service contracts to limit liability in areas considered  
to be higher risk in terms of prevalence and cost to repair. 
 
The Group considers the adequacy of estimated future cash flows under the contracts to meet expected future costs under the 
contracts. Any deficiency is charged immediately to the Income Statement. 
Service requests are sensitive to the reliability of appliances as well as the impact of weather conditions. Each incremental 1% increase 
in service requests would impact profit and equity by approximately £8 million (2007: £7 million). The contracts are not exposed to any 
interest rate risk or significant credit risk and do not contain any embedded derivatives. 
The claims notified during the year were £291 million (2007: £269 million) and were exactly matched by expenses related to fixed-fee 
service contracts. All claims are settled immediately and in full.

The Directors propose a final dividend of 8.73 pence per ordinary share (totalling £446 million) for the year ended 31 December 2008. 
The dividend will be submitted for formal approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 11 May 2009. These Financial 
Statements do not reflect this dividend payable, which will be accounted for in shareholders’ equity as an appropriation of retained 
earnings in the year ending 31 December 2009. 
On 20 January 2009, the Group acquired 50% of the issued share capital of Segebel SA for total consideration of €590 million (£547 
million), including deferred consideration of €70 million (£65 million) and transaction costs of €5 million (£5 million), bringing the Group’s 
total ownership interest in Segebel SA to 100%. The transaction results in the Group acquiring a controlling interest in Segebel SA, 
which will result in it being consolidated as a subsidiary. Segebel SA holds a controlling stake of 51% in SPE SA, a Belgian energy 
company. As such, this transaction also results in the Group obtaining a controlling interest in SPE SA.

39.  EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE CONTINUED 
 
The provisional fair values of the consolidated assets and liabilities of Segebel SA, including 100% of the assets and liabilities of SPE 
SA, as at the acquisition date are disclosed below. These values are provisional because the Directors have not yet reached a final 
determination on all aspects of the fair value exercise. In order to calculate goodwill arising from the acquisition, the minority interests  
in SPE SA (49%) are eliminated from the consolidated net assets in order to present the net assets attributable to Segebel SA, of  
which the Group has acquired 50%. 
In addition to the provisional estimate of £229 million of goodwill to be recognised as part of this transaction, the Group also holds 
previously recognised goodwill of £26 million arising from the acquisition of the initial 50% stake in Segebel SA in September 2005.  
Goodwill of £229 million arises principally in relation to incremental benefits expected to arise from the Pax Electrica II arrangements, as 
well as the recognition of deferred tax on the fair value adjustments.

On 30 June 2008, an agreement was entered into to transfer the active members of the Centrica Pension Scheme to the Centrica 
Management Pension Scheme with an effective date of 1 January 2009. Liabilities and assets will accordingly be transferred with effect 
from this date. There will be no tax effect arising on the transfer. The Group has paid an additional £30 million to the Centrica 
Management Pension Scheme in December 2008 in relation to the transfer and will be paying a further amount of up to £79 million plus 
interest to that scheme. In addition, the Group has agreed to provide security to the Centrica Management Pension Scheme in the form 
of a charge on assets and/or letters of credit of up to £70 million in relation to the transfer.

Independent Auditors’ report to the members  
of Centrica plc 
We have audited the parent Company Financial Statements of 
Centrica plc for the year ended 31 December 2008 which 
comprise the Balance Sheet and the related notes. These parent 
Company Financial Statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is 
described as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the Group Financial Statements 
of Centrica plc for the year ended 31 December 2008. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report,  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the parent Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company Financial 
Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for 
and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come  
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent Company 
Financial Statements give a true and fair view and whether the 
parent Company Financial Statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also 
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report (comprising the Directors’ Report – Business 
Review and the Directors’ Report – Governance) is consistent with 
the parent Company Financial Statements.  
In addition, we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.  
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent Company 
Financial Statements. The other information comprises only At a 
Glance, Financial Highlights, the Chairman’s Statement, the 
Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, the Gas and Liquids Reserves, Five Year 
Record and Shareholder Information. We consider the 
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent 
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent 
Company Financial Statements. Our responsibilities do not extend 
to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of 
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent 
Company Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made  
by the Directors in the preparation of the parent Company 
Financial Statements, and of whether the accounting policies  
are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary  
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the parent Company Financial Statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent 
Company Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
 the parent Company Financial Statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as  
at 31 December 2008; 
 the parent Company Financial Statements and the part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act  
1985; and 
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with 
the parent Company Financial Statements.

Notes to the  
Company Balance Sheet  
 
I. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE COMPANY 
 
Accounting principles 
The Company Balance Sheet has been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and under the historical  
cost convention and the Companies Act 1985. 
Basis of preparation 
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 230(3) of the Companies Act 1985. The Company’s 
loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2008 was £93 million (2007: £5 million profit). 
Employee share schemes 
The Group has a number of employee share schemes, detailed in note 33, under which it makes equity-settled share-based payments 
to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant (excluding the effect of non-
market-based vesting conditions). The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together with a 
corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number of awards that will vest and 
adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The issue of share incentives by the Company to employees of its 
subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions. An addition to the Company’s investment in subsidiary undertakings is reported 
with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ funds. The addition to the Company’s investment in subsidiary undertakings is reduced 
on the issue of share incentives as these are recharged to the subsidiaries.   
Fair value is measured using methods appropriate to each of the different schemes as follows: 
LTIS: awards up to 2005 A Black-Scholes valuation augmented by a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the total 
shareholder return performance 
LTIS: EPS awards after 2005  Market value on the date of grant 
LTIS: TSR awards after 2005 A Monte Carlo simulation to predict the total shareholder return performance 
Sharesave Black-Scholes 
ESOS Black-Scholes using an adjusted option life assumption to reflect the possibility of early exercise
SAS, SIP, DMSS, RSS and ESPP Market value on the date of grant  
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into pounds sterling at closing rates of exchange. Exchange differences  
on monetary assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account. 
Tangible fixed assets 
Tangible fixed assets are included in the Balance Sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment. 
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values,  
of individual assets over their estimated useful lives of up to 10 years.  
Leases 
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments are held in the Balance Sheet at cost, less any provision for impairment as necessary. Current asset 
investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Company’s employees participate in a number of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes as described in note 34 to the 
Group Financial Statements. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the schemes on a 
consistent and reasonable basis and therefore accounts for the schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes. The charge to 
the profit and loss account is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes in the accounting period. Details of the defined benefit 
schemes of the Group (accounted for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies detailed in note 2 to the Group Financial 
Statements) can be found in note 34 to the Group Financial Statements.

Taxation 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at 
the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial 
Statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the Financial Statements. 
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can  
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits in the foreseeable future from which the reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless, by the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to sell 
the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the Financial Statements. Deferred tax is not 
recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only  
if and when the replacement assets are sold. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the 
balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in the future has 
been entered into by the subsidiary or associate. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected 
to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.

Gas and Liquids 
Reserves 
(unaudited) 
The Group’s estimates of reserves of gas and liquids are reviewed as part of the half-year and full-year reporting process and updated 
accordingly. A number of factors affect the volumes of gas and liquids reserves, including the available reservoir data, commodity prices 
and future costs. Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change 
as additional information becomes available.  
The Group discloses proven and probable gas and liquids reserves, representing the central estimate of future hydrocarbon recovery. 
Reserves for Centrica operated fields are estimated by in-house technical teams composed of geoscientists and reservoir engineers. 
Reserves for non-operated fields are estimated by the operator, but are subject to internal review and challenge.   
As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, an audit of the reserves, including the application of the reserves 
definitions, is undertaken by an independent technical auditor. Reserves are estimated in accordance with a formal policy and 
procedure standard. 
The Group has estimated proven and probable gas and liquids reserves in Europe and North America.  
The principal fields in Europe are South Morecambe, North Morecambe, Statfjord, Grove, Seven Seas and the Rough field associated 
with Centrica Storage. The European reserves estimates are consistent with the guidelines and definitions of the Society of Petroleum 
Engineers, Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and World Petroleum Congress Petroleum Resources Management System 
using accepted principles. An annual reserves audit has been carried out by ERC Energy Resource Consultants Ltd. 
The principal fields in North America are Medicine Hat, Entice and Bashaw, located in the province of Alberta, Canada. The North 
American reserves estimates have been evaluated in accordance with the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (COGEH) 
reserves definitions and are consistent with the guidelines and definitions of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the World 
Petroleum Congress.

Dividends can be paid automatically into your designated bank or 
building society account. This service has a number of benefits: 
•  there is no chance of the dividend cheque going missing in  
the post; 
•  the dividend payment is received more quickly as the cash is 
paid directly into the account on the payment date without the 
need to pay in the cheque and then wait for it to clear; and 
•  a single consolidated tax voucher is issued at the end of each  
tax year, in March, in time for the preparation of your 
self-assessment tax return. 
Direct dividend payment also helps Centrica improve its  
efficiency by reducing postage and cheque clearance costs.  
To register for this service, please call the Centrica shareholder 
helpline on 0871 384 2985* to request a direct dividend  
payment form, or download it from our website at  
www.centrica.com/shareholders. 
Overseas dividend payments 
A service has been established to provide shareholders in over  
30 countries with the opportunity to receive Centrica dividends in 
their local currency. For a small fixed fee, shareholders can have 
their dividends automatically converted from sterling and paid  
into their bank account, normally within five working days of the 
dividend payment date. For further details, please contact the 
Centrica overseas shareholder helpline on +44 121 415 7061. 
Buying and selling shares in the UK 
If you wish to buy or sell certificated Centrica shares, you will need 
to use a stockbroker or high street bank which trades on the 
London Stock Exchange. There are also many telephone and 
online sharedealing services available. If you are selling, you will 
need to present your share certificate at the time of sale. FlexiShare 
(details above) offers a low-cost dealing service to its participants. 
Share price information 
As well as using the Centrica website to view details of the current 
and historical Centrica share price, shareholders can find share 
prices listed in most national newspapers. Ceefax and Teletext 
pages also display share prices that are updated regularly 
throughout the trading day. For a real-time buying or selling price, 
you should contact a stockbroker. 
American Depositary Receipts 
Centrica has a Level 1 American Depositary Receipt (ADR) 
programme which trades under the symbol CPYYY. During the 
year, Centrica’s ADR ratio was changed from one ADR being 
equivalent to ten UK ordinary shares into one ADR being equivalent 
to four UK ordinary shares. The ratio change is intended to improve 
market liquidity in the US. The 150% ADR distribution (forward split) 
became effective from 6 October 2008.

Useful historical information 
Demerger 
The shares of Centrica plc were traded on the London Stock 
Exchange for the first time on 17 February 1997, the date of 
demerger from British Gas plc. Shares were acquired in Centrica 
plc on the basis of one Centrica share for every British Gas share 
held at demerger. The split between the post-demerger Centrica 
and British Gas shares was in the proportion Centrica 27.053%  
and British Gas 72.947%.
Shares in Centrica plc acquired on demerger are treated as  
having a base cost for capital gains tax purposes (calculated  
in accordance with taxation legislation) of 64.25 pence each.
Share capital consolidations and the 2008 Rights Issue
The share capital of Centrica plc was consolidated on two 
occasions, in 1999 and 2004, and in 2008 the Company offered 
shareholders the right to subscribe for additional shares as set  
out below:
•  on 10 May 1999, the ordinary share capital was consolidated  
on the basis of nine new ordinary shares of 5
5
⁄9 pence for  
every ten ordinary shares of 5 pence held on 7 May 1999.  
The consolidation was linked to the payment of a special 
dividend of 12 pence per share on 23 June 1999; 
•  on 25 October 2004, the ordinary share capital was consolidated 
on the basis of nine new ordinary shares of 6
14
⁄81 pence for every 
ten ordinary shares of 5
5
⁄9 pence held on 22 October 2004. The 
consolidation was linked to the payment of a special dividend of 
25 pence per share on 17 November 2004; and
•  on 31 October 2008, a Rights Issue was announced on the  
basis of three new ordinary shares for every eight existing shares 
held on 14 November 2008, at a subscription price of 160 pence 
per share. Dealing in the new fully paid ordinary shares 
commenced on the London Stock Exchange on 15 December 
2008. Shareholders who subscribed for their rights in full should, 
for UK tax on chargeable gains (CGT) purposes, treat the existing 
and new shares as the same asset acquired at the time of 
acquisition of their existing shares, and the subscription monies 
for the new shares should be added to the base cost of their 
existing shareholding. Further tax information can be found in  
the Rights Issue prospectus on the Centrica website.

for the benefit of our

and shareholders.”
Chairman’s 
Statement
Performing well  
in a difficult year
Centrica performed well in 2008, during what was a very difficult year 
for energy supply businesses, with unprecedented levels of volatility  
in wholesale gas and power prices. Oil prices rose to almost $150  
per barrel and then fell to below $50 as the high levels of global oil 
demand reversed quite rapidly, due to the recessionary impact of  
the global financial crisis. Against this backdrop Centrica’s financial 
performance in the year was good, with higher upstream profits 
providing a partial hedge to the inevitable decline in retail profits.  
The sharp rises in world energy prices necessitated two retail price 
increases for UK consumers. We concentrated on providing some 
protection for our customers by reducing our operating costs through 
efficiency improvements, by transforming the level of service we offer 
and increasing the support we provide to our vulnerable customers. 
In September we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with 
EDF to acquire a 25% stake in the British Energy business. This 
potential investment is intended to provide a long-term hedge against 
volatile commodity prices and a platform for longer-term growth 
through involvement in new nuclear power generation. We made 
further acquisitions of gas reserves in the North Sea and in North 
America, and also announced our intention to build new gas storage 
facilities in the UK which will help provide important additional security 
of supply. In the year we delivered excellent results in our growth 
businesses. British Gas Business and British Gas Services once 
again reported strong growth in revenue and operating profit. In North 
America the economic climate proved challenging but the business 
held up well and also delivered a good performance.
In Europe we strengthened our presence by acquiring a controlling 
interest in SPE in Belgium. However in The Netherlands, where the 
market continues to favour integrated incumbents, Oxxio did not 
perform well and we have written down its carrying value.
Dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing a final dividend of 8.73 pence  
per share to be paid in June 2009, bringing our full year dividend  
to 12.2 pence, an increase of 5.4%. This is in line with our policy of 
delivering sustained real growth in the ordinary dividend.
Board changes
In March we announced the appointment of Mark Hanafin  
as Managing Director Centrica Energy and Europe, replacing  
Jake Ulrich. I would like to thank Jake for the dedication he has shown 
since the formation of Centrica in 1997 and the material contribution 
he has made in building our portfolio of gas, power and storage 
assets. Mark joined us from Shell where he was president and chief 
executive officer of Shell Energy North America.
In February 2009 we announced some changes to the business and 
management structure. We have combined our British Gas 
operations into a single retail organisation to be headed by Phil 
Bentley. Deryk King, President and CEO of Direct Energy has decided 
to retire and will leave Direct Energy in July 2009. Deryk has built a 
very successful business for Centrica in North America over the last 
eight years. He will be succeeded by Chris Weston from British Gas 
Services who will also join the Board. Paul Walsh, a Non-Executive 
Director of Centrica will step down from the Board at the 2009 AGM. 
Our employees
In February 2009, British Gas was recognised by The Sunday Times 
as one of the ‘20 Best Big Companies to Work For’ which is a 
significant achievement. Our employees remain central to the success 
of Centrica, particularly during these times of great uncertainty and 
change. I want to thank them for the dedication, commitment, loyalty 
and professionalism which they continue to display.
The future
The economic landscape, dominated by the global financial squeeze, 
continues to worsen and Centrica is not immune to the effects of this. 
Energy markets remain volatile and erratic, placing pressure on parts 
of our business and on our customers. 
In these challenging conditions the task of management will be to 
ensure we provide good service and competitive prices to all,  
support for the most vulnerable, a fair return for our shareholders and 
long-term environmentally friendly sources of energy supply for the 
countries that we serve.
I am confident that under Sam Laidlaw’s leadership the management 
team will remain focused on delivering stability and growth in Centrica 
for the benefit of our customers, employees and shareholders.

Investing in new 
power generation
We’ve invested £400 million 
in building the first new power 
station in the UK for almost five 
years. The 885MW gas-fired 
power station in Devon will  
be one of the UK’s cleanest 
fossil-fuelled power plants.
Small is beautiful. 
The European Renewables 
Directive will bind the  
UK to a 15% renewables 
target by 2020.  
No single technology  
can deliver that. So we  
have responded by  
developing a range of 
microgeneration solutions.
We’re supplying  
US industry
The acquisition of Strategic 
Energy has made Direct Energy 
the third largest supplier of energy 
to industry in North America.
We’re securing  
our supply
Investing in new energy 
production, finding new ways of 
importing gas and new places to 
store it, are vital to the future of 
the Company and the UK.  
We’re doing all three. 06
Chief 
Executive’s 
Review
It has been a year of extraordinary turbulence in the 
commodity markets. During the first half of the year we 
experienced volatile and rapidly rising global oil and gas 
prices driven primarily by growing demand in Asia. In the 
second half the sharp contraction of credit markets caused 
a collapse of worldwide oil demand and the oil price.  
By the end of the year this started to feed through into  
a softening of the wholesale gas price. Although Centrica 
has navigated well through this market upheaval our 
profitability has been impacted with the upstream 
benefiting at the expense of downstream margins.
Only five years ago the energy environment in which we operate 
was very different to the one that we are in today. Then, wholesale 
gas markets were reasonably stable, security of supply was a 
distant concern with the UK self-sufficient in gas and exporting  
its excess to the continent – and new nuclear power was not 
universally welcome.
A great deal has changed.
Even though energy prices have softened as a result of the 
recession, the long-term trend remains upwards driven by  
the industrialisation of Asia, the increased costs of oil and gas 
extraction, political uncertainties surrounding sources of supply  
and the need to decarbonise our economies to meet the challenge 
of climate change. In the UK, domestic oil and gas production 
continues to decline and our import dependency is growing 
sharply. The power generation fleet is ageing and needs replacing 
with low-carbon technologies. In the US the new Obama 
administration has placed a high priority on meeting the challenge 
of climate change which, as in Europe, will place an additional but 
necessary cost on the consumer.
Taken together the triple challenges of ensuring security of supply, 
minimising climate change and providing affordable energy pose 
profound questions for the whole of the energy industry. There are 
no easy – or cheap – answers, although energy efficiency has a 
vital role to play. What is clear is that unprecedented levels of 
investment will be required over the next two decades to meet 
these challenges.
Gas
The UK is increasingly reliant on imports. Some 35% of UK gas 
was imported in 2008, and it is estimated that 70% will be imported 
by 2015. Demand for gas remains at high levels globally, despite 
the economic recession and the UK has to compete in the global 
marketplace. So Centrica is investing in new gas assets in the 
British and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea.
We are also investing in contracts and UK infrastructure to enable 
us to import increasing amounts of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In 
January 2009, we received the largest shipment of LNG ever 
delivered to the UK. But LNG is also a global product and the UK 
and Europe are competing with Asia and North America for LNG 
supplies.
Going forward, as additional LNG production comes on-stream 
and an increasing number of players enter the market, we will be 
pursuing a range of sourcing strategies.
Price volatility and supply constraints can be eased through storing 
gas bought during periods of low demand. The UK has relatively 
limited storage – we have around 16 days of gas storage compared 
to about 77 in Germany and 88 in France – and so this is another 
area in which Centrica is investing.
Power
The European Union and national governments are imposing  
strict limits on CO2 emissions and stretching targets for the use  
of renewable energy. The European Renewables Directive, for 
example, will bind the UK to a 15% renewables target by 2020.  
The UK Government has suggested that this is likely to mean up  
to 30–35% of electricity could come from renewable sources 
compared with less than 5% today. According to the Government,  
this will require around £100 billion of investment.
However, renewables alone will not be able to fill the medium- 
term supply gap. The alternatives are gas, coal or nuclear  
power stations.
We are close to completing the first gas-fired power station to be 
built in the UK for almost five years, at a cost of £400 million and 
expect this to begin commercial operation later in 2009. We also

firmly believe that a vital longer-term contributor to energy security 
in a low-carbon world is new nuclear capacity. Much of the existing 
nuclear generation fleet will be retired over the next 15 years, and 
the replacement process has a very long lead time so decisions 
need to be made today. Our Rights Issue in December has provided 
the resources to enable us to be actively involved in this market. 
Centrica’s strategy needs to be able to address the complex issues 
that the industry faces, and to do so in ways that can deliver 
sustainable value for our shareholders. This requires us to manage 
all of the risks and opportunities we are facing with a clear vision 
and an understanding of where our corporate responsibilities lie. 
Our strategy must be able to respond appropriately to the needs of 
our vulnerable customers, to ensure the health and safety of our 
customers and employees, as well as meeting the challenges of 
security of supply and climate change.
I believe that it can, and that in seeking to create an integrated 
energy company, operating upstream by developing new sources 
of gas and power, and downstream with strong brands and 
innovative propositions, we have a robust approach to meeting  
the challenges ahead.
We have continued to operate the business in line with the strategic 
priorities we set at the end of 2006, and report on those over the next 
pages. In short the increasing extent of vertical integration in Centrica, 
the emphasis on operational excellence, the reduction of our cost 
base and the improvement in our customer service meant that we 
ended 2008 with a stronger business and momentum for the future.
PRIORITy 1 – T RANSFORm BRITISh GAS
British Gas Residential is the core of our business, and  
it needs to deliver consistently high levels of service and 
profitability if we are to succeed. 
The transformation, therefore, aims to: 
•  improve our price competitiveness, service levels and 
product offer
•  reduce our costs through ‘best-in-class’ productivity 
while remaining a great place to work
• achieve long-term margins of 6–7%
The progress we’ve made 
During 2008 our customer service improved significantly. Average 
time to answer and to handle calls reduced further and our 
proportion of industry complaint levels fell by nearly a third over  
the year. Compared to 2007 we also increased the percentage  
of customer enquiries which were resolved on the first call and 
substantially reduced the transactional exceptions associated with 
the new billing system. These service improvements enabled further 
progress to be made on our cost reduction initiatives. Our operating 
cost base in 2008 was over £200 million lower than in 2006.
In October Ofgem published the initial findings of its probe into  
the energy supply industry in Britain. The report concluded that 
effective competition exists between the major suppliers. However, 
it did make recommendations to reduce certain retail price 
differentials, particularly relating to former incumbent electricity 
suppliers who charge different prices for in-area and out-of-area 
customers. It also suggested a reduction in tariffs for those 
customers with a prepayment meter, to more accurately reflect the 
additional cost involved in supplying those customers. British Gas 
complied with this recommendation in a matter of a few weeks. 
What’s next 
We have created a strong foundation here over the last two years 
and now is the time to take British Gas to the next stage of its 
evolution. Building on our already strong brand in the UK we are 
seeking to deepen the customer relationship by combining the 
energy and services propositions. This will offset the gradual decline 
over time in the use of gas by consumers in the UK as we move to  
a lower carbon economy, and take full advantage of the increasing 
demand for energy efficient products and services. To best achieve 
this we will combine British Gas Residential, British Gas Business 
and British Gas Services into a single customer-focused 
organisation. This will enable us to launch new bundled products 
under the British Gas brand, products that customers want, to 
increase customer loyalty, to further reduce costs and to target 
even more efficiently the substantial support we already provide for 
our vulnerable customers. Phil Bentley, the current Managing 
Director of British Gas Energy, will run this new organisation. Chris 
Weston, current Managing Director of British Gas Services, will take 
over leadership of the Direct Energy business from Deryk King in 
July 2009.

PRIORITy 2 – ShARPEN ThE ORGANISATION 
AND REDUCE COSTS
We operate in a highly competitive market – for customers 
at national level and for global sources of energy.
In order to compete in the long term, our organisation has 
to be as lean and efficient as possible, with the people and 
structures that enable us to make the best use of the skills 
and resources we have.
The progress we’ve made 
In July Mark Hanafin joined Centrica as Managing Director Centrica 
Energy and Europe. This further strengthened the executive team. 
Various initiatives in the year across the Group meant that we finished 
2008 as a leaner organisation without affecting our ability to grow. 
This helped to reduce our Group like-for-like operating costs by  
£40 million, despite the inflationary pressures, particularly in the 
offshore services environment.
What’s next 
We have a strong leadership team in place and improved capital 
allocation, risk management and cost control processes, which will 
enable us to drive superior financial and operational performance. 
Going forward, we consider operating cost advantage to be a key 
competitive differentiator for Centrica and we will be relentless in 
the pursuit of further cost reductions, while enabling growth across 
the business. 
PRIORITy 3 – R EDUCE RISK Th ROUGh 
INTEGRATION
We need to produce more of the energy that we sell. In the 
UK, we are only able to supply 29% of our gas requirements 
from our own gas fields and 58% of our peak electricity 
demand from our own generation facilities. The remainder 
has to be bought in highly volatile world markets.
The progress we’ve made 
During the year, we made good progress. We acquired additional 
gas assets in the British and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea.  
In March we increased our equity stake in the assets originally 
acquired from Newfield in 2007 and in October we completed our 
acquisition of assets in the Heimdal area of the North Sea. At the 
end of the year we announced an agreement to acquire an 
additional interest in the Peik gas field in the UK and in January 
2009 we agreed to take additional equity in the York gas field. These 
deals provided us with both producing gas assets and valuable 
exploration and development prospects.
During the year Centrica Storage announced two important 
potential gas storage projects. In March we began engineering 
studies to explore the potential to convert the Bains gas field in the 
Morecambe Bay area into a storage field with a capacity of up to 
20 billion cubic feet (bcf). In September we acquired the Caythorpe 
onshore gas field and began the process of converting it into  
a storage field capable of holding up to 7.5bcf of stored gas.  
In February 2009 we announced our intention to create an 
additional 60bcf gas storage field in the UK North Sea following  
the acquisition of a 70% share in the Baird gas field. 
In power generation we completed the Lynn and Inner Dowsing  
wind farm development off the Lincolnshire coast, the largest 
operational offshore wind farm development in the world. In Devon, 
the construction of the Langage gas-fired power station continued, 
although the contractor has experienced some delays and we now 
expect the station to become operational towards the end of 2009. 
In September we announced the signing of a Memorandum of 
Understanding with EDF to acquire a 25% share in the British 
Energy business. This would add significantly to our upstream 
position and provide us with a long-term hedge against volatile 
wholesale power prices, with access to power where the price  
is not impacted by the cost of oil and gas, and an opportunity  
to grow through new build nuclear construction in the UK.
The proceeds from the successful £2.16 billion Rights Issue 
towards the end of the year provide us with the capital required to 
complete the British Energy transaction and make further material 
progress in increasing the upstream asset base and reducing risk.

Overview Our Performance Shareholder Information
What’s next 
We will continue to expand our power generation fleet as part of the 
overall upstream hedge to reduce the exposure to the increasing 
volatility in power prices and spreads. Here we will seek to cover an 
increasing amount of our UK electricity demand load and to grow and 
better align our generation mix with that of our competitors and the 
wider market. As part of this, our discussions with EDF , regarding us 
potentially acquiring 25% of British Energy are continuing. We will also 
pursue external financing to allow us to develop and build on our wind 
farm portfolio, and additional options to grow the size of our 
conventional gas-fired fleet of power stations.
In gas we are continuing to push ahead on reducing our exposure to 
the short-term volatility in wholesale gas prices by acquiring additional 
gas assets and striking gas contracts. In pursuing this we will focus 
most of our asset acquisition activity on the UK and Norwegian 
sectors of the North Sea while also continuing to evaluate LNG 
opportunities. Building closer relationships with National Oil 
Companies, to secure competitive long-term sources of gas  
for our customers, remains firmly on the agenda. 
PRIORITy 4 – BUIl D ON OUR GROWTh 
Pl ATFORmS
Centrica’s growth businesses in the UK, Europe and  
North America have great potential for increasing the 
Group’s profitability.
We are focusing on new opportunities, such as providing 
low-carbon products and services, and increasingly on 
integration in the North American business. This will see us 
concentrate on the geographies and service areas in which 
we are already strong, and support the retail businesses 
through the construction and acquisition of new power assets.
The progress we’ve made 
The financial results in the year show real progress with this priority. 
In British Gas Business and British Gas Services we grew revenue, 
operating profit and customer numbers, while delivering ongoing 
cost efficiencies. In North America we faced a difficult economic 
environment. However here too we increased customer numbers 
and delivered a strong financial result, partially due to favourable 
exchange rate movements. Our acquisition in June of Strategic 
Energy doubled the size of our commercial and industrial (C&I) 
energy supply business and made us the third largest commercial 
supplier of energy in North America. In Europe, in January 2009 we 
completed the acquisition of an additional 25.5% of SPE, giving us a 
valuable controlling stake of 51%. Unfortunately Oxxio, our business 
in The Netherlands, recorded a disappointing loss*. We have taken 
action to stem losses here, including replacing management.
What’s next 
The reorganisation in British Gas provides us with an opportunity  
to increase the overall value of our customer base by expanding  
the overlap between our energy and services businesses through 
bundled offerings under a single brand. In North America we will 
also integrate further by building on the platform we have already 
established and tightening the focus on key geographies. In doing 
this we will establish a centralised service platform which enables 
us to compete more efficiently. With better focus will come a 
greater degree of integration, primarily through the selective 
acquisition and construction of gas and power assets, to provide 
growth opportunities and support for the retail businesses.
In summary 
Following a record 2007 , the financial performance in 2008 was 
good despite a much harsher environment. We made strong 
progress against the strategic priorities we set out at the end of 
2006. The outlook for the global economy remains very challenging 
and in the UK 2009 could be particularly difficult for many of  
our customers, both residential and commercial. We will continue  
to place our customers’ needs at the forefront of our agenda, 
alongside our determination to deliver increasing long-term value  
for our shareholders.

BRITISh GAS RESIDENTIAl
The focus on delivering good customer 
service, reducing our cost base, 
maximising value from the customer 
base and providing an attractive 
environment for employees has been 
central to the ongoing transformation  
of British Gas Residential.
The rapid rise in wholesale energy prices during the first 
half of the year required price rises to customers in January 
and July in order to maintain reasonable profitability. 
Although there was a short-term increase in customer 
churn, sales of energy accounts remained high. At the  
end of 2008 we were serving 15.6 million accounts, of 
which 3.6 million had a fixed-price product. In November, 
we reduced the standard retail tariff for prepayment 
customers, and in January 2009, we cut our standard  
gas tariffs by 10% and introduced a prompt payment 
discount for credit customers.
British Gas continued to demonstrate industry leadership  
in supporting those customers less able to pay their fuel 
bills. We have over 500,000 customers on our Essentials 
tariff, the UK’s largest social tariff, and will spend more  
than double our £34 million commitment during 2008/09  
in supporting our most vulnerable customers. 
The volume of incoming calls was 22% lower than 2007 , 
reflecting improved internal processes and increased 
first-time resolution of customer queries. Our share of 
Ombudsman’s complaints fell to 25%, lower than our 
overall energy market share. In February 2009 British Gas 
was also recognised by The Sunday Times as one of the 
‘20 Best Big Companies to Work For’ for the first time,  
an important accolade for a business where employee 
engagement is central to performance.
Revenue in the year was up by 20% to £7,769 million  
as a result of higher prices partially offset by slightly  
lower customer numbers. 
With rapidly escalating wholesale gas prices, operating 
profit* was down by 34% to £379 million (2007: £571 
million). This translated to a 4.9% margin (2007: 8.8%). Gas 
costs increased year-on-year by 43% and there were also 
increases in transmission and metering costs of 7%. 
Operating costs fell by 9% with savings made in our sales 
and support functions and in our call centres. Net charges 
for bad debts were broadly unchanged, but given the 
current economic pressures facing our customers, are 
expected to increase in 2009.

BRITISh GAS NEW ENERGy
As the UK moves towards a low- 
carbon future British Gas New Energy 
was established to develop a range  
of low-carbon solutions for homes  
and businesses. We provide energy 
efficiency and microgeneration 
products and services to customers.
In January we acquired a minority equity stake in Ceres 
Power Holdings plc and entered into a development and 
distribution agreement. Ceres is developing a fuel cell 
domestic boiler which generates electricity at the same 
time as producing heat. In September we entered the 
microgeneration market though our acquisition of Solar 
Technologies, an installer of solar photovoltaic technology. 
We expect the Government to introduce a feed-in tariff  
in 2010 which will strengthen this market by providing 
financial incentives for small-scale low-carbon generation. 
In October we acquired Semplice Energy Limited, a low- 
carbon solutions company which offers consulting, design 
and systems integration to help businesses reduce their 
energy usage and use cleaner energy. We also entered 
into technology partnerships with Disenco, a developer  
of a micro combined heat and power appliance, and 
VPhase, a developer of energy-saving products. 
British Gas New Energy sought to raise awareness of 
energy efficiency through the successful ‘Green Streets’ 
campaign, where streets in the UK competed against 
each other to see which could save the most energy. 
We also continue to deliver British Gas’ regulatory 
obligations in energy efficiency under the Government’s 
Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) programme. 
In 2008, the energy efficiency measures we provided to 
homes delivered lifetime carbon savings of almost 18 
million tonnes.

BRITISh GAS SERv ICES
By responding to new customer  
needs with new products and better 
service delivery, British Gas Services 
has increased its customer base and 
financial performance. It is a growth 
business that is growing strongly.
British Gas Services delivered a strong performance in 
2008 as we continued to grow the business through 
investment in high levels of customer service and a  
greater contribution from products beyond the original 
central heating care range. 
Revenue was up 5% at £1,349 million with particularly 
strong growth in our Plumbing and Drains and Home 
Electrical Care products, up by 6% and 11% respectively. 
By the end of the year we had increased the total  
number of customer product relationships by 5% to  
8.1 million, and customer retention rates across most of  
our product range remained above prior year levels. 
Service levels at our new National Distribution Centre, 
which underpins our overnight parts delivery commitment, 
have been high at 99%.
During the year we extended our range of services with the 
introduction of new insurance-based products covering 
water supply pipes and general home emergencies. By 
December we had sold over 130,000 of these products. 
Our performance in the on-demand market remains strong, 
with over 65% of these customers subsequently converting 
to a contractual product. We also supported the launch of  
a bundled product, Dual Fuel Extra, in conjunction with 
British Gas Residential. This offers a priority response to 
emergency central heating breakdowns. 
Despite worsening economic conditions our Central  
Heating Installations business maintained activity at near 
2007 levels, with 111,000 installations. Following the 
restructuring of this business and a major operation to 
minimise overheads and supply costs we improved 
operating profit substantially. 
Overall operating profit* increased by 29% to £195 million 
(2007: £151 million), reflecting the continued strong growth 
of our higher margin secondary care products, improved 
efficiency and cost reductions across the business. Over 
the year we reduced costs by £25 million. Operating costs 
as a percentage of gross margin decreased to 69% (2007: 
74%) and the operating margin rose to 14.5% (2007: 11.8%).

CENTRICA ENERGy
Centrica Energy is the part of the 
business that ensures security of 
supply for our customers. It is building 
the upstream operation that is vital  
for an integrated energy company,  
by investing in new sources of gas  
and power.
Operating profit* in gas production increased to £1,164 
million from £429 million in 2007, due to increased 
production volumes and higher sales prices. Gas sales 
volumes increased by 7% and the average selling price 
rose to 59.1p/therm (2007: 30.4p/therm). 
During the year we made acquisitions in the UK and 
Norwegian North Sea including, in October, Marathon’s 
Heimdal gas assets for £162 million. We invested  
£108 million in 2008 on our existing gas asset portfolio and 
£43 million in our exploration programme in the Morecambe 
Bay area and our licence blocks in Norway and Nigeria. 
Power generation delivered an operating profit* of  
£7 million (2007: £46 million). The financial performance of 
the fleet was held back by a forward sales contract and 
unplanned outages at several power stations. Despite 
these outages, total power generated from our portfolio 
rose to 23.4 terawatt hours (TWh). 
By the end of the year the 180 megawatt (MW) Lynn  
and Inner Dowsing offshore wind farm development was 
exporting directly to the National Grid, and in October we 
gained Government approval for a proposed 250MW wind 
farm off the Lincolnshire coast. 
The 885MW Langage gas-fired power station development 
remains on budget and we expect it to begin full 
commercial operation towards the end of 2009.
The industrial and commercial segment reported an 
operating loss* of £329 million (2007: £179 million operating 
profit*), as we were supplying gas bought at high prices to 
index-linked contracts.
In energy procurement we negotiated additional 
medium-term supply contracts totalling around 4 billion 
cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year, and in November, we 
commissioned our liquefied natural gas (LNG) import 
capacity at the Isle of Grain with the largest LNG tanker 
delivery ever landed in the UK.
Our wholesale energy trading business, Accord, delivered 
an operating profit* of £37 million, up significantly on 2007’s 
£9 million.

BRITISh GAS BUSINESS
Innovative propositions, such as 
dedicated account managers, have 
helped British Gas Business to grow 
by maintaining high levels of customer 
service, customer satisfaction and 
customer retention.
Despite challenging wholesale energy market conditions, 
British Gas Business delivered a very strong financial 
result and continued to grow its overall customer base.  
By the end of 2008 we were supplying over 1 million 
customer supply points. This included the addition of  
two small customer blocks. In October we successfully 
tendered for 37,000 electricity accounts for small and 
medium-sized enterprise (SME) customers, as part of 
Ofgem’s supplier of last resort process, following the 
collapse of E4B. In November we added a further  
39,000 electricity accounts through the acquisition (for 
£3.5 million) of BizzEnergy’s customer base from the 
administrators of this privately owned energy supplier.  
In October we also announced the acquisition of BMSi, 
which increases our presence in the UK’s expanding 
commercial energy-related services market.
Revenue for the year was up by 26% to £3,063 million 
(2007: £2,431 million), reflecting tariff increases and higher 
contract renewal rates, combined with higher average 
customer numbers and increased consumption in both 
gas and power.
Service levels across the business remain high. First time 
resolution of customer queries continued to improve, 
resulting in fewer repeat calls and higher satisfaction  
levels across the commercial customer base. Customer 
retention in both larger commercial and SME customers 
also remained high. For the fourth year running British Gas 
Business was recognised as one of the UK’s Top 50 ‘Best 
Workplaces’ by the Financial Times.
Operating profit* for the year increased by 19% to  
£143 million (2007: £120 million). This was due to the 
maintenance of our gross margins and the identification  
of further operating cost efficiencies, including the 
renegotiation of our commercial broker fee structure.  
As a result our operating costs as a percentage of gross 
margin decreased to 62% (2007: 72%).

EUROPEAN ENERGy
We are involved in power generation, 
energy management and retail energy 
supply in mainland Europe, where the 
development of a fully competitive 
energy market would provide 
significant growth opportunities.
Our European businesses experienced tough wholesale 
market conditions during 2008, reporting an operating 
loss* of £56 million (2007: operating profit* £17 million).
In Belgium, SPE continued to grow its customer base and 
now supplies over 1.5 million customers (2007: 1.4 million). 
Earnings of £8 million in 2008 were in line with 2007. In 
January 2009 we completed our acquisition from GdF of 
their 25.5% of SPE for an initial price of €515 million, giving 
us a controlling stake of 51%. An additional amount of  
€70 million was triggered following approval of the  
PE2 agreement, under which SPE will have access  
to additional low-cost nuclear power in Belgium.
In The Netherlands, Oxxio faced highly volatile commodity 
prices and struggled to compete against vertically 
integrated incumbent players. Customer numbers fell 
slightly as a result and underlying trading results were weak. 
In addition, we experienced operational challenges, with the 
business suffering a billing backlog and overruns in 
procurement costs, both of which resulted in significant 
additional charges within the 2008 results. The operating 
loss* for the year was £63 million (2007: operating profit* £3 
million). We have taken action to address the internal issues 
within the business, including putting a new management 
team in place. In light of the 2008 loss, the carrying value of 
the goodwill associated with Oxxio has been written down 
by £45 million. This has been charged as an exceptional 
item which totalled £67 million, the remaining £22 million 
being a write-down of a receivable relating to historic 
overpayments of energy revenue tax where recovery is  
now uncertain.
In Spain and Germany changes during the year to the 
regulatory regimes were helpful to our businesses. In Spain 
the high voltage regulated tariff was removed allowing 
Centrica Energía, one of only three 100% green suppliers  
in the country, to make further progress in the high voltage 
power market. In Germany the restructuring of the historic 
gas supply areas and the implementation of a new gas 
balancing regime were helpful.

CENTRICA STORAGE
Gas storage is an integral part of the 
upstream supply chain, and a hedge 
against wholesale price volatility. 
Centrica – and the UK – does not have 
enough storage capacity and so we 
are investing in more.
Centrica Storage delivered a good financial performance, 
despite narrower year-on-year summer/winter gas price 
spreads. As a result, revenue in the period was down  
14% to £280 million (2007: £327 million) primarily driven  
by a lower achieved standard bundled unit (SBU) price of 
43.8 pence (2007: 57.4 pence). This was partially offset by 
additional revenue of £26 million from the sale of cushion 
gas in the last quarter of the year. Lower revenue and an 
increased cost of fuel gas caused operating profit* to fall by 
19% to £195 million (2007: £240 million).
Operationally the Rough field performed strongly in 2008, 
with injection and production availability of 99%. In the first 
half of the year we upgraded the two offshore compression 
trains for the field which enhanced injection rates. Since 
completing the Rough acquisition in 2003, continued 
investment has enabled us to create the equivalent of more 
than 80 million additional SBU sales in 2008. During the 
year the Easington terminal passed five years without  
a lost time incident and Centrica Storage’s overall accident 
rate of below one lost time incident per million man hours, 
compares very favourably with industry benchmarks. 
In July approval was granted by Ofgem to modify the 
standard storage contract to include prepaid entry  
capacity rights. Centrica Storage now offers a range  
of products that give customers increased choice. 
During the year Centrica Storage also announced its 
involvement in two major new storage projects. In March 
we proposed conversion of the Bains gas field into a gas 
storage facility, with a potential capacity of up to 20bcf. In 
September we acquired Caythorpe Gas Storage Limited, 
which has planning permission to convert the onshore 
Caythorpe gas field to a gas storage facility, with a capacity 
of up to 7.5bcf. If completed, both of these projects would 
become operational by the winter of 2011/12, and would 
provide increased levels of flexibility and security.
In February 2009 a third new gas storage project was 
announced. Centrica Storage, in conjunction with Perenco, 
intends to convert the largely depleted Baird gas field into  
a facility that would have capacity to hold approximately 
60bcf, just over half the capacity of Rough, the UK’s largest 
gas storage facility.

Operating 
Review
continued
Direct Energy delivered a strong set of results in 2008 despite  
a difficult economic and commodity environment. Revenue in 
the year was up 46% at £5,824 million (2007: £3,992 million), 
mainly as a result of the acquisition of Strategic Energy, higher 
selling prices in retail energy, and the positive impact of the 
stronger US and Canadian currencies. Operating profit* was  
up 15% at £215 million (2007: £187 million), and by 4% on a 
constant currency basis.
Mass markets energy
Mass markets energy performed well given the tough market 
conditions. In Canada customer numbers grew by 3% as we 
gained market share in Alberta where we have now switched 
250,000 customer accounts from the regulated tariff to 
competitive products.
In the US North East customer numbers grew by 20% to more 
than 400,000 as we continued to grow our gas and power 
businesses in New York and increased our market share in 
Ohio and in Connecticut. Profits* also increased. 
However, in Texas customer numbers fell by 4% and total 
demand dropped by over 15% as benign weather and 
conservation efforts by customers in the face of higher prices 
impacted average consumption per customer. In September 
Hurricane Ike damaged Houston’s power infrastructure, 
causing a temporary but sharp reduction in demand. Despite 
these issues, Texas delivered operating margins of 9% in 2008.
Revenue for the year was up 9% to £2,652 million and 
operating profit* grew 11% to £137 million. On a constant 
currency basis both were broadly flat.
Commercial and industrial energy
Electricity sales in the year were almost double those in 2007, 
primarily as a result of the Strategic Energy acquisition. Higher 
contract prices and the favourable exchange rate, also helped 
to more than double revenue to £2,015 million (2007: £978 
million). On a constant currency basis revenue was up 88%. 
We now supply over 200,000 meter points which makes us  
the third largest C&I energy supplier in North America.
In the second half integration costs for Strategic Energy 
cancelled out the synergy benefits. However the integration  
is now essentially complete and we are on target to exceed the 
US$15 million of annual cost synergies announced at the time 
of the acquisition. 
Operating profit* for this business was up substantially 
year-on-year at £11 million (2007: £1 million).
Home and business services
It was a difficult year for our services business, as the severe 
slowdown in US housing construction had a material impact  
on installations of equipment in new homes. In response we 
cut costs sharply and increased our emphasis on protection 
products, where customer numbers rose by 11%.
In Canada our customer base for protection products grew by 
5%, mainly due to strong sales of total home protection plans. 
Revenue was up by 7% at £375 million, and operating profit* 
was down £1 million year-on-year at £16 million. But on a 
constant currency basis revenue was down 1% and operating 
profit* down 20%. 
Upstream and wholesale energy
Overall operating profit* was up 11% year-on-year at £51 million 
and on a constant currency basis was up 2%. This small 
underlying increase reflected higher upstream gas profits offset 
by a reduction in power generation margins. 
Our Texas power stations were affected by increasing capacity 
margins and lower spark spreads, which occasionally made it 
more economic to purchase power than produce it. Overall 
power generation volumes dropped by 7% to 4.7TWh. 
Natural gas production volumes increased by 23% to 365mmth 
(2007: 297mmth) following development of current reserves 
and the acquisitions of Rockyview Energy and the Canadian 
assets of TransGlobe Energy earlier in the year. The business 
also benefited in the first half from high gas prices on the 
portion of sales not forward sold.

Centrica plc Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2008
During 2008 we have continued to review, understand and manage 
the social, environmental and economic impact of our operations. 
Corporate responsibility (CR) is central to the delivery of sustainable 
value for our shareholders.
I am pleased that our Board-level Corporate Responsibility 
Committee continues to receive strong commitment from our 
senior leadership and provides strategic oversight to our overall  
CR approach. In 2008, Direct Energy’s Executive established its 
own CR Committee to oversee North American business-specific 
issues. And a senior manager is also now accountable for CR 
performance in each business. 
Our CR strategy focuses on areas where we can have a direct – 
and measurable – impact. These are:
• climate change and the environment 
• serving our customers 
• health and safety 
• valuing our people 
• our local impact 
• our supply chain
Climate change and the environment 
Small-scale technologies can play a significant role in helping the 
UK achieve its targets for CO2 emissions and renewable energy.  
In 2008 British Gas New Energy made a number of acquisitions to 
help develop our capability in microgeneration, and support our 
strategy to lead the market in low-carbon products and services.
Our 18-month-long Green Streets competition between eight 
communities has highlighted practical solutions for consumers  
to make their homes more energy efficient.
We further reduced our overall carbon intensity, and the energy we 
supplied had the lowest carbon emissions of any major supplier in 
Britain. Our new efficient gas-fired power station at Langage will 
generate its first power in 2009. And our offshore wind farm 
development at Lynn and Inner Dowsing is the largest of its type  
in the world. We are also actively pursuing an interest in new 
nuclear power. 
We are focused on reducing our own operational carbon footprint 
and are creating a culture among our employees appropriate for  
a business leading the way towards a low-carbon future. 
Serving our customers 
We have long been committed to providing proactive help to  
our vulnerable customers and to working alongside the UK 
Government to alleviate fuel poverty, which National Energy Action 
estimates affects over 5 million households in Britain. 
In total, we provided support to an estimated 1.4 million vulnerable 
or in-need customers during 2008; and by the end of 2008, there 
were around 526,000 accounts on our Essentials tariff, a 55% 
increase on 2007. 
h ealth and safety 
The health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers 
and communities in which we live and work is a top priority. Health 
and safety is a standing item on the agenda of all Executive 
Committee meetings.
We achieved a 5% reduction in the rate of lost time injuries (LTI)  
in 2008, though our overall LTI rates are high with British Gas 
Services accounting for more than 80% of our accidents.  
To decrease injury rates, British Gas Services has launched  
a major programme of safety improvements, including a high  
profile internal awareness campaign. 
valuing our people
We want Centrica to be a great place to work and there was  
a 94% response rate to the 2008 engagement survey, which  
found levels of employee commitment well in excess of UK and 
European benchmarks. 
Our approach to flexible working is a key factor in attracting 
employees and a reason for their staying. We are also committed  
to pursuing both equality and diversity in all our activities. Direct 
Energy has a Diversity and Inclusion Council to oversee strategy  
in North America.
l ocal impact 
We aim to benefit the communities in which we operate by 
understanding local social and environmental issues and by taking 
action to address those issues. For example, more than 8,000 UK 
schools have signed up to the British Gas Generation Green 
programme; we have helped create a new secondary school in 
India; and in Nigeria we are working to tackle youth unemployment.
Supply chain 
As a large international company, we have responsibilities for the 
application of appropriate business practice throughout our supply 
chain, and are working to include corporate responsibility clauses 
in our contracts with suppliers.

(i)   Certain re-measurements included within operating profit comprise re-measurement arising on energy procurement activities and re-measurement of proprietary trades in relation to cross-border 
transportation or capacity contracts. In our business we enter into a portfolio of forward energy contracts which include buying substantial quantities of commodity to meet the future needs of our 
customers. A number of these arrangements are considered to be derivative financial instruments and are required to be fair valued under IAS 39. Fair valuing means that we apply the prevailing 
forward market prices to these contracts. The Group has shown the fair value adjustments separately as certain re-measurements as they are unrealised and non-cash in nature. The profits arising 
from the physical purchase and sale of commodities during the year, which reflect the prices in the underlying contracts, are not impacted by these re-measurements.
  As permitted by IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, certain items are presented separately. The items that the Group separately presents as exceptional are items which are of a 
nonrecurring nature and, in the judgement of the Directors, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature, size or incidence in order to obtain a clear and consistent presentation of the 
Group’s underlying business performance. Items which may be considered exceptional in nature include disposals of businesses, business restructurings, the renegotiation of significant contracts 
and asset write-downs.
  Exceptional items and certain re-measurements included within discontinued operations in 2007 comprise the gain on disposal of The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund and re-measurement 
of the publicly traded units of The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund. All other re-measurement is included within results before exceptional items and certain re-measurements.
(ii)  Group revenue and cost of sales have been restated to report gas sales revenue of Centrica Storage net of cost of sales to better reflect the nature of the transactions.
(iii)  During the year, the Group raised proceeds of approximately £2,164 million, net of issue costs of approximately £65 million, through a three for eight Rights Issue of new ordinary shares at 160 pence 
per share, representing a bonus to existing shareholders of 0.1233 ordinary shares per ordinary share held. Earnings per ordinary share and dividend per ordinary share figures have been restated 
to reflect the bonus element of the Rights Issue.
(iv)  During 2008, exceptional charges of £67 million were incurred in the European Energy segment, including a £45 million impairment of the Oxxio goodwill and a £22 million impairment of a receivable 
balance in Oxxio relating to historic overpayments of regulatory energy revenue tax, reflecting the reduced likelihood of realising the balance in the future. 23

Summary 
Reports
Independent Auditors’ statement to the members  
of Centrica plc
We have examined the Summary Financial Statements of  
Centrica plc which comprises the Summary Group Income 
Statement, Summary Group Balance Sheet, Summary Group 
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, Summary Group 
Cash Flow Statement and the Summary Remuneration Report.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Review and 
Summary Financial Statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
law. Our responsibility is to report to you our opinion on the 
consistency of the Summary Financial Statements within this 
Annual Review with the full Annual Financial Statements, the 
Directors’ Report (comprising the Directors’ Report – Business 
Review and the Directors’ Report – Governance) and the 
Remuneration Report, and its compliance with the relevant 
requirements of section 251 of the UK Companies Act 1985  
and the regulations made thereunder. We also read the other 
information contained in the Annual Review and Summary Financial 
Statements and consider the implications for our statement if  
we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the Summary Financial Statements. This 
statement, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with section 
251 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this statement is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Basis of opinion 
We conducted our work in accordance with Bulletin 1999/6,  
‘The auditors’ statement on the summary financial statement’ 
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. Our report on the 
Company’s full Annual Financial Statements describes the  
basis of our audit opinion on those Financial Statements and  
the Remuneration Report.
Opinion 
In our opinion the Summary Financial Statements are consistent 
with the full Annual Financial Statements, the Directors’ Report 
(comprising the Directors’ Report – Business Review and the 
Directors’ Report – Governance) and the Remuneration Report  
of Centrica plc for the year ended 31 December 2008 and comply 
with the applicable requirements of section 251 of the Companies 
Act 1985, and the regulations made thereunder.

Full Annual Report
The Auditors have issued an unqualified report on the Annual 
Financial Statements and Remuneration Report containing no 
statement under section 237(2) or section 237(3) of the Companies 
Act 1985. The Auditors’ Report in respect of consistency between 
the Directors’ Report and the Group Financial Statements is also 
unqualified. These Summary Financial Statements are a summary 
of the full Centrica Annual Report and the narrative reports contain 
information from the Directors’ Report but not the full text of that 
report. They do not contain sufficient information to allow as full an 
understanding of the results and state of affairs of the Group and of 
its policies and arrangements concerning the Directors’ 
remuneration as would be provided by the full Annual Report.  
The full Report can be downloaded from the Company’s website  
at www.centrica.com or can be obtained, free of charge, by 
contacting the Centrica shareholder helpline (see page 29 for 
contact details).
Dividends 
An interim dividend for 2008 of 3.47 pence per share (3.9 pence 
per share before adjusting for the bonus element of the Rights 
Issue) was paid on 12 November 2008. The Directors propose that, 
subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting (AGM), a final 
dividend of 8.73 pence per share will be paid on 10 June 2009 to 
those shareholders registered on 24 April 2009. This would make  
a total ordinary dividend for the year of 12.2 pence per share (2007: 
13.0 pence per share, 11.57 pence per share after adjusting for the 
bonus element of the Rights Issue). 
Corporate Governance 
The Board of Directors is committed to the highest standards of 
corporate governance and believes that such standards are critical 
to overall business integrity and performance. Throughout the year 
ended 31 December 2008, the Company fully complied with the 
provisions set out in Section 1 of the 2006 Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance (the Code) with the exception of provision 
A.4.3 which currently states that no individual should be appointed 
to a second chairmanship of a FTSE 100 company. In July 2008, 
the Chairman of the Company was appointed as chairman of 
Cadbury plc following its demerger from Cadbury Schweppes plc. 
The Board believes that the Chairman’s commitment and 
contribution to the Company will not suffer as a consequence of 
this appointment. This provision has been removed from the new 
2008 Combined Code, which the Company will report against in 
2010. A report on how the Code’s principles were applied is set  
out in the Corporate Governance Report in the full Annual Report.
Board of Directors 
The Directors consider that the Board effectively leads and  
controls the Group. The powers of the Directors are set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association (Articles), which are available  
on the Company’s website. To accommodate recent changes in 
company law, the Company adopted a new set of Articles at the 
2008 Annual General Meeting.
The Board has a schedule of matters specifically reserved for its 
approval, which is also available for inspection on the Company’s 
website. The Board has delegated authority to its committees to 
carry out certain tasks as defined in each committee’s respective 
terms of reference. During the year, the Board conducted a 
comprehensive review of each of its committees’ terms of reference 
against best practice and approved revised terms. The written terms 
of reference of the Board’s principal Committees are available on the 
Company’s website and hard copies are available upon request. 
Board appointments, evaluation and development 
In accordance with the Code and the Company’s Articles,  
all Directors are subject to reappointment by shareholders at the 
first AGM following their appointment to the Board and thereafter 
are subject to reappointment every third year. Non-Executive 
Directors are initially appointed for a three-year term and, subject  
to review and reappointment by shareholders, can serve up to a 
maximum of three such terms. A formal, rigorous and transparent 
process is followed during the selection and subsequent  25
Centrica plc Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2008
appointment of new Directors to the Board. This process is 
described on page 40 of the full Annual Report.
On 14 July 2008, Mark Hanafin was appointed to the Board as 
Managing Director, Centrica Energy and Europe and he will be 
seeking reappointment at the forthcoming AGM. Mark Hanafin 
replaced Jake Ulrich, who resigned from the Board on 12 May 
2008. On 26 February 2009, the Chairman announced a number  
of changes to the composition of the Board. Chris Weston, who  
is currently Managing Director of British Gas Services will be 
appointed to the Board on 1 July 2009 and will assume 
responsibility for the Company’s North American business  
following Deryk King’s retirement. Chris Weston will therefore seek 
reappointment to the Board at the 2010 Annual General Meeting. 
Phil Bentley assumes responsibility for the newly combined British 
Gas business and will remain a member of the Board. Paul Walsh, 
who has served as a Non-Executive Director since March 2003,  
will retire from the Board at the 2009 AGM. A search for a suitable 
candidate has commenced.
The Board conducted a formal evaluation of its own performance 
and that of its committees and individual Directors. The evaluation 
was carried out with the assistance of an independent external 
facilitator, Egon Zehnder International, in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2008. 
All new Directors appointed to the Board receive a comprehensive 
induction briefing tailored to meet their individual needs. Ongoing 
development and training is provided to Directors at Board 
meetings and, where appropriate, committee meetings. 
Internal control  
The Audit Committee reviews regular internal control reports,  
tracks issues, monitors performance against objectives and 
ensures necessary actions are taken to remedy any significant 
failings or weaknesses identified from those reports. 
The Board, with the advice of the Audit Committee, has reviewed 
the effectiveness of the system of internal control, for the period 
from 1 January 2008 to the date of this report, and is satisfied  
that the Group complies with the Turnbull Guidance. The Board  
will continue routinely to challenge management in order to  
ensure that the system of internal control is constantly improving.
Summary Remuneration Report 
This is a summary of the full Remuneration Report, which is 
contained in the Annual Report and Accounts, copies of which  
are available on the Company’s website.
It is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee to make 
recommendations to the Board on: the policy, framework and cost 
of executive remuneration; the implementation of remuneration 
policy; and the determination of specific remuneration packages  
for each of the Executive Directors. It consists exclusively of 
Non-Executive Directors and has access to the advice and views  
of management and external consultants.
Summary remuneration policy  
The Committee ensures that the Group’s remuneration policy and 
framework provides competitive reward for its Executive Directors 
and other senior executives, taking into account the Company’s 
performance, the markets in which it operates and pay and 
conditions elsewhere in the Group. In constructing the 
remuneration packages, the Committee aims to achieve an 
appropriate balance between fixed and variable compensation for 
each executive. A significant proportion depends on the attainment 
of demanding performance objectives both short and long term. 
The Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) incentivises and rewards the 
achievement of demanding financial and business-related 
objectives. Long-term share-based incentives align interests with 
the longer term interests of Centrica’s shareholders. 
The Committee reviews the packages to ensure they continue to 
promote the achievement of strategic objectives while delivering 
shareholder value; reflect current best practice and meet the  
Group’s business needs; and enable the Group to attract and retain 
high calibre management. During a recent Committee review, in 
consultation with major shareholders, changes to future policy and 
framework of executive remuneration and, in particular, the operation 
of the AIS and Deferred and Matching Share Scheme (DMSS) going 
forward were agreed and become effective during 2009. 
In 2008 executive remuneration comprised base salary, AIS, an 
allocation of shares under the Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS), 
and an allocation of shares under the DMSS. Given the current 
economic climate, Executive Directors and the senior level of 
management will not receive a base pay increase in 2009 except 
where individuals have had a significant change to their 
responsibilities. No Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) grants 
were made during the year, although the Committee retains the 
discretion to make grants under the ESOS in the future. A one-off 
allocation of shares under the Special Long Term Incentive Scheme 
(SLTIS) and a grant of options under the Special Executive Share 
Option Scheme (SESOS) were made to Mark Hanafin in 
accordance with the terms of his engagement.
As a matter of policy, the notice periods in the Executive Directors’ 
service contracts do not exceed one year. However, in the case of 
new appointments to the Board, the Committee retains a level of 
flexibility as permitted by the Code and has exercised its discretion 
in respect of the appointments of Sam Laidlaw on 1 July 2006, 
Nick Luff on 1 March 2007 and Mark Hanafin on 14 July 2008. 
Each has a service contract that contains a notice period of two 
years, which will reduce to one year on the second anniversary of 
their respective date of appointment. The notice period contained 
in Sam Laidlaw’s contract has now reduced to one year.
The Committee believes that these arrangements are important in 
providing a potential remuneration package that will attract, retain 
and continue to motivate Executive Directors and other senior 
executives in a marketplace that is challenging and competitive  
in both commercial and human resource terms. It is currently 
intended that this remuneration policy and framework, which is  
fully endorsed by the Board, will continue for 2009.
Components of remuneration  
For 2008 the target and maximum bonus opportunity under the 
AIS, together with the relative proportions of the components that 
made up the maximum bonus opportunity, were as follows:

†  EPS in this table represents the Group’s diluted adjusted earnings per share.
*  The Committee has determined that, for the pre-2006 LTIS and for that part of the LTIS subject to the comparative TSR performance conditions, the most appropriate comparator group for the 
Company is the companies comprising the FTSE 100 at the start of the relevant performance period (the LTIS comparator group).
A balanced range of measures is used to determine overall AIS 
performance, during 2008, the primary financial measure was 
Group Economic Profit (EP). Each Business Unit had a number  
of business metrics focusing on key strategic priorities for the year 
which the Committee take into consideration together with health, 
safety and environmental matters when determining the level of 
bonuses to be paid. A bonus will be forfeited if the Committee 
considers overall performance to be unsatisfactory.
Twenty per cent of annual bonuses paid in respect of 2006 and 
2007 were deferred automatically and invested in the DMSS (see 
below). To incentivise Executive Directors to focus on creating 
long-term value for shareholders and to deliver sustained high 
performance, the deferral in respect of 2008 and thereafter will 
increase from 20% to 40% of any AIS award for the Chief Executive 
and to 30% for Executive Directors and executives immediately 
below board level. 
In 2008 the DMSS award was delayed due to Executive Directors 
and other senior executives being subject to prolonged dealing 
restrictions as a result of the Company being in a prohibited  
period under the Model Code. 20% of the AIS paid in April 2008 
was, however, deferred automatically at that time and subsequently 
invested in deferred shares once the Company had ceased to be in 
a prohibited period. Participants were also given the opportunity to 
invest an additional amount in investment shares from their actual 
bonus, up to 50% of the individual’s maximum bonus entitlement in 
respect of 2007. The Committee determined that the three-year 
performance period would be deemed to have commenced in April 
2008. Deferred and investment shares were matched with 
conditional matching shares, which will be released upon the 
achievement of a performance target (see table below). For the 
purposes of matching, the investment shares are grossed up for 
income tax and National Insurance contributions. Released 
matching shares will be increased to reflect the dividends that 
would have been paid during the performance period. In the event 
of a change of control the number of matching shares that vest will 
be subject to time-apportionment in line with best practice. 
The Committee is making a change to the operation of the DMSS 
for 2009 and thereafter. It is the Committee’s intention to measure 
EP growth on a three-year point-to-point basis going forward, 
rather than a three-year cumulative calculation of growth. The 
Company believes that this change will encourage executives  
to invest in the scheme and so align their interests with Centrica’s 
shareholders and help drive long-term performance.

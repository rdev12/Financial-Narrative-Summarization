FOCUS DELIVERY GROWTH
Kounrad Operation
The Group acquired a 60% interest in the 
Kounrad project in September 2007 following 
a tender of the subsoil use rights to develop 
the project with the local Kazakhstan 
authorities. The project is an in-situ dump 
leach with a 10,000 tonne per annum copper 
SX-EW plant. Whilst the project has historically 
been structured as a 60:40 joint venture, 
throughout the development and construction 
phase, it was 100% managed and financed  
by CAML. The Company has been working 
towards 100% ownership of the project 
following the acquisition of the 40% interest  
in KCC on 21 October 2013. This is planned  
for completion in H1 2014. In the 20 months  
to 31 December 2013 the SX-EW plant has 
produced 17,095 tonnes of copper cathode.
Kounrad Resource
The resources at Kounrad have been classified as 
JORC compliant during 2013 following significant 
drilling and sampling works on the dumps 
between 2007 and 2012. It is estimated that the 
dumps contain over 650 million tonnes of ore 
containing copper in excess of 600,000 tonnes. 
The leaching process to extract the copper will 
recover between 35 % and 52% of the contained 
copper depending on the mineralogy of the ore. 
In parallel to the JORC classification the resources 
were also placed onto the approved ‘State 
Balance’ of geological resources during 2013. 
The combination of the eastern and western 
dumps cover a combined area of 22 square 
kilometres and since the commencement of 
leaching in 2012 a total of 1,410km of pipework 
has been installed.
Investment in Chile
The Company acquired a 50% interest in a 
copper tailings project in Chañaral Bay, Chile, 
in late November 2013. This was the Group’s 
first acquisition outside of the Central Asia 
region. From 1938 to 1975, an estimated 250 
million tonnes of tailings from inland copper 
mines were discharged into the Rio Salado 
which outflows into Chañaral Bay. The area is 
heavily polluted as a result and there is 
significant local and national support for the 
project. Studies to-date estimate that there is a 
non-JORC compliant resource in the beach and 
bay area of 116Mt at 0.25% copper equating 
to approximately 290,000 tonnes of copper. 
Conventional metallurgical processing 
methods are proposed to be used and the 
metallurgical studies conducted so far suggest 
that up to 80% of the contained copper may 
be recoverable.
Kounrad Expansion
The Company is well advanced in planning for 
an increase in production capacity at the 
Kounrad site. In late 2013, the CAML Board 
approved a capital expenditure programme of 
$2.6 million for the addition of two new boilers. 
It is anticipated the boilers will be commissioned 
in late October 2014 and the production target 
for 2014 has been increased to 11,000 tonnes. 
Additional plans for expansion will be finalised 
once the Kounrad Transaction is completed and 
the Group owns 100% of the project.

Chairman’s Statement
DELIVERING ON OUR PROMISES
2013 has proved to be another successful year 
for the Company. We have delivered on the 
key promises we made to investors during the 
IPO and met our production and cost targets 
for the year.
Dear Shareholders
Key achievements
The year ending 31 December 2013 has been 
another successful period in the development  
of the Company. We have delivered a strong 
operational and financial performance and 
achieved a number of significant corporate and 
operational milestones.
2013 was the Company’s first 12-month 
reporting period of full production at the 
Kounrad plant and we were pleased to have 
produced 10,509 tonnes of copper which 
exceeded our production target by over 5%. 
Further, all of the copper sold through our 
marketing agreement with Traxys was LME 
Grade A quality. 
We have maintained focus throughout the  
year on the low cost nature of our operations, 
maintaining our position within the lowest 
quartile of cash cost producers globally.
The combination of our operational strength at 
Kounrad and the resilience of the copper price 
throughout 2013, enabled the Company to 
build up significant cash balances which totalled 
$44.5 million as at 31 December 2013. 
Corporate Governance
Since the IPO in September 2010, the 
Company has sought to build on the 
governance structures and internal control 
procedures in place at that time. The Company 
is committed to upholding the highest levels of 
Corporate Governance and the Board is well 
aware that it operates in a challenging 
business environment.
We work hard to ensure that the appropriate 
level of business controls are maintained across 
the Group’s operations. A combination of 
experienced management and regular 
communications and training has led to further 
improvements across the Group since the IPO.

In December 2013, Mr Kenges Rakishev was 
appointed to the CAML Board as a Non-
Executive Director. We are delighted to 
welcome Kenges to the Board and believe that 
his knowledge of the business environment in 
Kazakhstan and his entrepreneurial experience 
will prove of great value to the Company in 
future years.
Commitments to a sustainable 
business
Within Kazakhstan we feel we have a positive 
role to play as we develop our business.  
The Company is proud to contribute to the 
wider Kazakhstan economy through our 
business operations and plan to be there for the 
long term. The economic benefits generated for 
our local communities are significant both in 
terms of the employment opportunities and our 
social contributions.
As a responsible operator, we are also fully aware 
of our obligations to the environment and are 
committed to the sound management of our 
operating area in full compliance with the 
applicable environmental regulations and laws  
of Kazakhstan.
Strategy and Growth
Since listing, the strategy and direction of the 
business has been clear and focused on the 
delivery of the Kounrad project. The Board is 
extremely proud of what has been achieved by 
the management and staff during this period 
and the Company can justifiably say that it has 
delivered on its key promises made at the time 
of the IPO.
We are now entering an exciting period in  
the Company’s development and growth  
and are well placed to take advantage of 
opportunities that may arise in the sector  
at this stage of the economic cycle. The 
Company aims to complete the Kounrad 
Transaction in the first half of 2014, and to 
subsequently update shareholders on its plans 
to expand copper production on site. The details 
and timing of this aspect of the Company’s 
growth strategy will be announced during the 
course of 2014 as events unfold.
In addition to consolidating our business in 
Kazakhstan, the Company will be looking to 
identify attractive opportunities to expand its 
portfolio of assets in Kazakhstan and elsewhere.
Returns to Shareholders
Our strong operational performance in 2013, 
has enabled the Company to return funds to 
shareholders through its dividend policy which 
was announced in December 2012. Having 
raised $60 million at IPO in September 2010, 
the Company has already returned $21.6 million 
to shareholders through a combination of 
dividends and share buybacks.
The CAML Board will propose a final dividend 
for 2013 of 5 pence per ordinary share taking 
the total dividend for 2013 to 9 pence per 
ordinary share. This will increase the amount 
returned to existing shareholders since the 
commencement of production at Kounrad to 
$28.6 million, or 47.6% of the amount raised  
at the IPO.
It is the intention of the Board that the Group’s 
dividend policy, which is financed from the 
attributable revenue earned at Kounrad, will 
remain in place as we look to build on the 
Company’s activities and create further 
shareholder value.
Outlook
As a copper producer the Company’s fortunes 
are inextricably linked to the commodity price 
cycle over which the Board has no control. 
However, as a low cost producer, the Board is 
confident that the Company will be able to 
operate profitably even if the copper price 
should fall significantly below current levels.

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
FOCUSING ON SUST AINABLE  
LOW COST OPERA TIONS
Since the start of the project we have worked 
over 1.6 million man-hours on site with no  
lost-time injuries. This is a testament to our 
commitment towards ensuring the highest 
standards of safety and awareness for all  
our staff.
Strong Operational Performance
The Company’s first full year of production at 
the Kounrad Project has been a great success. 
We produced 10,509 tonnes of copper 
cathode and surpassed our production target 
by 5% whilst maintaining a competitive cash 
cost base. During 2013, our C1 cash cost of 
production was $0.73/lb (2012: $0.71/lb) and 
fully absorbed costs within Kazakhstan were 
$1.13/lb (2012: $0.98/lb).
Since the Company’s IPO in September 2010, 
management has focused the Company’s 
efforts towards early cash flowing projects  
and away from exploration. The Kounrad 
SX-EW project in Kazakhstan was identified as 
the project capable of delivering on this 
objective and now, just three and a half years 
later, the Company has a world-class facility 
that consistently produces high-quality copper 
cathode at industry competitive cash costs.
The company took a decision pre-IPO to use 
the services of a Chinese engineering group, 
BGRIMM, to undertake the design and costing 
for our Kounrad SX-EW plant which resulted in 
significant capital cost savings. The design of 
the plant along with the dedication and 
professionalism of the Group’s 217 employees 
at site ensured that the plant ran efficiently 
and profitably.
The generation of $76.0 million of project 
revenue at Kounrad during 2013, combined 
with the low costs of production has resulted in 
healthy cashflows for the Group enabling us to 
instigate and maintain an aggressive dividend 
policy. The full-year dividend proposed for 
2013 of 9 pence per share amounts to $12.6 
million and represents 23% of the Group’s 
attributable revenue for the year.

Capacity expansion at Kounrad
Having successfully met our 2013 production 
target we have already committed to some 
minor expansion at the SX-EW plant in 
advance of completing the ownership 
transaction with Mr Kenges Rakishev. In 
January 2014, we announced that our 
targeted copper production for the year at 
Kounrad would increase to 11,000 tonnes. The 
increased capacity will be made possible due 
to the expansion of the boiler house with the 
installation of additional coal-fired boilers 
taking the boiler house capacity to 14MW.  
In turn, this will allow increased volumes of 
copper bearing solution to be processed  
during winter operations. 
Additional and more significant capacity 
expansion at Kounrad is also being evaluated 
and management thinking is well advanced 
with regard to the various options available  
at the site given its size and characteristics. 
Management believes that the most efficient 
means by which the resource base can be 
exploited over the remaining life of the licence 
is an expansion of the existing plant. This 
appears to offer the best value for 
shareholders whilst managing the risks 
associated with expanding the leaching 
process to the western dumps.
Further analysis and preliminary engineering 
design work with BGRIMM and local design 
institutes is planned for early 2014. The CAML 
Board will not make a definitive decision on  
the expansion plans until the transaction with  
Mr Kenges Rakishev is completed.
Corporate and Social Responsibility
Management is fully committed to adopting 
the highest possible standards of Corporate 
and Social Responsibility and in line with this 
commitment, in July 2013, I was delighted to 
appoint a hydrogeologist and environmental 
engineer, Nick Shirley, as CSR Director to  
lead the Kounrad Health and Safety and 
environmental team. 
The health and safety of our employees and 
contractors is our number one priority and I 
am pleased to report that we have had no 
lost-time injuries during the period. Indeed, 
since the commencement of construction  
back in July 2010 we can report in excess of  
1.6 million man-hours have been worked 
without a lost-time injury.
Throughout 2013, we continued to build on the 
positive relationships we have developed with 
the local community and stakeholders. We 
place great importance on such relationships 
and during the year we contributed over 
$178,000 towards regional and local causes. 
We also provided assistance to a number of 
community development programmes with 
the focus being on health, welfare and 
education.
Finally, we have placed particular emphasis 
during 2013 on raising the environmental 
awareness of all our staff throughout the 
Company through specialist training 
programmes. The aim of the programmes  
is to ensure all staff are aware of the 
environmental standards and requirements  
of the Company.
Kounrad Ownership
As reported last year, the transaction to 
amalgamate 100% ownership of the Kounrad 
project within the Group has been going 
through due process with the Kazakhstan 
authorities since early 2012. This remains the 
case as at 31 December 2013, although, as 
announced on 27 June 2013, the nature of the 
transaction was renegotiated during the year 
with Mr Kenges Rakishev.
Significantly, and as a consequence of the 
renegotiated transaction, the transfer of the 
40% interest in Kounrad Copper Company LLP 
was registered on 21 October 2013. This was a 
notable milestone for the Company, as this 
entity owns the SX-EW copper plant which is 
responsible for the production and delivery of 
the copper cathodes and is the key revenue 
generator for the overall business.
On conclusion of this part of the overall 
transaction, and in accordance with the 
contractual arrangements, Mr Kenges Rakishev 
was duly appointed a Non-Executive Director to 
the CAML Board in December 201 3. 
The Company will endeavour to complete the 
final part of the transaction, the transfer of the 
subsoil use contract to our subsidiary company, 
as quickly as possible through the help of  
Mr Kenges Rakishev and our locally based 
management team. We remain confident that  
it will be completed during the first half of 2014. 
More detail on the transaction is set out on page 9.
Copper Bay Limited
The Company made its first investment 
outside of the Central Asia region during 2013 
with the investment of $3.2 million for a 50% 
shareholding in Copper Bay Limited. The funds 
will be used to complete a pre-feasibility study 
on the copper tailings project at Chañaral Bay, 
Chile.
Management believe that the Chañaral Bay 
project has merit and we look forward to 
working with the Copper Bay management 
team in taking it to the next phase. The 
Company has the option to invest a further  
$3 million to increase its shareholding to 75% 
in Copper Bay Limited. It is currently envisaged 
that this further investment would be used  
to complete a definitive feasibility study on  
the project.

Mongolia
The Company’s Mongolian assets were not progressed 
during the year. Efforts to sell the Ereen and Handgait 
projects were unsuccessful, however we continue to 
look to dispose of these projects. Our application for a 
mining permit at the Alag Bayan exploration project 
was not successful and as a result our exploration 
licence expired.
Consequently, management took the decision to close 
down our Mongolian operations and accordingly 
incurred a write down on the asset values of $12.9 
million. As at 31 December 2013, two of the subsidiaries, 
New CAML Mongolia LLC and Mongolian Silver 
Mountain LLC, had been sold locally for nil 
consideration and a third, Bayanresources LLC 
was close to finalisation, also for nil consolidation.
The Ereen and Handgait projects remain available for 
sale and management hope to complete this process 
during 2014.
Outlook
The Company’s primary objective for 2014 is to produce 
11,000 tonnes of copper at Kounrad and remain in the 
lowest quartile of the cash cost curve. Completion of the 
ownership transaction with Mr Kenges Rakishev remains 
a key objective for the first half of the year and this will 
then enable the Company to finalise its expansion plans 
for the Kounrad SX-EW project.
Outside of Kazakhstan, we will look for other opportunities 
to grow the business. We continue to evaluate other 
investment and acquisition opportunities worldwide for 
the Company which would add value to the shareholders 
and strengthen the Group’s asset portfolio.
I look forward to an exciting 2014 and would like to 
take this opportunity to thank all the staff for their hard 
work and dedication in making 2013 such a successful 
year for the Company.

Revised deal with Mr Kenges 
Rakishev – June 2013 – the  
“Kounrad Transaction”
During the early part of 2013, it was becoming 
clear to CAML management that the above 
deal with the SAT Group was taking longer  
to conclude than had been anticipated.  
A meeting was convened with the major 
shareholder and effective owner of the SAT 
Group, Mr Kenges Rakishev (“KR”) in March 
2013. The purpose of the meeting was to 
understand where the possible problems and 
delays were originating from and what could 
be done to expedite the process.
The outcome of the meeting was a revised deal 
whereby KR personally agreed to oversee the 
completion of the deal in exchange for an 
enhanced ownership in the Company of 20% 
post completion of the transaction. After careful 
consideration and deliberation, the CAML Board 
decided to accept the offer from KR and on  
27 June 2013 the Company announced a new 
Framework Agreement (the “Agreement”) for 
the acquisition of the remaining 40% of the 
Kounrad Project. The Agreement superseded 
the previous arrangements with SAT. 
The Agreement will result in CAML obtaining 
control over the Kounrad Project in two 
transactions:
▲ ▲ The first transaction (“KCC Transaction”) 
will be effected by the transfer of the 
remaining 40% share capital of KCC from 
SAT to KR, followed by a subsequent 
transfer to CAML ’s wholly owned subsidiary 
CAML Kazakhstan BV (“CAML BV”)
▲ ▲ The second transaction (“SUC Transaction”) 
will be effected by the transfer of the 
remaining 40% economic interest in the SUC 
from SAT, once it acquired it from SA, to KR, 
followed by a subsequent transfer to CAML ’s 
wholly owned subsidiary SK
▲ ▲ The two elements of the deal together being 
referred to as the “Kounrad Transaction”. Both 
parts are required to be completed for any 
consideration to be paid
▲ ▲ In March 2014, the long stop date, namely 
the date by which both parties committed 
to complete all aspects of the deal, was 
extended by mutual agreement to  
30 June 2014
The agreed purchase consideration consists  
of 21,211,751 Ordinary Shares in the capital  
of the Company (“CAML Shares”) and an 
entitlement to a cash payment in lieu of any 
benefits to which KR might have been entitled 
to had the CAML Shares been issued to KR on 
the transfer of the KCC interest to CAML BV, 
rather than on completion.
The CAML Shares will be allocated in two 
tranches, with one tranche of 15,336,096 
Ordinary Shares (72.3% of the CAML Shares) 
for the transfer of the 40% share capital of 
KCC to CAML BV (the “CAML Shares 1”). The 
remaining 5,875,655 Ordinary Shares (27.7% 
of the CAML Shares) for the transfer of the 
40% economic interest in the SUC to SK (the 
“CAML Shares 2”).
As part of the Agreement, KR was to be 
appointed to the CAML Board and this was 
duly completed on 9 December 2013.
Status of ownership changes as at 
31 December 2013
▲ ▲ The KCC transfer to the Group was 
registered on 21 October 2013
▲ ▲ The SUC Transaction remains outstanding 
as at the year end, pending receipt of the 
relevant consent and waiver of the 
pre-emptive rights of the government of 
the Republic of Kazakhstan
The accounting treatment for the Kounrad 
Transaction is detailed in note 33 to the 
accounts under Business Combinations.

Market Overview
FOCUSED ON COPPER 
The World currently consumes in excess of 20Mt of 
copper per annum and during 201 3 there was a further 
increase of approximately 4 %. Whilst predicting future 
consumption can be notoriously difficult, it seems 
reasonable to conclude that demand will remain robust 
into the future.
Global copper supply
Why Copper...
▲ ▲ Copper is used extensively in the construction and 
electrical industries – it is a “bellwether” for the global 
economy
▲ ▲ Copper’s unique properties in terms of malleability, 
strength and conductivity make it very hard to 
substitute with alternative materials
Supply against demand...
▲ ▲ Market analysts expect global demand for copper to rise 
by approximately 4% per annum through to 2030
▲ ▲ To meet the demand, global copper supply will need to 
rely on higher-risk projects
 – Lower average head grades and more remote mine 
locations
 – Higher capital costs of construction and lack of 
funding
 – Volatile commodity markets can impact investment 
decisions and delay start ups
 – Unstable mining jurisdictions
▲ ▲ Over-stated global supply projections due to market 
disruptions 
 – between 2005 and 2012 there was an accumulated 
loss in forecast production of approximately 8Mt
 – equates to approximately 1Mt per annum which is 
approximately 5% of projected annual demand
Regional demand...
▲ ▲ China consumes in excess of 40% of global demand 
and is forecast to increase consumption by 
approximately 5% per annum through to 2030
▲ ▲ Europe and Turkey consume approximately 20%  
of global demand

Copper price in 2014
During 2013 mined copper supply started to 
expand at a faster pace than demand after  
a long period of constrained and disrupted  
output growth – it is estimated there was a 6% 
increase in 2013. Many “greenfield” projects  
are set to come on line or ramp up production 
significantly in the next few years, although not 
all the projected mine capacity will necessarily 
lead to higher global output as many older 
mines start to decrease production.
During 2013 the copper price fell by 6% and 
the start of 2014 has seen the metal come 
under further price pressure. There are 
concerns over the demand from China and the 
linkage of the metal to the Chinese credit 
market where copper has been used over the 
past decade as collateral for many Chinese 
financial transactions. The impact of this 
potential slowing industrial demand, combined 
with a change in sentiment by the Chinese 
authorities to loan defaults, may lead to 
additional pressure on the copper price in the 
short term.
In early March 2014, the price dropped by 
almost 10% in just five trading days despite no 
obvious disruptions to the supply market or 
perceived changes to the global demand. 
Indeed, the copper price is down by about 
10% in Q1 2014 for the year and almost 35% 
from its all-time peak in 2011.
It is the view of CAML management that the 
marginal cost of production will support the 
copper price at a level based on the cost curve 
into the foreseeable future.
CAML ’ s copper market –  
the smaller producer
The impact of price pressures on the copper 
market will affect the profitability of the 
Kounrad operation. Despite this, the key to 
survival in such a market and during any 
potential downturn in the copper price is 
maintaining low costs of production. 
Kounrad is a low cost operation and in the 
lowest quartile on the cash cost curve.
Business opportunities 
for growth
Within this global market, over 50% of  
the supply is provided by the ten biggest 
producers. The balance of the supply market 
comes from smaller projects and the scope for 
overall consolidation and growth in the market 
is compelling. CAML is a well-managed copper 
producer with available funds to take 
advantage of this position.
▲ ▲ Of approximately 416 worldwide copper 
projects, 335 (80%) have an annual copper 
output of < 50Kt
▲ ▲ Copper production by SX-EW contributes 
approximately 3.6Mt to global annual 
production
▲ ▲ Of approximately 96 SX-EW projects, 74 
(77%) are smaller than 50Kt per annum
In the longer term the fundamentals  
for the copper market remain strong.

Managing the risks associated with our business 
environment is essential to implementing our strategy 
and ensuring our long-term success.
The Group is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties which could have a material 
impact on its business performance. The management of these risks is an integral part of the 
day to day responsibility of the management team.
The Board has identified the risks below as being the principal risks within the business: STRATEGIC

Production Risk – leaching process
The production of copper cathode is dependent upon the 
successful leaching of the dumps. There is a the risk that the 
leaching process slows down or that the pregnant leach 
solution containing the copper does not migrate to the collector 
trenches which have been built around the dumps to collect  
the solution
Impact
Reduced copper production or the complete suspension of 
copper production at the SX-EW plant with the subsequent loss 
of revenues
▲ ▲ During 2013, the Company processed in excess  
of 4.8 million tonnes of solution at an average copper 
grade of just below 3g per litre
▲ ▲ Prior to the commencement of commercial operations at 
the site, the Company conducted pilot plant testing on the 
dumps over a three year period. The specific purpose of 
such testing was to determine the hydrogeological and 
leaching characteristics of the dumps as well as the 
potential copper recoveries
▲ ▲ There are 118 boreholes around the dumps which monitor 
the leaching process for any possible leakage
▲ ▲ During 2012 and 2013 extensive geological, 
hydrogeological and hydrometallurgical testing has been 
conducted to further understand the dump characteristics 
CEO/TD/SKGD/CSR 1
Production Risk – SX-EW plant
Prior to the commencement of operations there was a risk that 
the SX-EW plant would not operate to its design specifications 
in terms of output and quality of copper cathodes
SX-EW plants world-wide are at risk from fire damage due to the 
large tonnages of flammable reagents utilised in the recovery 
process 
Impact
A fire would probably result in the complete destruction of the 
SX circuit and take up to 12 months to replace 
Reduced copper production or the complete suspension of 
copper production at the SX-EW plant with the subsequent loss 
of revenues
▲ ▲ Since the commencement of commercial operations in 
late April 2012 through to December 2013, the Company 
has produced 17,095 tonnes of copper 
▲ ▲ The quality of copper cathodes is closely monitored within 
the plant
▲ ▲ The plant has been designed using latest industry design 
codes to mitigate contributing factors such as build-ups of 
static electricity
▲ ▲ Entry into the plant area is strictly controlled
▲ ▲ A strict “permission to work scheme” is employed within 
this section by the engineering teams
▲ ▲ The section is protected by a fire detection and 
extinguishing system
▲ ▲ Frequent engineering and fire safety inspections are 
undertaken by site management

Expansion at Kounrad 
The detailed capital and operational expenditure plans may be 
affected by project delays as well as possible cost overruns on 
the project 
Impact
Additional costs to the business and delays in projected output
▲ ▲ The current CAML management team had a record of 
delivering on project timescales and budgets
▲ ▲ The management team has an established relationship 
with a competent engineering design company and cost 
effective supplier in China

Kounrad Transaction – increasing CAML ’s 
ownership to 100%
The transfer of the 40% in the Kounrad Project not owned by 
the Group has been in process for over two years and there is a 
risk that it does not complete or is changed again to the 
disadvantage of the Group
Impact
A return to the joint venture arrangements and a reduction in 
profitability. The breakdown could also prove damaging for 
CAML ’s business in Kazakhstan
▲ ▲ The Kounrad Transaction is a legally binding agreement
▲ ▲ As part of the Kounrad Transaction, KCC was re-registered 
under CAML ’s ownership in October 2013
▲ ▲ Mr Kenges Rakishev joined the CAML Board on 
9 December 2013
▲ ▲ The final waiver applications for the completion of the 
Transaction were submitted to the Kazakhstan authorities 
on 6 March 2014

Retention of key personnel 
The achievement of the Group’ s objectives are dependent on the 
Group attracting and retaining qualified and motivated staff
Impact
The efficiency of a particular aspect of the Group’s operations 
would be affected leading to reduced profitability, possible 
claims against the Group or a breakdown in overall 
management of a section of the business
▲ ▲ Group management annually review the salaries of its 
staff in order to ensure their pay levels are competitive 
with local and industry standards
▲ ▲ An annual bonus scheme is operated with specific 
performance targets set for the Group
▲ ▲ Senior management are incentivised through a 
combination of the above and also share options

Copper Price 
The Company’s financial performance is directly linked to the 
copper price which is influenced by a number of global factors
Impact
The impact is a loss in revenue for copper price reductions but 
the impact on the viability of the business would only become 
significant if the copper price fell substantially for a prolonged 
period
▲ ▲ Whilst the Group actively monitors the copper price  
it has a sufficiently low cash cost of production to be able 
to withstand a sustained reduction in the copper price
▲ ▲ In such a scenario, the Group would look to consider 
hedging a proportion of its copper production but is under 
no obligation to do so in order to offset any fixed liabilities 
other than the Group’s cost base

During 201 3 the SX-EW plant has operated 
with a utilisation rate of 97%.
Dump Leaching and Irrigation  
of the dumps
During 2012 all of the irrigation activity was 
focused on dumps 9-10 which are highlighted in 
the diagram below. It is estimated that 55% of 
the forecast recoverable copper within these 
dumps was achieved during that eight month 
period. Leaching operations continued on 
dumps 9-10 during Q1 2013 as specific blocks of 
ore had been prepared and covered with HDPE 
to allow continuous solution flow even under 
extremely low temperature conditions.
From Q2 2013 onwards, the dump leaching 
operations gradually moved over to dumps 6 
and 7 . The irrigation delivery systems on dumps 
9-10 were extended through the installation of 
3.2km of pipework onto dump 7 and 2.5km of 
pipework onto dump 6. Additionally, irrigation 
dripper pipes were installed over these areas.  
By the end of the year it was estimated that a 
total of just over 1,410km of dripper pipework 
had been installed on the three dumps since the 
start of leaching operations in 2012. A total of 
86.1 hectares of dump area have now been 
subjected to leaching in that period of which a 
total of 16 hectares have been covered by 
protective HDPE for winter operations.
During the year, the interceptor trench which 
collects the Copper Bearing Solution termed as 
PLS was extended by a further 2km to 
encompass dump 7 . This will now allow  
for the full irrigation and collection of PLS 
solutions from both dumps 6 and 7 during the 
next two years of operations. The site works also 
involved the construction of an intermediate 
pond and installation of a pumping station to 
transport the PLS. All the pipework necessary to 
extend the irrigation systems to cover the whole  
of dumps 6 and 7 is already on site with 
installation planned to commence in early  
April 2014.
Through operational experience, the site team 
has established that modifying the leaching 
cycle to incorporate rest and rinse periods has 
resulted in optimising the recovery of copper. 
This has enabled them to manage the 
incoming PLS grade to satisfy the SX-EW 
plant’s copper plating capacity.
During the period of rest, a combination of 
chemical dissolution with residual acid and 
ferric solutions continues to degrade the copper 
minerals that are not pure oxides, thereby 
making them more amenable to acid leaching. 
This process is also assisted by natural bacterial 
activity occurring in the dumps, particularly in 
the conversion of iron in pyrite to a ferric form 
which is a strong driver of the mineral 
decomposition process. The rest period can last 
up to six months, followed by the rinse cycle 
which tends to be a short duration leach of four  
to eight weeks. This latter cycle results in a 
further flushing of copper from the dump.
During 2013 it is estimated that the leaching 
of the dumps has resulted in an indicated total 
copper recovery of almost 46% from dumps 
9-10 equating to approximately 90% of the 
predicted target recovery from these dumps. 
The table on page 20 provides an indication of 
the calculated recovery values from each of 
the three dumps currently under irrigation.

KOUNRAD OPERA TIONS
During 201 3 we have worked 4 18,951 man-hours on 
site with no lost-time injuries. This is a testament  
to our commitment towards ensuring the highest 
standards of safety and awareness for all our staff  
on site.
The dump leaching operations are primarily 
about the application and management of 
high volumes of solution. 4.8 million tonnes of 
dilute acid solution, known as raffinate, were 
pumped through the irrigation systems during 
2013. Operational experience has determined 
that the optimum rate of solution application 
is between 2.0 to 3.4 litres per square metre 
per hour.
The PLS is collected at the base of the dumps 
and during 2013 the average grade was 2.96 
grams copper per litre. The management of 
solution flows ensures that the SX-EW plant is 
operated to its optimal design to maximise 
copper recovery at low cost.
Due to the extremes of climate experienced at 
Kounrad the leaching system is designed with 
two distinct phases of operation, winter and 
summer. During the winter period the volume 
of raffinate supplied to the irrigation system is 
reduced to a level at which it can be heated 
through the boiler system to at least 10 
degrees celsius. At the same time, with 
dedicated fresh blocks of ore, the PLS grade 
during these colder months tends to be higher 
than the annual average. The converse is true 
in warmer months when the Company will seek 
to maximise flow rates through the irrigation 
system and treat a slightly lower PLS grade. 
This operating approach allows management 
the flexibility to respond to the wide 
temperature variations between winter and 
summer which are experienced at Kounrad. 0

SX-EW Operations
The SX-EW copper plant performed to its 
design expectations throughout the year  
and the charts on page 22 highlight the 
performance over the course of the year.
An integral part of the success throughout the 
year was the achievement of excellent levels of 
plant utilisation. The Solvent Extraction (SX) 
section achieved a 97% utilisation rate whilst 
the Electro Winning (EW) section achieved a 
similarly high rate at 97%. The main rectifier 
unit which provides direct current to the EW 
section operated at 100% of its design 
capacity of 30,000 Amps for a seven month 
period throughout the summer of 2013.
The SX-EW plant management team are 
focused on optimising the production levels 
whilst minimising operating expenditures. 
Within the plant, the major costs items are 
labour, reagents and electrical power. Whilst 
labour is largely fixed, modifications to the SX 
circuit and improved operating techniques 
during 2013 resulted in significantly reduced 
consumption rates for the two key reagents, 
LIX and diluent. 
The consumption of acid in the plant and on 
the dumps has remained extremely low and 
was approximately 250kg per tonne of copper 
produced. The graph adjacent indicates the 
achieved reductions in consumption rates of 
the key reagents.
The copper cathodes produced remain of the 
highest quality and during 2013 all the copper 
was sold to LME Grade A chemical specifications.

Kounrad Resources
During 2013 no additional resource drilling was 
conducted on site as the samples and assays 
obtained during 2012, together with the 
geological work undertaken by Wardell 
Armstrong International (“WAI”) was sufficient 
for the preparation of a JORC compliant 
resource statement.
In addition to the resources being classified  
to the internationally recognised JORC 
standard, they were also admitted onto the 
Kazakhstan GKZ approved ‘State Balance’  
in the C1 category. The inclusion of this 
material to the ‘State Balance’ triggered  
a tax charge of $3.7 million.
Expansion of Capacity at Kounrad
2014 – 11,000 tonnes of copper
In late 2013 the CAML Board approved the 
capital expenditure for the addition of 2 extra 
boilers in the raffinate heating system 
increasing capacity from 8.4MW to 14MW. The 
intention is that the boilers will enable the volume 
of solution which is irrigated in the winter period 
to be increased. It is anticipated that the boilers 
will be commissioned in October 2014 and will 
facilitate an improvement in processed volumes 
from 450m
3
/hr to around 700m
3
/hr. The capital 
expenditure is approximately $2.6 million and 
with existing optimisation at the plant will enable 
the planned copper output for 2014 to be 
increased to 1 1,000 tonnes.
Further Expansion to process 
Western Dumps
The feasibility of constructing a second 10,000 
tonne SX-EW facility to exploit the Western 
dumps has been closely examined over the past 
12 months. The capital cost estimates indicate 
that expenditure in excess of $50 million would 
be required for this option due to significant 
costs associated with the infrastructure.

A second option to expand the current SX-EW 
plant and transfer the PLS from leaching on the 
Western dumps to the current plant location  
has also been closely examined. It has been 
assessed that the existing SX-EW plant capacity 
could be increased to a base level of 
approximately 15,000 tonnes per annum by the 
addition of a sixth mixer-settler unit and the 
construction of a new 5,000 tonne per annum 
EW building. The main transformer would 
require up grading to 10MW at the existing 
electrical sub-station.
In order to access the estern dumps in such a 
scenario, leaching solutions would be pumped 
via a pipeline with the raffinate being returned 
by a second pipeline. The estimated pumping 
distance is 12km in each direction. A three unit  
8.4MW boiler house would have to be 
constructed at the Western dump area to heat 
solutions in the winter together with the 
appropriate interceptor trenches and a pond 
collection system.
Whilst the capital cost for such an option is still 
being assessed and finalised, it is estimated to 
be significantly lower than the option of 
constructing a new SX-EW plant over at the 
Western dumps. 
Further, it is recognised by management that 
one of the big advantages of the latter option 
would be the addition of an extra mixer-settler 
unit at the current SX-EW plant. This would 
provide greater flexibility to treat larger 
volumes of solution essential for the economic 
treatment of copper bearing solutions below  
1 gram per litre. This would be a significant 
benefit to the operation should PLS recovery 
grades fall at any stage in the leaching cycle.
It is also estimated that the useful life of the 
SX-EW plant is significantly longer than that of 
the resource at the eastern dumps based on 
current extraction rates.  
On the basis of these two key operational 
aspects, management are of the opinion that 
an expansion to the current SX-EW plant may 
be the most effective way to exploit the dumps.
In early December 2013 a contract was signed 
with the engineering arm of Kazatomprom in 
Kazakhstan to develop the technical project 
documentation to enable the processing  
of the western dumps and materials within 
dumps 5 and 2 on the eastern area. The 
process of regulatory approval entails multiple 
stages of review and it is expected that final 
approval will not be obtained before late 2014 
at the earliest.

COPPER BA Y – CHILE
For an investment of $3.2 million CAML has acquired  
a 50% share in a project with a potential 290,000 
tonnes of contained copper in a mining-friendly 
jurisdiction. The combination of CAML ’s proven  
project management skills together with Copper  
Bay’s technical knowledge of the project could be  
the key to success. 
The Chañaral Bay area is 
heavily polluted following 
many years of tailings being 
discharged into the Rio 
Salado. There is a willingness 
at local and governmental 
level to resolve the problem 
and clean up the environment.

In November 2013, CAML acquired a 50% 
interest in Copper Bay Limited (CBL) by means 
of a $3.2 million cash investment into the 
company. CBL was formed in September 2010 
for the purpose of developing a copper tailings 
project in the Chañaral Bay area of Chile.  
The project location is some 800km north  
of Santiago and 120km northwest of the 
Regional Capital of Copiapó.
From 1938 to 1975, the Potrerillos, and later 
the El Salvador copper mines, disposed of the 
tailings residues from their respective mineral 
processing operations into the Rio Salado 
which outflows into Chañaral Bay. Over that 
period, it is believed that some 250Mt of 
tailings were discharged into the bay. These 
tailings deposited on the beach and bay area 
cover a 13 square kilometre area. CBL intends 
to explore the potential to reclaim and process 
the copper tailings to produce copper cathode 
and copper concentrate product.
Studies to-date, including a total of 253 drill 
holes, estimate that there is a non-JORC 
compliant resource of 116Mt of tailings at 
0.25% Copper. This amounts to some 290,000 
tonnes of contained copper plus minor gold 
and molybdenum. Conventional metallurgical 
processing methods are contemplated and 
studies conducted so far suggest that up to 
80% of the contained copper may be 
recoverable.
During 2014, CBL plans to conduct a pre-
feasibility study (PFS) in order to prove up the 
potential of the Chañaral Bay project. The PFS 
will look at all aspects of the project including:
▲ ▲ The environmental and social impact on 
the area
▲ ▲ The definition of the resource
▲ ▲ Investigating the optimal method for 
reclaiming the sands
▲ ▲ The processing of the sands to produce 
saleable products and a cleaned residue
▲ ▲ The safe disposal of the process residues
▲ ▲ A preliminary evaluation of the project 
economics
CAML has the right to invest a further  
$3 million to take its holding in the company to 
75%. These funds may be used to finance 
further studies with the aim of upgrading the 
PFS to the level of a Definitive Feasibility Study 
to be completed in 2015. If the project 
economics are positive, CBL would hope to be 
in a position by the end of 2015 to move 
forward with detailed engineering and finance.

Overview
The Company has reported another strong  
set of financial results on the basis of its 
operational performance at Kounrad and the 
associated low costs of production at this 
project. The resulting cashflows have enabled 
the Company to return $19.7 million in 
dividends to shareholders during 2013  
as well as strengthen our cash resources.
The year ending 31 December 2013 
represented the Company’s first complete 12 
months of production at the Kounrad SX-EW 
project having commenced production of 
copper cathodes on 30 April 2012. 
Further, on 21 October 2013, the ownership of 
Kounrad Copper Company LLP increased from 
60% to 100%. Consequently, the results for 
2013 comprise only 60% of the revenues and 
costs for the first nine months of the year but 
100% for the final three months of the year.
The accounting treatment for the business 
combination resulting from the acquisition of 
the additional 40% share in KCC resulted in an 
uplift to the asset values of $46.4 million and 
an exceptional gain in the Income Statement 
of $27.8 million.
The impact of the above two events make 
comparisons difficult from the annually 
reported numbers in several of the notes to the 
accounts. A more meaningful analysis of the 
reported revenues and costs can be obtained 
on page 29.
Details of the Kounrad Transaction are noted 
on page 9. 
Details of the business combination  
and accounting treatment are contained in 
note 33.
Income Statement 
The Group operating profit for the 12 month 
period was $27.9 million (2012: $15.0 million).
Profit for the year from continuing operations 
increased significantly to $48.6 million  
(2012: $10.3 million), but after allowing for the 
one off exceptional gain associated with the 
acquisition of the additional 40% interest in 
KCC of $27.8 million, the profit is a more 
comparable $20.8 million (2012: $10.3 million). 
This is still more than a 100% increase year  
on year. 
During 2013 we returned $19.7 million back  
to our shareholders in dividends whilst 
increasing our cash reserves to $44.5 million.
Summary
▲ ▲ Gross revenue for the year increased by 76% to $54.1 million  
(2012: $30.7 million)
▲ ▲ Operating profit for the year increased by 86% to $27.9 million  
(2012: $15.0 million)
▲ ▲ Unit operating costs at Kounrad remain competitive
 – C1 cash costs of $1,600 per tonne (2012: $1,561), equates to $0.73/lb

During the year, the Group decided to write 
down the value of all its Mongolian operations 
due to the protracted nature of its efforts to 
sell the Ereen and Handgait assets and the 
unsuccessful application for a mining licence 
at Alag Bayan in the Southern Gobi. 
Management reviewed the carrying value  
of these assets and recognised an overall 
impairment loss of $12.9 million (2012: nil). 
Further details are provided in note 20.
The Group profit for the year after tax of $34.5 
million (2012: $9.8 million) resulted in earnings 
per share of 38.89 cents (2012: 11.42 cents) or 
37.36 cents (2012: 11.03 cents) on a fully 
diluted basis.
Revenue
10,500 tonnes of copper cathode were sold  
by Traxys as part of the Company’s off-take 
arrangements at Kounrad and a further 
189 tonnes were sold locally. The Company 
achieved an average selling price of $7,114 
(2012: $7,995) per tonne and this generated 
reported revenues for the Group of $54.1 million 
(201 2: $30.7 million).
Attributable revenues for the Group at  
the Kounrad Project level, assuming 100% 
ownership throughout the 12 month  
period, would have been $76.0 million  
(2012: $51.1 million). 
The Company has an offtake arrangement with  
Traxys to sell 90% of its product through  
to 31 December 2015. As part of this 
arrangement, Traxys takes the goods at the 
SX-EW plant at Kounrad and is then responsible 
for transporting the goods to the end customer.
The costs of marketing, distribution and selling 
associated with this arrangement are borne by 
the Company and during 2013 a fixed fee of 
$350 per tonne of copper shipped was 
negotiated with Traxys. This amount was 
based on the actual costs incurred during the 
first eight months of the arrangement in 2012 
following the commencement of production in 
late April 2012. During 2012, the Group 
reimbursed Traxys for such costs directly. 
As a consequence of the change in approach 
between 2012 and 2013, the Group has 
reported both a gross revenue and net revenue 
line for 2013 which reflects the offset of the 
fixed fee from the price of the copper achieved.

Cost of sales 
The cost of sales for the period was $13.8 million 
(2012: $5.8 million) which included an additional 
$1.3 million of depreciation and charges 
associated with the acquisition of the 40% 
interest of KCC.
The costs related to the physical production of 
copper cathodes are the production labour, 
reagents and electricity, plus any other SX-EW 
site related cost. These costs amounted to $6.1 
million (2012: $2.7 million). 
Mineral Extraction Tax is charged by the 
Kazakhstan authorities at the rate of 5.7% on 
the value of the metal recovered and during 
the year this amounted to a further cost of 
$3.1 million (2012: $1.8 million). 
 
The table excludes all costs associated with the pilot plant which is no longer operated.

Distribution and selling costs
The major portion of the sales and distribution 
costs consist of the fees paid to Traxys as part

Balance Sheet
As a result of the Kounrad Transaction there 
has been a significant uplift to the Group’s 
asset base. Property, plant and equipment  
at Kounrad has increased to $77.7 million  
(2012: $20.3 million), whilst the intangible 
assets of the Group have also increased to 
$16.7 million 2012: $7.5 million). 
The cash reserves held within the Group also 
increased during the year to $44.5 million 
(2012: $33.9 million) due to the strong 
performance at Kounrad. As a consequence, 
the Group’s total asset base increased to 
$161.5 million (2012: $91.6 million).
During the year the Company took the 
opportunity to restructure the balance sheet 
and transferred $61.4 million from the Share 
Premium account to distributable reserves.  
Group overheads for the year are $9.6 million 
(2012: $8.5 million) reflecting the growth of 
the Group during the period. 
Depreciation and Amortisation
During the year depreciation and amortisation 
charges amounted to $4.6 million (2012: $0.9 
million). The large increase is due to the impact 
of a full year charge in 2013 of $3.0 million 
compared to only 6 months in 2012.
A further charge of $1.3 million was incurred in 
the period 3 months of 2013 as a result of the 
acquisition of KCC and the fair value uplift.
Impact on unit costs of production
Given the changes in the business over the 
past two years, it is difficult to ascertain the 
impact on the Group’s productivity and unit 
cost measures from the reported numbers.  
The table on page 29 reconciles the reported 
numbers from the Group accounts with those 
reported internally at project level.
The Group’s C1 cash costs of production 
remained competitive throughout the year at 
$1,600 per tonne (2012: $1,561) or $0.73/lb 
(2012: $0.71/lb). This represents a 2.5% 
increase year on year. Given that the Group 
currently only has one significant project, it 
seems reasonable to report the Group’s unit 
cost base on a fully inclusive basis. The fully 
inclusive unit costs are $3,152 (2012: $3,184)  
or $1.43lb (2012: $1.44/lb).
The main change in the Group’s unit costs 
during 2013 was the increased unit costs for 
depreciation and amortisation.

transaction.
Cashflows
During the year the Group generated $41.1 
million (2012: $28.0 million) from operations 
which resulted in the Group’s cash balances 
increasing to $44.5 million (2012: 33.9 million) 
as at 31 December 2013. 
The return of $19.7 million of funds to 
shareholders through dividends was the main 
outflow of cash during the year within the Group. STRATEGIC

At Company level, all of the funds advanced to 
the Kounrad subsidiaries for the development 
and construction of the project since 2007 
were fully repaid by late October 2013. This 
represented a return of funds of $53.6 million 
in just 18 months of production.
Taxation
The tax legislation in Kazakhstan is developing 
and at times the interpretation and compliance 
can be challenging for businesses operating in 
the country. During 2013, Sary Kazna LLP , the 
Kazakhstan subsidiary that effectively manages 
the leaching process on the Kounrad dumps and 
currently owns 60% of the subsoil use contract, 
was subjected to a taxation charge of $3.7 
million for the classification of the Kounrad 
Resources onto a state approved list.
This taxation charge is locally known as the 
Commercial Discovery Bonus and is a required 
statutory payment to the Kazakhstan 
authorities based on 0.1 % of the estimated 
value of the mineral resources discovered.  
The law supporting this taxation charge is 
ambiguous and CAML management spent 
significant amounts of time in seeking external 
legal and taxation advice to challenge the 
payment. Despite the efforts of management, 
the conclusion of the CAML Board was that 
any grounds for a legal challenge were 
subjective and could have led to potential 
additional fines or penalties and reputational 
risk. Consequently, the decision was taken to 
pay the tax and accept the charge as the price 
for compliance with local tax legislation.
The Group is also owed over $5.4 million  
(2012: $2.0 million) by the Kazakhstan 
authorities for recoverable VAT. The amount 
has been audited by the tax authorities on  
a number of occasions during 2013. The 
conclusion from the authority’s audit work  
was that the VAT amount claimed has been 
determined correctly and was supported by 
the required documentary evidence. Despite 
this, the amount remained unpaid as at  
31 December 2013. The Group has lodged an 
appeal with the authorities to recover the tax 
owed with the support of a local specialist tax 
firm.
Foreign Exchange
The Group operates overseas and is  
exposed to foreign currency movements.  
On 11 February 2014, the Kazakhstan Tenge 
devalued by almost 20% overnight as 
highlighted in note 34. Given that the Group’s 
operations in Kazakhstan generate their 
income in US dollars through the export of 
copper, the immediate impact from a purely 
financial standpoint was positive. It is 
estimated that approximately 60% of the  
cost base in Kazakhstan is denominated in 
Kazakhstan Tenge.
Nevertheless, the CAML Board was concerned 
about the impact of such a devaluation on its 
local employees. Having monitored the 
situation carefully in the days following the 
devaluation, and in line with other large and 
responsible employers in the country, the Board 
agreed to increase salaries for staff in the 
country by 10% from the beginning of February 
2014. The Board wil l continue to monitor events 
in the country and respond accordingly. 
The Group does not keep large amounts of 
cash in the Kazakhstan Tenge and as at  
31 December 2013 held the US dollar 
equivalent of $0.6 million (2012: $0.2 million).
Dividend Policy
As a result of the Group dividend policy 
announced in December 2012, the Group 
returned a total of $19.7 million to shareholders 
in 2013. This represented a 7 pence annual 
dividend for 2012 plus a 3.7 pence special 
dividend related to cost savings made on the 
construction of the SX-EW plant. An interim 
dividend for 2013 of 4 pence per share was also 
announced on 27 September 2013 and paid on 
15 November 2013.
As part of these annual results, the CAML 
Board is proposing a 5 pence per ordinary 
share final dividend for 2013 payable, subject 
to the approval of shareholders, on 20 June 
2014 to those shareholders on the Company’s 
register on 30 May 2014, making a total 
dividend for the year of 9 pence  
(2012: 7 pence). 
Financing growth
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had $44.5 
million of cash in the bank of which $30.6 
million was held in London and the balance  
of $13.9 million in Kazakhstan to cover both 
working capital requirements in country and 
also the 2013 Corporate Income Tax which is 
due in April 2014.
The Group has no debts outstanding as at  
31 December 2013 and with the cash reserves 
at its disposal is confident that it has sufficient 
funds available to finance both the dividend 
policy in the coming years and also the capital 
expansion plans being finalised for the 
Kounrad project.
The overall combination of no outstanding 
debt, a strong cash balance and positive 
cashflows from Kounrad will provide the 
Company with the financial flexibility and 
strength to support the growth of the business.

CSR Overview
With the establishment of the CSR Committee 
in 2012, and the subsequent development of 
the Group CSR Policy (which can be found on 
the CAML website at www.centralasiametals.
com), the main focus in 2013 was to maintain 
and improve health and safety in the work 
place, to increase environmental awareness 
throughout the Company and to ensure 
positive and constructive working relationships 
with our neighbouring communities.
The main objectives for the year were to try 
and meet the targets that had been agreed 
with external consultants in 2012 who had 
produced a gap analysis with regards to 
national standards, the local training and the 
quality of local policies and procedures. In 
order to meet these objectives and assist in  
the implementation of the improvement 
programme a CSR Director was employed  
in July 2013.
The CSR Director is a senior appointment who 
reports directly to the Technical Director and  
is permanently based in Kazakhstan. The CSR 
Director has been tasked with the responsibility 
of ensuring that all CSR related activities 
comply with both national legislation as well  
as approaching International standards. CSR 
Reports are now produced on a monthly and 
quarterly basis detailing progress on site and 
these reports are then reviewed by the CSR 
Committee which meets regularly.
The main CSR activities with regards to the 
protection of the environment, social and 
community based actions and health and 
safety during 2013 are detailed as follows.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of its employees and 
contractors is CAML ’s number one priority. As 
such, the Company employs two full time, fully 
qualified health and safety engineers to oversee 
the specific safety requirements of both Sary 
Kazna LLP and Kounrad Copper Company LLP  
in full compliance with Kazakhstan regulations. 
The health and safety Engineers work closely 
with the process team to ensure that, where 
possible, potential safety hazards are resolved 
by engineering improvements. Where this is not 
deemed possible, for whatever reasons, staff 
are provided with suitable equipment for their 
personal protection.
Up to the end of 2013 a combined total of 
815,331 hours were worked by Sary Kazna LLP 
and Kounrad Copper Company LLP employees 
without a lost time incident.
The plant site has a fully equipped first aid and 
rapid response medical facility. This is staffed 
by qualified nursing personnel 24 hours per 
day, seven days per week who, amongst their 
other duties, carry out mandatory alcohol 
testing for all employees and contractors on 
site. The Company also employs a fire team 
who are on site on a permanent basis and able 
to respond to an incident 24 hours a day.
Comprehensive Health and Safety training is 
given to all employees ranging from a detailed 
site induction to specific job related training. 
This is given both internally by the safety team 
as well by a specialist external health and 
safety training company who visit site on a 
regular basis to provide refresher courses.

An independent, external health and safety 
audit was undertaken during December 2013 
by SGS specialists. Their report will be 
produced in the first quarter of 2014 and the 
intention is to develop an action plan to 
implement their recommendations as soon as 
possible during 2014. In addition during 2013 
the Local Emergency Committee from 
Karaganda undertook a safety inspection  
of the plant and produced a series of 
recommendations all of which were  
completed in 2013.
One of the key health and safety initiatives 
implemented in 2013 were the risk 
assessments which were developed by the 
Safety Department to identify any major risks 
across the site. For each of these risks the 
current mitigation measures were assessed 
and if deemed inadequate further mitigation 
measures identified in order to further reduce 
the risk. These are reviewed and updated on a 
six monthly basis.
Environment
CAML is committed to the sound 
environmental management of our operating 
area in full compliance with the applicable 
environmental regulations and laws of the 
countries within which it operates.
Particular emphasis during 2013 has been 
placed on raising the environmental awareness 
throughout the Company. Specialist training 
has been given to the local Kounrad team to 
ensure that they are fully aware of best 
practice with regards to environmental control. 
An environmental training programme has 
been developed for all employees with the 
focus being an environmental induction 
detailing the standards and requirements of 
the Company.
Environmental monitoring of the local area 
continued throughout 2013 with the 
monitoring and control of flora & fauna, soils, 
air, surface waters and ground-waters at the 
Kounrad site. Whilst most of the work was 
performed by the Group’s own staff, external 
specialists were also employed. Independent 
results and reports produced by them were 
sent on a quarterly basis for review by the local 
environmental regulatory authorities.
As reported in the 2012 annual report, the 
monitoring of groundwater quality is a key 
focus at the Kounrad site. In excess of 100 
boreholes are monitored in three rings around 
the perimeter of the eastern dumps. The first 
line of boreholes act as abstraction wells in the 
event of any solution leakage beyond the 
containment trench.
Water quality samples from the boreholes are 
analysed in the onsite laboratory, allowing site 
management to react as necessary to any 
non-compliance issues. Quality control is 
assured by sending duplicate samples to 
external certified laboratories.
An important component of the groundwater 
monitoring programme in 2013 was a detailed 
programme of site investigations in areas to  
be leached in the forthcoming years. This 
consisted of surface geophysics, trial pits, and 
the drilling of geological cored boreholes as 
well as monitoring and hydrogeological 
boreholes. This work was undertaken both  
on the eastern as well as the western dumps. 
Further, a specialist international 
hydrogeological consultancy was contracted to 
oversee the programme of investigations and 
produce a detailed interpretive hydrogeological 
report of the site investigations which will be 
completed in the first quarter of 2014.

The Local Community
Throughout 2013 CAML has continued to build 
on the positive relationships it has developed 
with the local community and stakeholders. 
The Company recognises that having sound 
relationships and the support of the local 
community is important in the successful 
running of its operation at Kounrad.
The Social Management System was further 
developed in 2013 with a series of objectives 
and targets established in conjunction with 
external advisers. This system provides a basis 
for the Group’s local subsidiaries to interact 
with the local community both in terms of 
communications and dealing with any possible 
local grievances. One of the main areas of 
focus during 2013 was raising awareness in the 
community of the Company and its processes. 
A number of articles were published in the local 
newspapers regarding the various activities of 
the Group, particularly with regards to its 
commitment to protecting the environment as 
well as its contribution to the development of 
the local community.
During the year, the Group provided assistance 
to a number of community development 
programmes with the focus being on health, 
welfare and education. Two key donations 
were made to the local primary schools in 
Kounrad village. The Group sourced and 
installed for each school a dedicated IT 
computer room with up to 18 desk-top PCs and 
peripheral equipment. It is estimated that the 
Group donated in the order of $178,000 for 
community development projects during 2013 
and has contributed almost $410,000 to date.
Taxation
The Group is a major contributor to taxation  
in the area and since production commenced 
in late April 2012 has generated almost $30 
million in various tax liabilities to the 
government of the Republic of Kazakhstan.  
A breakdown of the taxation is shown below.
The main taxation that the project attracts is 
Corporate Income Tax (CIT) and for 2013 the 
CIT liability was estimated as $9.6 million, $6.8 
million being the Group’s share of that tax 
liability. The taxation is currently paid annually in 
arrears although with effect from January 2014 
the Company will be obliged to pay the CIT 
monthly on an estimated basis. An advance 
payment of $1.3 million was paid in December 
2013 against the 2013 CIT liability as a goodwill 
gesture following the request of the local tax 
authority.
During 2013 a one-off taxation charge, known 
locally as the Commercial Discovery Bonus was 
also paid following on from the successful 
conversion of the resources onto the 
Kazakhstan Government’s official mineral 
resource list, the ‘State Balance’. An amount  
of $3.7 million was paid in September 2013 
based on 0.1 % of the value of the resources.

Introduction from the Chairman
Our Board views good practice in corporate governance as key to  
our business’s success. We believe achievement of that success on 
an ongoing basis requires the Group to maintain good governance 
processes and continue to enhance these as the Group develops. 
The encouragement of the entrepreneurial drive that exists in our 
business within appropriate governance structures will remain key  
to the building and ongoing delivery of shareholder value over the 
long term. That is our aim and I am pleased to be able to say that  
it is bearing positive results.
Although under the AIM rules we are not subject to the 
recommendations of any particular governance code, our Board 
draws on recommendations on corporate governance from the 
Quoted Companies Alliance and on the UK Corporate Governance 
Code in the way it is constituted and operates. Whilst compliance 
with these codes in our case is not mandatory, we do implement  
the recommendations which we feel are appropriate for a company 
of our size and type. This enriches our decision making and helps 
inform inputs to strategy and the monitoring of performance  
both at our regular meetings and otherwise as appropriate through 
the year. It is supported by our Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors alike.
We are fortunate to have a diverse, talented and committed group of 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors. Our Executive Directors are led 
by Nick Clarke, our Chief Executive, and also include Nigel Robinson, our 
Chief Financial Officer and Howard Nicholson, our Technical Director. 
They each have great experience in their respective areas of expertise 
and all work well both as a team and as part of the wider Board.
We have also been fortunate to be able to draw on the wide 
experience of Dr Michael Price, a highly experienced director in the 
mining industry providing a valuable and constructive independent 
perspective and Robert Cathery who is experienced in both the 
resources sector and public markets generally. They both make 
significant and independent contributions to our Board.
Nigel Hurst-Brown,  
Chairman
In addition, we were delighted to appoint to the Board Nurlan Zhakupov 
in 201 1 and, in conjunction with his transaction with the Company, 
Kenges Rakishev in December 2013. They are both nationals of 
Kazakhstan where our principal operations are based. They provide 
great local insight as well as adding to the diversity and different 
perspectives of the Board.
This international diversity contributes to what I believe to be a 
suitably diverse Board. Among them, our Directors have long and 
valuable experience in the mining industry, financial and operational 
aspects of businesses, and publicly quoted companies, operating in 
different geographies around the world. Whilst we recognise the 
emphasis over recent years on gender diversity, we also believe in 
recruiting the best available individual for particular roles. This policy 
led to the appointment of a woman to one of the two senior 
operational manager roles in Kazakhstan. Although our Board is 
currently comprised solely of men, we hope the opportunity will arise 
in future to appoint women to the Board.
Where appropriate, and where there are initially differing views 
amongst Directors, our Board engages in debates that are always 
constructive and sometimes lively. This allows decisions to be reached, 
following full consideration of all views around the table, by consensus. 
These debates are informed by comprehensive reports from each of 
the Executive Directors and by external input for example from the 
Company’s financial advisors when considered appropriate.
We have active Audit, CSR and Remuneration Committees which allow 
different forums for more detailed discussions on matters within their 
terms of reference. These discussions are reported to the full Board 
where they are considered further as appropriate. Our Remuneration 
Committee meets without the Executive Directors present to discuss 
their remuneration. Our Audit Committee meets with the external 
auditors in the absence of management at least once per year.
Of course, the success of our business depends on the great people 
we are fortunate to have working in our operations on a day to day 
basis. Our Executive Directors are regularly on site in Kazakhstan and 
in each of the past two years the Board as a whole has visited the 
operations to meet with local management, view the site and hold  
a Board meeting. Aside from being an important part of the Board’s 
role, it is always most enjoyable to see the quality of people 
producing such a high standard of operation in our business.
On the following pages are more details of our individual Directors, our 
Board and its Committees. I hope this review of governance provides 
insight for shareholders to the importance my fellow Directors and I 
place on how the Company is governed on their behalf.

Corporate Governance Report
Board role and effectiveness
The Board of Directors comprises three Executive Directors and  
five Non-Executive Directors. The Board considers that all the 
Non-Executive Directors, other than Kenges Rakishev, are fully 
independent. Although Kenges Rakishev is not considered fully 
independent due to the transaction he is undertaking with the 
Company, he is considered otherwise independent including 
independent of management. Consequently, the Directors are of 
the opinion that the Board comprises a suitable balance of Executive 
and independent Directors in compliance with the QCA guidance.
The Board, through the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors 
as well as the Executive Directors, maintains regular contact with its 
advisors and seeks to ensure that it develops an understanding of 
the views of major shareholders about the Company.
The Board meets regularly throughout the year and is responsible 
for reviewing and approving the Company’s strategy and monitoring 
its financial activities and operating performance. Day-to-day 
management is delegated to the three Executive Directors who 
consult the wider Board on significant matters. Consequently, 
decisions are made promptly following consultation amongst the 
Directors concerned where necessary and appropriate.
All necessary information is supplied to the Directors on a timely 
basis to enable them to discharge their duties effectively and all 
Directors have access to independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense, as and when required.
The Chairman is available to meet with institutional shareholders to 
discuss any issues and concerns regarding the Group’s governance. 
The participation of the private and institutional investors at the 
Annual General Meeting is welcomed by the Board.
Internal Controls
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Company’s 
and the Group’s systems of internal controls, which are designed to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and ensure the reliability of 
financial information for both internal use and external publication. 
Overall control is achieved by a regular detailed reporting system 
covering both technical progress of a project and the state of the 
Group’s financial affairs.
Any system of internal controls can provide only reasonable, and  
not absolute, assurance that material financial irregularities will be 
detected or that the risk of failure to achieve business objectives  
is eliminated. The Directors consider that the system of internal 
controls operated effectively throughout the financial year and  
up to the date the financial statements were signed.
Based on the size and complexity of the Group, the Board of 
Directors does not consider that there is a need for an internal  
audit function.
Committees
The Board has specific Audit, CSR and Remuneration Committees 
covering three of the areas of the Group’s operation which the Board 
views as having key importance to the Group’s stakeholders. Each of  
these Committees have their own terms of reference which provide 
the necessary authorities for them to operate as they consider 
appropriate.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Dr Michael Price, Chairman, and 
Nigel Hurst-Brown, both of whom are considered independent 
Directors and attended all meetings of the Committee during the 
year. The Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities are to review 
the effectiveness of the Company’s systems of internal controls, to 
review with the external auditors the nature and scope of their audit 
and the results of the audit, and to evaluate and select external 
auditors and ensure their independence and objectivity.
In accordance with its terms of reference, the Audit Committee held 
meetings during the year with the auditors to review the plans for 
and the results of the audit of the 2013 accounts. The Chief 
Financial Officer and a representative of the external auditors are 
normally invited to attend the Committee’s meetings. Other 
Directors, staff and representatives of the external auditors may  
be invited to attend as considered beneficial by the Committee.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Dr Michael Price, 
Chairman, and Nigel Hurst-Brown, both of whom are considered 
independent Non-Executive Directors and attended all meetings of 
the Committee during the year. The Remuneration Committee 
reviews the performance of the Executive Directors and sets the 
scale and structure of their remuneration and the basis of their 
service agreements with due regard to the interests of shareholders.
In determining the remuneration of Executive Directors, the 
Remuneration Committee seeks to enable the Company to attract 
and retain executives of the highest calibre. The Remuneration 
Committee also reviews the remuneration of other senior 
management. In addition, it decides whether to grant share awards 
in the Company and, if these are to be granted, who the recipients 
should be.
Under the Company’s share option schemes, nominal priced share 
options have been granted to the Executive Directors during the 
year as shown in note 35. The shares will generally vest one third 
each year after the date of grant subject to the achievement of any 
performance conditions to which the awards are subject. STRATEGIC

CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 41
The Company’s policy is to remunerate senior executives fairly in 
such a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and 
motivation of staff. The Remuneration Committee agrees with the 
Board a framework for the remuneration of Executive Directors and 
senior management of the Company. The principal objectives of the 
Committee are to ensure that Executive Directors and members of 
the senior management of the Company are provided incentives to 
encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible 
manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of 
the Company.
Non-Executive Director fees are considered and agreed by the Board 
with no Director participating in any decision relating to his own 
remuneration.
Corporate and Social Responsibility Committee 
The Company has always been keenly focused on ensuring that the 
environmental and social aspects of its operations are managed to 
the highest possible standards. In recognition of this responsibility, a 
CSR Committee was established by the CAML Board in June 2012. 
The CSR Committee comprises Howard Nicholson, who is Chairman, 
Nurlan Zhakupov and Dr Michael Price. The CSR Committee is 
tasked with co-ordinating and managing CSR activities across the 
Group, further details of which are found on pages 32 to 35. 
A Group CSR policy has been developed and a copy of it can be 
found on the CAML website at www.centralasiametals.com.
Nominations Committee
The Directors are of the opinion that, given the size of the Company, 
there is no requirement for a separate Nominations Committee and 
that the Board takes on this responsibility as and when required.
Risk management
The effective management of risk is critical to the growth and 
profitability of the Group. The Group is exposed to a number of risks 
within its business and has a structured approach to identifying, 
analysing, managing and monitoring such risks. The principal risks 
and uncertainties are discussed in more detail on pages 14 to 16. 42 CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the 
Group and parent Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
▲ ▲ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
▲ ▲ make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
▲ ▲ state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
▲ ▲ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in 
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The Directors present their report and the audited consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Principal activities
Central Asia Metals plc (“CAML” or “the Company”) is the holding 
company for a group of companies (the “Group”) engaged in:
▲ ▲ the processing and subsequent production of copper cathodes, 
from secondary mining techniques;
▲ ▲ the identification, acquisition and development of base and 
precious metals deposits primarily in the Central Asia region  
but also worldwide.
CAML is domiciled and incorporated in the UK with the registration

107 Hammersmith Road, London W14 0QH, United Kingdom. 
Review of business
A review of the current and future development of the Group’s 
business is given in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 35 which 
forms part of, and by reference is incorporated in, this Directors’ 
Report.
During the year, two Extraordinary General Meetings were held by 
the Company. The first was for the approval of the capital reduction 
scheme (see page 74) and the second for the issue of shares to  
Mr Kenges Rakishev as part of the Kounrad Transaction (see pages 
9, 77 to 79). All resolutions proposed at these two meetings were 
passed. 
Financial risk management has been assessed within note 3.
Dividends
The Company’s dividend policy is that an annual dividend will be 
paid by the Company based on a minimum of 20% of the 
attributable revenues earned from its SX-EW copper project at 
Kounrad, Kazakhstan. The payments will be made by means of an 
interim and final dividend subject to the Company’s cash reserves 
providing a dividend cover of three times or greater.
During 2013, interim dividends of 3.3 pence and 4 pence per 
Ordinary Share of $0.01 each (“Share”) were paid on 1 February 
2013 and 15 November 2013 respectively. A special dividend of 3.7 
pence per Share was also paid on 1 February 2013. A final dividend 
of 3.7 pence per Share was paid on 29 May 2013.
The Directors recommend a final dividend for the year ended 
31 December 2013 of 5 pence per Share payable, subject to the 
approval of shareholders, on 20 June 2014 to those shareholders,  
on the Company’s register on 30 May 2014.

Report on the financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion:
▲ ▲ The financial statements, defined below, give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit and of the Group’s and Parent Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
▲ ▲ The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union;
▲ ▲ The Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
▲ ▲ The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The Group financial statements and Parent Company financial statements (the “financial statements”), which are prepared by Central Asia 
Metals plc, comprise:
▲ ▲ the Group Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended;
▲ ▲ the Group and Parent Company Statements of Financial Position as at 31 December 2013;
▲ ▲ the Group and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity and Statements of Cash Flows for the year then ended; and
▲ ▲ the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the Parent Company, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future events.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & Ireland)). An audit involves 
obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
▲ ▲ whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed;
▲ ▲ the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
▲ ▲ the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”) to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
▲ ▲ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
▲ ▲ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
▲ ▲ the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
have not been made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. STRATEGIC

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 201 3
1. General information
Central Asia Metals plc (“CAML” or the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) are a mining and exploration organisation with 
operations primarily in Kazakhstan and a parent holding company based in the United Kingdom.
The Group’s principal business activity is the production of copper cathode at its Kounrad operations in Kazakhstan. The Group also owns 
various exploration projects in Mongolia which are held for sale and has recently invested in a copper tailings project in Chile.
CAML is a public limited company, which is listed on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock Exchange Plc and 
incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is Masters House, 107 Hammersmith Road, London, W14 0QH.  
The Company’s registered number is 5559627.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of Preparation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Finance Reporting standards (“IFRS”) 
as adopted by the European Union, IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of assets held for sale which 
have been held at fair value. The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for 
the year ended 31 December 2013. The Group financial statements are presented in US Dollars ($).
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are explained 
in note 4.
The Group commenced production of copper cathodes on 30 April 2012. The cathodes are produced by the SX-EW plant at Kounrad which is 
owned and operated by Kounrad Copper Company LLP. Consequently during 2012 the cost of sales and distribution and selling costs refer to 
only eight months of operations.
On 21 October 2013, the ownership of Kounrad Copper Company LLP increased from 60% to 100% following the acquisition of 40% of 
KCC. Consequently, the results for 2013 comprise only 60% of the revenues and costs for the first nine months of the year but 100% for the 
final three months of the year.
The impact of the above two events make annual comparisons difficult from the annually reported numbers in several of the notes to the 
accounts. A more meaningful analysis of the reported revenues and costs can be obtained from the Strategic Report on page 29.
Where a change in the presentational format between the prior year and current year financial statements has been made during the year, 
comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
Going concern
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements though its profitable operations at Kounrad. The Group has substantial cash 
balances as at 31 December 2013 and on the date of issue these financial statements. Management’s cash flow projections indicate that 
Group’s cash resources are adequate to meet all expected liabilities for the forseeable future.
The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Please refer to notes 6, 
23 and 27 for information on the Group’s revenues, cash balances and trade and other payables.
▲ ▲ New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The following standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and 
have a material impact on the Group:
Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Financial statement presentation’ regarding other comprehensive income. The main change resulting from these 
amendments is a requirement for entities to group items presented in ‘other comprehensive income’ (OCI) on the basis of whether they are 
potentially re-classifiable to profit or loss subsequently (reclassification adjustments).
Amendment to IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’, on asset and liability offsetting. This amendment includes new disclosures to 
facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare IFRS financial statements to those that prepare financial statements in 
accordance with US GAAP.
IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’, aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value and a 
single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRSs. The requirements, which are largely aligned 
between IFRSs and US GAAP, do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be applied where its use 
is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRSs. STRATEGIC  
REPORT
GOVERNANCE 
REPORT
FINANCIAL  
STATEMENTS
CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 55
Amendments to IAS 36, ‘Impairment of assets’, on the recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets. This amendment removed 
certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of CGUs which had been included in IAS 36 by the issue of IFRS 13. The amendment is not 
mandatory for the group until 1 January 2014, however the Group has decided to early adopt the amendment as of 1 January 2013.
▲ ▲ New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 
2013, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statement. None of these is expected to have a significant effect 
on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below:
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 
was issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of 
financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and 
those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition.
The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow 
characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in 
cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in 
other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The standard is not expected 
to have material impact on the Group.
IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in 
whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. The standard provides additional 
guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess. The standard is not mandatory for the group until 
1 January 2014. The standard is not expected to have material impact on the Group.
IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’ includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including 
joint arrangements, associates, structured entities and other off balance sheet vehicles. The standard is not mandatory for the group until 
1 January 2014. The standard is not expected to have material impact on the Group.
IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ focuses on the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement rather than its legal form. There are 
two types of joint arrangements: joint operations and joint ventures. Joint operations arise where the investors have rights to the assets  
and obligations for the liabilities of an arrangement. A joint operator accounts for its share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.  
Joint ventures arise where the investors have rights to the net assets of the arrangement; joint ventures are accounted for under the equity 
method. Proportional consolidation of joint arrangements is no longer permitted. The standard is not mandatory for the group until  
1 January 2014 and not material.
IFRIC 21, ‘Levies’, sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy that is not income tax. The interpretation addresses what the 
obligating event is that gives rise to pay a levy and when should a liability be recognised. The Group is not currently subjected to significant 
levies so the impact on the Group is not material.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Basis of Consolidation
Joint Venture Accounting – Kounrad Project
The Kounrad Project ownership changes have taken a significant amount of time to complete. Throughout the periods of joint ownership 
and under the terms of the JOA, both of the parties had an equal vote on all significant operational, financial and planning matters. 
Consequently, it was concluded that Joint Control existed over the Kounrad project and so, whilst the various transactions have been 
negotiated and submitted for government approval, the Kounrad Project has been accounted for in the following manner;
1.  The sub soil user licence operations under SK are classified as a jointly controlled asset. The assets, liabilities, income and expenditure 
have been proportionately consolidated on a 60:40 basis.
2.  All of the operations conducted under Kounrad Copper Company LLP have also been proportionately consolidated on a 60:40 basis as it 
has been a jointly owned legal entity. During 2013 the Group took advantage of the EU exemption which enabled it to delay 
implementing revised accounting standards under IFRS 11 for joint entities.
Business Combinations – Kounrad Project
Throughout 2013 the above Joint Venture Accounting has remained in place although it is recognised that the completion of both 
transactions (KCC and SUC) will result in a change in control of the Kounrad Project from joint control to control by CAML.
As such an IFRS 3 “Business Combination” will be deemed to have taken place upon completion.
Details of the accounting treatment for the business combination are contained in note 33. 56 CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
for the year ended 31 December 201 3
Other CAML Subsidiaries
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of CAML and the entities it controls drawn up to 31 December 2013.
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting 
rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are 
fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is 
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess 
of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of 
acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the 
income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised losses/gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses/gains are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have 
been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are 
presented separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheet distinct from parent shareholders equity.
Where losses are incurred by a partially owned subsidiary, they are consolidated such that the non-controlling interests’ share in the losses is 
apportioned in the same way as profits. Where the subsidiary makes continuing losses such that the non-controlling interests’ share of the 
losses in a period exceeds its interest in equity, the allocation of losses to the minority ceases and the loss is allocated against the parent 
company holding.
Where profits are then made in future periods, such profits are then allocated to the parent company until all unrecognised losses 
attributable to the non-controlling interests but absorbed by the parent are recovered at which point, profits are allocated as normal.
Segment reporting
As at 31 December 2013, the Group only had one business segment consisting of an SX-EW copper plant at Kounrad in Kazakhstan.  
The Group operations are controlled from a head office in London, UK but this does not represent a separate business segment.
Foreign currency translation
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates 
(“the functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars, which is the Group’s presentation currency.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting 
date. All differences are taken to the income statement.
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
▲ ▲ Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet;
▲ ▲ Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and
▲ ▲ All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to shareholders’ 
equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is 
recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the 
aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to 
making the asset capable of operating as intended.
The cost of the item also includes the cost of decommissioning any buildings or plant and equipment and making good the site, where a 
present obligation exists to undertake the restoration work. STRATEGIC  
REPORT
GOVERNANCE 
REPORT
FINANCIAL  
STATEMENTS
CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 57
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows:
▲ ▲ Construction in progress  – not depreciated
▲ ▲ Plant and Equipment  – over 5 to 15 years
▲ ▲ Motor Vehicles   – over 5 to 10 years
▲ ▲ Office Equipment  – over 2 to 10 years
Construction in progress is not depreciated until transferred to other classes of property, plant and equipment.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful lives and residual values are 
reviewed annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from  
the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset is included in the income statement.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets comprise goodwill, deferred exploration and evaluation costs, mining licences and permits and computer software.
Goodwill
All business combinations in the Group are accounted for under IFRS 3 using the purchase method. Any excess of cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the 
statement of financial position as goodwill and is not amortised. To the extent that the net fair value of the acquired entity’s identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for 
impairment, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, the purchase consideration is allocated to the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities on the basis of 
their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable net 
assets of the subsidiary acquired is recognised as positive goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisition comprised $9,278,000, being the Group’s 40 per cent share of the amount calculated in accordance with IFRS 
to recognise a deferred tax liability on the difference between the provisional fair value of the newly consolidated assets and liabilities with 
their tax base. This deferred tax liability was calculated on the acquisition of the additional 40% in Kounrad Copper Company LLP on 
21 October 2013 (note 33).
Any excess of the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable net assets of the subsidiary exceed the cost of the acquisition is recognised 
directly in the income statement.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit expected to benefit from the business combination 
in which the goodwill arose. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is 
recognised in the income statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to an entity is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit.
Deferred exploration and evaluation expenditure
Capitalised costs include costs directly related to any Group exploration and evaluation activities in the relevant area of interest. Exploration 
and evaluation expenditure capitalised includes acquisition of rights to explore, topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical 
studies, exploration drilling, trenching, sampling and activities in relation to the evaluation of the technical feasibility and commercial 
viability of extracting a mineral resource.
Mining licences, permits and computer software
The historical cost model is applied, with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses. Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives with 
charges included in either cost of sales or administrative expenses:
▲ ▲ Computer software  – over 2 to 5 years
▲ ▲ Permits and Mining licences – over the duration of the legal agreement.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value 
may not be recoverable. 58 CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
for the year ended 31 December 201 3
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group carries out impairment testing on all assets when there exists an indication of an impairment. If any such indication exists the 
Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating 
unit’s fair value less costs to sell or its value in use.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset.
The best evidence of an asset’s fair value is the value obtained from an active market or binding sale agreement. Where neither exists, fair 
value less costs to sell is based on the best available information to reflect the amount the Group could receive for the cash-generating unit 
in an arm’s length sale. In some cases this is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed if the recoverable amount increases as a result of a reversal of the conditions that 
originally resulted in the impairment. This reversal is recognised in the income statement and is limited to the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
Goodwill is also reviewed annually, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. Non-financial assets other than goodwill which have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the 
impairment at each reporting date.
Disposal groups held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale and included in discontinuing operations when their carrying amount is to be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received from sales of metal to an end user, net of any value added tax. It is measured as 
the consideration received for the metal after deduction of sales commissions and any other taxes. The value of the consideration is fair 
value which equates to the spot price on the date of sale or the contractually agreed price.
Gross revenue excludes customer discounts and other similar fees, which are required to be offset against revenue in accordance with IAS 18.
Revenue is only recognised at the point when the following criteria are satisfied:
▲ ▲ The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have been transferred to the buyer;
▲ ▲ No managerial control remains over the metal product; and
▲ ▲ The amount of revenue earned can be accurately measured.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour and all other direct costs associated with mining the 
ore and processing it to a saleable product.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less any further costs expected to be incurred to 
completion. Provision is made, if necessary, for slow moving, obsolete and defective inventory.
Current and deferred income tax
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the 
countries where the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised when they arise from timing differences where their recoverability in the short term is regarded as 
being probable.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. STRATEGIC

Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less amounts to be written off.
Share capital
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, 
net of tax, from the proceeds.
Share based compensation
The Group operates two main Share Option Plans, the rules of which were approved by the Board in December 2007 and October 2011.  
A scheme similar in details to the one approved in October 2011 was also set up for the two overseas General Directors with the only 
difference being a specific two year vesting period as opposed to a three year vesting period. The fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference 
to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market service and performance vesting conditions. Non-market 
vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. The total amount expensed is 
recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At each reporting 
date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-marketing vesting conditions. It 
recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables do not carry interest and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method.
Provisions
Provisions for environmental restoration of mining operations are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably 
estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to 
passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
3. Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks; foreign currency exchange risk, commodity price risk, tax risk, liquidity risk, 
capital risk, credit risk and interest rate risk. There risks are mitigated wherever possible by the Group’s financial management policies and 
practices described below;
Foreign currency exchange risk
The Group and Company report their financial results in US dollars and consequently they are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from 
various currency exposures with respect to the US Dollar. Foreign currency exchange risk arises from both future commercial transactions 
where projected expenditures are sourced in currencies other than US dollars and from the resulting exchange gains and losses recognised 
on assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations within the Group accounts.
The Group manages its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk associated with material commercial transactions and working capital 
requirements by maintaining controlled amounts of cash in the required currencies.
The primarily Group currency requirements:
▲ ▲ British Pounds (GBP) – CAML head office overheads and dividends
▲ ▲ Kazakhstan Tenge (KZT) and US dollars (USD) – working capital requirements for the Kounrad operations
The Mongolian Tugrik (MNT) and European Euro (EUR) requirements are immaterial to the Group’s operations.
The Group’s main revenue stream from the sale of copper cathode in Kazakhstan is denominated in US dollars. 60 CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Commodity price risk
Commodity price risk is the risk that the Group’s future earnings will be adversely impacted by changes in the market prices of commodities, 
primarily copper. Management is aware of this impact on its primary revenue stream but knows that there is little it can do to influence the 
price earned apart from a hedging scheme.
Given the low costs of production and the absence of any debt liabilities within the Group, since the commencement of production in late 
April 2012, CAML management has always felt that a hedging policy was not required and sold the copper generally on a “spot” basis.
Given the recent volatility in the copper price, the CAML Board is reviewing its position with regard to the possible hedging of copper sales. 
No decision has yet been taken to change the current approach and the CAML Board will continue to monitor this throughout 2014.

10% increase in copper price 5,435 2,889
10% decrease in copper price (5,435) (2,889)
Tax risk
The taxation systems in Kazakhstan are at an early stage of development. The interpretation and application of tax laws and regulations are 
evolving, which significantly increases the risks with respect to mining and subsoil use operations, and the Group’s investments in Kazakhstan 
in comparison with more developed tax systems.
Tax legislation is subject to different and changing interpretations, as well as inconsistent enforcement. Tax regulation and compliance is 
subject to review and investigation by the authorities who may impose extremely severe fines, penalties and interest charges. The fact that 
the tax authorities have conducted an audit of a particular period does not prevent them from revisiting that period and raising an 
additional assessment.
In addition, Kazakhstan’s tax system does not recognise the concept of tax authorities giving legally binding rulings on tax issues that are 
put before them. The inconsistent enforcement and the evolution of Kazakhstan tax laws creates a risk of excessive payment of tax or 
penalties by the subsoil users if they fail to comply with tax legislation.
The Group manages this risk by complying locally with all tax regulations and ensuring that its local accounting staff are adequately trained 
and updated regarding any appropriate tax law changes. CAML also receives tax advice on local issues from its tax advisers, PwC Chartered 
Accountants and Statutory Auditors, in Kazakhstan and Mongolia.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk relates to the ability of the Group and Company to meet future obligations and financial liabilities as and when they fall due.
As the Group currently has sufficient cash resources and material income stream from the Kounrad project, the liquidity risk is 
considered insignificant.
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group manages its capital in order to provide sufficient funds for the Group’s activities. Future capital requirements are regularly 
assessed and Board decisions taken as to the most appropriate source for obtaining the required funds, be it through internal revenue 
streams, external fund raising, issuing new shares or selling assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust 
the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Due to the cash flows being generated at Kounrad from the sale of copper cathode and no debt, the Group’s capital risk is currently 
perceived as minimal although the Board will continue to monitor requirements prudently.
Credit management
Credit risk refers to the risk that the Group and Company’s financial assets will be impaired by the default of a third party. The Group and 
Company are exposed to credit risk primarily on its cash and cash equivalents as set out in note 23 and on its trade and other receivables as 
set out in note 21.
The Directors have considered the credit exposures and do not consider that they pose a material risk at the present time. The credit risk for 
cash and cash equivalents is managed by ensuring that all surplus funds are deposited only with financial institutions with high quality 
credit ratings.
The Group is exposed to the risk of not recovering VAT receivable from Kazakhstan tax authorities as set out in note 21. 62 CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
for the year ended 31 December 201 3
Interest rate risk
The Group has no borrowings as at 31 December 2013 (2012: $150,000). The Group is funded 100% by equity and has limited exposure to 
interest rate risk.
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The Group has four key areas where critical accounting estimates and judgements are required that could have a material impact on the 
financial statements:
Impairment
As mentioned above estimates are required periodically to assess assets for impairment. These estimates will incorporate the expected 
future commodity prices, estimates of the ore reserves and projected future costs of development and production. This includes an 
assessment of the carrying values of assets held for sale.
The carrying value of the goodwill generated by accounting for the business combination of the Group acquiring an additional 40% in the 
Kounrad Project requires an annual impairment review. This review will determine whether the value of the goodwill can be justified by 
reference to the carrying value of the business assets and the future discounted cash flows of the business.
Mineral reserves and resources
The major value associated with the Group is the value of its mineral resources. These resources are the Group’s best estimate of product 
that can be economically and legally extracted from the relevant mining property. The Group’s estimates are supported by geological 
studies and drilling samples to determine the quantity and grade of each deposit.
Significant judgement is required to generate an estimate based on the geological data available. Ore resource estimates may vary from 
period to period. This judgement has a significant impact on impairment consideration and the period over which capitalised assets are 
depreciated within the financial statements.
The resources have been independently verified by Wardell Armstrong International and were classified as JORC Compliant in 2013.
Decommissioning and site rehabilitation estimates
Provision is made for the costs of decommissioning and site rehabilitation costs when the related environmental disturbance takes place. 
Provisions are recognised at the net present value of future expected costs using discount rate of 6.40% (2012: 6.86%).
The provision recognised represents management’s best estimate of the costs that will be incurred, but significant judgement is required as 
many of these costs will not crystallise until the end of the life of the mine. Estimates are reviewed annually and are based on current 
contractual and regulatory requirements and the estimated useful life of mines. Engineering and feasibility studies are undertaken 
periodically; however significant changes in the estimates of contamination, restoration standards and techniques will result in changes to 
provisions from period to period.
Business combination
The Kounrad Transaction will ultimately result in the Group acquiring the 40% of the joint venture project at Kounrad that it did not 
previously own. The assessment of the fair value uplift of the underlying assets acquired and the treatment of the two legal entities involved 
in the project as at the 31 December 2013 period end required a high degree of judgement.
The assessment of the overall project as a business combination for both legal entities, Kounrad Copper Company LLP and Sary Kazna LLP, 
and the impact on that judgement caused by the different stages of completion as at 31 December 2013 required a careful review of the 
overall transaction as opposed to the specific nature of the assets being acquired.
The fair value uplift of the assets acquired as a result of that judgement and the resulting accounting treatment have resulted in a significant 
change to both the income statement and the balance sheet of the business. The details are explained in note 33. STRATEGIC

5. Segmental information
The Board is the Group’s chief operating decision-maker. Management has determined the operating segments based on the information 
reviewed by the Board for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. The Board considers the business from a 
geographic prospective.
As at 31 December 2013, the Group only had one business segment consisting of an SX-EW copper plant at Kounrad in Kazakhstan.  
The Group operations are controlled from a head office in London, UK but this does not represent a separate business segment.
Previously reported business segments within the Group, namely all the Mongolian operations, are classified as held for sale as at 
31 December 2013. As part of the sale process, in December 2013, New CAML Mongolia LLC and Mongolian Silver Mountain LLC were sold 
for nil consideration.
The Board assesses the performance of the Kounrad project based on a number of key operational and financial measures which relate to 
copper production output, revenues from the sales of copper and the overall costs of producing the copper. All capital related expenditure at 
the project is also closely monitored and controlled.

The total production at Kounrad for the 12 month period was 10,509 tonnes whilst the total quantity of copper sold was slightly higher at 
10,689 tonnes. The average price achieved from the sale of copper was $7,114 per tonne.
EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure. CAML calculates EBITDA as profit or loss for the period excluding the following items:
▲ ▲ Income tax expense;
▲ ▲ Finance income and expense; 
▲ ▲ Depreciation and amortisation; and 
▲ ▲ Discontinuing operations; and Gain on re-measuring to fair value and other income or expenses.
EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts. It does not have any standardised meaning prescribed by  
IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA  
excludes the impact of cash costs of financing activities and taxes, and the effects of changes in operating working capital balances, and  
therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may  
calculate EBITDA differently. 64 CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013

The Group sells and distributes its copper cathode product primarily through an offtake arrangement with Traxys. The offtake arrangements 
are for 90% of the SX-EW plant’s output for the period up until 31 December 2015. The copper cathodes are delivered from the Kounrad site 
by rail under an FCA (Incoterms 2010) contractual basis and delivered to the end customers in Turkey. As part of the offtake arrangements, 
the Group sells the copper cathodes at a price linked to the London Metal Exchange (LME) copper price based on an agreed 
quotational period.
The offtake arrangements with Traxys started in May 2012 in line with the commencement of production on site. Given the lack of previous 
knowledge and experience of both the logistical issues and costs associated with delivering the copper cathodes from Kounrad to the end 
customers at that time, it was agreed to deliver the cathodes on an “open book” basis for the remaining eight months of 2012. This basis 
allowed the Group to better understand the costs and logistical issues involved during this learning period and thereby agree rates for future 
periods on a more informed basis. STRATEGIC

Consequently, during 2012 the costs associated with the sales and distribution of the copper cathodes from Kounrad to the end customer 
were incurred by Traxys but paid for by the Group. During 2013, the costs of delivery to the end customers have been effectively borne by 
the Group through means of an annually agreed buyer’s fee which is offset from the selling price (note 8).
During 2013 the Group sold 10,500 tonnes (2012: 6,083 tonnes) of copper through the offtake arrangements. Some of the copper cathodes 
are also sold locally and during 2013 a total of 189 tonnes (2012: 320 tonnes) were sold to local customers.

As part of the offtake arrangements, the Group may receive payment for copper cathodes immediately upon dispatch rather than waiting for 
delivery to the end customer. In such cases, interest is charged to the Group on such amounts received up to a maximum period of 60 days from 
the date of dispatch. During the year the Group incurred interest charges of $149,285 (2012: $168,712) under these arrangements.
The above finance costs also include $221,333 related to the annual assessment of the Group’s asset retirement obligations associated with 
the Kounrad project (2012: nil). The unwinding of discount is calculated on the environmental rehabilitation provision presented in note 28. 
For cash flow purposes unwinding of discount is excluded from the finance expense movement. STRATEGIC

Included within the line Acquisition of Subsidiary are a number of adjustments resulting from the Kounrad Transaction, explained in note 33 
and on page 9. The adjustments comprise:
1.  A proportionate increase (i.e. from 60% to 100%) in the carrying values of Kounrad related property, plant and equipment of 
$11,214,903 and accumulated depreciation of $605,294.
2.  A fair value uplift applied to the Kounrad assets of $46,392,000 (of which $27,835,000 results from measuring at fair value the Group’s 
60% equity interest in KCC held before the business combination). This fair value uplift resulted in an additional depreciation charge of 
$1,335,856 during the year; and
3.  The transfer of assets related to the Kounrad project of $4,508,743, previously recognised as investments (note 19).
The Company had $198,119 of office equipment at net book value as at 31 December 2013 (2012: $9,543). 70 CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013

As a result of the Kounrad Transaction, explained on page 9 of the Chief Executive Officer’s Statement, the Group has recognised goodwill of 
$9,278,000.
During the year the Group also paid a Commercial Discovery Bonus (“CDB”) of $3,680,486 ($2,208,292 on 60% consolidation basis) to the 
Kazakhstan Government on completion of the exploration and resource studies associated with the Kounrad waste dumps. The completion 
of this work enabled the resources on site to be registered as part of the Kazakhstan Government official list of resources (‘State Balance’) 
and thereby facilitate their transfer to a mining licence and the subsequent production of copper from the resources. The amount of CDB 
has been capitalised under Mining licences and permits during the year and will be amortised over the remaining life of the mine.
The investment of $3,222,420 in Copper Bay has been classified as an intangible asset and added to Mining licences and permits.
During the year the Group reclassified the Alag Bayan project (Bayanresources LLC) as held for sale and consequently made a full write down 
of the assets held by the subsidiary.
The Company had no intangible assets as at 31 December 2013 (2012: $1,000,000). During the year the Company has reclassified the Alag 
Bayan project to the assets classified as held for sale and consequently fully impaired the asset.
Impairment test for goodwill
The Group currently only has one business segment, namely the Kounrad project located in Kazakhstan. The goodwill associated with this 
project and the Kounrad Transaction will be monitored by management in the future but as at 31 December 2013 the goodwill did not 
require impairment.
The recoverable amount of all CGUs has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow 
projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are 
extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below. The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the 
copper business in which the CGU operates. STRATEGIC

On the acquisition of 100% ownership in KCC, the Kounrad investment, which was previously held in the Company, has been reclassified to 
property, plant and equipment.
The investment in Copper Bay Limited made by the Company has been classified as mining licenses and permits within the intangible assets 
of the Group.
Company
During the year, the Company invested £2 million, equating to $3,222,420, into a UK based company, Copper Bay Limited. The investment 
was to acquire a 50% controlling stake in the entity and its subsidiaries in order to develop an early stage copper tailings project in Chile. The 
funds invested are for the sole purpose of developing the project and the intention is for a pre-feasibility study to be prepared on the project 
during 2014.

20.  Assets held for sale
The Group continues to hold for sale the assets it owns in Mongolia and is actively seeking to sell the Ereen and Handgait projects. The sale 
process is taking far longer than the CAML Board ever anticipated due to the current political and regulatory uncertainties in the country and 
the implications of a court case brought by the Group’s minority partner on the Ereen project.
During the year, Bayanresources LLC (Alag Bayan) was also transferred to this group of assets held for sale following on from the failure to 
acquire a mining licence and the subsequent decision of the CAML Board to dispose of the asset and effectively cease all operations in 
Mongolia. These assets have been written down to nil. Retained liabilities include provisions for decommissioning and site rehabilitation 
estimates and outstanding trade and other payables.
As a consequence of the above, the Company deemed it prudent to write down all of its Mongolian assets during the year. This resulted in a 
total impairment charge of $12,879,357 against the assets and a loss from discontinuing operations for the year ending 31 December 2013 
of $14,149,137 (2012: loss $511,990). 72 CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013

The amounts receivable from related parties is a consequence of the joint venture accounting treatment required at the Kounrad project due to 
the nature of the ownership structure (note 33). The amounts will disappear once the transaction to acquire 100% of the project is completed.
The Group’s main receivable is the VAT incurred on purchases within Kazakhstan. As at 31 December 2013 a total of $5,436,475 (2012: 
$2,047,553) of VAT receivable was still owed to the Group by the Kazakhstan authorities. The Group still remains confident about its 
prospects to recover this outstanding debt and is working closely with its advisers and local partners to achieve this. The planned means of 
recovery will be through a combination of the local sales of cathode copper to effectively offset VAT liabilities and by a successful appeal to 
the authorities. An appeal was lodged on 19 November 2013 by the local tax advisers and the outcome was still pending as at 31 December 
2013. However, as a result of the above and the uncertainty regarding timing, the Group has reclassified the VAT receivable from current  
to non-current.
Management’s policy is to assess all trade and other receivables for recoverability on a regular basis. A provision is made where doubt exists 
and amounts are fully written off when information comes to light that the amounts due will not be recovered. 
Please refer to note 3 for information on aging of trade and other receivables.

for the year ended 31 December 201 3
The par value of Ordinary Shares is $0.01 per share (2012: $0.01) and all shares are fully paid. During 2013, the Company did not issue any 
shares not did it repurchase any shares. A share buy-back programme was undertaken in 2012 and a total of 1,318,929 shares were 
purchased between July 2012 and December 2012 at a value weighted average price of 93.059 pence. A total of $1,982,677 was spent on 
the purchases during 2012. These shares were held in Treasury as at 31 December 2013 pending their cancellation or possible use in the 
Company employee share scheme.
During the year, the Company completed a court approved capital reduction scheme, which resulted in an amount of $61,431,533 being 
transferred from the share premium account to distributable reserves. A condition of the capital reduction scheme was to set aside an amount 
(into a restricted bank account), which would cover all creditors as of the effective date of the capital reduction (1 August 2013). To fulfill this 
condition, the Company set aside £1 million (approximately $1.6 million), which primarily represented the allowance to KR as part of the 
Kounrad Transaction. The majority of the money in the restricted account would be released upon the completion of the Kounrad Transaction.

On 21 October 2013, the Group completed the transfer from KR to the Group of an additional 40% of Kounrad Copper Company LLP taking 
its ownership to 100%. This transfer forms part of overall transaction (the “Kounrad Transaction”). The Company agreed to issue 15,336,096 
ordinary shares in the Company as consideration for the 40% interest in KCC albeit the shares would only be issued once the whole Kounrad 
Transaction was completed (note 33).
As at 31 December 2013, the Kounrad Transaction had not been fully completed as the transfer of the 40% in the subsoil use contract were 
still awaiting Government approval. Consequently, the shares were not issued as at 31 December 2013 and have been classified as a 
contingent equity consideration.
26.  Equity settled share based payments
The Company provides additional rewards to staff, in addition to their salaries and annual discretionary bonuses, through the granting of 
share options in the Company. The Company effectively has two such option schemes in place, the Old Scheme and the New Scheme.
Old Scheme
The first share option plan was introduced by the Company in February 2008 and initially had an exercise price of $6.42. On the recommendation 
of the Remuneration Committee the exercise price for the participants was reduced to $0.68 in February 2010 to reflect the changed economic 
circumstances of the Company and maintain some form of incentive for staff. Only those staff still employed by the Group at this time 
benefited from this decision and those participants who had left the Group maintained an exercise price of $6.42 on their options. The vesting 
of share options in the plan is purely conditional upon time served by the participant and as at 31 December 2013 all options have fully vested.
New Scheme
The second share option plan was introduced by the Company in October 2011. This scheme has an exercise price of effectively nil for the 
participants. The nil-cost share options granted under this scheme vest on the basis of a third annually depending on the achievement by 
the Group and the participant of the performance targets as determined by the CAML Remuneration Committee. Under a separate 
Non-Executive share option plan 2012, Nurlan Zhakupov was granted 100,000 nil-cost options in 2012 which vest on the basis of a third 
annually, without any performance conditions due to his Non-Executive role.
As at 31 December 2013, a total of 520,086 Old Scheme options and 2,082,974 New Scheme options (including those issued to Nurlan 
Zhakupov) were outstanding. Share options are granted to Directors and selected employees. The exercise price of the granted options is 
presented in the table below for every grant. In general, options vest in 1/3 tranches over three-year period. The Company has the option but 
not the legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash. STRATEGIC

were cash settled at the spot price on the date, and resulted in total cash consideration paid of $345,748 (2012: $125,785). The related 
weighted average share price at the time of exercise was $1.92 (2012: $1.52) per share.
An amount of $1,588,116 (2012: $504,601) has been credited to the share option reserve for the grant of stock options for the period ending

In respect of the period between the date an award is issued and the date it is exercised the number of shares covered by such awards is

Employee Benefit Trust
An Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) was set up by the Company during 2009 as a means of incentivising the senior management of CAML prior 
to the Initial Public Offering (IPO). All of the shares awarded as part of the EBT scheme vested on the successful completion of the IPO on 
30 September 2010.
A total of 2,534,688 Ordinary Shares were initially issued as part of the arrangements in December 2009 followed by a further issue of 
853,258 in September 2010. The shares were issued at the exercise price of $0.68 which was the best estimate of the Company’s valuation 
at the time. Details of the awards are contained in note 35.
Restatement
At the time that the EBT scheme was organised, an amount was set aside in the Company’s reserves based on a Black Scholes valuation 
model. During the year the Company decided that this initial approach was incorrect and that the value of the reserve should have been 
aligned with the scheme share valuation of $0.68. Consequently, the Company has adjusted the reserve to reflect this change which has 
resulted in an additional charge to the reserve of $1,383,594.

As at 31 December 2013, the main liabilities of the Group are the Corporate Income tax liability at Kounrad for the 12 months ending 
31 December 2013. The Group made a net provision for this liability of $8,367,253 (2012: $4,271,306) having paid an amount of $1,302,000 
in advance in December 2013.
The Company provided $1,011,446 as an allowance for the accrued dividend on the 15,336,096 shares payable to KR as part of the 
completion of the Kounrad Transaction. The dividend associated with the remaining 5,875,655 shares for the outstanding 40% transfer of 
the subsoil use contract of the Kounrad project has been classified as a contingent liability (note 30).

30. Contingencies
 As at 31 December 2013, the Group had a contingent liability related to the Kounrad Transaction of £235,026, equivalent to $387,511. This is 
based on the value of the 2013 interim dividend of 4 pence per share which was paid in November 2013 and the agreed consideration of 
5,875,655 ordinary shares in the Company for the transfer of the subsoil use contract as part of the Kounrad Transaction. As this element of 
the Kounrad Transaction had not been completed as at 31 December 2013 it is considered to be a contingent liability and the amount will 
only be paid on completion of the whole Kounrad Transaction.

32. Dividend per share
The Company announced a dividend policy on 13 December 2012. In line with that policy, the Company paid $14,306,000 in 2013 which 
consisted of a special dividend of 3.7 pence per share and an annual dividend for 2012 of 7 pence per share.
In November 2013, an amount of $5,432,584 was paid representing a 2013 interim dividend of 4 pence per share. The final dividend in 
respect of the year ended 31 December 2013 of 5 pence per share will be recommended at the forthcoming Annual General meeting (AGM).
33. Business combination
On 27 June 2013, the Company announced a new framework agreement (the “Agreement”) for the acquisition of the remaining 40% of the 
Kounrad Project. The Agreement superseded the previous arrangements with SAT and more details on the background and history to the 
Kounrad Project ownership changes can be found within the Chief Executive Officer’s Statement within the Strategic Report.
The Agreement will result in CAML obtaining control over the Kounrad Project in two transactions:
▲ ▲ The first transaction (“KCC Transaction”) was effected by the transfer of the remaining 40% share capital of KCC from SAT to Mr Kenges 
Rakishev (“KR”), followed by the subsequent transfer to CAML ’s wholly owned subsidiary CAML Kazakhstan BV (“CAML BV”), which was 
registered on 21 October 2013.
▲ ▲ The second transaction (“SUC Transaction”) will be effected by the transfer of the remaining 40% economic interest in the subsoil use 
contract (“SUC”) from SAT to KR, followed by a subsequent transfer to CAML ’s wholly owned subsidiary SK. The transfer to KR and then 
to SK remained outstanding as at 31 December 2013.
The agreed purchase consideration consists of 21,211,751 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (“CAML Shares”) and an 
entitlement to a cash payment in lieu of any benefits to which KR might have been entitled to had the CAML Shares been issued to KR on 
the transfer of the KCC interest to CAML BV, rather than on completion, capped at £904,120. In March 2014 the parties to the Agreement 
recognised that an amount of £848,470 had accrued under this entitlement, and agreed that a further entitlement capped at £1.1 million 
would accrue to KR. The parties have also agreed to change the longstop date from 31 March 2014 to 30 June 2014. The above cash 
entitlements are only payable to KR upon the completion of the Kounrad Transaction.
The CAML Shares will be allocated in two tranches, with one tranche of 15,336,096 Ordinary Shares (72.3% of the CAML Shares) for the 
transfer of the 40% share capital of KCC to CAML BV (the “CAML Shares 1”). The remaining 5,875,655 Ordinary Shares (27.7% of the CAML 
Shares) for the transfer of the 40% economic interest in the SUC to SK (the “CAML Shares 2”).
As part of the Agreement, KR was to be appointed to the CAML Board and this was duly completed on 9 December 2013. 78 CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
for the year ended 31 December 201 3
Status of ownership changes as at 31 December 2013
The transfer of the 40% interest of KCC to the Group was registered on 21 October 2013. The SUC Transaction remains outstanding as at 
the year end, pending receipt of the relevant waiver of the pre-emptive rights and approvals of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
The submission of the relevant documentation for the waivers and approvals to facilitate the transfer to SK was submitted to the relevant 
authorities on 6 March 2013.
The Agreement stipulated that the whole transaction would be completed by the longstop date of 31 March 2014. At a CAML Board 
meeting in March 2014, KR indicated that this would not be possible but that a revised longstop date of 30 June 2014 would be achieved. 
On 28 March 2014, the Company announced the extension to the longstop date.
Upon the completion of both the KCC Transaction and the SUC Transaction there will result in a change in control of the Kounrad Project 
from joint control to control by CAML. As such an IFRS 3 “Business Combination” will be deemed to have taken place upon completion.  
The nature of the Kounrad project is such that both KCC and the SUC are interlinked and neither could operate in isolation effectively or 
commercially. Consequently, it is also felt by management that the acquisition of each entity can be considered to form the parts of a single 
business combination.
Whilst the SUC Transaction was not complete at 31 December 2013, and will not be accounted for until such time as it is complete, it is 
apparent from their inter-dependency that both transactions fall under the scope of IFRS 3.
KCC Transaction
Consequently, in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”, the Group recognized the acquired assets and liabilities based upon their 
fair values. Management made a preliminary assessment on a provisional basis at the time of the completion but recognise that they may 
be required to reassess these values within 12 months from the date of acquisition should a material change arise. Any revisions to the 
provisional values will be reflected as of the acquisition date.
The following table summarises the consideration paid for KCC, the fair value of assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

Deferred tax liabilities (note 36) (9,278)
Total identifiable net assets 31,143
Purchase consideration 40,421
Provisional goodwill 9,278
Goodwill arising on acquisition comprises $9,278,000 being the amount, calculated in accordance with IFRS, to recognise a deferred tax 
liability on the difference between the provisional fair value of newly consolidated assets and liabilities and their tax base. The goodwill is not 
deductible for tax purposes.
The fair value of the 15,336,096 Ordinary Shares promised as part of the consideration paid for the 40% share capital of KCC was 
determined based on the published share price on the date of registration, 21 October 2013. An equity instrument of $39,408,839 was  
recognised within other reserves recorded by the Group to recognise its promise to issue the shares on completion of the Kounrad 
Transaction. A further amount of $1,011,446 in lieu of the agreement to pay the interim dividend to KR was accrued within the Group and 
Company liabilities (note 27).

CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 79
The Group recognised a gain of $27,835,000 as a result of measuring at fair value its 60% equity interest in KCC held before the business 
combination. The gain is included in other income, as a line item “Gain on re-measuring to fair value the existing interests in KCC on 
acquisition of control”, in the Group’s income statement for the year ended 31 December 2013. The fair value uplift applied to the assets 
acquired as part of the transaction has all been applied to the plant and equipment of KCC resulting in an uplift of $46,392,000 to the 
carrying value.
The revenue included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since registration of the transfer of the 40% interest in KCC 
on 21 October 2013 and contributed by KCC was $20,183,301. KCC also contributed profit of $10,265,727 over the same period.
Had KCC been consolidated from 1 January 2013, the consolidated statement of income would show pro-forma revenue of $72,186,537 and 
profit of $49,836,183.
SUC Transaction – not completed as at 31 December 2013
Given that the SUC Transaction had not been completed at the year end, it continues to be accounted for as a jointly controlled asset. The 
acquisition of the remaining 40% economic interest in the SUC will also be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 once completion occurs. 
This is expected during the first half of 2014.
As at 31 December 2013, It was estimated that a gain of $14,052,000 would have been recognised as a result of measuring at fair value the 
Group’s 60% economic interest in the SUC held prior to the business combination had it occurred at that date. As with the KCC Transaction, 
this will be recognised in other income in the Group’s income statement on the date of completion.
34.  Events after the reporting period
KZT devaluation
On 11 February 2014 Kazakhstan’s Central Bank decided to stop supporting the Tenge exchange rate and decrease currency interventions. 
As a result, the exchange rate of the Tenge (KZT) depreciated to 185 KZT for 1 US dollar (USD), approximately 20% compared to the rate 
used for 31 December 2013 accounting purposes.
Whilst no adjustment to the accounts has been made to reflect this devaluation, it is worth noting that the impact on the results as at 
31 December 2013 was an effective reduction in the Kazakhstan corporate income tax (CIT) and mineral extraction tax (MET) liability of 
approximately $1.9 million based on the revised exchange rate offset by an effective reduction in the outstanding VAT receivable balance  
of approximately $1 million.
At the Group level it is also worth noting that the devaluation will impact on the net asset position of the Group in future reporting periods.  
A devaluation impact on the net assets of $41.9 million denominated in KZT as at 31 December 2013 is 20% or $8.4 million.
Kounrad Transaction
Whilst the SUC Transaction remained outstanding at the year end, the submission of the relevant documentation for the waivers and 
approvals for the transfer to SK was submitted to the relevant authorities on 6 March 2014.
In March 2014 the parties to the Agreement recognised that an amount of £848,470 had accrued under the original cash entitlement, and 
that a further entitlement capped at £1.1 million could accrue to KR. The parties have also agreed to change the longstop date from 
31 March 2014 to 30 June 2014. The above cash entitlements are only payable to KR upon the completion of the Kounrad Transaction.
Whilst the SUC Transaction was not complete at 31 December 2013, and will not be accounted for until such time as it is complete, it is 
apparent from their inter-dependency that both transactions fall under the scope of IFRS 3 (notes 2 and 33).
35. Related party transactions
The Group had the following related party balances and transactions during the year ended 31 December 2013. Related parties are those 
entities owned or controlled by the Company, which is the ultimate controlling party of the Group.

Deferred tax liabilities (272) (9,457) 11 66 (9,652)
Deferred tax liability, net (272) (9,457) 11 66 (9,652)
A deferred tax liability of $9.3 million has been recognised in respect of the Kounrad Copper Company LLP acquisition that occurred in the 
year (2012: nil). The net assets of KCC were recognised in the consolidated financial statements at their fair values at the date of acquisition. 
The tax base of the individual assets and liabilities remains the same as the pre-acquisition tax base as the transaction is considered to be 
non-taxable. A taxable temporary difference arises as a result of the acquisition of the long term assets where the carrying amount is 
increased to fair value at the date of acquisition but its tax base remains at cost.
The deferred tax liability arising from this taxable temporary difference is recognised in the consolidated financial statements to reflect the 
future tax consequences of recovering the long term assets recognised at fair value. The resulting deferred tax liability affects goodwill.
Where the realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent on future profits, the Group recognises losses carried forward and other deferred 
tax assets only to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group did not recognise other potential deferred tax assets arising from losses of $4.5 million (2012: $2.1 million) as there is insufficient 
evidence of future taxable profits. Unrecognised losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had other deferred tax assets of $4.9 million (2012: $3.5 million) in respect of the exploration assets pool, 
depreciation, share-based payments and other temporary differences which had not been recognised because of insufficient evidence of 
future taxable profits.
There are no significant unrecognised temporary differences associated with undistributed profits of subsidiaries at 31 December 2013 and 
2012, respectively.
Company
At 31 December 2013 and 2012 respectively, the Company had no recognised deferred tax assets or liabilities.
At 31 December 2013, the Company had not recognised potential deferred tax assets arising from losses of $2.2 million (2012: $1.1 million) 
as there is insufficient evidence of future taxable profits. The losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
At 31 December 2013, the Company had other deferred tax assets of $4.9 million (2012: $3.5 million) in respect of share-based payments

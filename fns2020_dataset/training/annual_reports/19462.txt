Strategic report Governance Financial statements Our business model
How we create value
• Once again, our progress in 2015 has justified our confidence in 
the Regus business model. Rigorous planning, stress-testing and 
constant review clearly demonstrate that it remains fit for purpose.
Our  
business
Customers Returns
Our business comprises four  
fundamental elements: our people,  
our network, our products and our brands. 
The geographic scale of Regus‘ operations  
is unmatched. Critically, as our physical 
network grows, so does our lead over  
other workspace alternatives.
These elements are underpinned by:
 • rigorous planning processes to support 
the execution of our growth strategy;
 • constant investment in innovation  
to differentiate Regus from all 
competitors; and
 • disciplined management procedures  
to minimise the risks inherent in  
rapid growth.
Customers – from self-employed 
entrepreneurs to multinational 
corporations – use Regus because they 
want to be in the best places where they 
can focus on what they are doing. They stay 
because we provide them with an excellent 
service at competitive rates, with a product 
that flexes to meet their every requirement. 
Demand continues to increase – during 
2015, membership grew to over 
2.3m worldwide.
Our approach to investment ensures we 
deliver strong post-tax cash returns, 
generating long-term shareholder value 
through returns on investment that are  
well in excess of our cost of capital.
Our focus is on optimising revenue 
generation through improving the 
performance of each location. This  
gives us the solid foundation we need  
to deliver strong returns, particularly  
when combined with our discipline  
on overhead costs, which continue to  
fall as a percentage of revenues.
How we calculate our returns 
These returns are based on the  
post-tax return divided by the net  
growth capital investment. 
Post-tax cash return = EBITDA less 
amortisation of partner contribution,  
less tax based on EBIT , less maintenance 
capital expenditure. 
Net growth capital investment = 
growth capital less partner contributions.

Investment  
in growth
A particularly attractive feature of the Regus 
business model is our strong conversion of 
profit into cash. The cash flows we generate 
from our locations support a significant 
proportion of our continued investment  
in developing our network. Strong cash 
generation underpins the Group’s 
progressive dividend as well as funding  
the addition of locations to our network.
We invest significant sums in growth,  
both through organic openings and selective 
acquisitions, and we continue to find many 
high-quality opportunities that meet our 
stringent returns criteria. Our network 
growth is enhanced by our continued 
investment in developing new location 
formats and a greater diversity in partner 
relationships. T ogether , these are enabling  
us to grow in a more capital-efficient way. 
Our ability to adapt our growth plans to 
reflect changing market conditions is 
another important aspect of our capability  
to manage risk through the economic cycle. 
With relatively short lead times between 
contracting with a partner and opening  
a new location, depending on where we are  
in the economic cycle we can either rapidly 
capitalise on a favourable investment 
environment, or restrict growth.
We have a progressive dividend policy.  
2015 dividend increased by 13%.

I would like to thank our former CFO, 
Dominique Yates, for his contribution to 
Regus. He leaves us with our balance sheet 
and financial returns looking strong after a 
period of significant expansion. I would also 
like to thank Alex Sulkowski, who retired from 
the Board in May 2015, for his contribution to 
the Board and Group.
An external evaluation of the performance of 
the Board was carried out during the year by 
an independent leadership consultancy. The 
results of the review have been incorporated 
into our efforts to continuously improve the 
processes and effectiveness of the Board.
Our people
Every year , our success is attributable to the 
energy , commitment and skills of our people 
in all the markets where we operate and at 
every level of the organisation. Once again,  
I would like to thank them on behalf of the 
Board for their outstanding contribution, 
delivering another strong set of results for 
the benefit of our customers, our business 
and our investors.
Dividend
We remain committed to a sustainable  
and progressive dividend policy. I am 
therefore pleased to announce that the 
Board is recommending a 13% increase  
in the final dividend to 3.1p per share, 
reflecting the continued strong performance 
of  the business. Subject to the approval  
of shareholders at the 2015 AGM, this  
will be paid on 27 May 2016 to shareholders  
on the register at the close of business  
on 29 April 2016. The full year dividend  
is 4.5p (2014: 4.0p), an increase of 13%.

Chairman’s statement
Another year of  
substantial development
• The Group has completed 
another year of successfully 
implementing its strategy as 
evidenced by delivering both 
strong results and growth.  
We continue to significantly 
expand the network with 
convenient locations and 
innovative formats for our 
customers, while maintaining 
attractive financial returns.
Douglas Sutherland
Chairman
During the period, Group revenues  
grew to £1,927.0m (2014: £1,676.1m), 
representing an increase of 15.9% at 
constant currency (up 15.0% at actual  
rates). Notwithstanding the significant 
growth in the network, underlying operating 
profit advanced 37% at constant currency  
to £144.8m (2014: £104.3m), up 39% at 
actual rates. Including the non-recurring  
gain of £15.3m, our reported statutory 
operating profit was £160.1m, an increase  
of 51% at constant currency.
This strong performance has been delivered 
whilst adding 554 new locations to our 
network and continuing to drive operating 
efficiency , with overheads as a percentage  
of revenue reducing by a further two 
percentage points. Our strong cash 
generation and disciplined approach  
to investment in growth have also enabled  
the Group to maintain a robust and 
conservative capital structure. 
Rigorous risk management
We continue to take a rigorous approach  
to risk management across every aspect  
of our business. A good illustration of this  
is the process we go through to ensure that 
our new locations deliver the challenging 
financial returns that we seek. Every single 
locality goes through a detailed process 
before approval, comparing its anticipated 
performance against what is being achieved 
in comparable locations, the competitive 
environment and considering the maximum 
cash outlay and downside risk just as much  
as upside potential and returns.
Our investment in growth is kept under 
constant review and can be curtailed within  
a short period if market conditions dictate. 
Over time, we are taking an increasingly 
capital-light approach to investment,  
in which we will increasingly become the 
facilitator between the property investor  
and the end customer , with the aim of 
further improving margins and reducing risk.
Board update
We welcomed Dominik de Daniel, our  
new CFO and COO, to our international 
management team and Board in November 
2015 and look forward to his input as we 
continue to deliver on our growth ambitions. 
He is a proven and capable leader who brings 
very relevant experience to Regus’ finance 
and operations teams. 
In May 2015 we welcomed François Pauly  
to the Board as a new Independent 
Non-Executive Director. François’ extensive 
executive and board experience along with 
his international business knowledge is 
already contributing to the continued 
strategic development of Regus. www.regus.com 13

Chief Executive Officer’s review
A high-growth business
• 2015 has been another successful  
year for Regus. We have continued to  
see powerful structural growth drivers in  
our market. More and more organisations 
and individuals are reassessing their 
approach to physical workspace and how 
they work. These positive dynamics have 
seen our business deliver strong underlying 
progress; strategically, operationally, and 
financially. We have added more locations  
to our market-leading network than ever 
before, generated attractive returns on our 
investments and significantly increased our 
profit through further operational efficiency.
Strong financial performance
The post-tax cash return on net growth 
capital expenditure achieved from locations 
opened on or before 31 December 2011  
was 23.1%, an improvement on the returns 
for the same estate in 2014 of 20.9% and  
a level well above our cost of capital. The 
2015 post-tax cash return on investment 
from locations opened on or before 31 
December 2012 was 21.5% (2014: 18.0%).
Group revenue increased by 15.9% at 
constant currency to £1,927.0m (2014: 
£1676.1m) (15.0% at actual rates). 
Underlying operating profit, before the net 
non-recurring gain of £15.3m, increased to 
£144.8m, up 37% at constant currency (39% 
at actual rates). Including the non-recurring 
gain, our statutory operating profit increased 
51% at constant currency to £160.1m  
(up 54% at actual rates).
We invested £284.9m in net growth capital 
expenditure during the year , adding a further 
554 new openings to the network, which stood 
at 2,768 locations at the end of the year.
We generated an increased gross margin  
of 28.3% on all our locations that were open 
on or before 31 December 2012 and also 
improved the gross margin on those 
locations that were added to the network 
during 2013 and 2014, both of which were 
material years of growth and consequently 
represent an increasingly significant  
element of our overall revenue. The initial 
performance of the locations added to  
the network during 2015 is in line with our 
expectations, albeit these are still at an  
early stage of progression towards  
financial maturity. 
Through detailed planning and strengthening 
our controls and processes, we have delivered 
improved operational effectiveness of  
our business, with a further reduction in 
overheads as a percentage of revenues.  
T otal Group overheads were up only 2%  
at constant currency compared to a 22% 
increase in the size of our network. As a result, 
total overheads as a percentage of revenues 
further reduced from 16.7% to 14.7%. 
Cash conversion remains a strong feature  
of our business model. Cash generated before 
investment in growth, dividends and share 
repurchases, and excluding the £80m net 
proceeds arising from the disposal of various 
portfolios of property assets in the first quarter , 
increased 23% to £215.7m (2014: £175.6m). 
After taking the net growth capital expenditure 
of £284.9m and disposal proceeds into 
account, and after paying dividends of £38.8m 
and spending approximately £32.0m buying 
our own shares, Group net debt increased 
from £138.0m at 31 December 2014 to 
£190.6m at 31 December 2015. This 
represents a Group net debt : EBITDA  
leverage ratio of 0.66  times, which is  
well below our internal 1.5 times limit and  
reflects our continued prudent approach  
to the Group’s capital structure.
Americas
Our Americas business achieved a good 
performance and is a key growth region  
in absolute terms. In total we had 1,140 
locations in the region at the end of 
December 2015. On a like-for-like basis 
mature revenues increased 3.9% at  
constant currency to £712.1m (up 7.9%  
at actual rates) with an average mature 
occupancy of 83.0% (2014: 79.1%).  
During the year we added 180 locations  
to the Americas network, expanding the 
business into more parts of the region.  
This expansion increased the average 
number of available workstations from 
131,665 to 149,414, with a total of 165, 464  
at the period end. 
In the Americas, the USA is our predominant 
market. It has performed well and we have 
made good progress expanding into 
secondary and tertiary markets on variable 
lease deals and increasing the range of price 
points by expanding the number of formats  
being offered. Mexico has remained a good 
market and after recent economic issues  
we have seen an improvement in our 
business in Brazil. 
EMEA
The reported revenues of our EMEA 
business have been impacted by the 
appreciation of sterling against the euro. 
Mature revenues on a constant currency 
basis increased 5.5% to £321.2m but  
were down 5.8% at actual rates.  
Occupancy on the Mature business 
increased from 77.6% to 79.4%. During 
2015 we added 183 new locations, taking  
the total number of locations to 736, and 
added Iraq to the network. The average 
number of workstations increased from 
61,274 to 77,901. At period end we had 
82,491 workstations. 
We have experienced strong growth in  
the incredibly diverse region of the Middle 
East and Africa. In Europe, across the  
many countries in which we operate,  
there has been a mixture of performance, 
but the overall result has been good. We 
have experienced an improved performance  
in Spain, whereas Russia has been a difficult 
market requiring the renegotiation of rental 
An excellent year in the 
development of our business. 
Our financial results are strong 
and we remain in robust 
financial health. We continue  
to find attractive opportunities 
to build out our global network 
and service the structural 
changes in the world of work.

Asia Pacific
Our Asia Pacific business continues to  
move forward and has been our fastest 
growth region overall, with 146 new locations 
being added including our first centre in 
Brunei. In total we had 545 locations in the 
region. Mature revenues increased 3.9%  
to £239.1m at constant currency (up 3.7%  
at actual rates) with an average mature 
occupancy of 85.4% (2014: 78.9%) driven  
by growth in lower relative REVPOW 
markets. The average number of 
workstations increased from 58,911 to 
78,571. At the end of the period we had 
91,887 workstations, making it our second 
largest region.
There remains ample opportunity for  
growth in Asia Pacific both from building  
out in existing countries and adding new 
ones, like Brunei. We have continued to 
expand our business in China, which has  
not experienced any impact from the recent 
economic slowdown. We remain watchful 
however , and look to drive growth in 
secondary and tertiary areas using  
capital-light deals.

performance. Mature revenues advanced 
3.7% to £352.9m with mature occupancy  
at 81.1% (2014: 83.7%). With growth in the 
UK in recent years driven primarily through 
acquisitions, which started to feed into the 
Mature business in 2015, this is a good 
revenue improvement. The number of 
occupied workstations has remained  
very stable, but during 2015 expansions 
our competitors in our speed of expansion, 
increasing operational efficiency and the 
relevance and quality of our service offering. 
As part of our investment case we are 
constantly striving to improve our business 
and future potential returns. Whilst this is  
an ongoing process, we have recently 
implemented two important changes.
We have changed the field structure to 
introduce a clustering approach to the  
local management of locations. This has 
improved the cost structure of the  
business going forward and will lead to  
higher productivity. With the in-field  
selling resource now focused on a specific 
number of locations, we believe this will 
better promote the active marketing of  
the whole range of what is offered by the 
entire cluster , including format and price 
point. So, as well as improving operational 
leverage, this structural change also has the 
potential to deliver incremental revenues. 
The other important change we have 
implemented is to improve the compensation 
basis for location managers. Under the 
previous system bonuses consisted primarily 
of sales commissions. This has now been 
replaced by a quarterly profit share bonus 
scheme that better aligns rewards within  
the business with the interests of our 
shareholders. We have, however , retained  
the requirement to improve customer 
service, as measured by a Net Promoter 
Score, and reward export sales to locations 
outside of the manager’s cluster.
T oday, our return on investment is highly 
attractive, our cash flow is strong, and  
we have a proven, successful growth  
story that has seen us significantly develop 
our network over the past two years while 
continuing to deliver consistently strong 
returns. 2015 saw us hit many key 
milestones, as we added a record 554 
locations across the world to bring the  
total space under our management to over 
46 million square feet, entered Brunei, our 
106th national market, celebrated 20 years  
in China and 10 in India, opened our 500th 
centre in Asia Pacific and our 1,000th  
centre in North America (United States  
and Canada). 
We continued to differentiate our 
proposition, with the launch of services  
and benefits including the new Spaces 
(targeting creative workers) and Signature 
workspace formats, the continued growth  
of Regus Express in more airports, railway 
stations and shopping malls around the 
world, access to 18 million Wi-Fi hotspots 
and 800 airside lounges and our new 
community app. Importantly, we 
Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
increased the available inventory in the 
Mature business by 3%, which largely 
accounts for the occupancy reduction. 
During 2015, 45 new locations were added  
in the UK taking the total number of 
locations to 347. We are now seeing more 
growth in regional locations in the UK to 
complement our presence in the major 
cities. T otal average workstations increased 
from 60,037 to 65,721 with 70,956 at the 
year-end.
We also opened our first co-working  
Spaces location in Oxford Street. After  
only six months this has proved a popular 
format and location and has achieved  
strong occupancy and good margins.
Market context
2015 was a very significant year in the 
development of Regus. The change we  
have seen over the past two years has  
been remarkable, as an increasing number  
of businesses – from large corporations  
to entrepreneurial start-ups – have come  
to recognise the power of flexible workspace 
in helping them maximise the positive 
impact of new technologies and  
transform performance. 
Increasing awareness of our industry, 
coupled with shortening company and 
project lifecycles, is leading customers to 
distribute their workforces and service their 
customers in new ways that drive efficiency 
and reduced costs.

strengthened our business with the 
appointment of senior executives to bring 
additional energy, experience and intellect to 
our leadership teams.
Strategic direction
Despite our existing market leadership 
we have scope for significant growth.  
Our future is therefore about realising  
that potential, both in larger markets like 
China, India and the US, where we see the 
potential for a combined total of over 9,500 
locations (up from over 1,000 today), and in 
our most developed networks, such as the 
UK where we have 347 locations and see 
significant scope for further expansion. 
In doing so, we want to ensure that we  
can provide a solution for customers with 
every potential budget. We are focused on 
capturing the growth opportunity we have 
and realising the potential of the business, 
thereby generating significant value for 
shareholders as we move towards a potential 
20,000 locations. Effective planning, strong 
partnerships and product innovation will be 
the key factors in attaining this goal.
Planning
Business planning is critical as we go 
forwards. The simpler our business is to 
operate, ensuring that our people can get  
it right 100 per cent of the time, the more 
efficiently we can roll it out. As we enter the 
next stage of growth, we have developed  
a more sophisticated approach to planning, 
while keeping it simple, effective and fully 
aligned with our business goals. 
T oday , planning at Regus revolves entirely 
around defining and meeting customer  
needs through factors such as format,  
service portfolio and price point. Our approach 
is therefore structured, transparent, focused 
on the detail and planned at every level. As  
a result, we understand what we want to 
achieve, the risks involved and how to  
mitigate those risks.
Partnerships
Adding 554 locations during 2015 involved 
opening more than two every working day 
throughout the year. This is why we are 
further industrialising our approach to 
growth while keeping a very firm hand  
on risk.
We already have a very successful  
growth story. By changing the mix of 
formats, segments, markets and models  
and by streamlining our methodology 
through careful planning and automation 
within a new network of shared service 
centres, we can grow in a far more capital-
efficient way. Increasingly, by partnering 
more with the companies that own and fund  
real estate, we bring together investors  
in property and our fast-growing global 
customer base and continue to generate 
attractive returns on our investments. 
Products and innovation
Our business is based on the understanding 
that physical space needs to keep up with 
changes in technology. For this reason,  
we have invested a substantial amount  
in R&D during the past three years, building  
a world-class technical infrastructure and  
an array of apps and services. 
We will also continue to add to our line-up  
of formats that deliver a bespoke workspace 
environment to different parts of the 
addressable market, including the  
Spaces, Signature Group, OpenOffice,  
KORA and Express formats. 
T aking this approach means that we can 
support any organisation’s office needs, 
anywhere in the world. We provide a truly 
global and fast-growing network, with the 
right offer at the right price, in which it is  
easy to buy space for as little as a few hours 
or for several years. As part of this, we make 
best-of-breed products and services easily 
accessible to every member of the 
workforce, wherever they are and  
whatever their requirements. 
As we move ahead, we will have partnerships 
and alliances in place, building on those  
we already have with the likes of Microsoft, 
Google and Polycom, to bring customers 
those things that they cannot get for 
themselves. We will help customers  
become more productive, faster than  
ever before. In addition, we will increasingly 
provide the means for them to extract  
added value from their relationship with 
Regus, by collaborating, promoting their 
products and services to one another  
and participating in shared communities.
2016 outlook 
We remain confident in our business  
model and the long-term structural drivers 
of our industry. We will continue to invest  
to increase our levels of customer service, 
make our business relevant to a wider 
market, drive greater operational efficiency 
and deliver long-term shareholder value.  
We will continue to adhere to our strict 
financial criteria in executing our growth 
plans and remain suitably vigilant given the 
current global macroeconomic uncertainty, 
with flexibility in both our expansion plans 
and our cost base. Current trading is in line 
with management’s expectations and we 
remain confident in our prospects for 2016.

Our strategic objectives and key performance indicators
Our strategy is clear and simple
• Revenue growth achieved through the addition of new locations, the development  
of incremental revenue streams and active management of the existing network to  
drive efficiency, contributes to improvements in gross profit. Combined with strong overhead 
cost control, this drives operating profit and cash flow, generating strong  
returns on investment well ahead of the Group’s cost of capital.
Growth is demand-led as we respond to customers looking to outsource more of  
their workplace needs and/or benefit from the flexibility and convenience we provide.  
By expanding our networks and developing our growing range of formats, we expand  
our addressable audience and provide our existing customers with additional convenience.  
It is important to remember that our locations perform well in their own right and that the 
network then provides incremental opportunities.
We continue to be mindful of growing only in locations where the potential investment 
opportunity meets our stringent returns criteria.
We are also focused on increased partnering and using more capital-efficient  
ways of expanding the network.

Innovation is core to Regus’ strategy and allows us to maintain our market-leading position 
and customer service. We invest in R&D to ensure we stay on top of (and even help shape) 
trends, by developing location formats, products and services that meet our customers’ 
needs and help them work more conveniently, efficiently and effectively. New product 
development provides existing customers with additional reasons to use Regus and  
also opens up new revenue opportunities.
Cost control is achieved through operational excellence and the significant economies  
of scale and operational leverage that network growth brings.

Key performance indicators How we did Future ambitions and risks
Delivering profitable growth and strong, 
sustainable returns is central to creating future 
shareholder value. Regus is committed to 
delivering these returns by optimising revenue 
development and controlling costs. Our post-
2011 investments are progressing as expected.
We will continue to add breadth and convenience  
to the network through further measured 
investment in high-quality assets, across our 
range of formats, with the potential for attractive 
returns for shareholders. We are also focused on 
developing our range of location formats. As of 22 
February 2016 we had visibility over approximately 
£100m of net growth capital expenditure for 
2016, representing some 300 locations.
We will continue to control overheads to deliver 
further economies of scale, notwithstanding 
continued and significant investments made  
in the business to develop the network and  
our operating platform, processes and people.
We will continue our investment in R&D as the 
Group focuses on customer requirements and 
developing appropriate  offerings to satisfy their 
needs, thereby increasing the reasons to do 
business with Regus. We believe this provides a 
key point of differentiation for Regus.

approximately £100m, representing 
approximately 300 locations and 4m sq ft  
of additional space. 
Every potential investment is rigorously 
evaluated by our internal Investment 
Committee and has to meet our stringent 
financial hurdles before being approved.  
This is a process to which we apply maximum 
focus, given how critical the original decision 
is to our ultimate success.
Operational developments
We are constantly striving to improve our 
business and future potential returns. Whilst 
this is an ongoing process, we have recently 
implemented changes to the operational  
field structure, introducing a cluster approach 
to the management and organisation of our 
locations. With the in-field selling resource 
focused on a specific number of locations, we 
believe this will better promote the active 
marketing of the whole range of what is 
offered by the entire cluster , including format 
and price point. Moreover , the unrivalled  
scale of our business provides us with the 
opportunity to automate more processes  
to allow our employees to have greater focus 
on customer service across more than one 
location. We believe this will generate many 
positives for our business, including improved 
cost efficiency in the field, better productivity 
and a sharper focus on ‘selling the cluster’  
to unlock the full benefit of our broad offering. 
We have also implemented important 
changes to the compensation structure  
for our colleagues operating our locations by 
moving away from a largely sales 
commission-based bonus system to one 
based on financial performance. We believe 
this will be important and better align business 
behaviour with the interests of our 
shareholders. 
Non-recurring items
As previously disclosed, during the first 
quarter of 2015 we completed the sale  
of various portfolios of property assets 
acquired during 2014. The disposal raised 
£84m of cash before expenses and resulted  
in a non-recurring profit of £21.3m after 
expenses. During the second half two 
non-recurring items, relating to a litigation 
action in California and the Competition  
and Markets Authority’s review of the 
acquisition of Avanta in the UK, reduced  
the overall net gain by £6m to £15.3m.
While these items have had a significant 
impact on our 2015 results, except  
where specifically mentioned the following 
commentary and profit and loss analysis 
excludes the overall profit impact from  
these non-recurring items.
Chief Financial Officer’s review
Strong growth in network  
and attractive returns
• 2015 has been another 
successful year in delivering 
against our strategy of 
achieving strong returns on 
investment. Good business 
performance and overhead 
control are driving these 
improved returns.
Dominik de Daniel
Chief Financial Officer and  
Chief Operating Officer
during 2012 (which are not yet fully financially 
mature), the Group delivered a post-tax cash 
return of 21.5%  in respect of all locations 
opened on or before 31 December 2012  
(the equivalent return for the 12 months  
to 31 December 2014 on the same estate 
was 18.0%).
This strong performance reflects the 
underlying progress of the business as our 
locations mature, as well as our continued 
focus on efficiency and productivity, and  
the economies of scale on overheads that 
we enjoy as the Group continues to grow. 
The chart below also shows the status of  
our centre openings by year of opening,  
with pleasing progress in the development  
of returns for centres added in 2012 and 
2013 as they continue to progress towards 
full maturity.
Developing the network
During 2015, we invested £284.9m of  
net growth capital expenditure, adding  
a further 554 locations to the network. 
These locations added approximately  
7.7m sq ft, taking the Group’s total space 
globally to over 46m sq ft as at 31 December 
2015. In 2014 we invested net growth  
capital expenditure of £206.6m, adding  
452 locations, the equivalent of 5.7m sq ft  
of space. We remain confident that the 
returns from these investments will, in  
due course, be in line with the returns we 
generate on our historic investments.  
This investment in developing our network 
continues to increase the depth and breadth 
of our geographic scope, thereby building 
further resilience into the business.
We continue to have a good pipeline of new 
openings. As of 22 February we had visibility 
on net capital expenditure so far for 2016 of 
Return on investment
The focus of our strategy remains on  
driving returns that achieve our post-tax  
cash payback criteria, which typically is  
within four years. For the 12 months to  
31 December 2015, the Group delivered  
a post-tax cash return of 23.1% in respect  
of locations opened on or before 31 
December 2011 (up from 20.9% on the same 
estate for the 12 months to 31 December 
2014). Incorporating the centres opened

Revenue
Group revenues increased 15.9% at 
constant currency to £1,927.0m (2014: 
£1,676.1m), an increase of 15.0% at actual 
rates. This strong improvement reflects 
good underlying like-for-like growth as well 
as the contribution from additional locations. 
Mature revenues (from 1,771 like-for-like 
locations added on or before 31 December 
2013) grew a healthy 4.3% at constant 
currency to £1,628.2m (2014: £1,572.5m), 
up 3.5% at actual rates. Mature occupancy 
was 82.4% (2014: 79.6%).
Gross profit
Group gross profit improved 12% at 
constant currency rates to £428.4m  
(2014: £383.1m), up 12% at actual rates.  
The slight reduction in Group gross margin 
from 22.9% to 22.2% reflects the dilution 
from a relatively large number of immature 
locations resulting from the significant 
investment in growing the network over 
recent years (see table below). The  
mature gross margin improved from  
24.6% to 26.7%.

Continued improved  
overhead efficiency
As anticipated, the Group has made further 
strong progress in relation to overhead 
efficiency , thereby building on the progress 
achieved in recent years. We have benefited 
from our investment in management, 
systems and processes. As a consequence,  
in spite of significant growth, total overheads 
(including R&D expenditure) grew only 2%  
at constant currency to £283.9m (up 2% at 
actual rates). As a percentage of revenues, 
total overheads declined from 16.7% in 2014 
to 14.7% in 2015. We continue to maintain  
a strong focus on overhead discipline and 
anticipate further scale benefits.
Investment in R&D increased 18% from 
£8.7m in 2014 to £10.3m for 2015.
Operating profit  
(excluding non-recurring items)
As a result of the strong control of 
overheads, the incremental gross profit 
almost completely falls through to augment 
the Group operating profit, which increased 
37% at constant currency to £144.8m 
(2014: £104.3m) (up 39% at actual rates). 
Consequently, the underlying Group 
operating margin increased from 6.2% in 
2014 to 7.5% in 2015.
Net finance costs
Notwithstanding the increase in net  
debt from an opening position of £138.0m 
to £190.6m, the Group’s net finance costs 
decreased from £17.2m to £14.4m, 
reflecting strong treasury discipline and  
a favourable foreign exchange movement  
on inter-company balances compared with 
2014. During 2015 the Group incurred the 
additional cost of the €210m Schuldschein 
debt security which we issued in May 2014, 
but this was largely offset through subsequent 
lower utilisation of the Revolving Credit Facility. 
Within the overall net finance costs, the 
Group also incurred a notional, non-cash, 
interest charge of £1.6m (2014: £2.0m) 
relating to the accounting treatment of fair 
value adjustments on various acquisitions 
made in past years. In addition there were 
also other non-cash costs of £1.4m (2014: 
£1.3m) relating to the amortisation of upfront 
charges on the establishment of our various 
borrowing facilities. 
T ax 
The underlying effective tax rate for the year 
was 19.9%. The Group’s reported tax rate 
was 17.7% (2014: 19.7%). 
Earnings per share 
Statutory Group earnings per share 
increased significantly to 12.8p (2014: 7.4p). 
Excluding the positive contribution from  
the non-recurring items, underlying Group 
earnings per share increased 51% to 11.2p, 
reflecting the strong growth in underlying 
Group operating profit.
The weighted average number of shares  
in issue for the year was 933,457,741  
(2014: 944,081,638). The weighted  
average number of shares for diluted 
earnings per share was 953,678,034 (2014: 
972,814,973). During the year , the Group 
purchased 9,543,800 shares at a cost of 
approximately £24.5m designated to be  
held in treasury to satisfy future exercises 
under various Group long-term incentive 
schemes. Over the same period, the Group 
reissued 1,936,642 shares from treasury  
to satisfy such exercises.  20 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Cash flow and funding
The ability to generate cash is an attractive 
feature of our business model and Group 
cash generation continues to be strong. 
Cash generated before the investment  
in growth capital expenditure, dividends  
and share repurchases, and excluding the 
exceptional £80m disposal proceeds after 
expenses, increased 23% in 2015 to 
£215.7m (2014: £175.6m), reflecting the 
strong growth in underlying Group operating 
profit and very strong cash conversion.
Group net debt increased from £138.0m  
at 31 December 2014 to £190.6m at 31 
December 2015. This increase comes after 
taking the growth capital expenditure and 
disposal proceeds into account, and after 
paying dividends of £38.8m and spending 
approximately £32.0m on a combination of 
buying our own shares as a further hedge 
against the cost of the exercise of options by 
our employees across our various option  
and L TIP plans, and cash-settling  
the exercise of some of those options.  
This represents an underlying Group net 
debt : EBITDA leverage ratio of 0.66 times, 
which is well below our internal 1.5 times limit 
and reflects our continued prudent approach 
to the Group’s capital structure.
During the period, we extended and amended 
our key £320m Revolving Credit Facility , which 
is now committed until 2020 and which has 
further improved our debt maturity profile.

this decreased reported revenue and gross

however , operating profit increased by 
£1.9m compared to last year.
Chief Financial Officer’s review continued
T ogether with the Schuldschein debt security 
which we issued last year , the Group has 
adequate financial headroom to continue  
to execute on its strategy.

Dividends
Consistent with Regus’ progressive dividend 
policy and subject to shareholder approval, 
we will increase the final dividend for 2015  
by approximately 13% to 3.1p (2014: 2.75p). 
This will be paid on Friday, 27 May 2016, to 
shareholders on the register at the close  
of business on Friday 29 April 2016. This 
represents an increase in the full year 
dividend of approximately 13%, taking  
it from 4.0p for 2014 to 4.5p for 2015.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Identification, mitigation and management 
of risks is central to our strategy and our 
enterprise-wide risk management process 
allows us to understand the nature, scope 
and potential impact of our key business  
and strategic risks so we are able to manage 
these effectively.
Regus’ business could be impacted by 
various risks, leading to failure to achieve 
strategic targets for growth or loss of 
financial standing, cash flow, earnings, return 
on investment, and reputation. Not all these 
risks are wholly within the Group’s control 
and it may be affected by risks which are not 
yet manifested or reasonably foreseeable.
Effective risk management is critical  
to achieving our strategic objectives  
and protecting our personnel, assets  
and our reputation. Regus therefore  
has a comprehensive approach to risk 
management, as set out in more detail  
in the Corporate Governance Report.
A critical part of the risk management 
process is to assess the impact and 
likelihood of risks occurring so that 
appropriate mitigation plans can be 
developed and implemented.
For all known risks facing the business,  
Regus attempts to minimise the likelihood 
Effective risk management requires 
awareness and engagement at all levels  
of our organisation. It is for this reason that 
risk management is incorporated into the 
day-to-day management of our business,  
as well as being reflected in the Group’s core 
processes and controls. The Board oversees 
the risk management strategy and the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control 
framework. Risk management is at the heart 
of everything we do, particularly as we look to 
grow across multiple markets around the world. 
For this reason, we conduct risk assessments 
throughout the year as part of our business 
review process and all investment decisions. 
These activities include:
 • Monthly business reviews of all countries 
and Group functions
 • Individual reviews of every new location 
investment and all acquisitions
 • Annual planning process for all markets 
and Group functions
 • Review of the status of our key risks  
in each Audit Committee meeting 
and mitigate the impact. According to the 
nature of the risk, Regus may elect to take  
or tolerate risk, treat risk with controls and 
mitigating actions, transfer risk to third 
parties, or terminate risk by ceasing particular 
activities or operations. Regus has zero 
tolerance of financial and ethics non-
compliance and ensures that Health,  
Safety, Environmental & Security risks  
are managed to levels that are as low  
as reasonably practicable.
Whilst overall responsibility for the risk 
management process rests with the Board,  
it has delegated responsibility for assurance 
to the Audit Committee. Executive 
management is responsible for designing, 
implementing and maintaining the necessary 
systems of internal control.
A list of key risks is prepared and the  
Board collectively assesses the severity  
of each risk, the likelihood of it occurring  
and the strength of the controls in place. 
This approach allows the effect of any 
mitigating procedures to be reflected in  
the final assessment. It also recognises  
that risk cannot be totally eliminated at an 
acceptable cost and that there are some 
risks which, with its experience and after  
due consideration, the Board will choose  
to accept.

Risk Mitigation Progress in 2015
Strategic
Lease obligations – The single 
greatest financial risk to Regus  
is represented by the financial 
commitments deriving from the 
portfolio of leases held across  
the Group.
Whilst Regus has demonstrated 
consistently that it has a 
fundamentally profitable  
business model which works  
in all geographies, the profitability of 
centres is impacted by movements 
in market rents, which, in turn, 
impact the price at which Regus 
can sell to its customers.
The fact that the outstanding  
lease terms with our landlords  
are, on average, significantly longer 
than the outstanding terms on  
our contracts with our customers 
creates a potential mismatch if 
rentals fall significantly, which can 
impact profitability and cash flows.
This risk is mitigated in a number of ways:
1) 94% of our leases are ‘flexible’, meaning that they are either 
terminable at our option within six months and / or located  
in or assignable to a standalone legal entity, which is not fully 
cross-guaranteed. In this way, individual centres are sustained 
by their own profitability and cash flow. During the most 
recent downturn we were able to negotiate revised terms  
with our partners to reflect downward movements in market 
rates to help recovery. 
2) Over a quarter of our leases with landlords are variable in 
nature, which means that payments to landlords vary with  
the performance of the relevant centre. In this way the ‘risk’ 
to profitability and cash flow of that centre from fluctuations 
in market rates is softened by the consequent adjustment to 
rental costs. In a number of cases, we take no risk at all since 
the lease is signed by a partner who also undertakes all of the 
capital investment and pays us a fixed percentage of revenues 
as well as a share of centre profit.
3) The sheer number of leases and geographic diversity  
of our business reduces the overall risk to our business  
as the phasing of the business cycle and the performance  
of the commercial property market often varies from country 
to country and region to region.
4) Each year a significant number of leases in our portfolio 
reach a natural break point.
During 2015, the number of ‘flexible’ 
leases as a percentage of the total 
increased from 92% to 94%. At the  
end of 2015, we were operating 2,768 
locations in 977 towns and cities across 
106 countries.
Economic downturn – An economic 
downturn could adversely affect the 
Group’s operating revenues, thereby 
reducing operating performance or , 
in an extreme downturn, resulting in 
operating losses.
The Group has taken a number of actions to mitigate this risk:
1) More than a quarter of our leases are performance-related 
to a greater or lesser extent and our rental payments, if any, 
vary with revenues earned by the centre.
2) Lease contracts include break clauses when leases can  
be terminated at our behest. The Group also looks to stagger 
leases in locations where we have multiple centres so that  
we can manage our overall inventory in those locations.
3) We review our customer base to assess exposure  
to a particular customer or industry group.
4) The increasing geographic spread of the Group’s network 
increases the depth and breadth of our business and provides 
better protection from an economic downturn in a single 
market or region.
We increased the number of centres 
operating on performance-related 
leases by 20%.
We also increased the scale of our 
network by 22% and added 145 new 
towns and cities. Our monthly business 
performance reviews provide early 
warning of any impact on our business 
performance and allow management  
to react with speed. More generally, 
investment in our management  
team has also led to improved,  
more responsive decision-making  
at a country and area level.
Shifting demand and technology 
trends – T echnology developments 
are driving demand for flexible 
working. Failure to recognise these 
could mean Regus’ product offering 
is sub-optimal.
Regus continually invests in R&D to develop new products  
and services to increase its competitive advantage, protect 
current revenues and unlock potential new sources of revenue.
The Group increased spend on R&D  
by 18% in 2015. 
Financial
Funding – The Group relies on 
external funding to support a net 
debt position of £190.6m at the 
end of 2015. The loss of these 
facilities would cause a liquidity 
issue for the Group.
The Group constantly monitors its cash flow and financial 
headroom development and maintains a 12-month rolling 
forecast and a three-year strategic outlook. The Group also 
monitors the relevant financial ratios against the covenants  
in its facilities to ensure the risk of breach is being managed.
The Group also stresses these forecasts with downside 
scenario planning to assess risk and determine potential 
action plans.
The Board intends to maintain a prudent approach to the 
Group’s capital structure by holding the net debt : Group 
EBITDA leverage ratio below c. 1.5 times.
Part of the annual planning process is a debt strategy and 
action plan to ensure that the Group will have sufficient 
funding in place to achieve its strategic objectives.
The Group also constantly reviews and manages  
the maturity profile of its external funding.
We extended and amended our £320m 
Revolving Credit Facility, which is now 
committed until 2020. 
T ogether with the Group’s €210m of 
debt securities, consisting of €165m of 
three-year notes and €45m of five-year 
notes, this provides £474m of available 
debt financing.
Regus had a net debt : EBITDA ratio at 
31 December 2015 of 0.66 times. There 
is significant headroom on each of the 
covenant ratios.
Our A- for long-term debt and A1  
for short-term debt ratings, accorded by  
an independent credit rating agency, 
makes additional sources of financing 
potentially available.
Risk management and principal risks continued www.regus.com 23
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Risk Mitigation Progress in 2015
Financial
Exchange rates – The principal 
exposures of the Group are to 
the US dollar and the euro with 
approximately 33.9% of the 
Group’s revenues being 
attributable to the US dollar  
and 13.0% to the euro.
Any depreciation or appreciation  
of sterling would have an adverse 
or beneficial impact to the Group’s 
reported financial performance  
and position respectively. The 
Group does not generally hedge 
the translation exchange risk of  
its business results. Rather , it 
assumes that shareholders will  
take whatever steps they deem 
necessary based on their varied 
appetites for exchange risk  
and differing base currency 
investment positions.
1) Given that transactions generally take place in the 
functional currency of Group companies, the Group’s 
exposure to transactional foreign exchange risk is limited.
2) Where possible, the Group attempts to create natural 
hedges against currency exposures through matching income 
and expenses, and assets and liabilities, in the same currency.
3) The Group, where deemed appropriate, uses currency 
swaps to maintain the currency profile of its external debt.
Overall in 2015 the movement  
in exchange rates decreased reported 
revenue and gross profit by £16.4m and 
£1.0m respectively, however operating 
profit increased by £1.9m compared to 
last year.
During 2015 the Group had cross-
currency swaps on €165m of debt 
securities to retain the currency profile 
of its external debt following the issue  
of a €210m loan note (which was used  
to repay sterling debt on the Group’s 
Revolving Credit Facility).
Interest rates – Operating in a  
net debt position, an increase  
in interest rates would increase 
finance costs. 
The Group constantly monitors its interest rate exposure  
as part of its monthly treasury review.
As part of the Group’s balance sheet management it utilises 
interest rate swaps. 
During 2015 the Group maintained 
interest rate swaps to convert a 
substantial proportion of its debt  
from floating to fixed rates.
Operational
Cyber security – Regus has 
significant experience in operating 
and maintaining an enterprise 
infrastructure and application 
suite. The Group has ensured that 
information security is part  
of its ongoing business practice. 
The trend towards an integrated 
digital economy and use of external 
cloud services combined with the 
rise in malicious attacks and 
increasing consequential costs 
warrants particular attention  
to cyber security risks.
This risk is mitigated as follows:
1) The Group maintains an active information security 
program under the direction of the Group CIO with oversight 
by the Board
2) Both internal and external audits are conducted periodically 
to review risks and ensure appropriate measures are in place 
3) The Group ensures compliance with all major legislation 
and directives
4) The Group maintains a mandatory training programme to 
promote staff awareness of information security and 
compliance best practice
5) Data, systems and access permissions are strictly 
segregated to reduce exposure to risk
All core production applications have  
been made PCI (Payment Card Industry) 
– compliant and the Group no longer 
stores credit card details in any of  
its systems.
Internal and external audits have been 
completed and an ongoing monitoring 
and improvement programme is in place.
Loss of critical systems – The 
Group’s systems and applications 
are housed in a central data centre. 
Should the data centre be 
impacted as a result of 
circumstances outside the Group’s 
control there could be an adverse 
impact on the Group’s operations 
and therefore its financial results.
Regus manages this risk through:
1) Business continuity plans. 
2) A detailed service agreement with our external data centre 
provider which incorporates appropriate back-up procedures 
and controls.
3) Ensuring appropriate business interruption insurance  
is in place.
We undertake regular testing  
of business continuity procedures  
to ensure that they are adequate  
and appropriate. 24 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Risk Mitigation Progress in 2015
Operational
Fraud – Landlord and supplier  
and procurement related fraud
Regus manages this risk through:
1) A rigorous investment approval process to review the 
proposed deal structure against local market conditions  
and alternatives. 
2) Centralised procurement contracts with suppliers for  
key services and products. 
3) Standardised processes to manage and monitor spend.
4) A strong governance framework and policies on gifts and 
hospitality, business conduct and bribery and corruption.
5) Regular reviews to monitor effectiveness of controls.
Growth
Ensuring demand is there to 
support our growth – Regus has 
undertaken significant growth  
to develop local and national 
networks. Adding capacity carries 
the risk of creating overcapacity. 
Failure to fill new centres would 
create a negative impact on  
the Group’s profitability and  
cash generation. 
Regus mitigates this risk as follows:
1) Each investment or acquisition proposal is reviewed  
and approved by the Investment Committee. 
2) The monthly business review process monitors new  
centre development against the investment case to  
ensure that the anticipated returns are being generated.
3) As part of the annual planning process, a growth plan is 
agreed for each country which clearly sets out the annual 
growth objectives.
On aggregate, our new centres continue 
to perform in line with management 
expectations and are delivering 
attractive returns.
Human Resources
Ability to recruit at the right  
level – Our ability to increase  
our management capacity and 
capabilities through the hiring of 
experienced professionals not only 
supports our ability to execute our 
growth strategy, but also enables  
us to improve succession planning 
throughout the Group.
Mitigating actions include:
1) Succession planning discussions are an integral part  
of our business planning and review process.
2) Part of the annual planning process is the Human Resources 
Plan, and performance against this Plan is reviewed through 
the year.
3) Our global performance management system and quarterly 
staff survey allow us to keep close to our employees and 
maintain a two-way dialogue throughout the year.
4) Regular external and internal evaluation of the performance 
of the Board.
Our capability to hire the best talent 
continued to increase in 2015. Our 
direct recruit approach saved over £2m 
of search fees as our talent knowledge 
around the world deepens and expands. 
This has allowed us to further plan for 
succession in all markets.
Our diversity continues to flourish with 
our workforce split fairly evenly male/
female, which is an important factor  
in hiring talent in a growth business.
T raining and employee 
engagement – As a service- 
based business the strength  
and capabilities of our increasingly 
geographically diverse team  
are critical to achieving our 
strategic objectives.
One of the key items in the Human Resources Plan is  
the Global Induction & T raining Plan, which sets out the  
key objectives for the forthcoming year. Performance  
against these objectives is reviewed through the year.
Our employee survey also provides insight into employee 
issues, which is then used to improve the Plan.
We trained our employees, many 
through the Regus Online Learning 
Academy, including employees from 
new centre acquisitions and new talent 
to Regus. 
In 2015 there were over 297,000  
training modules completed on-line  
and face-to-face.
Our online learning curriculum was a  
winner of the Most Dramatic Business 
Impact Award at the Cornerstone Client 
Excellence Awards 2015 for the impact 
that this training had on sales performance. 
This is just one example of our relevant 
and easy-to-access development 
initiatives for front-line employees.

Global leadership
During 2015 and throughout the first half of 
2016, therefore, the focus of the Group’s 
people strategy was and will continue to be 
on building the global leadership teams and 
succession hierarchies needed to support 
flawless execution as we drive towards

each individual’s career with internal coaching 
and mentoring, business-school partnerships, 
bespoke training programmes and more. We 
also have a competitive reward strategy, in 
which we aim to lock in the talent we need 
through incentives. 
Maximising potential and retaining talent  
is an important priority at every level of  
the organisation, and we ensure that we  
give people opportunities to excel, from  
our intake of talented graduates to our 
customer-focused staff at country and 
location level. We run our staff satisfaction 
survey on a quarterly basis to ensure we  
are never reliant on out-dated information. 
Results consistently show that our people 
understand the Group vision and what  
is expected of them.
An outstanding team
The challenges ahead of us are great,  
but we have in place an integrated and  
truly world-class team at all levels of the 
organisation with the will, the capability and 
the energy to help Regus meet its targets.
People
They must already have excelled in a 
high-growth organisation and have proved 
they have the intellect, vision and passion 
required for key roles within such an exciting, 
fast-paced and rewarding environment. 
We successfully built an outstandingly skilled 
and experienced senior management team 
during 2015. Throughout the first half of 
2016, recruitment volumes will remain high  
as we deliver on our succession-planning 
policies and build our network of shared 
service centres. Thereafter , our primary 
focus will be building country teams as we 
grow our local networks across the world.

for personal growth and development,  
and have in place a widespread programme  
of interventions to maximise personal 
capabilities. This starts with a high-quality 
Attracting, developing, growing and retaining the best available

by deep planning and ongoing business review processes. 
The people to support and drive growth

Corporate responsibility
Focused on our communities
• Economic support for communities
Our presence is helping to generate wealth  
in every location where we operate, from 
major cities in world-leading economies  
to smaller communities in emerging states.  
We give start-ups and multinationals alike 
the freedom and flexibility to operate where 
they need to, employing local people and 
drawing on local supply chains. This in turn 
helps to improve and grow the business 
environment, attracting people and 
organisations to the area in a virtuous circle.
Reducing environmental impact
Our services directly enable local business 
communities to become more sustainable. 
Not only does the offer of flexible space 
reduce carbon emissions by enabling  
people to work closer to where they live,  
but we also provide facilities such as video 
conferencing that eradicate the need  
to travel for meetings. 
In addition, we encourage and enable the 
uptake of best practice across our network 
through a range of initiatives targeting 
reduced use of paper and increased 
recycling. We are also continuing to  
introduce carbon-reduction and energy-
efficiency policies and procedures in our  
centres, including control upgrades and 
energy-efficient lighting and temperature 
systems. While each of these makes a  
small individual contribution on its own, 
across our fast-growing network they  
are collectively delivering a substantial 
reduction in our environmental impact. 
Efficiency schemes
2015 saw our Green Committee accelerate 
its efforts in reducing energy and carbon 
across our UK portfolio, with particular 
emphasis on acquisitions. In the two years  
or so since the acquisition of MBW we have 
managed through good housekeeping  
and management to reduce this portfolio’s 
overall energy-related carbon emissions by 
circa 17%. By continuing to apply our greener 
working strategies to our traditional portfolio, 
we further reduced its energy carbon 
footprint by 2.5%. This has given an overall 
combined reduction of 5% in our  
CRC returns for 2014/2015.*

is planned for these areas in 2016. 
Charitable investments
We actively invest in our communities, 
additionally encouraging and enabling our 
colleagues and customers, suppliers and  
the public to do so as well. Direct Group 
investment can take the form  
of financial donations to charities and 
humanitarian appeals, the concession  
of working space and other in-kind 
donations to worthwhile causes, and 
employee recognition programmes for 
charity initiatives. We also provide the 
support of Regus facilities for the fund-
raising activities of our staff, customers  
and suppliers. These include in-centre 
initiatives (such as collections campaigns, 
charitable networking events and recycling 
projects) as well as off-site activities like fun 
runs, sponsored walks and volunteering at 
venues like soup kitchens and orphanages. 
In total over £209,000 was raised and used

2015 was also the year when the new  
energy auditing (ESOS) regulations had  
to be applied. We are pleased to report that 
Regus embraced these new requirements  
to identify further energy-saving 
opportunities across our whole portfolio.  
The outcomes and results will be reviewed  
by our Green Committee in early 2016  
for appropriate implementation. 
We are also conscious that as new centres 
are acquired their energy-related carbon 
footprints will need to be reviewed and this 
will form part of our ongoing work. T o help  
us we are using specialist external energy 
consultancies to record our energy 
consumption on a monthly basis across  
all our centres and to assist and advise  
us in the purchase, management and 
monitoring of our energy. 
Due to our business constantly changing 
and expanding, we will in 2016 review the 
targets set out in 2009 to ensure they 
remain appropriate for the current and 
future portfolios. 
We continue to be voluntary participants  
of the Carbon Disclosure Project and use  
it to gauge our ongoing performance for 
continuous improvement. We are happy  
to report a disclosure score of 87% in 2015. 
Our new centre refurbishments now 
automatically include energy-saving  
features such as LED lighting and more 
efficient controls for heating and cooling. 
There is also a general emphasis across  
our teams to keep our carbon footprint  
as low as practically possible and to keep 
implementing our carbon reducing policies. 
We have plans to upgrade a number of 
centre BMS control systems and to  
further train staff on their efficient usage. 
By encouraging our clients to make more 
use of local centres and nearby touchdown 
facilities, we believe we are helping them 
mitigate the risks of disruption by, amongst 
other things, severe weather events brought 
about by climate change.
In 2016 our refreshed Green Committee will 
At Regus, we are confident that the positive impact of our  
mission to provide flexible workspaces in many thousands of 
places across the world is significant, wide-ranging and growing  
in scope and influence as our network expands.

When Regus colleagues in Fortaleza,

participate in a programme to collect 
and segregate paper , cardboard, plastic 
cups, toner cartridges and other office

the Mumbai Marathon and raised enough money to help 50 children fulfil their dreams.
Responding to disaster
More than eight million people were 
affected by the massive earthquake

supported beneficiaries. We believe this 
will ultimately benefit the great causes 
we are all engaged with across the globe. 28 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

We have seen the benefits of having 
strength and diversity on the Board and  
our aim is to maintain a Board which is 
reflective of the broad range of skills, 
backgrounds and experience necessary to 
properly serve our shareholders. We have 
pursued this objective by engaging Board 
members based on merit who have had 
broad executive responsibilities and bring 
very different and complementary personal 
experiences and approaches to matters 
including the evaluation of opportunities  
and management of risks. 
Remuneration policy
As indicated in our 2014 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, during 2015 the 
Remuneration Committee has reviewed the 
remuneration and incentive framework for 
our Executive Directors and has consulted 
with our major shareholders and investor 
bodies on the introduction of the 
remuneration policy as set out on pages  
44 to 47; this policy has been designed to 
promote the long-term success of the 
Company and approval will be sought for  
it at the 2016 annual general meeting.
Audit Committee and auditors 
In view of our continuing long-term ambition 
for growth and the significant investments 
that have been made across the business, 
the Audit Committee has again played a 
substantial role in ensuring appropriate 
governance and challenge around our risk 
and assurance processes. This is covered  
in further detail on pages 21 to 24 and  
34 and 35. Full details of the work of the  
Audit Committee are detailed in the Audit 
Committee Report on pages 38 to 41 and 
includes our intention to commence an  
audit tendering process before June 2018.

Douglas Sutherland
Chairman
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce the Governance 
section of our Annual Report which 
documents your Board’s approach  
to directing and controlling Regus.
Our approach to governance
We firmly believe that good governance 
starts with a strong Board providing 
entrepreneurial leadership and setting  
the values for the Group against a backdrop 
of prudent and appropriate safeguards, 
checks and balances which are regularly 
reviewed and which ensure that the right 
considerations underpin every decision  
we make. 
As a Board we regularly discuss and 
review our:
 • Performance and progress
 • Major risks and their mitigation
 • Behaviours and values
 • People and how we can create a high 
performing team
 • Future development and succession
 • Customers
 • Shareholders
I hope that the reports contained in this 
section provide you with an insight into how 
we strive to achieve effective governance 
and the progress we have made in 2015.  
I also trust that you will find our reports to  
be fair , balanced and understandable; this  
is a reflection of how we do business and 
how the Board serves its stakeholders.

Non-Executive Director and Dominik de

UK Corporate  
Governance Code
The UK Corporate Governance Code,  
as published by the Financial Reporting 
Council in September 2014 and available  
on www.frc.gov.uk (the “Code”), sets  
out a series of principles and provisions 
documenting good practice in governance. 
Our Corporate Governance Report is 
structured to report against the main 
principles of the Code, which relate to: 
leadership; effectiveness; accountability; 
remuneration; and relations with 
shareholders. T ogether with the Audit 
Committee Report, the Nomination 
Committee Report and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report this Corporate 
Governance Report shows how we have 
applied the principles of the Code during 
2015, when we complied with all the 
provisions of the Code except in relation  
to Senior Independent Director contact with 
major shareholders. Further information on 
this is provided in our Compliance Statement 
on page 35. 
The Chairman ensures that each meeting 
covers an appropriate range of topics 
including operations, strategy, business 
development, special projects and 
administrative matters. Minutes are taken  
of all Board discussions and decisions and  
all Directors are encouraged to request 
inclusion in the Board minutes of any 
unresolved concerns that they may have. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for its decision and which cannot 
be delegated. These include:
 • approval of long-term objectives and 
commercial strategy;
 • approval of the annual budget;
 • approval of regulatory announcements 
including the interim and annual  
financial statements;
 • approval of terms of reference and 
membership of the Board and  
its Committees;
 • changes to the Group’s capital structure;
 • changes to the Group’s management  
and control structure;
 • capital expenditure in excess of £5m; and
 • material contracts (annual value in excess 
of £5m).
Board Committees
The Board is supported by the Audit 
Committee, the Remuneration Committee 
and the Nomination Committee (the 
“Committees”) to which it has delegated 
certain powers. The work of the Committees 
is further detailed on pages 36 to 52 and 
their terms of reference can be found on the 
Company’s website: www.regus.com.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to 
all the Committees and minutes of meetings 
are circulated to all Board members. 
Leadership
Role of the Board 
Your Board is collectively responsible for  
the long-term success of the Company.  
The Board sets the strategy for the Group 
and ensures that the necessary resources, 
measures and controls are in place to 
implement the agreed strategy and to 
monitor performance. The Board also sets 
the values and standards which form the 
basis of the corporate culture at Regus. 
The Chairman sets the Board meeting 
schedule and agenda. In 2015 the Board  
met eight times with all Directors present  
at every Board meeting. Details of Board 
membership throughout the year and

Effectiveness
Board composition
The Board currently comprises the 
Chairman, two Executive Directors and  
five Independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Board composition and the composition of 
the Committees is regularly reviewed and 
refreshed. During 2015 François Pauly was 
appointed as a new Independent Non-
Executive Director and Dominik de Daniel 
was appointed as a new Executive Director 
holding the combined position of Chief 
Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. 
The Board considers all Non-Executive 
Directors to be independent.
The Board considers that its current 
composition continues to ensure that no 
individual or group dominates its decision 
making process and that the Board has the 
right balance of skills to be able to discharge 
its duties effectively.
Board appointments and succession
The Board is satisfied that succession plans 
are in place for the orderly succession of 
appointments to the Board and to senior 
management positions. The Board has 
established a Nomination Committee  
with responsibility for leading the process  
for Board appointments and succession 
planning. Further details of the Nomination 
Committee’s work and responsibilities are 
contained on page 36 and 37. 
Development, information and support
Appropriate training is made available for  
all new Directors to assist them in the 
discharge of their duties. All Directors  
have the opportunity to meet with major 
shareholders and have access to the 
Company’s operations and employees. 
T raining is provided on an ongoing basis to 
meet particular needs with the emphasis on 
governance and accounting developments. 
During the year the Company Secretary 
provided updates to the Board on relevant 
governance matters, whilst the Audit 
Committee regularly considers new 
accounting developments through 
presentations from management,  
internal business assurance and the 
external auditors. 
The Board programme includes the receipt 
of monthly Board reports and presentations 
given at Board meetings from management 
with strategic responsibilities. These, 
together with site visits, increase the 
Non-Executive Directors’ understanding  
of the business and sector.
All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary, who  
is responsible for ensuring that Board 
procedures, corporate governance and 
regulatory compliance are followed and 
complied with. Appointment and removal  
of the Company Secretary is a matter 
reserved for the Board. 
Should a Director request independent 
professional advice to carry out his duties, 
such advice is available to him or her at  
the Company’s expense. 
Corporate Governance continued
Re-election of the Board
All Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
submit themselves for re-election by 
shareholders annually and Directors 
appointed during the period since the last 
annual general meeting are required to seek 
election at the next annual general meeting 
under the Company’s articles of association. 
Dominik de Daniel, who was appointed in 
2015 after the last annual general meeting, 
will seek election at the 2016 annual  
general meeting. 
Time commitment
In accordance with the terms of their 
appointment agreements, the Chairman and 
all Non-Executive Directors are expected to 
allocate such time as is necessary for the 
proper performance of their duties as 
Directors of the Company and are required 
to advise the Board if there is a change in 
circumstances which will impact on the time 
they are able to dedicate to the Company. 
Copies of all Non-Executives’ appointment 
agreements are available for inspection at 
the Company’s Registered Office during 
normal business hours and at the annual 
general meeting. Details of other 
commitments held by the Directors are 
disclosed on pages 28 and 29.
Douglas Sutherland
Chairman
The Chairman is responsible for leadership 
of the Board, setting its agenda and 
monitoring its effectiveness. He ensures 
effective communication with shareholders 
and that the Board is aware of the views of 
major shareholders. He facilitates both the 
contribution of the Non-Executive Directors 
and constructive relations between the 
Executive Directors and Non-Executive 
Directors, and regularly meets with the 
Non-Executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors being present. In 
addition, he oversees the corporate 
responsibility activities of the Group, 
including community projects and 
environmental impact initiatives.
Mark Dixon
Chief Executive
The Chief Executive is responsible for 
formulating strategy and for its delivery  
once agreed by the Board. He creates a 
framework of strategy, values, organisation 
and objectives to ensure the successful 
delivery of key targets, and allocates 
decision-making and responsibilities 
accordingly. 
Role of Board members
There is a clear division of responsibilities  
at the head of the Company between the 
running of the Board and the running of  
the Company’s business. No one individual 
Director has unfettered powers of decision-
making and all Directors are required to act  
in the best interests of the Company. 
The Group’s insurance programme is 
reviewed annually and appropriate insurance 
cover is obtained to protect the Directors 
and senior management in the event of a 
claim being brought against any of them in 
their capacity as Directors and Officers of 
the Company. www.regus.com 33
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Board performance evaluation
An external evaluation of the Board was 
carried out by an independent leadership 
consultancy, Panthea, with experience in 
conducting such reviews. Panthea also 
performed the last external review of the 
board and was selected in order to have  
the perspective on the development of  
the Board during the period since the last 
external review. Another independent 
evaluator will be chosen for the next  
external Board review in order to bring  
other viewpoints to the process. The recent 
evaluation included a series of one-to-one 
discussions between the reviewer and each 
Board member and a review of Board 
materials. The evaluation results were 
reviewed by the Board and suggestions  
are being addressed in our efforts to 
continuously improve the processes  
and effectiveness of the Board and its 
Committees. No reportable matters were 
noted by the evaluation and we continue  
to have full confidence in the Board’s 
members and processes. 
The Senior Independent Director  
annually leads the Non-Executive Directors 
performance evaluation of the Chairman 
taking the views of the Executive Directors 
into account.
Going concern
The Directors, having made appropriate 
enquiries, have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group and the Company have 
adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for a period of at  
least 12 months from the date of approval  
of the financial statements. For this reason 
they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Accounts on  
pages 55 to 105.
In adopting the going concern basis for 
preparing the financial statements, the 
Directors have considered the further 
information included in the business 
activities commentary as set out on  
pages 13 to 17, as well as the Group’s  
principle risks and uncertainties as set  
out on pages 21 to 24. 
Further details on the going concern basis  
of preparation can be found in note 24  
of the notes to the accounts on page 81.
Accountability
Financial and business reporting
In accordance with its responsibilities  
the Board considers this Annual Report  
and Accounts, taken as a whole to be fair , 
balanced and understandable, providing  
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. 
A statement by the Company’s auditor 
about their responsibilities in relation to  
the Annual Report and Accounts is  
included on page 55. 
The Board conducts regular reviews of  
the Group’s strategic direction. Country  
and regional strategic objectives, plans  
and performance targets are set by the 
Executive Directors and are regularly 
reviewed by the Board in the context of the 
Group’s overall objectives. Further details of 
the basis on which the Company generates 
and preserves value over the longer term 
and the strategy for delivering the objectives 
of the Company are contained in the 
Strategic Report on pages 1 to 27.
Lance Browne
Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director acts  
as a sounding board and confidant for  
the Chairman, as an intermediary for  
other Directors as necessary and leads the 
appraisal of the Chairman’s performance.  
He is also available to shareholders if they 
have concerns that cannot be resolved 
through normal channels. 
Non-Executive Directors
 
 
The Non-Executive Directors each bring 
their own senior-level experience and 
objectivity to the Board. The independent 
counsel and challenge brought to the Group 
by the Non-Executive Directors enhances 
the development of strategy and the  
overall decision making of the Board.  
The Non-Executive Directors scrutinise  
the performance of management and are 
responsible for determining appropriate 
levels of executive remuneration. 
Non-Executive Directors are subject to  
the re-election requirements and serve  
the Company under letters of appointment, 
which have an initial three-year term.
Lynsey Blair

Corporate Governance continued
Longer term viability
The Directors have also assessed the 
viability of the Group and Company over a 
three-year period to 31 December 2018. 
This is based on three years of strategic 
outlook and planning and related stress 
scenario testing. Whilst the Board has no 
reason to believe that the Group will not be 
viable over a longer period, using a three-
year period was chosen to give greater 
certainty over the assumptions used. 
In making their assessment, the Directors 
took account of the further information 
included in the business activities 
commentary as set out on pages 13 to  
17, as well as the Group’s principal risks  
and uncertainties and related mitigation 
approaches as set out on pages 21 to 24.  
They assessed potential financial and 
operational aspects of various severe but 
plausible scenarios in the context of these 
principle risks and uncertainties and potential 
combinations thereof along with the likely 
effectiveness of available mitigating actions.
Based on this assessment, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group and Company will be able to continue 
in operation and meet all their liabilities  
as they fall due over the period up to  
31 December 2018.
Principal risks
The Board is responsible for assessing  
the nature and extent of the principal risks  
it is willing to take to achieve its strategic 
objectives. The key risks to the Group and 
the steps taken to manage and mitigate 
them which were reviewed and approved  
by the Board are detailed on pages 21 to 24. 
The Board has delegated authority for 
overseeing and reviewing the process of 
identifying, managing and reviewing risks  
to the Audit Committee which reports 
regularly to the Board. 
Remuneration
Remuneration Committee 
The Board has established a Remuneration 
Committee with responsibility for the design 
and implementation of the remuneration 
policy for both Executive Directors and the 
Chairman. In doing so the Committee will pay 
due regard to wider remuneration trends 
across the Group, legal requirements and 
best corporate governance. The aim is to 
ensure our Remuneration Policy is aligned to 
Company strategy, key business objectives 
and the best interests of our shareholders 
and stakeholders. Further details of the 
Remuneration Committee’s work is 
contained on pages 42 to 52. Although  
not required under Luxembourg law, but  
in order to maintain transparency, approval 
for the Company’s Remuneration Policy and 
the Annual Report on Remuneration will be 
sought at the annual general meeting. 
Internal control systems
The Board has delegated its responsibility  
for the Company’s system of internal control 
and risk management and for ensuring the 
effectiveness of this system to the Audit 
Committee. Details of the system and the 
Committee’s review of its effectiveness  
are reported on pages 39 and 40. 
Audit Committee and auditors
The Board has established an Audit 
Committee consisting entirely of 
Independent Non-Executive Directors.  
The Audit Committee has responsibility for 
ensuring the integrity of financial information 
and the effectiveness of financial controls 
and the internal control and risk 
management system. Further details  
of the Audit Committee’s work and 
responsibilities are contained on  
pages 38 to 41. 
All members of the Audit Committee  
are considered by the Board to be 
independent in character and judgement 
and are competent in accounting and/or 
auditing. Furthermore, and in compliance 
with the Code, the Board regards Elmar 
Heggen as the Committee member 
possessing recent and relevant  
financial experience.
On recommendation of the Audit 
Committee it is intended that the external 
audit contract should be put out to tender 
before June 2018 and it is proposed that 
KPMG be re-appointed as the auditor for  
the financial year ending 31 December 2016.

from them in their  
role, including business 
ethics and compliance, 
regulations and 
internal policies;

Relations with 
Shareholders
Dialogue with shareholders
The Company reports formally to 
shareholders twice a year , with the half-year 
results typically announced in August and 
the preliminary final results in March. There 
are programmes for the Chief Executive  
and the Chief Financial Officer and Chief 
Operating Officer to give presentations of 
these results to the Company’s institutional 
investors, analysts and media in London  
and other key locations.
The Chief Executive and the Chief  
Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer 
maintain a close dialogue with institutional 
investors on the Company’s performance, 
governance, plans and objectives. These 
meetings also serve to develop an ongoing 
understanding of the views and any concerns 
of the Company’s major shareholders.
On 6 October 2015 Regus hosted a Capital 
Markets Day, which focussed on providing 
information to investors on the Group’s 
strategy and operations.
Non-Executive Directors are given regular 
updates as to the views of institutional 
shareholders. The Chairman attends the 
main presentations of the half year and  
full year results and is also available to  
meet with shareholders on request.
The principal communication with private 
shareholders is through the Annual Report, 
the half-year results and the annual  
general meeting.
The Company continues to engage the 
services of Brunswick as its investor 
relations adviser.
Annual general meeting
The annual general meeting each year is held 
in May in Luxembourg and is attended, other 
than in exceptional circumstances, by all 
members of the Board. In addition to the 
formal business of the meeting, there is

On 23 September 2014, Mark Dixon entered 
into a Relationship Agreement with the 
Company so as to comply with Listing Rule 
LR 9.2.2A(2)(a), which came into effect on  
16 May 2014. The following undertakings 
were given by Mark Dixon:
 • all transactions and relationships with any 
member of the Group will be conducted 
on arm’s length terms and on a normal 
commercial basis; 
 • no action will be taken that would have  
the effect of preventing the Company 
from complying with its obligations  
under the Listing Rules; and 
 • no resolution will be proposed, or procured 
to be proposed, which is intended to, or 
appears to be intended to, circumvent the 
proper application of the Listing Rules.

with its obligations under the Relationship 
Agreement during the financial period  
under review, and that so far as it is aware  
all other parties to that agreement have 
complied with it.

Directors informally afterwards.
Notice of the annual general meeting 
together with any related documents is 
required to be mailed to shareholders at 
least 30 clear days before the meeting  
and separate resolutions are proposed  
on each issue.
The voting in respect of all resolutions to

Compliance statement
The Company has complied with the 
provisions of the Code throughout the  
year ended 31 December 2015, with  
the exception of the following:
 • Provision E.1.1 – The Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director Lance Browne 
does not have regular meetings with 
major external shareholders.
The Board considers it appropriate for  
the Chairman to be the main conduit  
to investors, rather than the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director.  
The Chairman participates in investor 
meetings and makes himself available for 
questions, in person, at the time of major 
announcements as well as upon request. 
The Chairman regularly updates the Board 
and particularly the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director on the results  
of his meetings and the opinions of

Succession planning
We ensure that succession plans are in place 
for the orderly succession for appointments 
to the Board and senior management 
positions, so that there is an appropriate 
balance of skills and experience within the 
Company and on the Board. Our aim is for 
our Board and senior management team to 
be reflective of the international nature of 
our business and the communities in which 
we operate and we are seeking to achieve 
this through the development of people 
from all parts of our business, supplemented 
by the hiring of experienced professionals. 
Succession planning discussions are  
an integral part of the Group’s business 
planning and review process and the 
continued development of the management 
capacity and capabilities within the business 
enabled succession planning to be 
addressed in a robust way in 2015.

Chairman
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present to you my  
report on the Nomination Committee. 
2015 was an important year for the 
Nomination Committee during which we 
continued our work to refresh and strengthen 
your Board. Key activities in 2015 included:
 • Identifying and recommending  
the appointment of François Pauly as 
Independent Non-Executive Director;  
François was subsequently appointed  
to the Board at the Company’s annual 
general meeting held on 19 May 2015.
 • Identifying and recommending the 
appointment of Dominik de Daniel as an 
Executive Director holding the combined 
position of Chief Financial Officer and 
Chief Operating Officer. Dominik was 
subsequently appointed by the Board with 
effect from 1 November 2015 and offers 
himself for election at the Company’s 
2016 annual general meeting.
 • Reviewing our succession policy  
for Executive Director and senior 
management roles.
Board appointments
The Committee’s regular internal Board 
review process monitors effectiveness, 
performance, balance, independence, 
leadership and succession planning enabling 
us to identify the capabilities and roles 
required for a particular Board appointment. 
In view of the future development of the 
Group and our objective to continue to 
enhance the diversity of the Board, the 
Nomination Committee maintains an 
ongoing programme of engagement with 
highly qualified potential Non-Executive 
Directors of varied backgrounds and gender; 
François Pauly was engaged through this 
programme and we did not need to make 
use of a search agency in relation to his 
appointment. Russell Reynolds Associates 
provided search services to the Company in 
respect of Dominik de Daniel’s appointment; 
they are independent of the Company.
Our recommendations for Board 
appointments are based on merit whilst 
reflecting our succession policy of continuing 
to increase the diversity of the Board over 
time. Our eight current Board members 
comprising two women and six men  
represent six different nationalities and

Elmar Heggen
Chairman

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
The Committee discussed and reviewed the 
following significant issues with KPMG and 
management in relation to the financial 
statements for 2015:
 • Fair value accounting for business 
combinations: The Committee has 
considered the business combinations 
purchased during the year and the fair 
value and goodwill accounting valuations 
in relation thereto. Particular consideration 
has been given to the assessment of what 
qualifies as a “business combination” 
under IFRS and to management’s 
judgements relating to the non-current 
assets acquired; The Committee is 
satisfied that management have  
adopted balanced accounting policies  
and made appropriate judgements.
 • Valuation of intangibles and goodwill: 
The Committee has considered the 
impairment testing undertaken and 
disclosures made in relation to the value  
of the Company’s goodwill and intangibles 
and has challenged the key assumptions 
made by management in their valuation 
methodology. The Committee considers 
that an appropriately cautious approach 
has been used by management and is 
satisfied that no impairment of intangibles 
and goodwill is required. See notes 12 and  
13 for further information.
Following its in depth review of this Annual 
Report the Committee has advised the 
Board that it considers the Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, to be fair , balanced and 
understandable, providing the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. As such the 
Committee recommended the Annual 
Report to the Board.
Risk management
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee 
oversees and reviews an ongoing process  
for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
risks faced by the Group. Major business 
risks and their financial implications are 
appraised by the responsible executives  
as a part of the planning process and are 
endorsed by regional management. Key risks 
are reported to the Audit Committee, which 
in turn ensured that the Board is made aware 
of them. The appropriateness of controls is 
considered by the executives, having regard 
to cost, benefit, materiality and the likelihood 
of risks crystallising. Key risks and actions to 
mitigate those risks were considered by both 
the Audit Committee and the Board in the 
year under review, and were formally 
reviewed and approved by the Board.
 • a system of regular reports from 
management setting out key performance 
and risk indicators has been developed.
The above process is designed to provide 
assurance by way of cumulative assessment 
and is embedded in operational 
management and governance processes.
Key elements of the Group’s system of 
internal control which have operated 
throughout the year under review  
are as follows:
 • The risk assessments of all significant 
business decisions at the individual 
transaction level, and as part of the annual 
business planning process. A Group-wide 
risk register is developed annually whereby 
all Company-inherent risks are identified 
and assessed, and appropriate action 
plans developed to manage the risk per 
the Company’s risk appetite. The Board 
reviews the Group’s principal risks register 
annually and management periodically 
reports on the progress against agreed 
actions to keep a close watch on how  
we are managing our key risks.
 • The annual strategic planning process, 
which is designed to ensure consistency 
with the Company’s strategic objectives. 
The final budget is reviewed and approved 
by the Board. Performance is reviewed 
against objectives at each Board meeting.
 • Comprehensive monthly business  
review processes under which business 
performance is reviewed at business 
centre, area, country, regional and 
functional levels. Actual results are 
reviewed against targets, explanations  
are received for all material movements, 
and recovery plans are agreed where 
appropriate.
 • The documentation of key policies and 
control procedures (including finance, 
operations, and health and safety)  
having Group-wide application. These  
are available to all staff via the Group’s 
intranet system.
 • Formal procedures for the review and 
approval of all investment and acquisition 
projects. The Group Investment 
Committee reviews and approves all 
investments. Additionally, the form and 
content of routine investment proposals 
are standardised to facilitate the  
review process.
 • The delegation of authority limits with 
regard to the approval of transactions.
Principal risks
There are a number of risks and 
uncertainties which could have an impact  
on the Group’s long-term performance.  
The Group has a risk management structure 
in place designed to identify, manage and 
mitigate business risks. Risk assessment  
and evaluation is an integral part of the 
annual planning process, as well as the 
Group’s monthly review cycle.
The Group’s principal risks, together with  
an explanation of how the Group manages 
these risks, are presented on pages 21 to 24  
of this Annual Report.
Internal control
The Committee has a delegated 
responsibility from the Board for the 
Company’s system of internal control  
and risk management and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of this system. Such a system 
is designed to identify, evaluate and control 
the significant risks associated with the 
Group’s achievement of its business 
objectives with a view to safeguarding 
shareholders’ investments and the Group’s 
assets. Due to the limitations that are 
inherent in any system of internal control, 
this system is designed to meet the 
Company’s particular needs and the risks  
to which it is exposed, and is designed  
to manage rather than eliminate risk.
Accordingly, such a system can provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
In accordance with the FRC Revised 
Guidance, the Committee confirms that 
there is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant  
risks faced by the Group.
During the year under review, the Committee 
continued to revisit its risk identification and 
assessment processes, inviting Board 
members and senior management to 
convene and discuss the Group’s key  
risks and mitigating controls.
A risk-based approach has been adopted in 
establishing the Group’s system of internal 
control and in reviewing its effectiveness.  
T o identify and manage key risks:
 • a number of Group-wide procedures, 
policies and standards have been 
established;
 • a framework for reporting and escalating 
matters of significance has been 
maintained;
 • reviews of the effectiveness of 
management actions in addressing  
key Group risks identified by the Board 
have been undertaken; and 40 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
 • The generation of targeted, action-
oriented reports from the Group’s  
sales and operating systems on a  
daily, weekly and monthly basis, which 
provide management at all levels with 
performance data for their area of 
responsibility, and which help them  
to focus on key issues and manage  
them more effectively.
 • The delivery of a centrally co-ordinated 
assurance programme by the business 
assurance department that includes key 
business risk areas. The findings and 
recommendations of each review are 
reported to both management and 
the Committee.
 • Annual internal control self-assessment 
and management certification exercise 
covering the effectiveness of financial  
and operational controls. This is based  
on a comprehensive internal control 
questionnaire collated and reviewed  
by business assurance. Results and any 
necessary mitigating action plans are 
presented to senior management  
and the Board.
 • The maintenance of high standards of 
behaviour which is demanded from staff 
at all levels in the Group. The following 
procedures are in place to support this:
 • a clearly defined organisation structure 
with established responsibilities;
 • an induction process to educate new 
team members on the standards 
required from them in their role, 
including business ethics and 
compliance, regulation and 
internal policies;
 • the availability of the ‘T eam Member 
Handbook’, via the Group’s intranet, 
which contains the Company’s Code  
of Business Conduct, detailed guidance 
on employee policies and the standards 
of behaviour required of staff;
 • policies, procedure manuals and 
guidelines are readily accessible  
through the Group’s intranet site;
 • operational audit and self-certification 
tools which require individual managers 
to confirm their adherence to Group 
policies and procedures; and
 • a Group-wide policy to recruit  
and develop appropriately skilled 
management and staff of high  
calibre and integrity and with 
appropriate disciplines.
External auditors
KPMG Luxembourg, Société coopérative 
was the Company’s auditor for the year 
ended 31 December 2015. The Audit 
Committee is responsible for oversight of 
the external auditor , including an annual 
assessment of their independence and 
objectivity and the measures in place to 
safeguard this.
During the year , the external auditor audited 
the consolidated financial statements of the 
Company, performed control observations 
throughout the Group and provided an 
overview of the half-year results of  
the Company.
KPMG Luxembourg, Société coopérative  
did not perform any significant non-audit 
services. 
Measures in place to safeguard KPMG’s 
independence were:
 • the Company’s policy to use the external 
auditor for non-audit-related services only 
where the use of the external auditor will 
deliver a demonstrable benefit to the 
Company as compared to the use of other 
potential providers of the services and 
where it will not impair their independence 
or objectivity;
 • all proposals for permitted defined 
non-audit services to use the external 
auditor must be submitted to, and 
authorised by, the Chief Financial Officer; 
permitted non-audit services include 
advice on financial accounting and 
regulatory reporting matters, reviews of 
internal accounting and risk management 
controls, non-statutory audits (e.g. 
regarding acquisitions and disposal of 
assets and interests in companies) and  
tax compliance and advisory services;
 • prohibited non-audit services include 
book-keeping and other accounting 
services, actuarial valuation services, 
recruitment services in relation to key 
management positions and transaction 
(acquisitions, mergers and dispositions) 
work that includes investment banking 
services, preparation of forecasts or 
investment proposals and deal 
execution services; and
 • KPMG is required to adhere to a rotation 
policy requiring rotation of the lead audit 
partner at least every seven years. A new 
lead audit partner took responsibility for 
the audit in respect of the financial year 
ended 31 December 2015. 
The Committee and the Board regard 
responsible corporate behaviour as an 
integral part of the overall governance 
framework and believes, that it should  
be fully integrated into management 
structures and systems. Therefore the  
risk management policies, procedures and 
monitoring methods described above apply 
equally to the identification, evaluation and 
control of the Company’s safety, ethical and 
environmental risks and opportunities. This 
approach ensures that the Company has  
the necessary and adequate information to 
identify and assess risks and opportunities 
affecting the Company’s long-term value 
arising from its handling of corporate 
responsibility and corporate 
governance matters.
The Committee has completed its annual 
review of the effectiveness of the system of 
internal control for the year to 31 December 
2015 and is satisfied that it is in accordance 
with the FRC Revised Guidance and  
the Code. The assessment included 
consideration of the effectiveness of the 
Board’s ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the risks  
facing the Group.
Whistle-blowing policy
The Company has an externally hosted 
whistle-blowing channel (‘EthicsPoint’), 
which is available to all employees via email, 
and on the Company’s intranet. The aim  
of the policy is to encourage all employees, 
regardless of seniority, to bring matters that 
cause them concern to the attention of the 
Audit Committee.
The Business Assurance Director , where 
appropriate and in consultation with the 
senior management team, decides  
on the appropriate method and level of 
investigation. The Audit Committee is 
notified of all material discourses made  
and receives reports on the results of 
investigations and actions taken on a  
regular basis. The Audit Committee has  
the power to request further information, 
conduct its own inquiries or order additional 
action as it sees fit.

on page 69.
In assessing the effectiveness of the 
external audit process for 2015 the 
Committee has considered: 
 • the audit process as a whole and its 
suitability for the challenges facing  
the Group;
 • the strength and independence of the 
external audit team;
 • the audit team’s understanding of the 
control environment;
 • the culture of the external auditor in 
seeking continuous improvement and 
increased quality; 
 • the quality and timeliness of 
communications and reports  
received; and
 • the quality of interaction with 
management. 
Following the Committee’s assessment  
of the effectiveness of the external audit 
process for 2015 and of KPMG’s continuing 
independence, the Committee has 
recommended to the Board that a resolution 
to reappoint KPMG Luxembourg, Société 
coopérative as the Company’s auditor  
in respect of the financial year ending  
31 December 2016 be proposed at  
the annual general meeting.
KPMG has been the Company’s external 
auditor since 2008. In light of the new EU 
legislation regarding auditor independence 
and rotation, the Committee has 
recommended to the Board that it is in  
the best interests of the Company for the 
Committee to launch a tendering process 
before June 2018 in respect of the financial 
year ending 31 December 2018. The 
Committee has debated the advantages  
and disadvantages related to tendering  
the Regus external audit prior to this and 
concluded that given the significant level  
of other changes which remain ongoing, 
including the mix of countries in which much 
of the audit work is conducted, the rapid 
growth and evolving structure of the Group, 
changes in financial organisation and 
personnel, ongoing efforts to continue to 
improve audit effectiveness with the existing 
external auditor , and other factors, that it was 
not appropriate or in the interest of 
shareholders to bring this timeline forward.

1. 0-3 years: 3
2. 3-6 years: 1
3. 6-9 years: 1
We are proposing three principal changes  
to the Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors. Our objective is to simplify the 
Remuneration Policy, set remuneration 
levels which reflect the size and scope of  
the Group and our corporate strategy and 
incorporate performance hurdles for variable 
pay. These changes are explained below.
1. Repositioning of base salaries to reflect  
the increased size and scale of the Group
Current salaries for Mark Dixon (and formerly 
Dominique Yates) were set in the context of 
the Company’s positioning five years ago 
which was towards the bottom end of the 
FTSE 350, when the scale of the Group’s 
operations was significantly smaller. The 
appointment of Dominik de Daniel to the 
position of Chief Operating Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer represents a significantly 
expanded role. This newly created position 
requires pay considerably above the level of 
the previous stand-alone Chief Financial 
Officer role. Dominik de Daniel’s salary on 
appointment is £725,000.
In addition to positioning ourselves 
competitively when recruiting externally, we 
must also set salaries appropriately for those 
already within the organisation. Accordingly, 
from 1 January 2016 Mark Dixon’s salary  
was increased to £825,000. While this is a 
significant increase from the current level, 
we believe it is the right decision for the 
Company in the context of the external 
environment to reflect the market rate for  
an executive who has led the Company 
through a period of outstanding success  
and who continues to implement an 
ambitious profitable growth strategy.
2. Increase to bonus potential with 
compulsory deferral
Under the current policy, there is a significant 
weighting towards fixed pay. This no longer 
adequately reflects our philosophy of pay for 
performance and longer term alignment with 
equity ownership, and nor is it usual in the 
market in general. We therefore propose to 
raise the maximum bonus opportunity for 
the Executive Directors at Regus to 150%  
of salary (with 90% of salary paid for target 
performance) and to introduce compulsory 
deferral of half of bonus into shares, vesting 
after three years.
3. Introduction of a single Performance  
Share Plan (“PSP”)
Our current policy of linking long-term 
reward potential under the Co-Investment 
Plan (“CIP”) with the outcome of 
performance under the annual bonus  
is unusual. The potential reward under  
the CIP is reliant entirely upon short-term 
Directors’ Remuneration report
The Committee’s challenge is 
to ensure that we set a policy 
that enables us to motivate our 
people and recruit the calibre  
of talent that will lead the 
Company in sustaining its 
record of profitable growth. 
Nina Henderson
Chairman
Dear shareholder 
I am pleased to present this Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, which follows a year  
in which the Company has continued to 
make excellent progress.
The Committee’s challenge is to ensure that 
we set a policy that enables us to motivate 
our people and recruit the calibre of talent 
that will lead the Company in sustaining its 
record of profitable growth. In last year’s 
report, the Committee committed to review 
the remuneration framework for Executive 
Directors during 2015. The review’s 
objectives were to create a structure that  
is competitive, aligned with our strategic 
objectives and is straightforward.
There are three sections to this report. This 
letter summarises the 2015 highlights and 
explains the changes we are making to the 
Remuneration Policy with effect from 2016. 
Our new Remuneration Policy follows in full 
on pages 44 to 47. Finally, the Annual Report 
on Remuneration on pages 48 to 52 
describes the amounts paid to Directors in 
respect of 2015 and describes how we 
intend to implement the policy for 2016.
Context for changes
Over the last five years Regus has 
demonstrated continued growth and 
sustained strong performance. Revenues 
have increased by over 85% and EPS has 
grown from 0.3p to 12.8p. This sustained 
financial growth has been reflected in our 
share price and market value. Continued 
strong revenue and profit growth in 2015, 
combined with a return on investment of 
11.4% gives us confidence in the future  
and in our ability to meet our long-term  
goals to continue to expand globally.
Growth of this nature brings new challenges 
and demands. A key driver of the Company’s 
growth has been and will continue to be its 
people and their talents. The Company’s 
human resource continues to evolve adding 
new capabilities and skills. For example, the 
creation of our new role of Chief Financial 
Officer and Chief Operating Officer , with 
Dominik de Daniel appointed to this role 
effective from 1 November 2015.
Summary of main changes
Our Remuneration Policy for senior 
management continues to evolve with the 
growth in size and scale of the Company,  
The policy must enable us to hire and retain 
top talent with the capability to lead the 
Company on its journey of continued growth. 
We seek to ensure that our remuneration 
structure provides alignment with our 
shareholders and is straightforward  
and transparent.

performance captured in the annual bonus 
and subject to an executive’s ability to invest 
via the voluntary deferral mechanism. This is 
complex, disproportionately favourable to 
higher earning executives, and not in line 
with prevailing best practice. Accordingly, 
from 2016, shareholder approval will be 
sought for a new PSP, and the CIP will  
no longer be used.
Under the PSP an annual grant policy will be 
followed (initially 200% of salary). The first 
awards under the PSP will be made in early 
2016 and will replace any CIP grants which 
would have otherwise been made in 2016.
For the first awards, the PSP will operate  
with three performance metrics, designed  
to align closely with our current growth 
strategy. These will be relative TSR vs  
the FTSE 350, EPS growth and return  
on invested capital.
As before, clawback provisions will apply.
Performance and reward in 2015 
As highlighted in the strategic report  
on pages 1 to 27, 2015 was a strong year 
delivering attractive shareholder returns. 
The chart to the right shows the growth in 
EPS per share achieved from 2010 (0.3p)  
to 2015 (12.8p). The TSR graph on page  
52 shows that as at 31 December 2015,  
the value of £100 invested in Regus shares 
on 31 December 2008 would be worth £789, 
as compared to a value of £197 if £100  
were invested in the FTSE 350 (excluding 
Investment T rusts).
Annual bonus
The 2015 bonus plan was based on 
performance against an operating profit 
target. The achieved operating profit of 
£144.8 for 2015 exceeded the operating 
profit target for full bonus while maintaining 
our growth objectives, therefore bonuses 
were paid at 100%.
Co-Investment Plan
The performance metrics utilised in respect 
of the CIP Matching Shares granted in 2013 
which vested during 2015 were adjusted  
EPS and relative TSR. As a result of strong 
performance against both measures, the  
CIP vested at 97%.
Conclusion
You will be asked to approve four 
remuneration-related resolutions at our 
annual general meeting:
First, our revised Remuneration Policy will  
be put to shareholders for approval. As a 
Luxembourg registered company, this is not 
a statutory requirement. However , the 
Committee is committed to upholding the 
highest governance standards and a full  
and open dialogue with shareholders.  
In developing our proposals, we actively 
consulted with all of our largest institutional 
shareholders. The feedback we received has 
been both supportive and constructive.
Secondly , the Annual Report on Remuneration 
which will be subject to an advisory vote.
Finally, approval is sought for our new 
Performance Share Plan and Deferred Bonus 
Share Plan.
On behalf of the Committee, I commend this 
report to you and ask for your support at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting.

remuneration to 
attract and retain 
people of the 
highest calibre  
and experience

Salaries are set by the Committee. The 
Committee reviews all relevant factors  
such as: the scope and responsibilities  
of the role, the skills, experience and 
circumstances of the individual, sustained 
performance in role, the level of increase

appropriate market data. 
Salaries are reviewed annually and any 
changes normally made effective from  
1st January. 
The base salaries effective 1st January 
2016 are set out on page 48 of the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
There is no prescribed 
maximum salary. Salary 
increases will normally be 
broadly in line with increases 
awarded to other employees 
in the business, although  
the Committee retains 
discretion to award larger 
increases if it considers it 
appropriate (e.g. to reflect a 
change in role, development

Remuneration Policy
This Remuneration Policy, as determined  
by the Remuneration Committee, will be 
effective from 1 January 2016 subject to 
shareholder approval at the 2016 annual 
general meeting. This policy supersedes  
that approved by shareholders in 2014.
Overview of Remuneration Policy
The revised policy, which was developed as 
part of a remuneration review carried out 
during last year , has the following objectives:
 • T o enable the Group to recruit and retain 
individuals with the capability to lead  
the Company on its ambitious future 
growth path;
 • T o ensure that our structures  
are transparent and capable of 
straightforward explanation  
externally and to employees;
 • T o align the targets for variable pay  
with the strategic objectives for the 
Group; and
 • T o reflect the global operating model of 
the Group while recognising governance 
best practice. 
As a result of this remuneration review,  
the following key changes are proposed  
to our remuneration arrangements for 
Executive Directors:
 • Annual bonus – Under the previous policy 
there was a significant weighting towards 
fixed pay, which was not aligned with our 
philosophy of pay for performance, longer 
term alignment and equity ownership. As  
a result the maximum bonus potential for 
Executive Directors will be increased  
from 100% of base salary to 150% with 
compulsory deferral of half of any bonus 
paid for three years. Awards are subject  
to recovery and with-holding provisions.
 • Introduction of a single PSP – Our previous 
share-matching arrangement, the CIP, 
was linked to the outcome of performance 
under the annual bonus and as a result, 
the potential reward was reliant entirely 
upon short-term performance. In order  
to provide a clearer focus on long-term 
performance, and reduce complexity, the 
CIP will be terminated and replaced with  
a single PSP. As with the annual bonus, 
PSP awards are subject to recovery  
and withholding.
 • Introduction of shareholding guidelines – 
In line with best practice and to ensure 
long-term alignment with shareholders, 
shareholding guidelines of a minimum of 
200% of base salary will be introduced.
 • Clarification of recruitment and 
termination payments – The policy has 
been clarified to ensure alignment with 
best practice and to encompass new 
elements of the Executive’s packages, 
primarily the PSP. www.regus.com 45

Half of any annual bonus paid will be in 
deferred shares which will vest after three 
years, subject to continued employment 
but no further performance targets. The 
other half is paid in cash following the 
relevant year end. 
A dividend equivalent provision allows  
the Committee to pay dividends, at the 
Committee’s discretion, on vested shares

and may assume the reinvestment of 
dividends on a cumulative basis.

Performance metrics are

on the current business 
objectives. The majority 
of the bonus will be linked 
to key financial metrics, of 
which there will typically 
be a significant profit-
based element (see  
note 3 below).
Performance below 
threshold results in zero 
payment, with no more 
than three-fifths of the 
bonus available at target.

Awards will normally be made annually 
under the PSP, and will take the form of 
either nil-cost options or conditional share 
awards. Participation and individual award 
levels will be determined at the discretion 
of the Committee within the policy.
Awards vest five years following grant, 
subject to performance against pre-
determined targets (measured after 
three years) which are set and 
communicated at the time of grant.
Recovery and withholding provisions  
apply to PSP awards (see note 1 below).
A dividend equivalent provision allows  
the Committee to pay dividends, at the 
Committee’s discretion, on vested shares 
(in cash or shares) at the time of vesting 
and may assume the reinvestment of 
dividends on a cumulative basis.
The normal plan limit is 
250% of base salary.
Awards have a 
performance period  
of three financial years 
starting at the beginning 
of the financial year in 
which the award is made. 
Performance conditions 
will measure the 
long-term success  
of the Company (see  
note 4 below).
In respect of each 
performance measure, 
performance below the 
threshold target results in 
zero vesting. The starting 
point for the vesting of 
each performance 
element will be no higher 
than 25% and rises on  
a straight-line basis to 
100% for attainment of 
levels of performance 
between the threshold 
and maximum targets. 
There is no opportunity  
to re-test.
Shareholding 
guidelines
T o align Executive 
Directors’ interests 
with those of  
our long-term 
shareholders and 
other stakeholders.
Executive Directors are expected to build  
a holding in the Company’s shares to a 
minimum value of two times their base 
salary. This must be built via the retention 
of the net-of-tax shares vesting under the 
Company’s equity based share plans.
N/A N/A
Notes to the policy table: 
1) Recovery and withholding provisions may be applied as a result of misconduct, material misstatement or error in calculation of performance. Awards subsequent to the 
grant but before the expiry of the holding period, may be reduced or an Executive Director may be required to repay an award at any time within three years of the date  
on which the award vests.
2) For the avoidance of doubt, by approval of the policy, authority has been given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors 
(such as the payment of a pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes) that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous Directors’ Remuneration Reports. 
Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise. The previous Remuneration Policy included the CIP which 
is being replaced by the new PSP. Under the CIP, Executive Directors could defer a proportion of their bonus into shares and receive a performance based matching 
award for each deferred share. The final CIP awards were made in March 2015. Details of this award are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration. Subject to 
satisfaction of the relevant performance targets, the final CIP awards will be fully vested and exercisable from 4 March 2020 until 4 March 2025.
3) Annual bonus performance measures are determined at the start of each year , based on the key business priorities for the year. The majority will be based on clear 
financial targets, including a significant weighting towards profit, as this is the primary indicator of our sustainable growth.
4) PSP performance metrics are determined at the time of grant. Performance measures may include measures of profits and profitability (such as EPS), capital return  
(such as EVA or ROI) and other measures of long-term success (such as relative TSR). These measures align with our long-term goal of value creation for shareholders 
through underlying financial growth and above-market returns. 46 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Directors’ Remuneration report continued
5) As Regus operates in a number of geographies employee remuneration practices vary across the Group to reflect local market practice. However , employee 
remuneration policies are based on the same broad principles. Our primary objective in awarding variable pay is to drive achievement of results, according to role, and  
to recognise and reward excellent performance. Accordingly, to account for variances in responsibilities, influence and seniority, incentive schemes are not uniform in 
approach.
6) In order to ensure that the Remuneration Policy achieves its intended aims, the Remuneration Committee retains discretion over the operation of certain elements of 
the variable pay policy. This includes the discretion to adjust the annual bonus and PSP outcome if it is not considered to be reflective of the wider performance of Regus. 
In addition the Committee may adjust elements of the plans including, but not limited to:
•  Participation; 
•  The timing of the grant of award and/or payment; 
•  The size of an award (up to plan limits) and/or payment; 
•  Discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control; 
•  Determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) for incentive plan purposes;
•  Adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring and special dividends); and 
•  The ability to recognise exceptional events within existing performance conditions. 
 Should any such discretions be exercised, an explanation would be provided in the following Annual Report on Remuneration and may be subject to shareholder 
consultation as appropriate.
7) The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions available to it in connection 
with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the policy came into 
effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the 
individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes “payments” includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an 
award over shares, the terms of the payment are “agreed” at the time the award is granted. The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above 
(for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that 
amendment.

Consideration of conditions elsewhere

When setting the policy for the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors, the Committee 
has regard to the pay and employment 
conditions of employees within the Group. 
The Committee does not consult directly 
with employees when formulating the 
remuneration policy for Executive Directors. 
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee is dedicated to ensuring 
that Regus shareholders understand  
and support our remuneration structures. 
Accordingly, where changes are being made 
to the Remuneration Policy, or in the event 
of a significant exercise of discretion we will 
consult with shareholders, as appropriate,  
to explain our approach and rationale fully. 
Such an approach was followed in relation to 
the changes to policy for 2016. Additionally, 
the Committee considers shareholder 
feedback received in relation to each annual 
general meeting alongside any views 
expressed during the year. We actively 
engage with our largest shareholders and 
consider the range of views expressed. 
Except for in exception circumstances  
the members of the Committee, including 
the Committee Chairman, attend the 
Company’s annual general meeting and  
are available to listen to views and to  
answer shareholders’ questions about 
Directors’ remuneration.
The Committee also reviews the executive 
remuneration framework in the context of 
published shareholder guidelines. 
Approach to recruitment remuneration
When determining the remuneration 
package for a newly appointed Executive 
Director , the Committee would seek to apply 
the following principles: 
 • The package must be sufficiently 
competitive to facilitate the recruitment 
of individuals of the highest calibre and 
experience needed to shape and execute 
the Company’s strategy. At the same 
time, the Committee would seek to  
pay no more than necessary. 
 • The remuneration package for a  
new Executive Director would be set  
in accordance with the terms of the 
approved remuneration policy in force  
at the time of the appointment. Salaries 
would reflect the skills and experience  
of the individual, and may (but not  www.regus.com 47
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
necessarily) be set at a level to allow future 
salary progression to reflect performance 
in role.
 • The Committee may offer additional cash 
and/or share-based payments in the year 
of appointment when it considers these to 
be in the best interests of the Company 
and, therefore, shareholders. Per the 
remuneration policy the maximum level  
of variable remuneration which may be 
awarded is 400% of salary (of which 250% 
is permitted under the PSP under the 
exceptional circumstances limit and  
150% under the annual bonus plan). 
Performance conditions for variable  
pay in the year of appointment may  
be different to those applying to other 
directors, which would be subject to 
stretching performance conditions. 
 • Where an individual forfeits remuneration 
at a previous employer as a result of 
appointment to the Company, the 
Committee may offer compensatory 
payments or awards to facilitate 
recruitment. Such payments or awards 
could include cash as well as performance 
and non-performance-related share 
awards, and would be in such form as the 
Committee considers appropriate taking 
into account all relevant factors such as 
the form, expected value, anticipated 
vesting and timing of the forfeited 
remuneration. The aim of any such award 
would be to ensure that so far as possible, 
the expected value and structure of the 
award will be no more generous than  
the amount forfeited. 
 • Any share-based awards referred to in this 
section will be granted as far as possible 
under the Company’s existing share plans. 
If necessary, awards may be granted 
outside of these plans as permitted  
under the Listing Rules, and in line with  
the approach and the limits set out above. 
In the case of an internal appointment, 
variable pay awarded in respect of the 
incumbent’s prior role may pay out according 
to its terms of grant. In addition, any other 
ongoing remuneration obligations prior to 
their appointment may continue, provided 
that they are put to shareholders for 
approval at the first annual general meeting 
following their appointment.
The remuneration package for a newly 
appointed Non-Executive Director would 
normally be in line with the structure set  
out in the Policy T able for Non-Executive 
Directors on page 46.
Service contracts 
Executive Directors have service contracts 
with the Group which can be terminated  
by the Company or the Director by giving  
12 months’ notice. This applies to current 
Executive Directors and would normally  
be applied as the policy for future 
appointments. 
The Company may terminate employment 
of the Chief Executive by making a payment 
in lieu of notice which would not exceed  
12 months’ salary.
Under the current service agreements Mark 
Dixon’s contract provides that, on a change 
of control he may terminate the contract by 
giving one month’s notice and will, in addition 
to contractual payments for the one-month 
notice period, receive a payment equal to  
12 months’ salary, and remain eligible for  
a discretionary bonus. 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
are appointed for a three year term, which is 
renewable, with six months’ notice on either 
side, no contractual termination payments 
being due and subject to retirement 
pursuant to the Articles of Association  
at the annual general meeting. 
Policy on payment for loss of office
Where an Executive Director leaves 
employment, the Committee’s approach  
to determining any payment for loss of  
office will normally be based on the  
following principles: 
 • The Committee’s objective is to find an 
outcome which is in the best interests of 
the Company and its shareholders, taking 
into account the specific circumstances, 
contractual obligations and seeking to pay 
no more than is warranted. Payments in 
lieu of notice will not exceed 12 months’ 
salary and benefits.
 • T reatment of annual bonus: There is  
no contractual right to receive an annual 
bonus in the year of termination. However 
the Committee has discretion for certain 
leavers to make a payment under the 
annual bonus. This will reflect the period of 
service during the year and performance 
(measured at the same time as 
performance for other plan participants,  
if feasible). Should the Committee make  
a payment in these circumstances, the 
rationale would be set out in the following 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
 • T reatment of share plans: If an Executive 
Director leaves employment with the 
Company unvested PSP and deferred 
bonus shares will lapse unless the 
Committee in its absolute discretion 
determines otherwise for reasons 
including, amongst others, injury, disability, 
retirement, redundancy and death. In such 
circumstances an Executive Director’s 
award normally vests based on the  
time served and in the case of the PSP, 
achievement of performance criteria. 
Should the Committee adjust the time 
pro-rating, then this would be explained  
in the following Annual Report on 
Remuneration. If the Executive Director 
ceases to be an employee for any reason 
other than those specified above then  
the award shall lapse immediately on  
such cessation.
The terms of any other unvested share 
awards on termination will be as set out  
in the prior policy.
Awards will vest on the normal vesting 
date unless the Committee determines,  
in its discretion, that awards will vest at  
the date of cessation. 
The Committee reserves the right to  
make additional exit payments where  
such payments are made in good faith in 
discharge of an existing legal obligation  
(or by way of damages for breach of such  
an obligation) or by way of settlement  
or compromise of any claim arising in 
connection with the termination of  
a Director’s office or employment. 
Policy in Respect of External Board 
Appointments for Executive Directors
It is recognised that external non-executive 
directorships may be beneficial for both the 
Company and Executive Director. At the 
discretion of the Board, Executive Directors 
are permitted to retain fees received in 
respect of any such non-executive 
directorship.  48 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Illustration of Remuneration Policy
The charts opposite illustrate the application of the 
Remuneration Policy set out in the Policy T able for Executive 
Directors. This assumes the level of fixed remuneration (salary , 
benefits and pension) as at 1 January 2016 and the following  
in respect of each scenario:
 • “Minimum” represents fixed remuneration only (i.e. current 
salary, benefits and pension).
 • “T arget” represents fixed remuneration plus three-fifths of 
the maximum annual bonus award and threshold (25%) 
vesting of the PSP award
 • “Maximum” represents the maximum annual bonus of 
150% of salary and full vesting of the normal PSP grant  
of 200% of base salary.

Members of the Committee
All members of the Committee are independent. Committee membership during the year and attendance at the meetings is set out on  
page 42. In addition to the designated members of the Remuneration Committee, the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Company 
Secretary also attended Committee meetings during the year although none were present during discussions concerning their own 
remuneration.
T erms of reference
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s website (www.regus.com).
Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for 2016
As summarised within the introductory letter , and set out fully within the Remuneration Policy section, a series of amendments to the 
Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy are proposed. Details of how we intend to operate our policy in 2016, subject to shareholder 
approval, are outlined below.
Base salaries for the Executive Directors 
The salaries for the Executive Directors for 2016 (and compared to 2015) are as follows. Dominik de Daniel was appointed with effect from  
1 November 2015, and his salary will first be reviewed with effect from 1 January 2017.
Salary 2015 Salary 2016
Percentage 
increase
Mark Dixon £587,000 £825,000 41%
Dominik de Daniel £725,000 £725,000 0%
Current salaries for Mark Dixon (and formerly Dominique Yates) were set in the context of the Company’s positioning five years ago which  
was towards the bottom end of the FTSE 350, when the scale of the Group’s operations was significantly smaller. With the appointment of 
Dominik de Daniel as Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating, it was necessary to pay considerably above the level of the previous Chief 
Financial Officer. Dominik de Daniel’s salary on appointment is £725,000.
As well as positioning ourselves competitively when recruiting externally, we must also set salaries appropriately for those already within the 
organisation. Accordingly, from 1 January 2016 Mark Dixon’s salary was increased to £825,000. While this is a significant increase from the 
current level, we believe it is the right decision for the Company in the context of the external environment to reflect the market rate for  
an executive who has led the Company through a period of outstanding success and is effectively implementing an ambitious profitable  
growth strategy.
Annual Bonus
For 2016, the maximum bonus potential for both Executive Directors is 150% of salary. The on-target bonus is 90% of salary. Half of any 
bonus paid will be deferred into shares, which will vest after three years subject to continued employment.
The 2016 annual bonus will include a measurement against an operating profit target ranging from threshhold to stretch. The target is not 
being disclosed prospectively as it is commercially sensitive; however a description of relative performance will be included in next year’s 
Annual Report.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
PSP awards will be made at 200% of salary to Executive Directors, subject to shareholder approval of the revised Remuneration Policy and  
the new PSP.

The salary, benefits, pension and cash element of the bonus for Dominique Yates were paid in Swiss francs and have been converted to 
sterling for the table above using the average exchange rate for the relevant year. Dominique Yates stepped down from the Board  
on 1 November 2015. His salary, benefits, pension, annual bonus and CIP have been pro-rated to reflect his period of qualifying service. 
Dominik de Daniel was appointed to the Board on 1 November 2015. Remuneration detailed above reflects time served.
Benefits – Include private health insurance and life insurance and for Dominique Yates, a representation allowance and expatriate allowances.
Pension – Includes pension contributions of 7% of salary into defined contribution arrangements (or cash equivalent) plus any contributions  
in accordance with standard local practice or employment regulations.
Annual bonus – The bonus shown is the full awarded bonus in respect of the relevant financial year for the period served as a Director.
CIP awards – Includes the value of Matching Share awards made to Mark Dixon and Dominique Yates under the CIP in previous years which 
vested in respect of a performance period ending in the relevant financial year. The vesting of the final tranche of the 2008/2009 Matching 
Shares is included in the 2014 column (820,205 shares vested out of the maximum of 954,420). The vesting of the first tranche of the 2013 
Matching Shares is included in the 2015 column (371,485 shares vested out of the maximum of 380,011). The figure reflects the average 
market price of shares in the last quarter of 2015, being 313.028p per share.
François Pauly joined the Board with effect from 19 May 2015.
Alex Sulkowski stepped down from the Board with effect from 19 May 2015.
Determination of 2015 Annual Bonus
The 2015 bonus plan was based on performance against an operating profit target. The achieved operating profit of £144.8 exceeded the 
operating profit target for full bonus while maintaining our growth objectives, therefore bonuses were paid at 100%.
Dominik de Daniel’s bonus was pro-rated for the two month period served during the year.
The awards will be subject to three independently operated performance metrics as summarised below:
Performance conditions Threshold vesting Threshold Maximum 
EPS (33.3% weighting) 0% Compound annual growth of 5% Compound annual  
growth of 25%
Relative TSR versus FTSE 350 (excluding 
investment trusts) (33.3% weighting)

growth above median
Return on investment (33.3% weighting) 0% Return to be equal to 2015 performance Return to be 300 basis points

The first awards under the PSP will be made in early 2016 and will replace any CIP grants that would otherwise have been made in 2016.

CIP awards vesting in respect of 2015
The 2013 Matching Share award is divided into three separate equal tranches subject to performance periods over three, four and five years 
respectively from 1 January 2013. The first tranche of the 2013 Matching Share award was based on a three-year performance period to  
31 December 2015. The vesting conditions for this tranche are outlined below.

The Committee has assessed performance against the TSR and EPS targets set in 2013 and concluded that 97% of the total award should 
vest (and the remainder of that tranche shall lapse).
 • TSR (25% of total award). From a base point of 100%, Regus achieved a TSR value of 243.3% compared to 24.9% for the FTSE All Share 
Index over the performance period, equating to a vesting of 100% of this part of the award. 
 • EPS (75% of total award). Based on achieving a 2015 EPS of 13.9p, which reflects underlying performance delivered during the three-year 
performance period, the Committee concluded that 97% of this part of the award should vest.
CIP granted during the financial year
The Executive Directors deferred 50% of their 2014 annual bonus into Investment Shares under the CIP.
For each Investment Share held the Executive Directors may earn up to a maximum of four Matching Shares. The Matching Shares will be 
released in March 2020 at the end of the holding period, subject to continuous employment with the Group and the achievement of EPS and 
TSR performance conditions. As the Investment Shares had a value of 50% of salary the maximum number of Matching Shares awarded in 
2015 was equivalent to 200% of salary. 
Details of the Investment Share and Matching Share awards made during 2015 to the Executive Directors are shown in the table below. 
Executive Director T ype of interest Face value (£’000) Threshold vesting End of holding period
Mark Dixon Investment Shares 293.5 N/A 3 March 2018
Matching Shares 1,174.0 25% 3 March 2020
Dominique Y ates Investment Shares 167.8 N/A 3 March 2018
Matching Shares* 670.9 25% 3 March 2020
* Dominique Yates will leave the Group in 2016 and therefore the Matching Shares awarded to Dominique Yates will lapse.
The face value has been calculated using the share price of 221.8p, the closing price prior to the date of grant (4 March 2015). 
The vesting of the Matching Shares is subject to continuous employment with the Group and to the EPS and TSR performance conditions,  
as detailed below:
TSR target (25%)
The number of shares vesting will be determined by comparing the Company’s TSR to the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE 350 Index 
(excluding financial services and mining companies and investment trusts) (the “FTSE 350 Constituents”) over the performance period 
commencing on 1 January 2015 and ending on 31 December 2017.

following targets:

The target for 2017 is based on compound annual growth from an equivalent base year EPS figure for 2014 of 7.4p.
Straightline vesting occurs between these points. No shares will vest below the threshold target.
One-off award on recruitment of Dominik de Daniel
On 2 November 2015, an award over 328,751 ordinary shares of 1p each in the Company was granted to the Company’s Chief Financial 
Officer and Chief Operating Officer , Dominik de Daniel. The award was structured as a conditional award and was granted under a one-off 
award arrangement established under Listing Rule 9.4.2(2) in order to facilitate the recruitment of Dominik de Daniel. 
The level of the award was determined by reference to compensation otherwise due to Dominik de Daniel, that he gave up upon accepting 
employment with Regus.
In the normal course of events the award will vest over five years, and to the extent to which performance conditions are achieved. The 
applicable performance target is set out below:
Performance metric T arget Vesting at target
Compound annual growth in EPS over the performance period 5% 100%
T otal pension benefits
During the year under review, the Executive Directors received pension contributions of 7% of salary into defined contribution arrangements 
(or cash equivalent) plus any contributions in accordance with standard local practice or employment regulations. Details of the value of 
pension contributions received in the year under review are set out in the Pension column of the single total figure remuneration table.
Statement of share scheme interests and shareholdings
Executive Directors are required to build up and maintain a shareholding. The following table sets out for Directors who served during the year , 
the total number of shares held (including the interests of connected persons) as at 31 December 2015 alongside the interests in share

Payments for loss of office to past Directors
Dominique Yates stepped down from the Board on 1 November 2015. He will remain an employee of the Group for  
a period which will end no later than 31 August 2016. The Committee has determined that Dominique Yates will continue to receive his 
contractual salary and contractual benefits until 31 August 2016. If he leaves his employment earlier his salary and benefits will be 
appropriately adjusted.
The Committee considered the bonus of Dominique Yates at the same time as for other Executive Directors and concluded that a bonus of 
£279,400 should be awarded for the ten months of the year that he was a Director.  52 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

following a competitive selection process undertaken by the 
Committee. The fees charged by Aon Hewitt for the provision of 
independent advice to the Committee during 2015 were £94,000. 
The Committee is comfortable that Aon Hewitt’s engagement 
partner and team are objective and independent in their provision  
of advice to the Committee.
Statement of voting at the annual general meeting
The Committee is directly accountable to shareholders and, in this

respect of disclosure to the auditor.
The Directors do not consider any

Results and dividends
Profit before taxation for the year was 
£145.7m (2014: £87.1m).
The Directors are pleased to recommend  
a final dividend of £28.8m (2014: £25.8m), 
being 3.10p per share (2014: 2.75p per share). 
The total dividend for the year will therefore  
be 4.50p per share, made up of the interim 
dividend of 1.4p per share paid in October 
2015 (2014: 1.25p per share) and, assuming 
the final dividend is approved by shareholders 
at the forthcoming annual general meeting, an 
additional 3.10p per share (2014: 2.75p per 
share) which is expected to be paid on 27 May 
2016 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 29 April 2016.
Policy and practice on payment of 
creditors
The Group does not follow a universal code 
dealing specifically with payments to 
suppliers but, where appropriate, our 
practice is to:
 • agree the terms of payment upfront with 
the supplier;
 • ensure that suppliers are made aware of 
these terms of payment; and
 • pay in accordance with contractual and 
other legal obligations.
At 31 December 2015, the number of 
creditor days outstanding for the Group  
was 31 days (2014: 21 days) and for the 
Company was 99 days (2014: 19 days).
Employees
The Group treats applicants for employment 
with disabilities with full and fair consideration 
according to their skills and capabilities. 
Should an employee become disabled during 
their employment, efforts are made to retain 
them in their current employment or to 
explore opportunities for their retraining or 
redeployment elsewhere within the Group. 
Political and charitable donations
It is the Group’s policy not to make political 
donations either in the UK or overseas. The 
Group made charitable donations of 
£209,905 during the year (2014: £155,328).
Capital structure
The Company’s share capital comprises 
950,969,822 issued and fully paid up ordinary 
shares of 1p nominal value in Regus plc (2014: 
950,969,822). All ordinary shares have the 
same rights to vote at general meetings of the 
Company and to participate in distributions. 
There are no securities in issue that carry

traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Details of the role of the Board of Directors 
(the ‘Board’) and the process for the

Directors’ statements
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and which disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company and 
to enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with applicable law and 
regulations. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open 
to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud  
and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the 
Directors are also responsible for preparing  
a Directors’ Report, a Remuneration Report 
and a Corporate Governance Statement 
that complies with that law and those 
regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s websites. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Statutory statement as to disclosure  
to auditor
The Directors who held office at the date  
of approval of this Directors’ statements 
confirm that:
 • so far as they are each aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 • each Director has taken all the steps  
that he ought to have taken as a Director 
in order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditor is aware of 
that information.
These financial statements have been 
approved by the Directors of the Company. 
The Directors confirm that the financial 
statements have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable law and 
regulations and that they include a  
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the Annual Report and 
financial statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the Group and parent 
company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and parent company financial 
statements for each financial year. Under 
that law, they are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the  
EU and applicable law and have elected  
to prepare the parent company annual 
accounts in accordance with Luxembourg 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice  
and applicable law.
Under company law, the Directors must  
not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and parent company and their profit or loss 
for the period.
In preparing each of the Group and parent 
company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 • select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
 • make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 • for the Group financial statements,  
state whether they have been prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU;
 • for the parent company annual accounts, 
state whether applicable Luxembourg 
accounting standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the parent 
company annual accounts; and
 • prepare the financial statements on  
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the  
Group and the parent company will 
continue in business.  www.regus.com 55

Report of the Réviseur d’Entreprises 
Agréé 
Report on the consolidated financial statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements of Regus plc (société anonyme), which comprise  
the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 and  
the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, 
changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and  
a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information, as set out on pages 56 to 99. 
Board of Directors’ responsibility for the consolidated 
financial statements  
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and  
fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  
as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control  
as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free  
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Responsibility of the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit  
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing as adopted 
for Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur 
Financier. Those standards require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements  
are free from material misstatement. 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements. The procedures selected depend on the judgement  
of the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé, including the assessment of  
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk 
assessments, the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé considers internal 
control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation  
of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not  
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness  
of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness 
of accounting estimates made by the Board of Directors, as well  
as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated  
financial statements.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient  
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
Opinion 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements, as set out on 
pages 56 to 99, give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position of Regus plc (société anonyme) as of 31 December 2015, 
and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated 
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. 
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements 
The consolidated Directors’ report, including the corporate 
governance statement, which is the responsibility of the Board of 
Directors, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements 
and includes the information required by the law with respect to  
the Corporate Governance Statement.

1. Authorisation of financial statements 
The Group and Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors  
on 1 March 2016 and the balance sheets were signed on the Board’s behalf by Mark Dixon and Dominik de Daniel. Regus plc S.A. is a public 
limited company incorporated in Jersey and registered and domiciled in Luxembourg. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the 
London Stock Exchange. 
Regus plc S.A. owns a network of business centres which are leased to a variety of business customers. Information on the  
Group’s structure is provided in note 32, and information on other related party relationships of the Group is provided in note 31. 
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (‘Adopted IFRSs’). The Company prepares its parent company annual accounts in accordance 
with Luxembourg GAAP; extracts from these are presented on page 100. 
2. Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’)  
and equity account the Group’s interest in the associate and jointly controlled entities. The extract from the parent company annual 
accounts presents information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group. 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements. 
Amendments to adopted IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) with an effective date from 1 January 2015 did not have a material effect on the Group financial 
statements, unless otherwise indicated. 
The following standards, interpretations and amendments to standards were adopted by the Group for periods commencing on or after  
1 January 2015: 
IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions – Amendments to IAS 19 
IAS 40 Investment Property – Amendments to IAS 40 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations – Contingent consideration arrangements 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations – Joint arrangements 
IFRS 8  Operating Segments – Amendments to IFRS 8 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement – Amendments to IFRS 13 
Various Annual Improvements (2010 – 2012 Cycle) 
Various Annual Improvements (2011 – 2013 Cycle) 
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the consolidated financial 
statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 33. 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, with the exception of certain financial assets and liabilities  
that are measured at fair value as described in note 24. 
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing the consolidated financial statements on pages 56 to 99. 
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors have considered the further 
information included in the business activities commentary as set out on pages 13 to 15 as well as the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties as set out on pages 21 to 24. 
Further details on the going concern basis of preparation can be found in note 24 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  
on page 81. 
These Group consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (£), which is Regus plc’s functional currency, and all values 
are in million pounds, rounded to one decimal place, except where indicated otherwise. 
The attributable results of those companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the periods of ownership. 
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.  
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on  
an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases or  
the associate qualifies as a disposal group at which point the investment is carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and  
carrying value.  
Joint ventures include jointly controlled entities that are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, whereby the Group 
has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. The consolidated financial 
statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses of jointly controlled entities on an equity accounted basis, 
from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases or the jointly controlled entity qualifies as a disposal  
group at which point the investment is carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.

62 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in a joint venture, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of 
further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on  
behalf of a joint venture. 
On 19 April 2006 the Group acquired the remaining 58% of the shares of the UK business that were not already owned by the Group. As  
a result the Group fully consolidated the UK business from that date. The acquisition was accounted for through the purchase method and  
as a consequence the entire assets and liabilities of the UK business were revalued to fair value. The effect of these adjustments on the  
42% of the UK business already owned was reflected in the revaluation reserve. 
On 14 October 2008, Regus plc acquired the entire share capital of Regus Group plc in exchange for the issue of new shares of Regus plc  
on the basis of one share in Regus plc for one share held previously in Regus Group plc. At the date of the transaction, Regus plc had nominal 
assets and liabilities and therefore the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of Regus plc by Regus Group plc. Consequently, 
no fair value acquisition adjustments were required and the aggregate of the Group reserves have been attributed to Regus plc. 
IFRSs not yet effective 
The following IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements as they are effective 
for years beginning on or after 1 January 2015 or have not yet been endorsed by the European Union. Except for IFRS16 Leases, their 
adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements: 
IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative (Amendment to IAS 1) 1 January 2016
IAS 16 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 1 January 2016
IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 1 January 2016
IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of interests in Joint operations – Amendments to IFRS 11 1 January 2016
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 1 January 2016
 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle 1 January 2016
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
The Group did not adopt any standards, interpretations and amendments to standards which were available for optional early adoption and 
relevant to the Group. The Group will adopt the above standards or amendments in the year in which they become effective and/or endorsed 
by the European Union, whichever is later.  
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has the rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences. The results are 
consolidated until the date control ceases or the subsidiary qualifies as a disposal group, at which point the assets and liabilities are carried  
at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value. 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount was 
estimated at 31 October 2015. At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of these assets to determine whether there is 
an indicator of impairment. If any indicator is identified then the assets’ recoverable amount is re-evaluated. 
The carrying amount of the Group’s other non-financial assets (other than deferred tax assets) are reviewed at the balance sheet date to 
determine whether there is an indicator of impairment. If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated. 
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other 
assets or groups of assets. The Group has identified individual business centres as the CGU. 
We evaluate the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment at the centre (CGU) level where there are indicators of impairment. 
Centres (CGUs) are grouped by country of operation for the purposes of carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill as this is the lowest 
level at which it can be assessed. 
Individual fittings and equipment in our centres or elsewhere in the business that become obsolete or are damaged are assessed and 
impaired where appropriate. 
Calculation of recoverable amount 
The recoverable amount of relevant assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments  
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Goodwill 
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate 
of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable  www.regus.com 63
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
 
www.regus.com  63 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the 
Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used 
to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the re-assessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets 
acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss.  
Positive goodwill is stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value. An impairment test is carried out annually and, in addition, 
whenever indicators exist that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
Business combinations that took place prior to the Group’s transition date to IFRS on 1 January 2004 have not been restated under the 
requirements of IFRS. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired separately from the business are capitalised at cost. Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition  
of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill if their fair value can be identified and measured reliably on initial recognition. 
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: 
Brand – Regus brand Indefinite life
Brand – Other acquired brands 20 years
Computer software Up to 5 years
Customer lists 2 years
Management agreements Minimum duration of the contract
Amortisation of intangible assets is expensed through administration expenses in the income statement. 
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests 
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill 
is recognised as a result. Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are based 
on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. 
Assets held for sale 
Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying value of the identified assets and its fair value less cost to sell. 
Leases 
Plant and equipment leases for which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases. All other leases, including all of the Group’s property leases, are categorised as operating leases. 
Finance leases 
Plant and equipment acquired by way of a finance lease is capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of its fair value and  
the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception. Future payments under finance leases are included in creditors, net of any 
future finance charges. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. 
Finance charges are recognised in the income statement over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability. 
Operating leases 
Minimum lease payments under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  
Lease incentives, including partner contributions and rent-free periods are included in the calculation of minimum lease payments.  
The commencement of the lease term is the date from which the Group is entitled to use the leased asset. The lease term is the  
non-cancellable period of the lease, together with any further periods for which the Group has the option to continue to lease the  
asset and when at the inception of the lease it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise that option. 
Contingent rentals include rent increases based on future inflation indices or non-guaranteed rental payments based on centre turnover or 
profitability and are excluded from the calculation of minimum lease payments. Contingent rentals are recognised in the income statement 
as they are incurred. 
Onerous lease provisions are an estimate of the net amounts payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, discounted at  
an appropriate pre-tax rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. 
Partner contributions 
Partner contributions are contributions from our business partners (property owners and landlords) towards the initial costs of opening  
a business centre, including the fit-out of the property and the losses that we incur early in the centre life. The partner contribution is  
treated as a lease incentive and is amortised over the period of the lease. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is calculated  
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows:  
Buildings 50 years
Leasehold improvements 10 years
Furniture 10 years
Office equipment and telephones 5 years
Computer hardware 3 – 5 years 64 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

2. Accounting policies (continued) 
Revenue 
Revenue from the provision of services to customers is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable (excluding sales 
taxes). Where rent-free periods are granted to customers, rental income is spread on a straight-line basis over the length of the customer 
contract. 
Workstations 
Workstation revenue is recognised when the provision of the service is rendered. Amounts invoiced in advance are accounted for  
as deferred income and recognised as revenue upon provision of the service. 
Customer service income 
Service income (including the rental of meeting rooms) is recognised as services are rendered. In circumstances where Regus acts as  
an agent for the sale and purchase of goods to customers, only the commission fee earned is recognised as revenue. 
Management and franchise fees 
Fees received for the provision of initial and subsequent services are recognised as revenue as the services are rendered. Fees charged  
for the use of continuing rights granted by the agreement, or for other services provided during the period of the agreement, are recognised 
as revenue as the services are provided or the rights used. 
Membership card income 
Revenue from the sale of membership cards is deferred and recognised over the period that the benefits of the membership card are 
expected to be provided. 
These categories represent all material sources of revenue earned from the provision of global workplace solutions. 
Employee benefits 
The Group’s major pension plans are of the defined contribution type. For these plans the Group’s contribution and other paid and unpaid 
benefits earned by the employees are charged to the income statement as incurred. 
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method. 
Re-measurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding net interest and the return on plan  
assets, excluding net interest, are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to 
retained earnings through other comprehensive income (OCI) in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified  
to profit or loss in subsequent periods. 
Service costs are recognised in profit or loss, and include current and past service costs as well as gains and losses on curtailments. 
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Group recognises the following 
changes in the net defined benefit obligation under ‘cost of sales’, ‘selling, general and administration expenses’ and ‘research and 
development expenses’ in the consolidated income statement: service costs comprising current service costs; past service costs;  
and gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements. 
Settlements of defined benefit schemes are recognised in the period in which the settlement occurs. 
Share-based payments 
The share option programme entitles certain employees and Directors to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company; these awards are 
granted by the ultimate parent. 
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured  
at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the 
options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model or the Monte Carlo method, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the options were granted. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only 
to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. 
Share appreciation rights (CIP) are also granted by the Company to certain employees. The fair value of the amount payable to the employee 
is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is initially recognised at grant date and spread over the 
period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The fair value of the share appreciation rights is measured 
based on the Monte Carlo valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.  
Taxation 
Tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes  
and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill;  
the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount   www.regus.com 65
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
 
www.regus.com  65 
of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities,  
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised for all unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event that 
can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Restructuring provisions are made for direct expenditures of a business reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed and well 
advanced and where the appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date. 
Provision is made for onerous contracts to the extent that the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be delivered, discounted using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital. 
Net finance expenses 
Interest charges and income are accounted for in the income statement on an accruals basis. Financing transaction costs that relate to 
financial liabilities are charged to interest expense using the effective interest rate method and are recognised within the carrying value  
of the related financial liability on the balance sheet. Fees paid for the arrangement of credit facilities are recognised as a prepayment and 
recognised through the finance expense over the term of the facility. In the event of a facility being drawn the relevant unamortised portion 
of the fee is recognised within the carrying value of the financial liability and charged to the interest expense using the effective interest  
rate method. 
Where assets or liabilities on the Group balance sheet are carried at net present value, the increase in the amount due to unwinding the 
discount is recognised as a finance expense or finance income as appropriate. 
Costs arising on bank guarantees and letters of credit and foreign exchange gains or losses are included in other finance costs (note 8). 
Interest bearing borrowings and other financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities, including interest bearing borrowings, are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent 
to initial recognition, financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised 
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate method. 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired. 
Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss where the liability is either held for trading or is 
designated as held at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated  
at fair value with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement. 
Financial assets 
Financial assets are classified either at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets or  
loans and receivables. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined on initial recognition. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and changes therein, including any interest or dividend income, 
are recognised in profit or loss. 
Held-to-maturity financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, they are measured at amortised costs using the effective interest rate method.  
Available-for-sale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses and foreign currency differences on debt 
instruments, are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the fair value reserve. When these assets are derecognised, the gain or loss 
accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss. 
Trade and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and 
receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. Interest 
income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when recognition would be immaterial. 
Customer deposits 
Deposits received from customers against non-performance of the contract are held on the balance sheet as a current liability until they are 
returned to the customer at the end of their relationship with the Group. 
Foreign currency transactions and foreign operations 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the closing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the gains or 
losses on translation are taken to the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in 
a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. The results and cash flows of foreign operations are 
translated using the average rate for the period. Assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments, of foreign operations are 
translated using the closing rate, with all exchange differences arising on consolidation being recognised in other comprehensive income, 
and presented in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. Exchange differences are released to the income statement on disposal.  66 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

66 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group’s policy on the use of derivative financial instruments can be found in note 24. Derivative financial instruments are measured 
initially at fair value and changes in the fair value are recognised through profit or loss unless the derivative financial instrument has been 
designated as a cash flow hedge whereby the effective portion of changes in the fair value are deferred in equity.

3. Segmental analysis – statutory basis 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, 
including those that relate to transactions with other operating segments. An operating segment’s results are reviewed regularly by the chief 
operating decision maker (the Board of Directors of the Group) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and 
assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. 
The business is run on a worldwide basis but managed through four principal geographical segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East and 
Africa (EMEA); Asia Pacific; and the United Kingdom. These geographical segments exclude the Group’s non-trading, holding and corporate 
management companies. The results of business centres in each of these regions form the basis for reporting geographical results to the 
chief operating decision maker. All reportable segments are involved in the provision of global workplace solutions. 
The Group’s reportable segments operate in different markets and are managed separately because of the different economic 
characteristics that exist in each of those markets. Each reportable segment has its own discrete senior management team responsible  
for the performance of the segment. 
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the Annual Report and Accounts for Regus plc for the 
year ended 31 December 2014. The performance of each segment is assessed on the basis of the segment operating profit, which excludes 
internal revenue, corporate overheads and foreign exchange gains and losses arising on transactions with other operating segments.

Revenue in the “All other operating segments” category is generated from services related to the provision of workplace solutions, including 
fees earned from franchise agreements and commissions earned from the sale of outsourced workplace solution products. Revenue from 
internal customers is determined by reference to current market prices. 
4. Segmental analysis – entity-wide disclosures 
The Group’s primary activity and only business segment is the provision of global workplace solutions, therefore all revenue is attributed  
to a single group of similar products and services. It is not meaningful to separate this group into further categories of products. Revenue  
is recognised where the service is provided. 
The Group has a diversified customer base and no single customer contributes a material percentage of the Group’s revenue. 
The Group’s revenue from external customers and non-current assets analysed by foreign country is as follows:

The movements in deferred taxes included above are after the offset of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities where there  
is a legally enforceable right to set off and they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority. 
Deferred tax assets recognised on short-term temporary differences consist predominantly of provisions deductible when paid and  
share-based payments. Deferred tax assets have been recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities on the basis that there are forecast 
taxable profits in the entities concerned. 
At the balance sheet date, the temporary difference arising from unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries was £189.9m  
(2014: £249.8m). The only tax that would arise on these reserves would be non-creditable withholding tax.

Cash-generating units (CGUs), defined as individual business centres, are grouped by country of operation for the purposes of carrying out 
impairment reviews of goodwill as this is the lowest level at which it can be assessed. Goodwill acquired through business combinations is 
held at a country level and is subject to impairment reviews based on the cash flows of the CGUs within that country.

The indefinite life intangible asset relates to the brand value arising from the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year 
ended 31 December 2006 (see note 13). 
The value in use for each country has been determined using a model which derives the individual value in use for each country from the value 
in use of the Group as a whole. Although the model includes budgets and forecasts prepared by management it also reflects external factors, 
such as capital market risk pricing as reflected in the market capitalisation of the Group and prevailing tax rates, which have been used to 
determine the risk adjusted discount rate for the Group. Management believes that the projected cash flows are a reasonable reflection  
of the likely outcomes over the medium to long term. In the event that trading conditions deteriorate beyond the assumptions used in  
the projected cash flows, it is also possible that impairment charges could arise in future periods. 
The following key assumptions have been used in calculating value in use for each country: 
• Future cash flows are based on the budget for 2016 approved by the Board. The model excludes cost savings and restructurings that are 
anticipated but had not been committed to at the date of the determination of the value in use. Thereafter forecasts have been prepared 
by management for a further four years from 2016 that reflect an average annual growth rate of 3% (2015: 3%).  
• These forecasts exclude the impact of both organic and acquisitive growth expected to take place in future periods.  
• Management consider these projections to be a reasonable projection of margins expected at the mid-cycle position. Cash flows beyond 
2019 have been extrapolated using a 2% growth rate which management believes is a reasonable long-term growth rate for any of the 
markets in which the relevant countries operate. A terminal value is included in the assessment, reflecting the Group’s expectation that it 
will continue to operate in these markets and the long-term nature of the businesses. 
• The Group applies a country specific pre-tax discount rate to the pre-tax cash flows for each country. The country specific discount rate  
is based on the underlying weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the Group. The Group WACC is then adjusted for each country to 
reflect the assessed market risk specific to that country. The Group pre-tax WACC increased marginally from 12.4% in 2014 to 12.7% in 
2015 (post-tax WACC: 10.2%). The country specific pre-tax WACC reflecting the respective market risk adjustment has been set between 
12.1% and 17.3% (2014: 11.3% to 17.2%). 
The amount by which the value in use exceeds the carrying amounts of goodwill are sufficiently large to enable the Directors to conclude that 
a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not result in an impairment charge in any of the countries. Foreseeable events 
are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of such a significant nature as to result in the goodwill carrying amount exceeding their 
recoverable amount. The forecast models used in assessing the impairment of goodwill are based on the related business centre structure 
at the end of the year. These models therefore do not reflect the expected improvement in margin as new centres mature. 
The key assumptions used in the US model forecasts a centre contribution of 26%, with an average centre contribution of 26% over the  
next five years. Revenue and costs grow at 3% per annum from 2015, maintaining a terminal 2020 centre gross margin of 26%. Thereafter  
a 2% long-term growth rate is assumed on revenue and cost into perpetuity. The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount 
rate of 16% (2014: 15%). 
The UK model forecasts a 2015 centre contribution of 21%, with an average centre contribution of 21% over the next five years. Revenue 
and costs grow at 3% per annum from 2015, maintaining a terminal 2020 centre gross margin of 21%. Thereafter a 2% long-term growth 
rate is assumed on revenue and cost into perpetuity. The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 13% (2014: 13%).

12. Goodwill (continued) 
Management has considered the following sensitivities: 
Market growth and WIPOW – Management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and WIPOW. The value in use 
calculation shows that if the long-term growth rate was reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of the US and UK would still be greater  
than their carrying value. 
Discount rate – Management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the calculation. The value-in-use 
calculation shows that for the recoverable amount to be less than its carrying value, the pre-tax discount rate would have to be increased  
to 30% (2014: 23%) for the US and 36% (2014: 35%) for the UK.

Included with the brand value is £11.2m relating to the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year ended 31 December 
2006. The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an indefinite useful life due to the fact that the value of the brand is 
intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group. 
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an indefinite useful life no amortisation is charged but the carrying value 
is assessed for impairment on an annual basis. The brand was tested at the balance sheet date against the recoverable amount of the UK 
business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business (see note 12). 
The remaining amortisation life for non-indefinite life brands is nine years.

(2014: £3.9m) is pledged against various other commitments of the Group.  
Non-cash changes comprise the amortisation of the debt issue costs, finance leases and movements in debt maturity. 
24. Financial instruments and financial risk management 
The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to financial instruments and the management of capital are 
determined at Group level. The Group’s Board maintains responsibility for the risk management strategy of the Group and the Chief Financial 
Officer is responsible for policy on a day-to-day basis. The Chief Financial Officer and Group Treasurer review the Group’s risk management 
strategy and policies on an ongoing basis. The Board has delegated to the Group Audit Committee the responsibility for applying an effective 
system of internal control and compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. The Audit Committee is supported by the Head of Risk 
Management in performing this role. 
Exposure to credit, interest rate, and currency risks arise in the normal course of business. 
Going concern 
The Strategic Report on pages 1 to 27 of the Annual Report and Accounts sets out the Group’s strategy and the factors that are likely to 
affect the future performance and position of the business. The financial review on pages 18 to 20 within the Strategic Report reviews the 
trading performance, financial position, and cash flows of the Group. During the year ended 31 December 2015 the Group made a significant 
investment in growth and the Group’s net debt position increased by £52.6m to a net debt position of £190.6 as at 31 December 2015. The 
investment in growth is funded by a combination of cash flow generated from the Group’s mature business centres and debt. The Group has 
a £320m revolving credit facility provided by a group of relationship banks with a final maturity in 2020. As at 31 December 2015 £205.1m was 
available and undrawn. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report  
and Accounts. 
Credit risk 
Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a financial instrument and arises principally 
in relation to customer contracts and the Group’s cash deposits. 
A diversified customer base, requirement for customer deposits, and payments in advance on workstation contracts minimise the Group’s 
exposure to customer credit risk. No single customer contributes a material percentage of the Group’s revenue. The Group’s policy is to 
provide against trade receivables when specific debts are judged to be irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures have commenced. 
A provision is created where debts are more than three months overdue which reflects the Group’s historical experience of the likelihood  
of recoverability of these trade receivables. These provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess changes in the likelihood  
of recoverability. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date, analysed by geographic region, is summarised below.

At 31 December 2015, the Group maintained a provision of £11.6m against potential bad debts (2014: £8.3m) arising from trade receivables. 
The Group had provided £6.5m (2014: £4.5m) in the year and utilised £3.2m (2014: £2.5m). Customer deposits of £331.6m (2014: £290.4m) 
are held by the Group, mitigating the risk of default. 
The Group believes no provision is generally required for trade receivables that are not overdue as the Group collects the majority of its 
revenue in advance of the provision of office services and requires deposits from its customers.  
Cash investments and derivative financial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and management 
does not expect any of these counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.  
Liquidity risk 
The Group manages liquidity risk by closely monitoring the global cash position, the available and undrawn credit facilities, and forecast  
capital expenditure and expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group has free cash and liquid 
investments (excluding blocked cash) of £47.9m (2014: £55.2m). In addition to cash and liquid investments, the Group had £205.1m available 
and undrawn under its committed borrowings. The Directors consider the Group has adequate liquidity to meet day-to-day requirements. 
In May 2014 the Group issued debt securities for a total amount of EUR 210.0m (£154.2m) using the German “Schuldschein” framework for 
debt issuance. These securities consisted of EUR 165.0m of three year notes and EUR 45.0m of five year notes, and were sold to a number  
of banks and institutional investors. 
The Group maintains a £320m revolving credit facility with a final maturity date in September 2020. As at 31 December £205.1m was 
available and undrawn under this facility. 
Although the Group has net current liabilities of £446.1m (2014: £303.9m), the Group does not consider that this gives rise to a liquidity risk.  
A large proportion of the net current liabilities comprise non-cash liabilities such as deferred income which will be recognised in future periods 
through the income statement. Although the Group holds customer deposits of £331.6m (2014: £290.4m) these are spread across a large 
number of customers and no deposit held for an individual customer is material. Therefore the Group does not believe the balance 
represents a liquidity risk. The net current liabilities, excluding deferred income, were £205.4m at 31 December 2015 (2014: £98.6m).  
Market risk 
The Group is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and the market value of our 
investments in financial assets. These exposures are actively managed by the Group treasury department in accordance with a written  
policy approved by the Board of Directors. The Group does not use financial derivatives for trading or speculative reasons. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group manages its exposure to interest rate risk through the relative proportions of fixed rate debt and floating rate debt.  
The surplus cash balances are invested short-term, and at the end of 2015 no cash was invested for a period exceeding three months.  
Foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate movements. The majority of day-to-day transactions of overseas subsidiaries  
are carried out in local currency and the underlying foreign exchange exposure is small. Transactional exposures do arise in some countries 
where it is local market practice for a proportion of the payables or receivables to be in other than the functional currency of the affiliate. 
Intercompany charging, funding, and cash management activity may also lead to foreign exchange exposures. It is the policy of the Group to 
seek to minimise such transactional exposures through careful management of non-local currency assets and liabilities, thereby minimising 
the potential volatility in the income statement. Net investments in Regus affiliates with a functional currency other than sterling are of a 
long-term nature and the Group does not normally hedge such foreign currency translation exposures. 
From time to time the Group uses short-term derivative financial instruments to manage its transactional foreign exchange exposures 
where these exposures cannot be eliminated through balancing the underlying risks. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.

Other market risks 
The Group does not hold any available-for-sale equity securities and is therefore not subject to risks of changes in equity prices in the  
income statement. 
Sensitivity analysis 
For the year ending 31 December 2015 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have  
decreased the Group’s profit before tax by approximately £1.7m (2014: decrease of £0.9m) with a corresponding increase  
in total equity. 
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have decreased the Group’s profit 
before tax by approximately £6.0m for the year ended 31 December 2015 (2014: £3.1m). It is estimated that a five percentage point 
weakening in the value of the euro against sterling would have decreased the Group’s profit before tax by approximately £1.8m for  
the year ended 31 December 2015 (2014: decrease of £0.1m). 
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have decreased the Group’s total 
equity by approximately £10.7m for the year ended 31 December 2015 (2014: £11.7m). It is estimated that a five percentage point 
weakening in the value of the euro against sterling would have decreased the Group’s total equity  
by approximately £5.9m for the year ended 31 December 2015 (2014: £6.4m). 
Capital management 
The Group’s parent company is listed on the UK stock exchange and the Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base. The Chief

During the years ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015, there were no transfers between levels for fair value measured 
instruments, and no financial instruments requiring level 3 fair value measurements were held. 
Valuation techniques 
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised 
into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: 
• Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and 
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. 
The following tables show the valuation techniques used in measuring level 2 fair values, finance leases and methods used for financial assets 
and liabilities not measured at fair value: 
Type Valuation technique 
Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other 
receivables/payables and customer deposits 
For cash and cash equivalents, receivables/payables with a remaining life of less 
than one year and customer deposits, the book value approximates the fair value 
because of their short-term nature. 
Finance lease liabilities The fair value of finance leases has been calculated by discounting future cash flows 
at an appropriate discount rate which reflects current market assessments and the 
risks specific to such liabilities. 
Loans and overdrafts The fair value of bank loans, overdrafts and other loans approximates the carrying 
value because interest rates are at floating rates where payments are reset to 
market rates at intervals of less than one year. 
Foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps The fair values are based on a combination of broker quotes, forward pricing and 
swap models. 
There was no significant unobservable input used in our valuation techniques.

In May 2014 the Group issued debt securities for a total amount of €210.0m (£154.2m) using the German “Schuldschein” framework for debt 
issuance. These securities consisted of €165.0m of three year notes and €45.0m of five year notes, and were sold to a number of banks and 
institutional investors. These securities are subject to covenants which are similar to our banking facilities. The Group is in compliance with 
these covenant requirements. 
The underlying interest obligation on these debt securities is floating rate and in euro, however, as part of the Group’s balance sheet 
management and to protect against a future increase in interest rates, €165.0 million was swapped into a fixed rate GBP liability and  
€45.0m was swapped into a fixed rate euro liability. While providing the Group with protection against higher interest rates,  
given the current positive yield curve, the immediate impact of this hedging is a modest increase in financing expense.  
The Group maintains a £320.0m revolving credit facility and a £75.0m bank guarantee and letter of credit facility both with final maturities in  
April 2020 and September 2017 respectively. Both facilities are subject to financial covenants relating to operating cash flow, net debt to 
EBITDA, and EBITDA plus rent to interest plus rent. The Group is in compliance with all covenant requirements. 
25. Share-based payments 
There are three share-based payment plans, details of which are outlined below: 
Plan 1: Regus Group Share Option Plan 
During 2004 the Group established the Regus Group Share Option Plan that entitles Executive Directors and certain employees to purchase 
shares in Regus plc (previously Regus Group plc). In accordance with this programme, holders of vested options are entitled to purchase 
shares at the market price of the shares at the day before the date of grant. 
The Regus Group also operates the Regus Group Share Option Plan (France) which is included within the numbers for the Regus Share 
Option Plan disclosed above. The terms of the Regus Share Option Plan (France) are materially the same as the Regus Group Share Option 
Plan with the exception that they are only exercisable from the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, assuming the performance conditions 
have been met.

Plan 2: Regus plc Co-Investment Plan (CIP) and Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
The CIP operates in conjunction with the annual bonus whereby a gross bonus of up to 50% of basic annual salary will be taken as a deferred 
amount of shares (Investment Shares) to be released at the end of a defined period of not less than three years, with the balance paid in cash. 
Awards of Matching Shares are linked to the number of Investment Shares awarded and will vest depending on the Company’s future 
performance. The maximum number of Matching Shares which can be awarded to a participant in any calendar year under the CIP is 200% of 
salary. As such the maximum number of Matching Shares which can be awarded, based on Investment Shares awarded, is in the ratio of 4:1. 
The LTIP provides for the Remuneration Committee to make stand alone long-term incentive awards without reference to the annual bonus 
up to a maximum of 100% of salary per calendar year.

immediately. The LTIP options have a vesting date of 23 March 2013 and an expiry of 23 March 2020. The performance conditions are set out below. 
(b) The CIP Matching Shares and Share Option Plan awards made in 2008 and 2009 did not have performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee  
at the date of the award. A valuation was performed for those awards based on the terms that applied to similar awards made in previous years. The Remuneration 
Committee set the performance conditions for the awards made in 2008 and 2009 effective from 22 March 2010 and the valuation of these awards was updated  
in the year ended 31 December 2010.

25. Share-based payment (continued) 
It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that the additional EPS targets represent a highly challenging goal and consequently in 
determining whether they have been met the Committee will exercise its discretion. The overall aim is that the relevant EPS targets must 
have been met on a run-rate or underlying basis. As such an adjusted measure of EPS will be calculated to assess the underlying performance 
of the business. 
While the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust EPS as it sees fit at the time, by way of example, the following adjustments 
may be considered for the 2008 and 2009 grants: 
• In a fast-growing company such as Regus, costs are necessarily incurred in one year to drive profits in future years. Thus it is important  
to ensure management is not incentivised to cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any one year. Accordingly, those 
costs, incurred in the vesting year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth, will be excluded from the EPS calculation. These 
would include, inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, excess marketing expenditures and current year losses  
from investing in new locations. 
• Any one-off or non-recurring costs will be excluded. 
• It is expected that in the relevant periods the cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised, thereby increasing progressively 
the challenge of achieving a 14p EPS target. This will then be further complicated by the need to recognise deferred tax assets as the 
business strengthens, reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year and increasing it in the next. To provide greater clarity and incentive 
to management EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum of 30%. 
• The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and performance targets are a transparent and accurate measure  
of the Company’s performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long-term shareholder value. In addition,  
the TSR condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Company’s return to shareholders is 
competitive compared to comparable companies. 
The performance conditions are as follows: 
2008 and 2009 CIP Investment and matching grants 
The Remuneration Committee agreed to the following modifications to the awards made in 2008 and 2009 and that the following 
performance conditions would apply to these awards effective from 22 March 2010. 
The total number of matching awards made in 2008 and 2009 to each participant was divided into three separate equal amounts and was 
subject to future performance periods of three, four and five years respectively. Thus, conditional on meeting the performance targets, the 
first amount vested in March 2013, the second vested in March 2014 and the third vested in March 2015. These vesting dates relate to the 
financial years ending 31 December 2012, 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014 respectively. The vesting of these awards was subject  
to the achievement of challenging corporate performance targets. 75% of each of the three amounts was subject to defined earnings per 
share (EPS) targets over the respective performance periods. The remaining 25% of each were subject to relative total shareholder  
return (TSR) targets over the respective periods. The targets were as follows:

2013 CIP Investment and matching grants 
The total number of matching awards made in 2013 to each participant was divided into three separate equal amounts and is subject  
to future performance periods of three, four and five years respectively. Thus, conditional on meeting the performance targets, the first 
amount will vest in March 2016, the second will vest in March 2017 and the third will vest in March 2018. These vesting dates relate to the 
financial years ending 31 December 2015, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017 respectively. The vesting of these awards is subject  
to the achievement of challenging corporate performance targets. 75% of each of the three amounts is subject to defined earnings per 
share (EPS) targets over the respective performance periods. The remaining 25% of each will be subject to relative total shareholder

The goodwill arising on the above acquisitions reflects the anticipated future benefits Regus can obtain from operating the businesses more 
efficiently, primarily through increasing occupancy and the addition of value-adding products and services. £37.2m of the above goodwill is 
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
If the above acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2015, the revenue and net retained loss arising from these acquisitions would have  
been £ 94.1m and £ 2.1m respectively. In the year the equity acquisitions contributed revenue of £68.1m and net retained loss of £3.0m. 
There was £1.0m contingent consideration arising on the 2015 acquisitions. Deferred consideration of £1.1m (2014: nil) was also paid during 
the current year with respect to milestones achieved on prior year acquisitions. 
The acquisition costs associated with these transactions were £3.8m, recorded within administration expenses within the consolidated 
income statement. 
For a number of the acquisitions in 2015, the fair value of assets acquired has only been provisionally assessed at the reporting date. The 
main changes in the provisional fair values expected are for the fair value of the leases (asset or liability), customer relationships and plant, 
property and equipment. The final assessment of the fair value of these assets will be made within 12 months of the acquisition date and, any 
adjustments reported in future reports. 
The Group continued to complete acquisition transactions subsequent to 31 December 2015, which will be accounted for in accordance 
with IFRS 3. Due to the timing of these transactions, it is not practical to disclose the information associated with the initial accounting for 
these acquisitions.

efficiently, primarily through increasing occupancy and the addition of value-adding products and services. £13.3m of the above goodwill is 
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
If the above acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2014, the revenue and net retained profit arising from these acquisitions would have 
been £18.7m and £2.4m respectively. In the year the equity acquisitions contributed revenue of £16.0m and net retained loss of £1.2m. 
There was £5.6m contingent consideration arising on the above acquisitions. 
The acquisition costs associated with these transactions were £1.3m, recorded within administration expenses within the consolidated 
income statement.

33. Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain judgements and 
assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. 
Fair value accounting for business combinations 
For each business combination, we assess the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired. Where there is not an active market in the category 
of the non-current assets typically acquired with a business centre or where the books and records of the acquired company do not provide 
sufficient information to derive an accurate valuation, management calculates an estimated fair value based on available information and 
experience.  
The main categories of acquired non-current assets where management’s judgement has an impact on the amounts recorded include 
tangible fixed assets, customer list intangibles and the fair market value of leasehold assets and liabilities. For significant business 
combinations management also obtains third-party valuations to provide additional guidance as to the appropriate valuation to  
be included in the financial statements.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements

www.regus.com  99 
Valuation of intangibles and goodwill 
We evaluate the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an 
event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the carrying value of 
goodwill based on our CGUs aggregated at a country level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections which 
assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the 
asset is less than its estimated recoverable amount. Further details of the methodology and assumptions applied to the impairment review in 
the year ended 31 December 2015, including the sensitivity to changes in those assumptions can be found in note 12. 
Impairment of property plant and equipment 
We evaluate the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment at a centre (CGU) level where there are indicators of impairment at 
the balance sheet date. In the assessment of value-in-use, key judgemental areas in determining future cash flow projections include: an 
assessment of the location of the centre; the local economic situation; competition; local environmental factors; the management of the 
centre; and future changes in occupancy, revenue and costs of the centre. 
Tax assets and liabilities 
We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and  
other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business  
results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax 
consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates.  
It is current Group policy to recognise a deferred tax asset when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
assets can be used. The Group considers it probable if the entity has made a taxable profit in the previous year and is forecast to continue  
to make a profit in the foreseeable future. Where appropriate, the Group assesses the potential risk of future tax liabilities arising from the 
operation of its business in multiple tax jurisdictions and includes provisions within tax liabilities for those risks that can be estimated reliably. 
Changes in existing tax laws can affect large international groups similar to Regus and could result in significant additional tax liabilities over 
and above those already provided for. 
Onerous lease provisions 
We have identified certain poor performing centres where the lease is considered onerous, i.e. the Group does not expect to recover the 
unavoidable lease costs up to the first break point. The accounts include a provision for our estimate of the net amounts payable under  
the terms of the lease to the first break point, discounted at the Group weighted average cost of capital, where appropriate. 
Dilapidations 
Certain of our leases with landlords include a clause obliging the Group to hand the property back in the condition as at the date  
of signing the lease. The costs to bring the property back to that condition are not known until the Group exits the property so the  
Group estimates the costs at each balance sheet date. However, given that landlords often regard the nature of changes made  
to properties as improvements, the Group estimates that it is unlikely that any material dilapidation payments will be necessary. 
Consequently, provision has been made only for those potential dilapidation payments when it is probable that an outflow will  
occur and can be reliably estimated.  100 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with Luxembourg legal and regulatory requirements under the historical  
cost convention, which differs in material respects from IFRS in both the measurement and presentation of certain transactions. 
The Company is included in the consolidated financial statements of Regus plc. 
The balance sheet has been extracted from the full accounts of Regus plc for the period ended 31 December 2015, which are available  
from the Company’s registered office, 26 Boulevard Royal, Luxembourg and which will be filed with both the Luxembourg Register  
of Commerce and the Jersey Register of Companies. 
Financial assets 
Shares in affiliated undertakings are valued at purchase price including acquisition costs. Where any permanent diminution in value is 
identified, value adjustments are recorded in the profit and loss account. These value adjustments are not continued if the reasons  
which caused their initial recording cease to apply.  102 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

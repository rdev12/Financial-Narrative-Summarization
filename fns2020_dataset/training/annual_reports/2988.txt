Chairman’s Statement
the Onetel integration demonstrates that there is the
necessary quality of operational expertise to support
the strategic vision. Execution will become an ever
more important theme over the next 12 months as 
we bed down the AOL business and make further
signiﬁcant enhancements to the quality of our
broadband service. 
However, it is not in the Group’s nature to stand still
for long, and we were very pleased to agree a major
strategic partnership shortly before our year end with
Best Buy Co, Inc., the largest consumer electronics
retailer in the US. After a successful trial in New York,
we are rolling out a mobile retail joint venture to 
150-200 stores in the US in the next 18 months. 
In addition, we are bringing Best Buy’s Geek Squad
home technology customer service operation to the
UK. The business case for both of these projects is
compelling, and we believe the partnership will create
signiﬁcant value over the coming years. 
This year we have asked more of our people than ever
before, and they have responded to the challenges 
we have faced with great commitment, dedication and
patience. I would like to extend the Board’s thanks
and gratitude to everyone in the Group for their
continued efforts. We all share the same
dissatisfaction in falling well short of our usual high
standards of customer service and are united in our
determination to deliver a very positive and consistent
customer experience in the years ahead. 
John Gildersleeve,
Chairman
The Group has experienced a year of mixed
fortunes. The Distribution business has once again
exceeded our expectations, continuing to prosper in
an attractive market and taking share from our
competitors. Our fixed line telecoms business has
achieved real scale, with the strong organic growth
stimulated by our Free Broadband proposition
augmented by the acquisition of the UK customer
base of AOL. However, the unprecedented demand
created by our broadband offer led to unacceptable
levels of customer service. 
As an organisation that has always sought to put the
customer at the centre of all of our business decisions,
we were very disappointed to have let our customers
down in this way. In response to the problems, we
have dedicated signiﬁcant additional resource in our
call centres and re-engineered our provisioning and
customer management processes to create a robust
and scaleable platform. It is our aspiration to
differentiate our broadband proposition not only on
value but also on service, and this will be one of the
Group’s key goals for the coming year.
Group revenue for the period was £3,991.5m, a rise 
of 31.0% on last year’s ﬁgure of £3,046.4m. Headline
pre-tax proﬁt fell by 9.5% from £136.1m to £123.1m,
reﬂecting, as expected, start-up losses of £80.5m in
the launch of Free Broadband and Virgin Mobile in
France, and a net gain on ﬁxed asset disposals of
£3.7m. Earnings per share on the same basis
decreased by 4.5% from 12.38p to 11.82p. Statutory
proﬁt before tax, after the amortisation of acquisition
intangibles, and reorganisation costs in the prior year,
fell by 15.6% from £81.0m to £68.4m, while statutory
earnings per share decreased by 6.0% from 7.99p to
7.51p. Cash generated from operations increased by
30.5% from £196.4m to £256.3m, reﬂecting strong
growth in the Group’s underlying business. The Board
is proposing a ﬁnal dividend of 2.25p, taking the total
for the year to 3.25p. The increase of 30% on last
year’s distribution reﬂects the Board’s conﬁdence that
the current level of investment will generate signiﬁcant
long-term value.
As the business grows up, we will increasingly need to
balance its natural dynamism and creativity with a tight
focus on operational efﬁciency and business
processes. Over the past 18 months, with the
acquisition of Onetel and the AOL base, and the
launch of Free Broadband, the entrepreneurial spirit of
the business has been self-evident. The success of

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
As the business grows up, 
we will increasingly need to
balance its natural dynamism
with a tight focus on
operational efficiency Chief Executive’s Review
This has been another successful year for Carphone
Warehouse, but we faced significant challenges
along the way. Group revenues are up 31.0%, we
have executed very well in our Retail business and
increased our market share, and we have made
significant progress towards our goal of becoming
the leading alternative fixed line telecoms provider 
in the UK. The launch of Free Broadband changed
the face of the UK broadband market forever, but
created its own problems: the unexpected level 
of demand, combined with the complexity of the
provisioning processes, led to significant customer
service issues.
Last year I underlined our “private company” approach
to investment and growth opportunities. While every
project needs to be ﬁnancially justiﬁed and we have
rigorous hurdle rates for new investment, we tend to
take the long view. As a result, earnings in the short
term can be depressed by our pursuit of long-term
value creation. In such circumstances it is our
responsibility to communicate the scale, timing and
impact of new business initiatives so that investors 
can make informed decisions.
This has never been more true than in the past 
12 months. We have incurred start-up losses of over
£80m in our launch of Free Broadband and Virgin
Mobile in France. Our total cash commitment in the year
to these new initiatives, and the acquisition of AOL’s UK
customer base, has been nearly £400m. As we manage
the path to proﬁtability and cash generation in these
businesses, we are already committing to a further
exciting growth project, with the roll-out of our retail joint
venture in the US and Geek Squad in the UK. No doubt
further opportunities will arise, and we will continue to
pursue them with commitment and conviction.
Strategic context
Our strategic approach is built on three 
primary objectives:
• To continue to grow market share in all our
geographical markets, by investing in new store
openings, achieving increasing productivity from 
our existing estate, and developing additional
distribution channels;
• To maximise the lifetime value of our customers, both
by providing a level of service that encourages repeat
business, and by identifying relevant new products
and services where our brand, service and
distribution give us an edge over other suppliers; and
• To become the leading alternative provider of ﬁxed
line telecommunications services in the UK.
Through organic growth and acquisition, we have built
up a unique set of assets: a network of stores that act
as the focal point of our interaction with customers,
both mobile and ﬁxed line; a comprehensive ﬁxed line
telecoms network covering the whole of the UK, with
investment focused on areas of added value; and
signiﬁcant customer bases, creating valuable annuity
revenue streams to improve the quality of our
earnings. Our strategic objectives aim to leverage
these assets to deliver long-term growth and value
creation to shareholders.
Growing our retail presence
There are two key factors supporting our strategy to
grow our retail presence. Firstly, we believe that we 
are under-penetrated in almost all of our geographical
markets, and the dynamics of the industry continue to
be attractive. Secondly, as our market share increases,
our scale delivers operational beneﬁts through
improving terms with network operators and handset
manufacturers alike. Our model of reinvesting these
beneﬁts into the customer proposition, through better
pricing and improved range and availability of
handsets, serves both to defend our market position
by raising the barriers to entry, and to deliver
incremental growth and scale.
This year we have opened 366 net new stores across
our ten markets, taking the total portfolio to 2,144. Over
the last three years we have opened 930 stores and
grown the estate by 76.6%. During the same period,
connections are up 87.2%, demonstrating our ability 
to generate continued growth out of existing sites.
We generated retail like-for-like gross proﬁt growth 
of 5.0% during the period, as the handset market
showed further growth, and we took market share
through our focus on the widest range of handsets
and the best availability on the high street. After last

Looking forward, we plan to marry physical
expansion with an increased focus on
productivity from our existing estate
allowing seamless connectivity across multiple
platforms and locations. They want their computer to
talk to their television, and to be able to control both
from their mobile device while away from home.
We sell most of the “nuts and bolts” today – mobile
contracts, high-speed data cards, broadband, hand-
held e-mail devices; some of these are our own
products, most of them are third party. Our job will be
to set our customers up with the most appropriate
suite of services and make sure that it all works. The
stores, as ever, will be the primary point of distribution,
but Geek Squad will become an integral part of our
overall value proposition. 
Geek Squad, launched with our partners Best Buy, is
a home technology troubleshooting service, developed
to address the increasing technological complexity of
people’s lives. It will allow us to add signiﬁcant value 
to customers by making technology work for them,
and to our network partners by tying their individual
products and services into a uniﬁed package.
To support the broadening of our proposition, 
which will include the sale of an increasing range 
of non-cellular communications products, we are
embarking on a programme of reﬁts and relocations
across a range of our larger stores in prime locations.
We will update investors with progress as our new
strategy evolves. 
Becoming the leading alternative fixed line provider 
in the UK
Nearly ﬁve years ago, when we acquired Opal Telecom
in November 2002, we set ourselves the ambitious goal
of becoming the number one alternative ﬁxed line
telecoms provider in the UK. We believed that the
combination of high consumer prices, a high incumbent
market share, meaningful regulatory change and our
own unique distribution network was a powerful one;
the network infrastructure and telco know-how we
acquired with Opal completed the jigsaw.
Today, through a combination of strong organic growth
and judicious acquisitions, we have over 10% of the
residential telephony market and approximately 16% 
of the broadband market. After the very signiﬁcant
strides we have made this year, our bold objective 
is now clearly within reach.
During the year we made three notable steps forward
and one step back. We announced in November 2005
our plans to invest in local loop unbundling (“LLU”) – 
a process in which we install our own exchange
year’s success with the exclusive pink Motorola V3,
this was a particularly creditable performance achieved
across a range of unique handsets rather than from a
single blockbuster product.
During the year we entered our ﬁrst new market for
over seven years through our link-up in the US with
Best Buy. After a successful trial we are excited about
the rapid roll-out plans and the opportunity to
introduce US consumers to the independent mobile
retail model. Best Buy is the ideal partner and the
relationship between us is highly complementary.
Looking forward, we plan to marry physical expansion
with an increased focus on productivity from our
existing estate. Excluding the US, we see opportunities
to open a further 200-250 stores a year for the next
three years. Just as importantly, we are revisiting
existing sites and assessing the need for additional
headcount and points of sale as we seek to convert
more of our footfall into business. We also have the
opportunity to re-site stores in many major centres
where we have outgrown our current footprint.
Maximising customer lifetime value
We have been focused on maximising customer
lifetime value for almost as long as Carphone
Warehouse has existed. Generating enhanced 
value for our network partners and loyalty from our
customers comes not just from providing high quality
consultancy at the point of sale, but supporting
customers through the product life-cycle.
Over the years we have been very successful at
introducing new services into our retail offering, with
our Insurance and Fixed Line services being the 
most obvious and successful. However, the quality 
of our customer interaction is often demonstrated 
in less quantiﬁable ways – for example, through our
investment in new store formats or our commitment 
to live product demonstrations. What all of these
developments have in common, though, is that they
meet the changing needs of the marketplace and
reﬂect Carphone Warehouse’s ongoing ability to renew
its business model in response to the prevailing
opportunities and risks.
Today, as wireless technologies become more
pervasive and our customers increasingly want 
more from us than choice, availability and advice on 
a simple mobile contract, we are beginning to adapt
our proposition once more. Customers – and our
network partners – will want integrated solutions,

KEY TARGETS Chief Executive’s Review continued
equipment within BT’s exchange network, enabling 
us to take control of the copper wire (or “local loop”)
that connects customers’ houses with their local
exchange. OFCOM, the UK telecoms regulator, had
just ﬁnalised its market review, which ﬁnally gave
visibility and certainty to LLU. Its attractions for a
telecoms service provider are that it allows us to
provide calls, line rental and broadband services 
to our customers at a much lower cost price than 
BT’s wholesale product suite.
In April 2006 we announced a revolutionary new
service, TalkTalk Free Broadband, giving free
broadband connectivity to customers who sign up 
for our calls and line rental package. At the same time,
we announced a rapid acceleration of our LLU roll-out,
aiming to unbundle 1,000 exchanges over the following
14 months. Demand for the new proposition has been
exceptional, and by March 2007 we had signed up
655,000 live customers. In addition, our engineers at
Carphone Warehouse Networks, the re-branded Opal
network team, completed all of our planned equipment
installation well ahead of schedule, with 1,024
exchanges live by the end of the ﬁnancial year.
Broadband via LLU is a scale game, with unit costs
falling with every additional customer connected to 
an unbundled exchange. As a result, we were
delighted to acquire the customer base of AOL in 
the UK in December 2006. This immediately took 
our market share to around 16%, and gives us the
scale we need to ensure a signiﬁcant payback on 
our infrastructure investment. In addition, we now
operate with two differentiated brands, allowing us 
to address two distinct and valuable segments of 
the broadband marketplace.
The one ﬂat note to our broadband launch has been
the impact on customer service levels resulting from
the very strong demand we generated. For much of
the year we were slow to answer calls in our contact
centres and failed to resolve enough of our customers’
problems ﬁrst time around. This inevitably led to 
a poor customer experience and our fair share of
negative publicity. We continue to invest substantially
in improving the provisioning process and providing
high quality support, and are conﬁdent that as the 
new ﬁnancial year progresses, we will begin to make
customer service a positive differentiator for the
TalkTalk brand.
Outlook
The outlook for the Group remains positive. The key
drivers of the Distribution division – network appetite
for customers, a vibrant handset market, and our own
physical expansion – all remain ﬁrmly in place. As our
strategy evolves, we believe that our opportunities for
growth in the medium term are increasing, both
through the development of our wireless solutions
model, and through the Geek Squad and Best Buy
Mobile ventures. Our ability to achieve continued
growth in sales and proﬁtability stems in no small part
from our historical success in adapting the business
model to address the opportunities and challenges of
a dynamic market.
Physical expansion and market share gains remain at
the heart of our strategy, and we plan to open a
further 250 stores this year, in addition to the US roll-
out. Our market share in continental Europe still lags
our UK share, which itself continues to grow: there is
no structural reason why, in time, our market shares
across most of our European markets cannot reach
the 20% level.
We are targeting 15% growth in subscription
connections, a little ahead of our planned space
growth, as we anticipate further growth in this higher
value part of the market and invest in improved store
productivity. The pre-pay market is quieter, after 
18 months of very signiﬁcant growth, and we expect
this to be reﬂected in our own pre-pay connections
growth during the year. We expect gross proﬁt per
connection, an important KPI for the business, on both
subscription and pre-pay to be stable year-on-year.
Our Ongoing and Insurance revenue streams, key
components of customer lifetime value driven by
subscription connections, are set to rise in line with
mobile subscriptions growth. Progress in our Mobile
businesses will be steady, as our German service
provision business continues to increase customer
numbers, revenues and proﬁts, and our MVNO
operations across Europe start to come out of 
their launch phases.
In our UK Fixed Line operations, our broadband and
unbundling strategy will begin to bear fruit, as margins

improve dramatically with the migration of customers
to our own network and the integration of the AOL
customer base. Meanwhile, we will continue to invest
in expanding and deepening our network and growing
the customer base towards our target of 3.5m
broadband customers by March 2010. We are
absolutely focused on improving operational execution
and customer service and while we are encouraged 
by the progress we are making in these areas, there 
is much more we can and will do.
Launching Free Broadband has been the hardest thing
I’ve ever done in business, and it’s been hard for all of
our employees – in the stores, in the contact centres
and in management and support functions. All of us
share one goal – to service all our customers properly
and make TalkTalk a business we can be proud of,
with a reputation for quality and service that The
Carphone Warehouse and The Phone House already
rightly enjoy. Once again I would like to thank everyone
across the whole Group for their continued efforts.

Our long-term approach to investment creates sustainable competitive
advantage in our chosen markets. Investment is not just about
capex – although our commitment to store openings and exchange
unbundling is signiﬁcant – it is also about marketing, brand-building
and customer recruitment.
Scale
We aim to be a mass market provider in our major business lines by
driving for volume ahead of margin. We then use our increased
presence in the market to improve our supplier terms and reinvest
these beneﬁts in the customer proposition.
Efficiency
Scale also creates signiﬁcant efﬁciencies for our business, through
leveraging our ﬁxed cost store base and telecoms infrastructure. We
seek to maintain our competitive advantage by continued investment
across the business.
Proposition
We are absolutely committed to delivering value to customers across 
all our services. Investment in the right platforms is key to our ability to
develop a compelling customer proposition, as it allows us to build
scale, and offer greater value and an improved customer experience.

Distribution Division
The Distribution division comprises our Retail
operations and all directly-related business streams.
The key operating assets of the division are our
2,144 stores across 10 European countries and 
our Retail and Online brands. Equally important 
are our supplier and partner relationships.
Distribution revenues were up 20.8% year-on-year to
£2,117.5m, and the division generated Headline EBIT
of £141.4m, a rise of 22.4%. Growth was strong
across all revenue lines.
From next year the Distribution division will also
incorporate our Mobile operations, as well as our
Dealer and non-UK Fixed Line business operations.
This will more accurately group our future operations
by the key assets that support them.
Retail (including Online)
The Group achieved 10.0m connections during the
year, representing growth of 22.3% over the prior year.
Subscription connections, the key driver of value in 
our Distribution business, were up 17.3% to 4.0m. 
We continued to operate in an attractive market, with
fashion and technology being the main drivers of an
accelerating handset replacement cycle, and network
operators keen to pursue customer growth.
We executed well on our handset strategy, focusing
on the broadest range and the best availability in 
the market, with a number of exclusive products 
to stimulate demand and raise footfall. In addition, 
we began work on improving retail productivity, 
as we seek ways to convert more of our footfall 
into revenues. This will be a key operational goal 
for the coming year.
Pre-pay sales continued the very strong trend from the
previous year, with total connections up 27.7%. This
performance partly reﬂects a buoyant market for 
pre-pay, and partly our successful strategy of growing
our pre-pay market share towards the level of our
subscription share. Towards the end of the ﬁnancial
year, pre-pay growth slowed as the market became
more subdued and we came up against very strong
comparable growth ﬁgures. SIM-free sales were up
10.7% year-on-year.

Total 10,014 8,191
We opened 444 new stores during the year and
closed 78. The total number of stores increased 
from 1,778 at March 2006 to 2,144 by March 2007.
The total includes 194 franchise stores (2006:140
franchises). Total average selling space excluding
franchises increased by 16.5% to 96,865 sqm 
(2006: 83,128 sqm) and sales per square metre
increased by 4.1% to £17,219 (2006: £16,547). Total
average selling space including franchises increased
by 18.9% to 104,452 sqm (2006: 87,871 sqm).
Total Retail revenues (including Online) were up 20.9%
and gross proﬁt by 23.9%. Like-for-like revenue
growth was 6.6% and like-for-like gross proﬁt growth
was 5.0%. The increase in revenues was the result 
of strong connections growth, partially offset by a fall
in average revenue per connection from £192.8 to
£190.6 as a result of the higher proportion of pre-pay
sales within the mix.
Average cash gross proﬁt per connection rose from
£54.4 to £55.2. Gross proﬁt per connection on
subscription rose 4.4% to £98.5 and gross proﬁt 
per connection on pre-pay rose 1.6% to £26.2.

Our Dutch and Swiss businesses continued to
underperform, recording connections growth of 5.0%
and a fall of 1.8% respectively. In Switzerland, a year 
of underperformance has led to a reorganisation of the
business, consolidating our operations into a single
support centre and introducing some new senior
management. In The Netherlands, the overall market
was subdued, but we have also failed to execute
consistently. A new management team is producing
encouraging early results.
Insurance
The Group offers a range of insurance products to 
its retail customers, providing protection for the
replacement cost of a lost, stolen or damaged handset,
as well as cover for any outstanding contractual liability
and the cost of any calls made if a mobile phone falls
into the wrong hands. Insurance is a core element of
the Group’s customer proposition. The main drivers of
the Insurance business are customer numbers, average
premiums, claims costs and operational efﬁciency.
The customer base rose by 16.2% over the year to
2.23m. Once again, the mix improved, with growth of
18.6% in the high tier base. Insurance revenues were
up 18.1% to £137.0m (2006: £116.1m) driven by the
higher average base. Contribution was up 19.6% to
£54.5m (2006: £45.5m).
The prospects for our Insurance business are good,
given our expectation of continued growth in
subscription connections, the key driver of insurance
policy sales. Customers are wedded to high value
subsidised handsets that are expensive to replace, and
our focus on excellent service and a straightforward
claims process makes the product attractive. 
Ongoing
Ongoing revenue represents the share of customer call
spend (or ARPU) we receive as a result of connecting
subscription customers to certain networks. We are
typically entitled to our share of revenue for as long as
a customer is active, so this income stream represents
an important element of our overall commercial
agreement with many networks, and aligns our
interests more closely. Again, the key underlying driver
for Ongoing is our subscription connection sales.
Ongoing revenues grew by 22.7% year-on-year to
£71.7m (2006: £58.4m). This continued strong
performance reﬂects the sustained strong subscription
connections over the last few years, and we expect
this positive trend to continue.
Contribution from Retail grew by 17.2% to £166.6m
(2006: £142.2m). The contribution margin fell to 8.7%
(2006: 9.0%), as further good like-for-like growth was
offset by continued investment in the store proposition.
Retail direct costs were up 27.1%, reﬂecting the
expansion of the store portfolio, higher commissions 
to sales consultants and ongoing rental inﬂation.
In the UK, our store portfolio increased from 669
stores to 769 stores. At the same time, we relocated 
a number of stores to bigger sites and began work on
a new store format providing an improved environment
for customers and sales consultants. We will continue
to roll out this new format to key locations across the
UK this year. Growth was enhanced by the acquisition
of a portfolio of stores previously trading as The Link,
one of our main independent competitors, after it had
been acquired by Telefonica/O2. Total UK connections
were up 21.6%.
Our Spanish business goes from strength to strength.
We opened 70 stores during the year, taking the
overall base up to 408, and achieved connections
growth of 24.6%. The launch of a fourth network,
Yoigo, and a number of MVNOs, stimulated further
demand. Our growth in Spain has led to long queues
with an impact on conversion rates in a number of our
stores, and we are therefore seeking to locate to larger
premises, where appropriate, to meet demand.
In France, the improving trends of the previous year
continued. We opened 50 stores, taking the total 
store count up to 270, and connections growth of
16.1% reﬂected a stronger market. The launch of 
a number of MVNOs, backed by strong consumer
brands, including our own Virgin Mobile joint venture,
contributed to a more vibrant market environment 
and a shorter replacement cycle.
With the exception of Switzerland and The
Netherlands, all of our other markets enjoyed a year 
of very good growth. In particular, Sweden achieved
connections growth of 36.3%, a notable effort after 
a difﬁcult previous 12 months. The performance
reﬂected our strategy of using a period of tougher
market conditions to improve our retail proposition 
and pursue additional distribution channels, with 
the result that in a rejuvenated market, we took
considerable market share while competitors had
weakened. Belgium, Germany, Ireland and Portugal 
all fared very well, with connections growth above 
the Group average and increasing consistency of
execution apparent across the board.

Telecoms Services Division
The Group’s Telecoms Services operations are split
into two businesses, Fixed and Mobile. The Fixed
business comprises our residential and business-to-
business fixed line operations, predominantly in the
UK. The Mobile business encompasses our German
service provision business, The Phone House
Telecom, and our-wholly owned MVNO and Facilities
Management (“FM”) businesses. 
From next year, we will report the Mobile and Non-UK
Fixed Line operations within Distribution, and report
UK Fixed Line as a separate division. This closely
reﬂects our internal reporting structure going forward
and groups business units more logically with the
assets that support them.
Telecoms Services revenues grew by 51.0% 
year-on-year to £1,700.6m (2006: £1,126.5m). 
Good underlying growth was supported by a full 
year’s contribution from Onetel, which was acquired 
in December 2005, and three months’ contribution
from the purchase of AOL’s customer base in the UK.
EBIT fell 26.4% to £19.4m, reﬂecting a total of £72.0m
in start-up losses relating to the launch of TalkTalk 
Free Broadband.
Fixed
Our ﬁxed line operations grew dramatically during 
the year, through a combination of strong underlying
growth and the impact of two major acquisitions. 
Total revenues were up 79.4% to £1,195.8m 
(2006: £666.7m), and contribution was £89.0m 
(2006: £61.1m). The contribution ﬁgure reﬂects the
impact of £60.3m of losses relating to the launch 
of TalkTalk Free Broadband.
In our UK business, the year was one of considerable
investment in launching our broadband offering: in
customer recruitment, customer services, network
infrastructure and the acquisition of AOL’s UK
customer base. Total UK Fixed Line revenues were 
up 91.7% to £1,084.2m (2006: £565.6m), and
contribution rose 55.5% to £81.4m (2006: £52.4m).
The cornerstone of all our UK ﬁxed line operations is
the Opal telecoms network, now re-branded as 
The Carphone Warehouse Networks. This year we
successfully undertook a major infrastructure project
with the build-out of our own local loop unbundling
(“LLU”) network. This investment allows us to provide
the full suite of ﬁxed telecoms services – calls, line
rental and broadband – to our customers at a
signiﬁcantly lower operating cost than we can using
BT’s wholesale products. By March 2007 we had
installed our own equipment in 1,024 exchanges,
covering over 65% of the residential population. 
Importantly, our pursuit of a “fully unbundled” strategy,
covering voice as well as broadband, gives us 
a material advantage over a partially unbundled
approach, in which only the broadband element is
unbundled. The technical expertise required to create
this network is substantial, and we do not believe that
it will be easily replicated by other market participants.
At the start of the ﬁnancial year, we launched TalkTalk
Free Broadband, and by March 2007 we had 655,000
customers live on the new service. Customer ARPUs
were ahead of our original plan, at approximately £28
per month, and underlying network costs were in line
with our expectations, giving us great conﬁdence in
the future proﬁtability of the broadband business. 
Costs exceeded our plan in two main areas: ﬁrstly, in
the rate of migration to our own network, which we
discuss in more detail below; and secondly in relation
to customer service overheads, where we invested in
additional headcount to deal with the high contact
rates created by demand and provisioning problems.
We anticipate that unit customer service costs will be
in line with our original plan by March 2008, but in the
meantime, as previously indicated, we expect to incur
additional costs of £10-15m in the coming year as a
result of these over-runs.
Operating and Financial Performance continued
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 200 7
12 had fallen to 1.86m customers. However, taking into
account our broadband customers who also take
voice services, our total voice base grew to 2.73m.
Underlying proﬁtability from voice services improved
during the year as industry consolidation led to a more
stable pricing environment. Overall, our UK residential
operations generated revenues of £764.4m (2006:
305.6m) and contribution of £50.2m (2006: £24.3m).
Our UK business-to-business operations, under the
Opal brand, enjoyed a year of good growth. Reported
proﬁtability does not fully reﬂect the underlying trend as
we continued to allocate all our telecoms engineering
headcount to the Opal business, although the
economic beneﬁt is shared with the residential
operations. From the current year, we will allocate
these costs on a more equitable basis. UK business-
to-business revenues were up 23.1% to £319.9m
(2006: £259.9m) and contribution rose 11.1% to
£31.2m (2006: £28.0m).
During the year, we acquired Alto Hiway, a small
business focused ISP . In combination with Rednet, 
a business ISP acquired with Onetel, this will provide
the platform for the launch of a range of data products
into Opal’s core market, as Opal seeks to extend its
product offering outside its historical focus on value-
added voice services. The platform of unbundled
exchanges supporting the residential strategy is a
potentially highly valuable asset in the SME space.
Non-UK Fixed Line revenues were up 10.4% to
£111.6m (2006: £101.1m) and contribution down
12.9% to £7.6m (2006: £8.7m). From the year to
March 2008 we will be reporting these operations, 
and our Mobile businesses, within the Distribution
division, since for the most part their value lies in 
our ability to recruit customers through the store 
base, rather than in network infrastructure.
Mobile
Total Mobile revenues were up 9.8% to £504.8m 
(2006: £459.8m), and contribution rose 24.0% to
£60.0m (2006: £48.4m). The Phone House Telecom,
our German mobile service provision business, saw
contribution rise 5.8% to £52.7m (2006: £49.8m) 
on revenues of £363.2m (2006: £337.4m). After the
amortisation charge for subscriber acquisition costs, net
contribution was up 15.8% to £21.9m (2006: £18.9m). 
The operating environment in Germany continued 
to beneﬁt our model, with networks demonstrating 
a consistent appetite for high quality subscription
We made a further major strategic move during the
year with the acquisition of AOL’s internet customer
base in the UK. This immediately made us the number
three player in the UK broadband market and gave us
the requisite scale to ensure a healthy payback on our
infrastructure investment. The acquisition also gives 
us two differentiated products in the market, thus
increasing our potential addressable market. We
ended the year with 2.27m broadband customers,
equivalent to approximately 16% of the UK market.
During the year we started migrating customers from
BT’s network to our own unbundled lines, a process
carried out by BT Openreach’s engineers. This
operation is fundamental to the overall proﬁtability of
our residential business as it signiﬁcantly reduces unit
operating costs. Initially, progress was slow and the
high number of errors resulted in a very poor customer
experience. However, towards the year end we saw 
a signiﬁcant improvement in the reliability of the
service, which led to a rapid acceleration in migration
rates. As at March 2007 we had more than 700,000
customers, or over 30% of our broadband base, on
our own unbundled network.

to 1.50m customers at March 2007, of whom 926,000
(2006: 823,000) were on two year contracts. Although
increased competition saw some pressure on ARPUs
year-on-year, particularly in pre-pay, our subscription
ARPUs showed some signs of stabilisation during the
year as we renewed our focus on higher end
distribution channels.
Our wholly-owned MVNO operations moved up 
a gear as we launched new services in Spain,
Portugal, Switzerland and Belgium during the year. 
In the UK, we reﬁned our product strategy to focus 
on Mobile World, which offers very cheap rates 
on calls to international destinations, and took 
an increasingly rigorous approach to maximising
customer lifetime value. Our MVNO strategy is to
identify niche markets not currently served by the
network operators, and to use our own stores and
some third party channels for customer recruitment.
Total MVNO revenues rose 25.1% to £57.8m, with 
a loss of £1.6m after a loss of £9.6m in the prior year.
In our Facilities Management operations, providing call
centre and billing services to network operators in the
UK and France, business was, as expected, relatively
static, with revenues of £83.8m (2006: £76.2m) and
contribution of £8.8m (2006: £8.2m).
The outlook for our Telecoms Services operations is
very promising. In Fixed Line, we expect to grow our
customer base, revenues and proﬁtability very strongly
over the next three years. We are targeting a total of
3.5m UK broadband customers by March 2010
across our AOL and TalkTalk brands, and our track
record of innovation and customer focus makes us 
a very credible top tier player in this exciting and
growing market. We expect ARPUs to be stable, 
with little sign of increased price-based competition 
in either broadband or ﬁxed line telephony. The
operational focus is on improved customer service 
and the continued migration of customers onto 
our own unbundled network, which will deliver 
a signiﬁcant uplift to divisional proﬁtability.
On the Mobile side we anticipate continued steady
growth from our German operations and a balance
between innovation and proﬁtability out of our 
MVNO businesses.

The European VAT authorities continue to investigate
the recovery of VAT in the industry for trading activities
conducted prior to April 2003. Having undertaken 
a detailed internal investigation and taken advice, 
we continue to believe that we have no ﬁnancial
exposure to this issue within the ﬁnancial statements.
Joint ventures
The share of results of joint ventures in the income
statement comprises our share of post-tax proﬁts or
losses from our joint venture operations. At the start 
of the ﬁnancial year, we entered into a joint venture
with Virgin to launch Virgin Mobile, a mass market
MVNO in France. The focus of the business has 
been on brand-building, customer recruitment and
developing sales channels, and we have been very
pleased with progress in the ﬁrst year of operation.
The French market remains less penetrated and less
competitive than the rest of Western Europe and
therefore constitutes a signiﬁcant opportunity.
Later in the year, we also entered into two commercial
agreements with Best Buy, the leading US consumer
electronics retailer. Firstly, we launched Best Buy
Mobile, an independent mobile retail format in the US.
After a successful trial in Manhattan, we announced
plans subsequent to the year end to expand the
venture to 150-200 stores over the next 18 months.
Secondly, we have collaborated to bring the Geek
Squad, the US home technology support business, 
to the UK market. This launched in London in March
2007 and we believe it will form an important element

allowing us to re-invest in the growth of the business
and pursue a progressive dividend policy. We are
proposing a ﬁnal dividend of 2.25p per share, taking
the total dividend for the ﬁnancial year to 3.25p and
representing growth of 30% over last year’s 2.50p 
total dividend. This level of distribution results in a
dividend cover of 2.33 (2006: 3.24). The ex-dividend
date is Wednesday 4 July 2007, with a record date 
of Friday 6 July 2007 and an intended payment date
of Friday 3 August 2007.

Total investment increased from £351.1m to £562.6m
year-on-year. In addition to the acquisitions noted
above, the increase reﬂects an uplift in subscriber
acquisition costs from £51.6m to £71.8m, and a
substantial increase in investment in the Group’s IT
systems and network infrastructure.
Balance sheet
The investment described above resulted in an
increase in non-current assets from £1,014.9m 
to £1,557.5m year-on-year.
customers require on-site and remote consultancy 
to enhance their user experience.
In the year to March 2007, losses from joint ventures
amounted to £9.9m, with the majority relating to our
Virgin Mobile venture. As previously indicated, we
anticipate total losses of £15-20m in the coming year,
as Virgin Mobile continues to invest in building its
brand and customer base and the Best Buy ventures
move towards critical mass.
Acquisitions
During the year the Group’s principal acquisition 
was the UK internet access business of AOL, for 
a gross cash consideration of £251.5m and deferred
consideration of £128.4m, payable over 18 months.
Acquisition intangibles of £323.6m and goodwill 
of £75.9m arose on the purchase.
Acquisition intangibles relate principally to customer
bases, together with contingent rights to a share 
of future customer transactional spend and a licence
to continue to use the AOL brand.
We have not yet commenced the restructuring 
of the AOL business, but expect to do so in the
forthcoming year.
Amortisation of acquisition intangibles and 
goodwill expense
The amortisation charge in respect of acquisition
intangibles amounted to £54.2m (2006: £18.0m), the
increase reﬂecting the full year impact of the Onetel
acquisition, and the AOL acquisition intangibles noted
above. A goodwill expense of £0.5m (2006: £1.8m)
has been recognised in respect of historical
acquisitions. These ﬁgures are excluded from Headline
proﬁt before taxation and earnings per share ﬁgures.
Interest and tax
Net interest of £26.4m was payable during the year,
compared to a charge of £5.7m in the prior year.
Signiﬁcant investment in capital expenditure and
acquisitions were ﬁnanced out of operating cash 
ﬂow and debt facilities.
The effective tax rate on a Headline basis was 
14.3% (2006: 19.6%). The tax rate beneﬁted from 
the recognition of tax losses incurred in earlier 
years, losses acquired from earlier acquisitions 
and low tax rate jurisdictions.
Earnings per share (“EPS”)
Headline EPS was 11.82p (2006: 12.38p). 
Statutory EPS was 7.51p (2006: 7.99p).

Business Review Governance Financial Statements
www.cpwplc.com Acquisitions and organic growth in both Distribution
and Telecoms Services are reﬂected in an increase 
in trade and other receivables from £554.5m to
£743.9m. Correspondingly, there is a year-on-year
increase in trade and other payables from £642.0m 
to £922.2m.
Provisions have decreased from £123.5m to £109.9m
during the year, principally reﬂecting the utilisation of
Onetel reorganisation provisions.
Net deferred tax assets have increased from £34.9m
to £51.7m, primarily reﬂecting an increase in unutilised
tax losses and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities 
on acquisition intangibles.
Financing and treasury
The Group’s operations are ﬁnanced by committed
bank facilities, retained proﬁts and equity. During the
period, the Group agreed a new term loan facility of
£375m to assist with the acquisition of AOL’s UK
business. This facility, which has an initial term of ﬁve
years ending in October 2011, was arranged by HSBC
plc, ING Bank NV, London Branch, and The Royal
Bank of Scotland PLC. The terms of the new facility
are similar to our other committed bank facilities and
the covenant packages are identical. The Group was
in compliance with the covenant conditions of all
facility agreements at the period end.
In addition to committed facilities, the Group has a
number of uncommitted loan facilities, overdrafts and
guarantee lines – all technically repayable on demand
– which enable it to optimise cash management
efﬁciency, particularly at times of peak working capital
requirements. Cash and investments held for
insurance purposes of approximately £79.8m (2006:
£77.0m) are not immediately available to the Group 
to offset borrowings. These funds are invested to
maximise returns whilst ensuring at all times that such
investments are within acceptable risk parameters.
Funding of our subsidiaries is arranged centrally with
an emphasis on tight cash control and efﬁcient cash
management. All cross-border funding is provided on
an arm’s length basis and currency risk is hedged
using foreign exchange swaps or currency borrowings,
as appropriate, at all times. Other than through inter-
company loans and capital funding, balance sheet
translational risk is not hedged against adverse
movements in exchange rates and the results of any
such movements are taken to reserves. The Group 
is exposed to limited cross-border transactional
commitments and, where signiﬁcant, these are hedged
at inception using forward currency contracts. In some
circumstances, particularly for highly volatile currencies,
the Group also hedges future currency commitments,
which are accounted for as cashﬂow hedges.
Treasury policy permits the use of long-term derivative
treasury products for the management of currency 
and interest rate risk and the Group’s interest rate
exposures are monitored regularly. The Group does
not trade or speculate in any ﬁnancial instruments. 
Return on capital employed 
Total shareholders’ funds at March 2007 were
£689.6m, compared to £619.0m at March 2006. 
After taking into account average net debt, and
adjusting for the amortisation of acquisition intangibles
and goodwill arising on historic minority acquisitions,
the Group generated a return on capital employed 
of 12.1% (2006: 16.9%), the decrease reﬂecting the
start-up losses in the period on Free Broadband and
Virgin Mobile France.
Assuming a weighted average cost of capital for 
the period of 6.8% (2006: 6.6%), this represents 
an economic value added of £56.6m (2006: 69.4m) 
or 5.4% (2006: 10.3%).

Business Review Governance Financial Statements
www.cpwplc.com
RISK AREA POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Competitive
environment 
Loss of market share and
erosion in margins from
increased competition.
We have always focused on reinvesting the beneﬁts of our increasing
scale into our customer proposition to keep barriers to entry high and
to maximise value for our customers. Our pricing in both mobile retail
and broadband reﬂects this strategy.
Brand 
perception
Reduction in customer loyalty
and higher churn in our ﬁxed line
operations as a result of poor
customer service.
We are investing signiﬁcantly in improving current service levels at
TalkTalk. This year we will introduce a new billing and customer
management platform that will enhance our ability to provide high
quality service to our customers. 
Capacity and
functionality 
of our IT and
telecoms
infrastructure
Failure to provide adequate
service levels to customers or to
manage back ofﬁce processes.
Our investment in IT continues to grow in line with the increasing scale
and complexity of our business. Telecoms investment will peak in the
coming year, with further investment in later years addressing the
increased bandwidth demands of customers.
Retention 
of key
management
Lack of necessary expertise or
continuity to execute strategy.
We have successfully attracted and retained high quality executive
management through attractive incentive packages and wide-ranging
career opportunities.
Operational risks
RISK AREA POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Revenue
assurance
Proﬁts and cash ﬂow 
reduced through high levels 
of non-paying customers.
We have dedicated credit control functions to manage both residential
and corporate debt, and credit checking processes that are continuously
developed to minimise the risk of non-payment. Our network operator
debtors are highly cash generative, well capitalised businesses.
Stock
management
Financial results impacted by
obsolete retail stock.
We have a very high turnover of stock and the subsidised business
model stimulates end demand.
Exchange 
rates
Reported proﬁts distorted by
exchange rate movements;
value of assets and liabilities
similarly affected.
Exchange rate exposures are primarily to the Euro and Swiss Franc,
which are historically stable currencies. Exposures to exchange rate
movements are continuously monitored and hedging of speciﬁc
transactions is undertaken where the risks are considered material.
Telecoms
regulation
Fixed line business model
compromised by changes 
to regulated market structure
and pricing.
We share the goals of the telecoms and insurance regulators of
competitive markets in which the customer has transparency and
choice. We have a team of regulatory specialists who work with the
relevant authorities towards these goals.
Investment in
new areas
Capital invested in new business
areas fails to make a return.
New business ventures and acquisition activity generally have a
required hurdle rate of 15% post-tax internal rate of return. New
ventures are managed in stages so that capital commitment is not
signiﬁcant until there is good visibility of a return.
Financial risks
As discussed in the Corporate Governance section on pages 22 to 24 of this report, the Group has a dedicated Risk and Internal Audit function,
reporting to the Board, that continuously assesses and monitors the key risks to the business. The table below summarises the more material risks 
to the Group, and how we seek to mitigate them in the day-to-day running of the business.  Governance
The Group has a strong track record as a responsible
employer, consumer and distributor and now also has
senior executive sponsorship to help co-ordinate and
plan our activities.
Our approach will be simple. We will aim to minimise
our environmental impact through simple but effective
actions across our stores and support facilities, and
mobilise our employees to change working practices
to support this drive. Importantly, we will also engage
with customers, who are increasingly discerning about
who they choose to do business with, based on
factors other than our core principles of value and
service. We are developing a range of solutions that
will educate customers and give them practical ways
to reduce their own environmental impact. We will 
give a full update on these initiatives next year.
Charity, community and employee activities
The Carphone Warehouse continued its support of its
two partner charities, Barnardo’s and Get Connected,
with a wide range of activities. TalkTalk, The Carphone
Warehouse’s ﬁxed line service, has continued to
partner with TreeHouse, the national charity for autism
education, raising funds and developing best practice
for autism education throughout the UK.
At The Carphone Warehouse we recognise that 
there are many different issues that affect the lives 
of our employees and have also created The
Carphone Warehouse UK Foundation to support 
those individual charities and local community 
projects nominated by employees.
The Carphone Warehouse supports both its charitable
partners and The Foundation in many ways, from
donating gifts for sales and rafﬂes, offering extra
holiday for employees undertaking overseas treks and
other speciﬁc volunteering activities, to donating proﬁts
from the sale of accessories over the Christmas period
and Give As You Earn through the payroll.
Get Connected
Get Connected is a free and conﬁdential helpline that
can ﬁnd and connect vulnerable young people to the
best services in the UK, to assist them with their
issues. The Carphone Warehouse provides ofﬁce
space and accommodation for the service and its
volunteers, phone lines and IT support as well as
offering employees the opportunity to earn extra
holiday or have matched time off to volunteer. 
In 2006 The Carphone Warehouse continued its
seven-year relationship with Get Connected offering
additional marketing support to its extensive charitable
efforts, including free advertising and direct mailings 
to its customer base.
In February 2007 Andrew Harrison, a trustee of the
charity, hosted its third charity auction at the Pigalle
Club, Piccadilly, London, with the continued support of
Corporate Responsibility
suppliers and partners. Those unable to attend the
event were also able to bid on-line, and we raised 
a total of £186,000, almost double the funds raised 
in the previous year.
The funds raised from the auction and employees’
individual efforts will allow Get Connected to help an
even greater number of young people throughout the
UK by developing an on-line presence and expanding
their web-chat service to match the hours of the free
phone line service.
TreeHouse
Autism is a life-long neurological condition affecting
basic communication skills in one in 100 children. 
At its most profound, children with autism may never
acquire spoken language, require 24-hour care and
may be perceived to be living in a world of their own.
TreeHouse was established to provide specialist
education for children with autism and provide an
educational centre of excellence for children with
autism and related communication disorders.
The shared vision of TalkTalk and TreeHouse of helping
people to communicate has made this a perfect
charity partnership. TalkTalk has committed to
continue to donate 1 penny from every call made 
to its 118111 directory enquiries service and has
provided extensive marketing support through activity
like bill inserts and direct mailing to its customers.
Since its foundation in 1997, TreeHouse has occupied
six temporary homes in North London. In 2005,
TreeHouse launched an appeal to raise £11.5 million 
to construct the ﬁrst National Centre for Autism
Education. This permanent building will house
extended school facilities for autistic children in London
and will also be home to a national teaching facility,
where services are piloted and evaluated and best
practice shared by practitioners throughout the UK. 
TalkTalk is committed to helping TreeHouse to see this
ambition realised.
Borneo Trek
Having the opportunity to visit one of the last unspoilt
places on earth, raising funds for The Carphone
Warehouse UK Foundation and gaining hands-on
experience in a local community project through the
annual charity trek, is a highlight for both employees
and charities.
Held in May 2006, this year’s trek took 53 employees
to Borneo with the goal of building the world’s ﬁrst
ever tracking station for the rehabilitation back into 
the wild of previously orphaned Orang-utans. Each
employee raised approximately £2,250 to fund their
trek with a total of £40,000 being raised for The
Carphone Warehouse Charity Partnerships in the UK.

Employees
Our Human Resources teams continue to review 
and improve processes to ensure that the work
environment, recruitment, training processes and
employee satisfaction are of the highest standard.
Historically, one of the key tools we have used to
assess these important areas is BackChat, a
completely anonymous online questionnaire that
enables us to examine the attitudes of every employee
to all aspects of the business.
The 2006 survey continued to produce encouraging
results, but also highlighted some areas for further
development. The overall response rate across the 
entire Group was 82%. On the positive side, the most
favourable scores were recorded in the sections on
management style and the day-to-day job, with 87% 
of employees understanding how their work contributes
towards the success of the company. 75% of employees
said they had received training in the last 12 months, up
three percentage points on the previous year.
Disappointing scores were recorded in areas such 
as quality of work life (49%) and communication and
support (51%). Partly in response to this feedback, we
have launched a range of new policies this year. New
fathers will now have much greater ﬂexibility over when
they take their paternity leave. Employees on maternity
leave can now come in for “keeping in touch” days,
enabling them to come into work on occasional days
without breaking their maternity leave, and when they
do return they can do so in a staged process, building
up their hours over time. The goal is to keep
employees engaged and involved, and to aid the
process of returning to work.
For 2007 we will be evolving the BackChat process
and moving the focus from employee satisfaction
towards employee engagement. We are also changing
the timing of the survey so that it is more aligned with
the business planning process and actions can be
incorporated into overall business plans. 
Diversity and inclusion
The Group recognises the importance of diversity
and inclusion, and has systems in place to recruit
employees of different genders, ages, disabilities and
ethnic origins. The Group is implementing an online
recruitment system and is also committed to putting
in systems to measure diversity across the Group.
Gender and race are, as last year, voluntarily recorded
via BackChat to enable us to monitor inclusion and
to recruit from speciﬁc groups that we feel are 
under-represented.
Regulatory and social responsibilities
We continue to operate in a relatively low impact
industry and our meetings and discussions with 
Group businesses on social, environmental and ethical
matters give us conﬁdence that both the risks to our
business in these areas are relatively low, and also that
controls are in place to ensure compliance with new
laws and regulations where necessary.
Below we have identiﬁed the key regulatory and social
risks currently affecting the Group. We have aimed to
focus our update on areas where there has been a
change in regulation or our approach during the year,
or where new regulation is on its way.
Mobile phones and driving
During the year we commissioned some market
research into attitudes on mobile phone usage while
driving. The results indicated that legislation had had little
impact on drivers’ habits, with 43% of men and 26% of
women still holding a mobile phone while driving.
In February 2007, an update to the Road Safety Bill 
in the UK came into force, increasing the penalty for
using a mobile phone while driving. Offenders now
face three penalty points on their licence and a ﬁne 
of £60. We raised awareness of the changes with 
our customers, reiterating our “hang up or go 
hands-free” message and running promotions on
hands-free equipment.
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive &
Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances
The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment
(“WEEE”) Regulations came into force on 2 January
2007. These regulations transpose the EU WEEE
19
Governance Financial Statements
www.cpwplc.com
BackChat, our annual
employee survey, enables 
us to measure the impact 
of actions taken to improve 
the working environment Directive, which aims to minimise the impact of
electrical and electronic goods on the environment, 
by increasing re-use and recycling and reducing the
amount of WEEE going to landﬁll. It seeks to achieve
this by making producers responsible for ﬁnancing the
collection, treatment, and recovery of waste electrical
equipment, and by obliging distributors to allow
consumers to return their waste equipment free of
charge (“Take-back”).
The Carphone Warehouse Limited and TalkTalk
Telecom Limited are subject to the regulations both as
producers and distributors. The speciﬁc obligations are
being rolled out in separate stages; the registration
and labelling requirements commenced in March 2007
and on 1 July 2007 the remainder of the obligations
will come into force, including ﬁnancing, record-
keeping and Take-back.
Adult content
We take the risks associated with illegal or abusive
content very seriously. In our Distribution business, 
we have a code of practice in the UK to apply to all
Carphone Warehouse branded web channels. As well as
clearly classifying content as suitable for adults only, we
include pre-requisites to purchasing, such as only selling
via credit card to ensure that a customer is over 18.
In our growing broadband operations, we have
recently opened a dedicated Abuse Management
bureau in our Stornoway call centre. The bureau is
staffed by trained and vetted individuals and deals
with issues arising from illegal or abusive content on
the TalkTalk network, and any other content that is
alleged to be in breach of our acceptable usage policy.
It liaises directly with the Internet Watch Foundation
(IWF) and, where necessary, the relevant law
enforcement agencies.
In addition, a new platform called StreamShield will
shortly be deployed. This performs upstream ﬁltering
of a list of banned websites as speciﬁed by IWF.
Environment
Our stores have a requirement to ensure that all
packaging and store waste is returned to our
warehouses to be recycled and re-used. The UK
monthly buyers’ guide is made from chlorine free
paper and from wood from sustainable forests. 
In addition, the Group has made a commitment to
ensure that all cleaning products used in its stores and
at the Support Centre are non-toxic and eco-friendly.
We actively promote non-legislative recycling initiatives
encouraging the recycling of paper, toner cartridges,
batteries and drinks cans.
Handset recycling
In an era of global warming and dwindling natural
resources, we are very concerned with the disposal 
of redundant mobile handsets and offer a service to
dispose of old phones responsibly and raise valuable
funds for charity. For every handset received, The
Carphone Warehouse is donating £10 to The CPW
Charity Partnership.
In the last year, 10,000kg of old phones were sent to
The Carphone Warehouse’s recycling centre. When
the phones arrive they are separated into handsets
that can be re-sold and those that need to be recycled
– typically around 10% of the total. No part of the
recycled phone ends up in a landﬁll site: batteries are
used to repair other handsets, metals are recovered
for re-use and parts with no recovery value are
incinerated to generate power.
Once impurities have been removed, the phone’s
plastics can be ground into a ﬁne powder and fed into
an injection moulder, producing products ranging from
coathangers to garden benches.
Carbon emissions 
We have almost completed our far reaching review 
of energy and utilities consumption and related 
CO2 emissions throughout the UK. We are now in
negotiations with carbon offsetting schemes and
alternative fuel providers for the retail distribution ﬂeet,
and we expect to complete agreements before the
end of 2007. We have made considerable moves to
reduce our carbon footprint through a series of energy
efﬁcient measures in both our retail and support
functions, and our retail stores are now amongst the
most innovative and efﬁcient in the sector. A full report,
incorporating emissions measurement and targets, will
be included in next year’s annual report.
Mobile phones and health
Throughout the year we have continued to support the
Government in their research into the effects of mobile
phones on health. Despite the recent conclusion of
their three year investigation, which has found that
mobile phones are unlikely to damage health, we will
continue to support the second phase of research 
over the next three years. Additionally, The Carphone
Warehouse continues to provide customers with all of
the information on mobile phones and health concerns
to enable them to make informed decisions. An
independent and extensive health fact sheet is available
in our stores and on our website. We also continue to
list speciﬁc absorption rates for every handset in our
Buyers’ Guide every month, and on our website.

Governance Financial Statements
www.cpwplc.com Introduction 
The Board of Directors recognises the importance of high standards of
corporate governance. This Report and the Remuneration Report set out on
pages 25 to 30 explain that the Company has complied during the period with
the principles contained in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
(“Code”) except as stated to the contrary in this Report. In accordance with the
Listing Rules issued by the Financial Services Authority, the relevant parts of
this Report have been reviewed by the auditors and their opinion is contained
in the Independent Auditor’s Report on page 33.
Board of Directors 
Composition of the Board 
There are currently ﬁve Executive Directors and eight Non-Executive Directors
(including the Non-Executive Chairman and the Non-Executive Deputy
Chairman). Biographies of each of the Directors, their responsibilities and 
Board Committee memberships are set out on page 21.
The following changes to the Board have taken place since last year’s 
Annual Report:
The appointment of Andrew Harrison as an Executive Director together with the
appointments of Baroness Morgan, Steven Esom and David Mansﬁeld all as
Non-Executive Directors were approved at the Annual General Meeting held on
27 July 2006.
Between the period of 2 April 2006 and 24 April 2007 the Board comprised
ﬁve Executive Directors and seven Non-Executive Directors (including the 
Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Deputy Chairman). All of the 
Non-Executive Directors excluding the Chairman and Deputy Chairman were
considered to be Independent Non-Executive Directors. Throughout the 
period from 2 April 2006 and 24 April 2007 half of the Board, excluding the
Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Deputy Chairman, were
Independent Non-Executive Directors as required by the Code. These were 
Sir Brian Pitman, Baroness Morgan, David Mansﬁeld, Steven Esom and Adrian
Martin. On 24 April 2007, the Company announced the appointment of David
Grigson as a Non-Executive Director with immediate effect, meaning the Board
then comprised ﬁve Executive Directors and eight Non-Executive Directors. 
The appointment of David Grigson will be proposed to the shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting to be held on 26 July 2007 (“AGM”) and he is also
considered to be an Independent Director. 
On 5 June 2007, the Company announced that Jim Dale would stand down 
as a Director of the Company with immediate effect.
Following all of the above changes to the Board and as from the AGM, the
Board will comprise four Executive Directors and eight Non-Executive Directors
(including the Non-Executive Chairman and the Non-Executive Deputy Chairman).
Six of these Non-Executive Directors, excluding the Non-Executive Chairman
and Non-Executive Deputy Chairman, are considered to be Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. These are Sir Brian Pitman, Baroness Morgan, 
David Mansﬁeld, Steven Esom, Adrian Martin and David Grigson.
Charles Dunstone is the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, John Gildersleeve is 
Non-Executive Chairman, David Ross is Non-Executive Deputy Chairman 
and Sir Brian Pitman is the Senior Independent Director.
All new Directors went through a formal process of induction principally carried
out by the Company Secretary. All Directors are subject to election by
shareholders at the ﬁrst Annual General Meeting following appointment and
thereafter to re-election at least every three years. Each Executive Director 
and David Ross has a service contract that can be terminated by either the
Company or the Director on 12 months’ notice or less.
The Non-Executive Directors, apart from David Ross, have three year periods
of appointment, the terms of which are substantially in the same format as
suggested by the Code, with three month notice periods and no compensation
for loss of ofﬁce. Further details on each Director’s remuneration, including the
dates of their contracts with the Company, are set out in the Remuneration
Report on pages 25 to 30.
Corporate Governance 
Board meetings 
The Board meets formally at least six times a year, with additional meetings 
as required. The Board met formally seven times during the period (including 
a strategy day). All Directors formally attended these meetings with the
exception of Steven Esom and Andrew Harrison who were both absent from
the meeting held on 25 May 2006, Jim Dale who was absent from the meeting
held on 25 January 2007 and David Ross who was absent from the meeting
on 29 March 2007. These absences were due to prior engagements that 
could not be changed with the exception of Jim Dale who had to attend a
family funeral. The Company Secretary ensures that all Board papers are sent
out to non-attending Directors and that, where possible, any comments they
have are received beforehand so that they can be expressed at the meeting.
Operation of the Board 
The wide range of experience and expertise of the Non-Executive Directors,
combined with the skill sets of the Executive Directors, provides vast experience
of retailing, mobile and ﬁxed line telecommunications and general business
experience, strong personal skills and independence of thought and perspective.
The overriding responsibility of the Board is to provide entrepreneurial and
responsible leadership to the Group within a framework of prudent and effective
controls. These controls allow for the key issues and risks facing the business to
be assessed and managed. The Board determines the overall strategic direction
for the Group, reviews management performance and ensures that the
necessary ﬁnancial and human resources are in place to enable the Group to
meet its objectives. The Board is comfortable that the necessary controls and
resources exist within the Group to enable these responsibilities to be met. The
Board ensures that the Directors, and in particular the Non-Executive Directors,
develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders about the
Company. The Company regularly communicates with major shareholders and
has a dedicated internal investor relations department. Brieﬁngs on market
activity, together with the views of shareholders and analysts on the Company,
are also regularly provided to the Board.
There is a clear and documented division of responsibilities between the roles
of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. There are also documented
schedules of matters reserved to the Board and matters delegated to
Committees of the Board. Such reserved matters include decisions on strategic
and policy issues, the approval of published ﬁnancial statements and major
acquisitions and disposals, authority levels for expenditure, treasury and risk
management policies. Strategic and policy issues are reviewed annually at 
a combined Board and senior executive strategy day.
Performance evaluation 
During the period the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of the
Directors was reviewed. The Board, and each individual Director, also
undertook performance evaluations. Using the Higgs ‘Suggestions for Good
Practice’ as guidance, the individual Directors initially completed separate
questionnaires. The results were collated and analysed by the Company
Secretary, who prepared reports as appropriate to the Chairman, the Senior
Independent Director, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the Board as a whole.
The areas covered included the role of the Executive and Non-Executive
Directors, the Board, the Board Committees, the Chairman of the Company,
preparation for and performance at meetings, the effectiveness of each
Director, leadership, culture and corporate governance. The results were then
considered by the Board as a speciﬁc item of business. The Board proposes
that these exercises or similar ones continue to be carried out each year.
Following such performance evaluation the Chairman conﬁrms that all those
Non-Executive Directors seeking election or re-election at the AGM continue to
be effective and demonstrate a commitment to the role, including having time
to attend all necessary meetings and to carry out other appropriate duties. 
The Chairman meets regularly with all the Independent Non-Executive Directors
usually in the evening prior to a Board meeting. This provides the opportunity
to raise any questions regarding the performance of the Executive Directors or
in respect of any other matters. 
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 200 7
22 The Senior Independent Director also met with the Non-Executive Directors, in
the absence of the Chairman, to assess the Chairman’s effectiveness, having
ﬁrst reviewed the results of a performance evaluation questionnaire completed
by all the Directors apart from the Chairman. The Board is of the opinion that
the Chairman had no other signiﬁcant commitments during the period that
would have affected his performance in his role. 
External appointments 
The Board supports Executive Directors taking up Non-Executive Directorships
as part of their continued development, and the Board believes that this will
ultimately beneﬁt the Company. Further details are provided in the
Remuneration Report on pages 25 to 30.
Board Committees 
There are ﬁve key Board Committees: Audit, Remuneration, Nomination,
Insurance Compliance and Telecoms Regulatory, the last two Committees
having been created during the period. The Committees are provided with
sufﬁcient resources via the Company Secretary and, where necessary, have
direct access to independent professional advisors to undertake their duties.
Audit Committee 
The Committee currently comprises the following Independent Non-Executive
Directors: Adrian Martin (Chairman), Sir Brian Pitman, Baroness Morgan, 
David Mansﬁeld, Steven Esom and, following his appointment on 24 April
2007, David Grigson. Both Adrian Martin and David Grigson are deemed by
the Board to be the Committee members with recent and relevant ﬁnancial
experience. All of the Committee members have extensive commercial
experience. The Committee met formally four times during the period. 
All members attended each meeting, with the exception of Sir Brian Pitman
who was absent from the meeting on 26 October 2006 due to a prior
engagement that could not be changed and David Grigson, who was 
only appointed on 24 April 2007.
The Chairman of the Committee updates the Board on any signiﬁcant issues
that may have arisen at the Board meeting following each Committee meeting.
During the period, all the requirements of the Code in respect of the Committee
were met. The work undertaken by the Committee is described within the
following sections of this Report. 
The Group’s Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and other senior management attend
Committee meetings by invitation of the Committee. Representatives of the
Company’s external auditors and the Group Director of Risk also attend these
meetings by invitation of the Committee. The external and internal auditors
have direct access to the Committee during formal meetings and time is set
aside for them to have private discussions with the Committee, in the absence
of management. 
The Committee’s terms of reference, which are available on request from the
Company Secretary and are published on the Company’s website, comply with
the Code. During the period, the formal calendar of items considered at each
Audit Committee meeting within each annual cycle embraced the Code
requirements to: 
• monitor the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements of the Company, and any
formal announcements relating to the Company’s ﬁnancial performance,
including reviewing signiﬁcant ﬁnancial reporting judgements contained 
in them; 
• review the Company’s internal ﬁnancial controls and its internal control and
risk management systems and to make recommendations to the Board; 
• review the Company’s arrangements by which employees may raise
concerns in conﬁdence; 
• monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s internal audit function; 
• make recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment, 
re-appointment and removal of external auditors and to approve 
their remuneration and terms of engagement; 
• review and monitor the external auditors’ independence and objectivity and
the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into consideration relevant UK
professional and regulatory requirements; and 
• review the Company’s policy on the engagement of the external auditors to
supply non-audit services. In this context the Committee’s remit requires it 
to report to the Board identifying any matters in respect of which it considers
that action or improvement is needed and to make recommendations as to
the steps to be taken.
In the light of the assessments and review undertaken, the Committee
recommended to the Board that Deloitte & Touche LLP be retained as 
auditors of the Company. This recommendation was endorsed by the Board. 
The policy relating to the provision of non-audit services by the external
auditors speciﬁes the types of work from which the external auditors are
excluded; for which the external auditors can be engaged without referral to
the Committee; and for which a case-by-case decision is required. In order to
safeguard the auditors’ objectivity and independence, the ratio of non-audit
fees to audit fees is monitored by the Committee within an overall limit set by
the Board on the recommendation of the Committee. 
A statement of fees paid or accrued for services from the external auditors
during the period is set out below: 
2007 2006 
£’000 £’000 
Audit services: 
– statutory audit 1,375 1,115
– non-statutory audit – 14
Tax services: 
– compliance services – 7
– advisory services 117 115
Other services 53 22 
Total 1,545 1,273 
Certain non-audit services are pre-approved by the Committee depending
upon the nature and size of the service. Tax services comprise compliance
services and technical advice associated with relevant UK and international
ﬁscal laws and regulations and, in particular, assessment of the potential
implications of proposed corporate transactions or restructuring. 
Having undertaken a review of the non-audit related work, the Committee has
satisﬁed itself that the services undertaken during the period did not prejudice
the external auditors’ independence. 
At each of its meetings the Committee reviewed and considered reports from
the Group Director of Risk on the status of the Group’s risk management
systems, ﬁndings from the internal audit function concerning internal controls,
and reports on the status of any weaknesses in internal controls identiﬁed by
the internal or external auditors. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Committee currently comprises the following independent Non-Executive
Directors: Sir Brian Pitman (Chairman), Baroness Morgan, David Mansﬁeld,
Steven Esom, Adrian Martin, and, following his appointment on 24 April 2007,
David Grigson. 
The Committee met formally ﬁve times during the period and each member,
except David Grigson who was only appointed on 24 April 2007, attended
every meeting with the exception of Steven Esom who was absent from the
meeting on 26 May 2006 and Baroness Morgan who was absent from the
meeting on 28 September 2006. Both absences were due to prior
engagements that could not be changed. The Company Secretary ensures that
all Committee papers are sent out to non-attending Directors and that, where
possible, any comments they have are received beforehand so that they can
23
Governance Financial Statements
www.cpwplc.com be expressed at the meeting. Other Directors, the Company Secretary, 
the Group Director of Human Resources, the Head of Compensation and 
Beneﬁts and advisors attended by invitation only. A detailed description 
of the Committee’s remit and work during the period is contained in the
Remuneration Report on pages 25 to 30. Its terms of reference comply with
the Code, are available on request from the Company Secretary and are
published on the Company’s website. The Chairman of the Committee
updates the Board following each Committee meeting.
Nomination Committee 
During the period the Committee comprised the following Non-Executive
Directors: John Gildersleeve (Chairman), David Ross, Sir Brian Pitman and
Adrian Martin. The Committee meets as and when required and met once
formally during the period to discuss succession planning and a consideration
of appropriate appointments to the Board. The Committee also met in April
2007 where it considered and recommended that David Grigson be appointed
as an Independent Non-Executive Director. Spencer Stuart was used as an
external search consultancy for the appointment of future Independent Non-
Executive Directors and their work was carried out in conjunction with potential
candidates sourced by the Group directly. In April 2007 the appointment of
David Grigson was then unanimously approved by the Board.
The Committee’s terms of reference comply with the Code and are available
from the Company Secretary on request and are published on the Company’s
website. The Committee is responsible for succession planning at Board level,
overseeing the selection and appointment of Directors, regularly reviewing the
structure, size and composition of the Board and making its recommendations
to the Board. It assists in evaluating the commitments of individual Directors
and the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board. 
Insurance Compliance Committee
The Committee is chaired by Baroness Morgan and is attended by Adrian
Martin and senior executives. The role of the Committee is to review the
Group’s compliance with regulatory matters concerning the sale of insurance
products to customers and to provide the Non-Executive Directors, through
Baroness Morgan, with visibility of compliance issues. The Committee met
formally three times during the period. The Chairman of the Committee also
updates the Board following each Committee meeting.
Telecoms Regulatory Committee 
The Committee is chaired by David Mansﬁeld and is attended by David Goldie,
the Company Secretary and other senior executives. The role of the Committee
is to review the Group’s compliance with ﬁxed line regulatory matters, consumer
regulation across the ﬁxed and mobile businesses including Trading Standards,
Data Protection and Advertising Standards, and to provide the Non-Executive
Directors, through David Mansﬁeld, with visibility of these compliance issues.
The Committee met formally twice during the period. The Chairman of the
Committee also updates the Board following each Committee meeting. 
Other Committees
The Company also intends to create a new Group Finance Committee during
the next year to formalise the regular meetings held between senior executives
of the group ﬁnance, tax, treasury and legal departments. Further details will be
provided in next year’s Annual Report.
Risk management and internal control 
The Company has established a risk management programme that assists
management throughout the Company to identify, assess and mitigate
business, ﬁnancial, operational and compliance risks. The Board views
management of risk as integral to good business practice. The programme 
is designed to support management’s decision-making and to improve the
reliability of business performance. 
The risk management programme is supported by a dedicated team of risk
specialists, including internal auditors, who comprise the Group Risk and
Assurance function. To ensure that all parts of the Company have a good
understanding of risk, members of this team have conducted risk workshops
Corporate Governance continued
and reviews within each of the main operating divisions in the past year,
culminating in an assessment of key business risks by the Executive Directors
and senior management. These risk assessments have been wide-ranging,
covering risks arising from the regulatory environment, strategy, counter-parties
and organisational change associated both with major projects and with
acquisitions. The risk management process operates throughout the Company,
being applied equally to the main business divisions and corporate functions. 
The output from each annual assessment is a list of key strategic, ﬁnancial,
operational and compliance risks. Associated action plans and controls to
mitigate them are also put in place where this is possible and to the extent
considered appropriate by the Board taking account of costs and beneﬁts.
Changes in the status of the key risks and changes to the risk matrix are
reported regularly to the Audit Committee and at each Board Meeting. 
The Directors have overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal
control and for reviewing their effectiveness. The Board delegates to executive
management the responsibility for designing, operating and monitoring these
systems. The systems are based on a process of identifying, evaluating and
managing key risks and include the risk management processes set out above.
The systems of internal control were in place throughout the period and up to the
date of approval of the Annual Report and ﬁnancial statements. The effectiveness
of these systems is periodically reviewed by the Audit Committee in accordance
with the guidance in the Turnbull Report. These systems are also reﬁned as
necessary to meet changes in the Group’s business and associated risks.
The systems of internal control are designed to manage rather than eliminate
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. They can only provide
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material errors, losses, fraud 
or breaches of laws and regulations. 
The Board has conducted an annual review of the effectiveness of the systems
of risk management and internal control in operation during the year and up to
the date of the approval of the Annual Report and ﬁnancial statements and this
was approved by the Audit Committee and the Board.
Communication with investors 
The Board believes it is important to explain business developments and
ﬁnancial results to the Company’s shareholders and to understand any
shareholder concerns. The principal communication media used to impart
information to shareholders are news releases (including results
announcements) and Company publications. In all such communications, 
care is taken to ensure that no price sensitive information is released. 
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer have lead responsibility
for investor relations. They are supported by a dedicated investor relations
department that, amongst other matters, organises presentations for analysts
and institutional investors. There is a full programme of regular dialogue with
major institutional shareholders, fund managers, analysts, retail brokers and
credit investors, upon which the Chairman ensures that the Board receives
regular updates at Board meetings. The Board also receives periodic reports
on investors’ views of the performance of the Company. All the Non-Executive
Directors and, in particular, the Chairman and Senior Independent Director, are
available to meet with major shareholders, if such meetings are required.
Further ﬁnancial and business information is available on the Company’s
website, www.cpwplc.com.
The Company also communicates with shareholders through the Annual
General Meeting, at which the Chairman gives an account of the progress of
the business over the last year, and a review of current issues, and provides
the opportunity for shareholders to ask questions.
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 200 7
24 Remuneration Report
Compliance
This Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (“Regulations”) and the Combined Code
on Corporate Governance (“Code”). The constitution and operation of the Remuneration Committee are in compliance with the Code. In framing its remuneration
policy the Committee has given full consideration to the matters set out in Schedule A of the Code. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve this
Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 26 July 2007 (“AGM”).
The Regulations require the Company’s auditors to report to the members on the “auditable part” of this Report (marked *) and to state, in their opinion, that this
part of the Report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations).
Remuneration Committee
Responsibility for the establishment of overall remuneration policy for the Group lies with the Board of Directors. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for
making recommendations to the Board on the remuneration of the Chairman, Executive Directors and senior managers. The terms of reference of the Committee
are available on the Group’s website (www.cpwplc.com) or on request from the Company Secretary.
The Committee’s current composition is Sir Brian Pitman (Chairman). Steven Esom, David Mansﬁeld, Baroness Morgan, Adrian Martin and David Grigson (who was
appointed to the Committee on 24 April 2007) all of whom are Independent Non-Executive Directors. None of the members of the Committee has any personal
ﬁnancial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided by the Committee, no potential conﬂicts of interest arising from cross-memberships and
no day-to-day involvement in running the Group’s business.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting (“Mercer”) were appointed by the Committee as lead advisors in January 2007 and conducted a total reward survey for
Executive Directors and other senior managers. Mercer have no other connection with the Group. Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”) provided advice to the
Committee on employment tax and the administration of share option and SAYE schemes. Deloitte are the Group’s auditors and provide other services to the
Group as set out in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 22 to 24. Advice was also provided by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP in relation to the
valuation of share schemes. The Deputy Chairman, the Group Director of Human Resources and the Company Secretary also provided internal advice in respect 
of matters raised by the Committee. No Director nor any person advising the Committee plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration. 
Remuneration policy
The primary aim of the Committee is to ensure that remuneration aligns the interests of management and shareholders and reinforces behaviour which will lead 
to the continued long-term development of the business.
The Committee makes its recommendations to the Board by taking into account:
• The experience of Executive Directors and other senior managers;
• The Group’s competitiveness in the market place, assessed through independent external market comparisons;
• The growing international nature of the Group; and
• The development of new business streams and the added complexity to the business.
The growth of the Group has been such that it continues to be appropriate to compare against companies in the FTSE 100. Alongside this, a benchmark has been
established of the 15 companies above and below the Company in terms of market capitalisation.
The overall remuneration policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages to attract, retain and motivate executives of the calibre required, and to align their
interests with those of shareholders by relating a signiﬁcant element of the remuneration package to speciﬁc performance measures. In particular, the Committee
has recognised that the complexity of the Group continues to evolve and that the remuneration policy should be adjusted to reﬂect the calibre of executives
needed to continue to develop and grow the business.
The approach is to set ﬁxed remuneration at market median levels and to offer variable rewards, linked to the performance of the Group, which can provide
signiﬁcant overall levels of remuneration for exceptional performance and shareholder value creation. Approximately 72% of Executive Directors’ total remuneration,
including share awards, earned in the period was performance related. Charles Dunstone does not receive long-term incentive share awards. 
Components of remuneration
The main ﬁxed and performance–related elements of remuneration that can be awarded to Executive Directors are as follows:
• basic salary, beneﬁts and pension contribution (ﬁxed);
• annual performance bonus (variable); 
• share options (variable); and
• Performance Shares (variable). 
The Company operates a minimum shareholding policy, requiring Executive Directors to build up and retain a shareholding in the Company of at least 100% of their
annual salaries.
Salaries and benefits
Executive Directors’ basic salaries are reviewed annually and take into account the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the individuals and
information obtained from published market data on the salary rates for similar positions in companies of a similar size. Salaries are reviewed on 1 July each year.
Following the most recent review, salaries from 1 July 2007 will be held at their current levels.

Annual Performance Bonus
The Company operates a bonus scheme designed to reﬂect the performance of the Group. Bonuses are governed by performance conditions set by the Remuneration
Committee to ensure that maximum variable rewards are paid only for exceptional performance. The bonus scheme for the period ending 29 March 2008 will have
targets based on improvements in Headline EPS (see note 11 to the ﬁnancial statements) before tax, with a maximum payment of 200% of annual salary.
Annual Deferred Bonus Plan 
In the period, Executive Directors and senior managers had the option of taking some or all of their cash bonus in the form of a deferred share award. The rights 
to deferred shares cannot be exercised for 12 months. Matching shares may also be awarded if the deferred share award is not exercised for up to a further two
years. The number of matching shares awarded equates to 12.5% of the deferred amount at the beginning of each year. The share equivalent of dividends that
would have been paid on the shares is added to the deferred share award each year. This scheme will be reviewed during the next year.
Share options
The Company has a share option scheme for Executive Directors and senior managers both in the UK and overseas. No options were granted to Executive
Directors in the period ended 31 March 2007 and it is currently not envisaged that grants will be made to them in the forthcoming year. A UK savings-related 
share option scheme is open to all eligible employees in the UK, including Executive Directors. No Executive Director currently participates in the scheme.
Performance Share Plan
In July 2004, senior managers, including Executive Directors, received awards of Performance Shares (as deﬁned in the Annual General Meeting on 28 July 2004).
Further awards were made to certain individuals in the period ended 1 April 2006. These awards are subject to a mixture of Headline EPS and Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) performance targets measured over a three or four year performance period. In December 2006 the Remuneration Committee awarded a further 
grant under the Performance Share Plan. The new award is subject to TSR performance targets measured against an initial performance period to 4 June 2010 
and a subsequent performance period to 4 June 2011. The TSR calculation is independently calculated for the Remuneration Committee by Mercer.
Details of the grants to Executive Directors and the performance targets are set out in the share tables later in the Report.

(i) The taxable beneﬁts provided consist of a company car or car allowance, car insurance, fuel and private medical cover.
(ii) Annual bonuses for the period ended 31 March 2007 were accrued at the balance sheet date and will be paid in June 2007. For this period, the bonus was
based on a range of stretching Headline EPS targets and an assessment of the implementation of Free Broadband. No bonus will be paid in respect of the
implementation of Free Broadband and a bonus of 100% salary will be paid in respect of EPS achievement. 
(iii) Steven Esom’s fees were paid directly to his employer, Waitrose Limited.
The Remuneration Committee is satisﬁed that this bonus has provided an excellent link between reward and operating performance, and the creation 
of further shareholder value.

is paid by the Company together with a ﬁxed proportion by the Executive Director and both amounts are invested on behalf of the Executive Director. Pension
beneﬁts are then funded by the total investment. Jim Dale has a similar scheme in the Isle of Man. Levels are reviewed annually against published market data.
None of the Directors was a member of a deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme during the period. Pension entitlements are based on basic salary only.

Performance graphs
Graph 1 shows the Group’s performance compared to the TSR performance of the FTSE 250 Index over the last ﬁve ﬁnancial years. A three month rolling average
has been applied.
The FTSE 250 was selected as it is a broad market index of which the Group is a member. In addition, the Group uses that index as a comparator for determining
whether or not Performance Shares vest. 
Graph 2 shows similar information to Graph 1 but measured from 1 April 2004, with TSR measured on a daily basis. This graph is relevant as it reﬂects the TSR
performance condition for the 2004 award of Performance Shares.

(2006 – 0.75p) was paid in the period. The Directors recommend the
payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 2.25p per share (2006 – 1.75p). Subject 
to shareholders’ approval at the Annual General Meeting, the intended
payment date of the ﬁnal dividend will be on 3 August 2007 to

in the Remuneration Report on pages 25 to 30.
Employment of disabled people
It is the Group’s policy to encourage application for employment from
disabled people and to assist with their training and career development,
having regard to particular aptitudes and abilities. Every endeavour is made 
to ﬁnd suitable alternative employment and to re-train any employee who
becomes disabled while serving the Group.
Employee involvement
The Group places signiﬁcant emphasis on its employees’ involvement in 
the business at all levels. Managers are remunerated according to results
wherever possible and all employees are kept informed of issues affecting the
Group through formal and informal meetings and through the Group’s internal
publications. Members of the management team regularly visit all Group
locations and discuss matters of current interest and concern with employees.
Supplier payment policy
The Group’s policy is to agree terms of transactions, including payment
terms, with suppliers and, provided that suppliers perform in accordance 
with the agreed terms, it is the Group’s normal practice that payment is 
made accordingly. Details of the average credit period taken on trade
payables are provided in note 19 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Donations
The Group made charitable donations of £117,000 during the period

the period are provided in notes 23 and 24 to the ﬁnancial statements.

continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.

Governance Financial Statements
www.cpwplc.com Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements of The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC
(“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, “the Group”).
The Directors are required by law to prepare the Group’s ﬁnancial statements
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are required to ensure that the Group’s ﬁnancial statements
present fairly for each ﬁnancial period the Group’s ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial
performance and cash ﬂows which requires the faithful representation of the
effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the
deﬁnition and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses
set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s Framework for the
Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements. 
In preparing the Group’s ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required 
to select and apply accounting policies, present information, including
accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable
and understandable information, and provide additional disclosures when
compliance with the speciﬁc requirements of IFRS is insufﬁcient to enable
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and
conditions on the Group’s ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial performance or cash ﬂows.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Company keeps proper
accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
ﬁnancial position of the Group and which enable them to ensure that the
Group’s ﬁnancial statements comply with applicable law. 
The Directors are responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and
hence for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to prevent and
detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for including in the Annual Report a report 
on Directors’ remuneration which complies with the requirements of the
Companies Act 1985. 
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of the Group’s
ﬁnancial statements conﬁrms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the auditors are unaware; and
• the Director has taken reasonable steps that he/she ought to have taken as
a Director in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the
provisions of section 234Z of the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the
ﬁnancial information contained on the corporate website, www.cpwplc.com.
The work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of 
these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for 
any changes that may have occurred to the Group’s ﬁnancial statements
since they were initially presented on the website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of The Carphone 
Warehouse Group PLC
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of The Carphone Warehouse
Group PLC for the 52 weeks ended 31 March 2007 which comprise the
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow
Statement and the related notes 1 to 31. These Group ﬁnancial statements
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have
also audited the information in the Remuneration Report that is described
as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the individual Company ﬁnancial statements of
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC for the 52 weeks ended 31 March 2007.
This Report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this Report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the
Remuneration Report and the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement 
of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group ﬁnancial statements
give a true and fair view, whether the Group ﬁnancial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4
of the IAS Regulation and whether the part of the Remuneration Report
described as having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group
ﬁnancial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes
that speciﬁc information presented in the Operational and Financial Performance
Review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the
Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
speciﬁed by law regarding Director’s Remuneration and other transactions 
is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reﬂects the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 Combined Code
speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described in
the contents section and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
Group ﬁnancial statements. The other information comprises only the
Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review,
the unaudited part of the Remuneration Report, the Business Review, the
Corporate Responsibility Statement and the Corporate Governance
Statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware 
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group
ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further
information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the Group ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of 
the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the
preparation of the Group ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group ﬁnancial
statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or
error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the Group ﬁnancial statements and the part of
the Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs
as at 31 March 2007 and of its proﬁt for the 52 week period then ended; and
• the Group ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report
described as having been audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group
ﬁnancial statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC (“the Company”) is incorporated in the
United Kingdom.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries
(“the Group”) have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted for use in the European Union and as
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985. These
ﬁnancial statements therefore comply with Article 4 of the European Union
International Accounting Standard regulation. The Company continues to apply
United Kingdom GAAP in the preparation of its individual ﬁnancial statements,
which are contained on pages 67 to 71.
The details of the elections made on conversion to IFRS were set out in the 
1 April 2006 Annual Report.
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements, the following
standards and interpretations, which have not been applied in these ﬁnancial
statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
• IFRS7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, and the related amendment to
IAS1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ on capital disclosures. The Group
will adopt these pronouncements for the period ending 29 March 2008.
• IFRS8 ‘Operating Segments’, which, subject to its endorsement by 
the European Union, the Group will adopt for the period ending 
28 March 2009.
• IFRIC8 ‘Scope of IFRS2’, which the Group will adopt for the period ending 
29 March 2008.
• IFRIC9 ‘Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives’, which the Group will 
adopt for the period ending 29 March 2008.
• IFRIC10 ‘Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment’, which, subject to its
endorsement by the European Union, the Group will adopt for the period
ending 29 March 2008.
• IFRIC12 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’, which, subject to its
endorsement by the European Union, the Group will adopt for 
the period ending 28 March 2009.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations
will have no material impact on the Group’s results or ﬁnancial position, but IFRS8
may affect the disclosure of information in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis,
except for the revaluation of certain ﬁnancial instruments. The Group’s principal
accounting policies are set out below.
b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the results of the Group to
31 March 2007. The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the period
are included from or to the date on which control passed. Intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries
to bring accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
c) Foreign currency translation
Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using forward purchases
or sales of the relevant currencies and are recognised in the ﬁnancial
statements at the exchange rates thus obtained. Unhedged transactions 
are recorded at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Material
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are hedged,
mainly using forward foreign exchange contracts to create matching liabilities
and assets, and are retranslated at each balance sheet date. Hedge
accounting as deﬁned by IAS39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement’ has been applied in the current period by marking to market the
relevant ﬁnancial instruments at the balance sheet date and recognising the
gain or loss in reserves in respect of cash ﬂow hedges, and through the
income statement in respect of fair value hedges.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average foreign
exchange rates for the period, and their balance sheets are translated at the
rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Goodwill is held in the currency 
of the operations to which it relates. Exchange differences arising on the
translation of opening net assets, goodwill and results of overseas operations
are dealt with through the translation reserve. All other exchange differences
are included in the income statement.
The principal exchange rates against Sterling used in these ﬁnancial statements
are as follows:
Average Average
52 weeks 52 weeks 
ended ended Closing Closing
31 March 1 April 31 March 1 April 
2007 2006 2007 2006
Euro 1.4748 1.4644 1.4735 1.4333
South African Rand 13.3742 n/a 14.2247 n/a
Swedish Krona 13.6029 13.6833 13.7611 13.5185
Swiss Franc 2.3434 2.2737 2.3945 2.2668
United States Dollar 1.9018 n/a 1.9614 n/a
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal
recognised in the income statement is determined after taking into account the
cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation.
d) Revenue
Revenue is stated net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The following
accounting policies are applied to each business segment:
Distribution:
Distribution revenue comprises revenue generated from the sale of mobile
communication products and services, commission receivable on sales less
provision for promotional offers and network operator performance penalties,
ongoing revenue (share of customer airtime spend, and customer revenue and
retention bonuses) and insurance premiums.
• Commission receivable on sales, being commission which is contractually
committed, and for which there are no ongoing performance criteria, is
recognised when the sales to which the commission relates are made.
• Volume bonuses are recognised when the conditions on which they 
are earned have been met.
• Ongoing revenue is recognised as it is earned over the lives of the 
relevant customers.
• Insurance premiums are typically paid quarterly in advance. Initial
administration fees, which are speciﬁed in the contract, are recognised 
at the point of sale. Insurance premium income is recognised over the 
lives of the relevant policies.
• All other revenue is recognised when the relevant goods or services 
are provided.
Telecoms Services:
Telecoms Services revenue comprises revenue generated from facilities
management, revenue from mobile and ﬁxed network services and ongoing
revenue. All such revenue is recognised as it is earned over the lives of the
relevant customers. Revenue from other products and services associated 
with Telecoms Services is recognised when such products and services 
are provided.
Dealer:
Dealer revenue comprises revenue generated from the sale of mobile hardware
and is recognised when sales are made.

Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued
e) Share-based payments
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of
grant, and expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate 
of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Binomial model for share-based payments
with internal performance criteria (such as Earnings Per Share targets) and a
Monte Carlo model for those with external performance criteria (such as Total
Shareholder Return targets). 
For schemes with internal performance criteria, the number of options
expected to vest is recalculated at each balance sheet date, based on
expectations of performance against target and of leavers prior to vesting. 
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet is
recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
For schemes with external performance criteria, the number of options
expected to vest is adjusted only for expectations of leavers prior to vesting.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet is
recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
f) Pensions
Contributions to deﬁned contribution schemes are charged to the income
statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
g) Dividends
Dividend income is recognised when payment has been received. Final
dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the ﬁnancial statements 
in the period in which they are approved by the Group’s shareholders. 
Interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
h) Leases
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement
on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives and rent-free periods are amortised through the income
statement over the period of the lease.
Gains or losses from sale and leaseback transactions are deferred over the life
of the new lease to the extent that the rentals are considered to be above or
below market rentals. The remaining gain or loss is recognised within operating
expenses in the period in which the sale is completed.
i) Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at
amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the carrying
amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base. 
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of
taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in
future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry-forward
of unused tax losses and credits. Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates
that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and
are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred
tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax is provided on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries,
except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be
controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that
future taxable proﬁts will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except where it
relates to an item recognised directly in reserves, in which case it is recognised
directly in reserves.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legal right to do so
in the relevant jurisdictions.
j) Intangible assets
Goodwill:
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses,
representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair
value of the identiﬁable assets and liabilities acquired, is recognised initially as an
asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated
impairment losses. At the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to each of the
cash-generating units (“CGUs”) expected to beneﬁt from the combination and
held in the currency of the operations to which the goodwill relates. Goodwill is
reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently where there is an
indication that goodwill may be impaired. Impairment is determined by
assessing the future cash ﬂows of the CGUs to which the goodwill relates.
Where the future cash ﬂows are less than the carrying value of goodwill, an
impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the relevant goodwill is included 
in the calculation of the proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Subscriber acquisition costs:
Subscriber acquisition costs comprise the direct third-party costs of recruiting
and retaining new customers, net of incentives from network operators and
provision for in-contract churn. They are capitalised as an intangible asset, 
to the extent that they are supported by expected future cash inﬂows, and
amortised on a straight-line basis through operating expenses in the income
statement over the minimum subscription period. Subscriber acquisition costs
for customers with no minimum subscription commitment are reﬂected in
operating expenses as incurred.
Software and licenses:
Software and licenses includes internal infrastructure and design costs incurred
in the development of software for internal use. Internally generated software 
is recognised as an intangible asset only if it can be separately identiﬁed, 
it is probable that the asset will generate future economic beneﬁts, and the
development cost can be measured reliably. Where these conditions are not
met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in
which it is incurred. Software and licenses are amortised on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful economic lives of up to 8 years. 
Key money:
Key money paid to enter a property is stated at cost, net of amortisation and
any provision for impairment. Amortisation is provided on key money at rates
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, on a straight-line
basis over 10 years or the lease term if less.
Acquisition intangibles:
Acquired intangible assets (“acquisition intangibles”) such as customer bases,
brands and other intangible assets acquired through a business combination
are capitalised separately from goodwill and amortised over their expected
useful lives of up to 6 years on a straight-line basis. The value attributed to
such assets is based on the future economic beneﬁt that is expected to be
derived from them, calculated as the present value of future cash ﬂows after 
a deduction for contributory assets.

Financial Statements
k) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation and any
provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and
equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual
value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life from
the date it is brought into use, as follows:
Freehold buildings 2-4% per annum
Short leasehold costs 10 years or the lease term if less
Computer hardware, network and 
ofﬁce equipment 12.5-50% per annum
Fixtures and ﬁttings 20-25% per annum
Motor vehicles 25% per annum
l) Recoverable amount of non-current assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that
an asset may be impaired. Where an indicator of impairment exists, the Group
makes a formal estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. Where the carrying
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to
be impaired and is written down through an accelerated amortisation charge to
its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or
CGU’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, and is determined for an
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash ﬂows that are largely
independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
m) Investments 
All investments are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the
consideration given and including acquisition costs associated with the
investment.
The Group’s investments are categorised as available-for-sale and recorded 
at fair value from this date. 
Changes in fair value, together with any related taxation, are taken directly to
reserves, and recycled to the income statement when the investment is sold 
or is determined to be impaired. 
n) Interests in joint ventures
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. The
consolidated income statement includes the Group’s share of the pre-tax
proﬁts and attributable taxation of the joint ventures based on their ﬁnancial
statements for the ﬁnancial period. In the consolidated balance sheet, the
Group’s interests in the joint ventures are shown as a non-current asset in the
balance sheet, representing the Group’s gross cash investment in the share
capital of the joint ventures, as well as any loans advanced, plus or minus the
Group’s share of proﬁts or losses arising in the joint ventures.
o) Stock
Stock is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost, net of
discounts, includes all direct costs incurred in bringing stock to its present
location and condition and represents ﬁnished goods and goods for resale. 
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs
expected to be incurred to disposal. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-
moving or defective items where appropriate.
p) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand, demand deposits and
short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash.
q) Loans and other borrowings
Loans and other borrowings represent bank overdrafts, uncommitted bank
loans, committed bank loans and loan notes issued by the Group.
Bank fees and legal costs associated with the securing of external ﬁnancing 
are capitalised and amortised over the term of the relevant facility. All other
borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in 
which they are incurred.
r) Financial instruments
The Group uses forward currency contracts to reduce its exposure to
exchange rate ﬂuctuations. Such contracts are measured at their fair value
based on contracted exchange rates. Hedge accounting as deﬁned by IAS39
has been applied to the ﬁnancial statements in the current period.
s) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive
obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outﬂow of
resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can 
be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted where 
the time value of money is considered to be material.
Provisions are categorised as follows:
Insurance:
Full provision is made for the estimated cost of all claims notiﬁed but not
settled at the balance sheet date. Provision is also made for the estimated cost
of claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date, based on historic
experience of the value of such claims. Any differences between original claims
provisions and subsequent settlements are reﬂected in the income statement in
the relevant period.
Reorganisation:
Reorganisation provisions are only recognised where plans are demonstrably
committed and where appropriate communication to those affected has been
undertaken at the balance sheet date. Provisions are not recognised in respect
of future operating losses.
Sales:
Sales provisions relate to “cash-back” and similar promotions, product
warranties, product returns, and network operator performance penalties. 
The anticipated costs of these items are assessed by reference to historic
trends and any other information that is considered to be relevant.
Other:
Other provisions relate to dilapidations and similar property costs, and all other
provisions, principally being the anticipated costs of unresolved tax issues 
and legal disputes, and costs associated with onerous contracts. All such
provisions are assessed by reference to the best available information at the
balance sheet date.
t) Use of critical accounting estimates and assumptions 
Estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements
are continually reviewed and revised as necessary. Whilst every effort is made
to ensure that such estimates and assumptions are reasonable, by their nature
they are uncertain, and as such changes in estimates and assumptions may
have a material impact in the ﬁnancial statements.
The principal balances in the ﬁnancial statements where changes in estimates
and assumptions may have a material impact are as follows:
Subscriber acquisition costs:
Estimates made in relation to future cash inﬂows, related cash outﬂows 
and rates of in-contract churn are based on the best information available 
at the balance sheet date, but such estimates may differ from actual results.
Recoverable amount of non-current assets:
All non-current assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, are
reviewed for potential impairment using estimates of the future economic
beneﬁts attributable to them. In the case of customer bases, such estimates
involve assumptions in relation to future customer margins and average
customer lives. Any estimates of future economic beneﬁts made in relation 
to non-current assets may differ from the beneﬁts that ultimately arise, and
materially affect the recoverable value of the asset.
Trade and other receivables:
Provisions for irrecoverable receivables are based on extensive historic
evidence, and the best available information in relation to speciﬁc issues, 
but are nevertheless inherently uncertain. Notes to the Financial Statements continued
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 200 7
40
Current taxation:
The complex nature of tax legislation across the tax jurisdictions in which the
Group operates necessitates the use of many estimates and assumptions,
where the outcome may differ from that assumed.
Deferred taxation:
The extent to which tax losses can be utilised depends on the extent to which
taxable proﬁts are generated in the relevant jurisdictions in the foreseeable
future, and on the tax legislation then in force, and as such the value of
associated deferred tax assets is uncertain.
Provisions:
The Group’s reorganisation provisions are based on the best information
available to management at the balance sheet date. However, the future 
costs assumed are inevitably only estimates, which may differ from those
ultimately incurred.
Sales provisions are based on historic patterns: of redemption for promotions,
product return rates for returns and warranties, and penalty rates from network
operators. The Group has extensive data in all areas; however, if the historic
patterns on which the provisions are based change signiﬁcantly in the future,
the ﬁnancial statements may be materially impacted.
Provisions relating to the disposal of excess property necessitate assumptions
in respect of period to disposal and exit costs, which may differ from the
ultimate cost of disposal. www.cpwplc.com

The difference between revenue by destination and revenue by origin is not material.
Material acquisitions were all in the United Kingdom in the Telecoms Services division; these acquisitions recorded revenue of £129.2m and a loss before taxation
of £6.6m in the period, and represented total assets of £448.7m at 31 March 2007. The loss before taxation reﬂects an operating loss of £2.7m and an interest
charge of £3.9m.

2007 2006
Notes £’000 £’000
Reorganisation costs a – 22,288
Accelerated amortisation b – 12,957
– 35,245
a) The Group acquired Onetel in December 2005. Since then, the Group has commenced a reorganisation programme to integrate Onetel with the rest of the
Group. The costs of this integration were estimated at £22.3m, comprising the following:
£’000
Redundancy and other employee costs 11,934
Contract termination costs 4,977
Network and customer migration costs 4,919
Other 458
22,288
b) The substantial customer growth achieved through the acquisition of Onetel and Tele2 UK, together with the Group’s major investment plans in respect of local
loop unbundling and billing platforms, prompted a review during the prior period of the Group’s systems and network infrastructure. 
This review represented a consideration of the extent to which the carrying value of the Group’s assets should be reduced either because they had no further
use or because their useful economic lives had reduced signiﬁcantly. The result of this review was an accelerated or one-off amortisation charge in respect of
the following assets:
£’000
Billing infrastructure and customer management systems 8,908
Other 4,049
12,957
Both these items are expected to attract tax relief at 30% and accordingly a deferred tax asset of £10.6m was recognised at 1 April 2006.

of the Company.
6 Share-based payments
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees, through the following schemes:
a) Performance Share Plan:
During the period the Group made awards of nil cost options under a Performance Share Plan. These awards are subject to Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”)
performance targets measured over an initial performance period to 4 June 2010 and a subsequent performance period to 4 June 2011. The awards made under
this plan in previous periods are subject to a mixture of Headline earnings per share (see note 11) and TSR performance targets measured over a three or four year
performance period. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee
leaves the Group before the options vest. Details of the performance targets are provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 25 to 30.
The following table summarises the number and weighted average exercise prices (“WAEP”) of share options for the scheme:

e) Fair value models:
Nil cost options with internal performance targets are valued using the market price of a share at the date of grant, discounted for expected future dividends to the
date of exercise. The fair values of other options with internal performance targets are estimated at the date of grant using the Binomial model. The inputs into the
Binomial model are as follows:
2007 2006
Expected volatility (%) 28.6 30.0
Risk free rate (%) 5.3 4.5
Dividend yield (%) 2.0 2.0
Expected volatility has been arrived at by using the historical volatility of the Group’s share price, and the volatility of the share price of similar companies, whose
shares have been listed for longer than those of the Group, over a period comparable with the expected lives of the options. The assumptions made to incorporate
the effects of expected early exercise have been included by assuming an expected option life based on historical exercise patterns for each option scheme.
The fair values of options with external performance targets are estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model. The model combines the market price 
of a share at the date of grant with the probability of meeting performance criteria, based on the historical performance of the Group’s shares. The historical
performance period reﬂects a volatility of 27.4%. A dividend yield of 2.0% has been assumed in the model.
f) Charge to income statement:
During the period the Group recognised a charge of £10.4m (2006 – £10.7m) in respect of equity settled share-based payments.

No deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in either period, except where there is a legal right to do so in the relevant jurisdictions.
At 31 March 2007 the Group had unused tax losses of £193.7m (2006 – £166.4m) available for offset against future taxable proﬁts. A deferred tax asset of £16.4m
(2006 – £6.4m) has been recognised in respect of £56.8m (2006 – £20.3m) of such losses, based on expectations of recovery in the foreseeable future.
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 200 7

8 Taxation continued
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £136.9m (2006 – £146.1m) as there is insufﬁcient evidence that there will be suitable
taxable proﬁts against which these losses can be recovered. Included within unrecognised tax losses are amounts of £12.0m (2006 – £16.7m) that will expire
between 2014 and 2018 and £14.0m (2006 – £9.3m) that will expire between 2008 and 2013. Other losses may be carried forward indeﬁnitely.
At 31 March 2007 the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have
not been recognised was £26.1m (2006 – £25.9m). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control
the timing of their reversal and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax assets and liabilities at 31 March 2007 do not take into account the impact of the proposed reduction in the UK statutory rate of corporation tax from 30.0% 
to 28.0% from 1 April 2008 as announced in the March 2007 Budget, as the relevant legislation was not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

12 Goodwill and other intangible fixed assets continued
Goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating units (“CGUs”), which are generally based on geographical location. The carrying amount of goodwill by
geographical location is as follows:
2007 2006
£’000 £’000
UK 341,124 261,437 
France 88,594 91,077 
Germany 71,062 73,054 
Spain 45,583 46,564 
Other 92,589 96,498 
Total goodwill 638,952 568,630 
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The Group prepares cash ﬂow forecasts derived from the most recent
ﬁnancial budgets approved by management for the next ﬁve years and extrapolates cash ﬂows for the following ﬁfteen years based on a country-speciﬁc growth
rate ranging from 1.7% to 3.0%. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. The average pre-tax rate used to discount
the forecast cash ﬂows is 10%.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct 
costs during the period, all of which are based on historical patterns and expectations of future market developments. Management estimates discount rates using
pre-tax rates that reﬂect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the CGUs. 
The Directors have not identiﬁed any CGUs where it is considered likely that key assumptions may change to such an extent that it would lead to a signiﬁcant
impairment loss.

i) AOL UK internet access business
On 29 December 2006, the Group acquired the trade and assets of the internet access business of AOL (UK) Limited, 100% of the issued share capital of AOL
Services (UK) Limited, registered in England and Wales, 100% of the issued share capital of AOL Europe Operations Limited, registered in Ireland, and 100% of the
issued share capital of AOL Services Sarl, registered in Luxembourg, for a total consideration of £379.9m. Total consideration comprises initial cash consideration
and fees of £251.5m, and deferred consideration of £128.4m, which is subject to working capital adjustments. Of this amount, £58.4m is payable within 1 year
and £70.0m is payable after 1 year.

Fair value adjustments relate principally to:
• the recognition of the following acquisition intangibles:
– customer bases comprising broadband, narrowband and voice customers valued at £279.0m. The valuation is derived from the discounted future cash ﬂows
expected to be generated by the customer bases, after a deduction for contributory assets;
– rights, subject to future performance criteria, to a share of transactional revenues generated by AOL access and TalkTalk customers on AOL sites. These rights
are valued at £34.7m, based on discounted expected future cash ﬂows, after a deduction for contributory assets; 
– a license to continue to use the AOL brand for a limited period, valued at £9.9m using the relief from royalty method, which reﬂects the discounted future
cash ﬂows saved from not incurring royalty payments.
• the write-down of property, plant and equipment and software development to its market value;
• the recognition of deferred tax, principally in respect of accelerated capital allowances and intangible assets; and
• the recognition of unrecorded liabilities and provision for onerous contracts.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of AOL is attributable primarily to the removal of a signiﬁcant competitor to TalkTalk in the residential broadband market and
the anticipated future operating synergies arising from the combination.
The Group’s results for the period reﬂect revenue from AOL of £106.8m and a loss before taxation of £3.5m.

iii) Other acquisitions
The Group made a number of other acquisitions during the period for a gross cash consideration of £13.4m. These acquisitions resulted in goodwill of £8.3m.
In addition, goodwill was reduced by £8.9m as a result of adjustments to contingent deferred consideration and by a net £2.4m due to the ﬁnalisation of provisional
fair value adjustments in both Onetel and Tele2 UK, principally in respect of unrecorded liabilities.
Deferred consideration of £7.5m was paid during the period in respect of acquisitions made in previous periods. This was offset by a reimbursement of contingent
consideration of £18.0m in relation to Onetel, which was acquired in December 2005.
The following summary shows the net cash outﬂow on acquisitions during the period:

All borrowings are unsecured.
Bank overdrafts and other uncommitted bank loans:
The Group has a variety of overdraft facilities in Sterling, Euro and other European currencies. These facilities are domiciled in various countries and interest is
charged at the standard overdraft rates applicable in the countries concerned. Some of the Group’s major banks make uncommitted facilities available to assist
with short-term liquidity management. These facilities bear interest based on the appropriate local interest rates. All of these facilities are repayable on demand.
Loan notes:
The Group has issued a number of interest-bearing loan notes. These loan notes are repayable on demand and expire between 2012 and 2015. No new loan
notes were issued during the period (2006 – £2.4m) and £15.1m (2006 – £6.6m) were redeemed or cancelled.
£ 45 0m Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”):
The RCF was signed in September 2004 and the amount available was increased from £300m to £450m in the prior period. The facility is repayable in full in
September 2009. The interest rate payable in respect of drawings under this facility is at a margin over LIBOR for the relevant currency and for the appropriate
period. The actual margin applicable to any drawing depends on the ratio of debt to EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent accounting period. A non-
utilisation fee is payable in respect of amounts available but undrawn under this facility. Covenants are included in this facility that limit the ratio of debt to EBITDA,
interest cover and ﬁxed charges (interest and operating lease expenditure) cover. The Group was in compliance with these covenants at the period end.
£ 5 0m term loan:
The ﬁve-year bi-lateral £50m term loan, which was signed in December 2005, is fully drawn in Sterling. The interest rate is calculated in a similar manner to the
£450m RCF. The loan is repayable in full in December 2010. The covenant package is identical to that in the £450m RCF.
£22 5 m term loan:
The £225m term loan, which was signed in February 2006, is fully drawn in Euro. The interest rate is calculated in a similar manner to the £450m RCF. The loan 
is repayable in full in February 2011. The covenant package is identical to that in the £450m RCF.
£ 375 m term loan:
In October 2006, the Group agreed a new term loan facility of £375m to assist with the acquisition of AOL’s UK internet access business. The maximum term of
this facility is seven years comprising a ﬁve year initial term and two one-year extension options, which are exercisable at the discretion of the bank group. If both
extension options are exercised, the ﬁnal maturity date will be October 2013. The terms of the new facility are similar to the Group’s other committed bank facilities,
and the covenant package is identical to that in the £450m RCF.

Liquidity risk:
To ensure the continuity of Group funding whilst also minimising the interest cost, borrowings are spread between long-term committed facilities, short-term
uncommitted bank loans and overdrafts with short-term cash surpluses invested overnight.

Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued
21 Financial instruments
The Business Review on pages 10 to 16 provides an explanation of the role that ﬁnancial instruments have in managing the Group’s currency and interest rate risk. 
Interest rate profile of financial assets and liabilities:
The interest rates on ﬂoating rate ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are linked to market interest rates, mainly on an overnight basis or for one, two or three month
periods. Future cashﬂows arising from these ﬁnancial assets and liabilities depend on interest periods agreed at the time of rollover and, as such, all ﬁnancial assets
and liabilities are classiﬁed as ﬂoating rate. 
The weighted average interest rate for loans and overdrafts was 4.29% (2006 – 3.28%).
The book value and fair value of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities is as follows:
2007 2006

Loan notes (483) (483) (15,558) (15,558)
Forward currency contracts (267) (267) ––
The fair value of available-for-sale investments has been provided by third-party fund managers. Other fair values have been arrived at by discounting future
cashﬂows, assuming no early redemption, or by revaluing forward currency contracts to period-end market rates or rates as appropriate to the instrument.
Foreign exchange derivatives:
The Group uses forward currency contracts to hedge transactional exposures. These contracts are mainly denominated in Euros, South African Rand and US
Dollars and primarily cover stock purchases and operating expenses. The Group also uses forward currency contracts to hedge balance sheet assets and liabilities
and also for short-term liquidity management. The Group currently holds no currency option contracts.
At 31 March 2007, the total notional principal amount of outstanding currency contracts was £171.0m (2006 – £129.4m). Within this balance, £6.0m (2006 – £nil)
is held in relation to cash ﬂow hedges, for which the associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred to operating proﬁt when the transactions occur over
the next 12 months. The balance relates to investments in and loans to the Group’s non-Sterling operations. The amount transferred to income in respect of
forward currency contracts was an expense of £0.3m (2006 – income of £0.2m).
The Group does not hedge the balance sheet translation risk of its foreign operations.
Functional currency:
The functional currency of individual companies within the Group varies with the territory in which they operate and the ﬁve currencies in which subsidiary
companies prepare their accounts are: Sterling, Euro, South African Rand, Swiss Franc and Swedish Krona. Material ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities held by
Group companies, which differ from their functional currency are as follows:
2007 2006
Euro Swiss Franc Other Total Euro Swiss Franc Other Total
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000

The ﬁnancial liabilities hedge net inter-company currency exposures and, as such, do not create foreign exchange risk in the income statement.
Embedded derivatives:
No contracts with embedded derivatives have been identiﬁed and accordingly no such derivatives have been accounted for separately.
Securities and guarantees:
None of the ﬁnancial liabilities are secured over Group assets. Although some guarantees are given by Group companies, these are to cover commercial
obligations and, as such, no additional credit risk is created.

Provisions are categorised as follows:
Insurance:
Insurance provisions represent the anticipated costs of all policyholder claims notiﬁed but not settled and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet
date. Insurance provisions are expected to be utilised within one year.
Reorganisation:
Reorganisation provisions at the start of the period relate principally to a store closure programme launched in the period ended 30 March 2002, the costs
associated with the ongoing implementation of shared service functions, and the reorganisation programme started in the prior period to integrate Onetel with the
rest of the Group. The costs of the Onetel integration were estimated at £22.3m (see note 4), principally being redundancy and other employee costs, contract
termination costs, and network and customer migration costs. These costs have been substantially incurred in the period ended 31 March 2007 and the remaining
costs are expected to be incurred in the period ending 29 March 2008. The release in the period relates to redundancies and contract termination costs, which
were over-estimated at 1 April 2006. The impact of this release is offset by further provision for network and customer migration costs, which were under-estimated
at 1 April 2006.
Sales:
Sales provisions relate to “cash-back” and similar promotions, product warranties, product returns, and network operator performance penalties. Sales provisions
are expected to be used within the following 12 to 24 months.
Other:
Other provisions relate to dilapidations and similar property costs, and all other provisions, principally being the anticipated costs of unresolved tax issues and legal
disputes, and costs associated with onerous contracts.

The Group has an Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) which holds 9.8m shares (2006 – 14.1m) in the Company for the beneﬁt of the Group’s employees.
The ESOT has waived its rights to receive dividends and none of its shares has been allocated to speciﬁc schemes.
At 31 March 2007 the shares had a carrying value of £16.2m and a market value of £27.1m (2006 – carrying value £23.5m, market value £43.5m). 
Unrealised gain on disposal of subsidiary:
On 3 April 2006, the Group disposed of the assets and customers of Omer Telecom SAS, the Group’s MVNO operation in France, to a joint venture, Omer
Telecom Limited, trading as Virgin Mobile, in which the Group owns a 48.5% holding. The disposal resulted in an unrealised gain of £1.7m, which has been
recognised in reserves in accordance with SIC13 ‘Jointly Controlled Entities – Non Monetary Contributions by Venturers’.

Financial Statements Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on the Company Financial Statements
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 200 7
66
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the ﬁnancial
statements. The Directors have chosen to prepare the accounts for the Company
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
United Kingdom company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial
statements for each ﬁnancial period which give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the Company and of its proﬁt or loss for that period. In preparing
those ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed; and 
• Prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the
Company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with
the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this Report
conﬁrms that: 
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of
which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
• the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as
a Director in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of 
that information. 
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the
provisions of s234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.

Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the individual Company ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the individual Company ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant ﬁnancial
reporting framework and whether the individual Company ﬁnancial statements
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Directors’ Report on page 31 is consistent with the individual Company
ﬁnancial statements. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions 
is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report as described 
in the contents section and consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the individual Company ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the individual Company ﬁnancial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made 
by the Directors in the preparation of the individual Company ﬁnancial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the individual Company
ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the individual
Company ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the individual Company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice,
of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2007;
• the individual Company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the
individual Company ﬁnancial statements.

1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom accounting standards under the historical cost convention, 
as modiﬁed by FRS26 ‘Financial Instruments: Measurement’. The principal
accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently throughout
the current and preceding period, except for the amendment to FRS26 and the
accounting interpretation to FRS20 ‘Group and Treasury Share Transactions’
that came into force in the current ﬁnancial period, which are as follows:
FRS26 ‘Financial Instruments: Measurement’
The accounting policy relating to ﬁnancial instruments has remained consistent
with the prior period except for a change in the accounting treatment of
ﬁnancial guarantee contracts arising from the adoption of the Amendment to
FRS26, which was issued by the Accounting Standards Board in April 2005
(see Financial guarantees below).
UITF44 ‘FRS20 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions’
The Company has adopted UITF44 and in accordance with the interpretation
has restated the balance sheet with effect from 3 April 2005. The UITF 
requires that the issue of options over the Company’s shares to its subsidiary
undertakings represents a capital contribution, resulting in an addition 
to investments and a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity 
(see Share-based payments below). 
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the
period ended 31 March 2007 contain a consolidated statement of cashﬂows.
Consequently, the Company has applied the exemption in FRS1 ‘Cash Flow
Statements’ not to present its own cash ﬂow statement. 
Investments
Investments held in Group companies are recognised at cost, being the fair
value of the consideration, acquisition charges associated with the investment,
and capital contributions by way of share-based payments, less any provision
for permanent diminution in value. 
Investments held in non-Group companies are treated as available-for-sale and
recorded at fair value. Changes in fair value, together with any related deferred
taxation, are taken directly to reserves, and recycled to the proﬁt and loss
account when the investment is sold or is determined to be impaired.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain
employees in the Group. Equity settled share-based payments are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant, and expensed over the vesting period, based
on the Company’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Binomial model for share-based payments
with internal performance criteria (such as Earnings Per Share targets) and a
Monte Carlo model for those with external performance criteria (such as Total
Shareholder Return targets).
For schemes with internal performance criteria, the number of options expected
to vest is recalculated at each balance sheet date, based on expectations of
performance against target and of leavers prior to vesting. The movement in
cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the proﬁt
and loss account, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
For schemes with external performance criteria, the number of options
expected to vest is adjusted only for expectations of leavers prior to vesting. 
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet is
recognised in the proﬁt and loss account, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
Share-based payments issued by the Company to its subsidiary undertakings
are treated as additions to investments based on the fair value of the grant,
spread over the relevant vesting period, with a corresponding credit to
reserves. Where the Company recharges the cost of share-based payments 
to its subsidiary undertakings the investment is reduced accordingly.
Dividends
Dividends receivable from the Company’s subsidiaries are recognised only
when they are approved by shareholders.
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as 
a liability in the ﬁnancial statements in the period in which they are approved 
by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised in the period
in which they are paid.
Foreign currency translation
Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using forward purchases
or sales of the relevant currencies and are recognised in the ﬁnancial statements
at the exchange rates thus obtained. Unhedged transactions are recorded at
the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Material monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are hedged, mainly using forward
foreign exchange contracts to create matching liabilities and assets, and are
retranslated at each balance sheet date. Hedge accounting as deﬁned by
FRS26 has been applied in the period.
Financial guarantees
The Company has guaranteed certain commitments given by subsidiary
undertakings. The fair value of any such guarantees is amortised through the
proﬁt and loss account on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period. www.cpwplc.com
2 Profit and loss account
In accordance with the exemption permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the proﬁt and loss account of the Company is not presented separately.
The proﬁt recognised for the period was £83.4m (2006 – £234.3m). 
Audit fees for the audit of the individual Company ﬁnancial statements are £0.01m (2006 – £0.01m).

The proposed ﬁnal dividend for the period ended 31 March 2007 is subject to shareholders’ approval at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included 
as a liability in these ﬁnancial statements.
The expected cost of the proposed ﬁnal dividend for the period ended 31 March 2007 reﬂects the fact that the Group’s Employee Share Ownership Trust has
agreed to waive its rights to receive dividends.

As explained in note 1, the Company adopted UITF44 in the period and has restated shareholders’ funds at 3 April 2005 and 1 April 2006 to reﬂect this. The effect
of the adjustment is to recognise a cumulative increase in reserves of £1.8m at 3 April 2005 and £9.3m at 1 April 2006 with a corresponding increase to ﬁxed
asset investments to reﬂect the net cost of share-based payments awarded to employees of subsidiary undertakings in both periods.
Included in the ﬁnancial proﬁt for the Company for the period is a share-based payment charge of £4.5m (2006 – £3.2m) representing the cost of share-based
payments granted to Group employees whose costs are borne by the Company. 
The only direct employees of the Company are the Directors detailed on page 21; details of their share options are shown in the Remuneration Report 
on pages 25 to 30.

Remuneration Report 
Resolution 2 
The Company is required under the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002 (“Regulations”) to produce a remuneration report for
shareholders which must comply with the Regulations, be approved by the
Board and ﬁled with the Registrar of Companies. The Report must also be
approved by the shareholders.
Dividend 
Resolution 3
Final dividends must be approved by shareholders but must not exceed the
amount recommended by Directors. If the meeting approves the ﬁnal dividend
it will be paid out in accordance with the Financial Calendar set out on page 75
of the Annual Report.
Directors 
Resolutions 4 , 5 and 6 
Adrian Martin and Sir Brian Pitman are required to retire by rotation and to
stand for re-election every three years pursuant to the Company’s Articles of
Association adopted on 13th July 2000. David Grigson was appointed as a
Director with effect from 24 April 2007. The Articles require that all Directors
appointed by the Board are elected by the Company’s shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting following their appointment. No Director may vote in
respect of his own appointment. Biographical details of those Directors seeking
election and re-election are given on page 21 of the Annual Report and will be
available at the meeting.
Auditors 
Resolution 7
The Company is required to appoint auditors at each general meeting at which
accounts are presented, to hold ofﬁce until the end of the next such meeting.
This resolution is recommended by the Audit Committee and proposes the 
re-appointment of the Company’s existing auditors Deloitte & Touche LLP , 
and follows good practice in giving authority to the Audit Committee to
determine their remuneration.
Directors’ Borrowing Power
Resolution 8
These borrowing limits were inserted in the Company’s Articles of Association
at the time of the Company’s ﬂotation on the London Stock Exchange in 
July 2000. The Board believes that these restrictions are no longer required
and potentially too restrictive given the Company’s history, size and nature 
and that it is in the Company’s best interests for them to be deleted. 
Electronic Communication
Resolution 9
Resolution 9 proposes to amend the Company’s Articles of Association to
enable the Company to beneﬁt from broader powers under the Companies Act
2006 (the “2006 Act”) in relation to the sending or supplying of documents or
information by or to the Company in electronic form (including, without
limitation, via a website). The provisions of the 2006 Act, which were brought
into force on 20 January 2007, permit the use of electronic communications
between shareholders and the Company such that documents or information
may be sent or supplied via the Company’s website to shareholders who have
not either, requested a hard copy of the relevant document or information or
provided an e-mail address to which the document or information can be sent.
The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company to take advantage
of these provisions and the Company intends to make use of these provisions
in the future in order to facilitate communications between the Company and
its shareholders and to reduce the current considerable cost associated with
sending paper copies of the documents to a large number of shareholders. 
The proxy card accompanying this notice includes an election form which asks
shareholders to decide (i) if they wish to continue to receive documents or
information in paper form (ii) to provide an e-mail address to which notiﬁcations
that documents or information are available on the website can be sent or (iii)
Explanatory Notes to the Resolutions 
to take no action and view any documents or information via the Company’s
website. Shareholders should note that if they do not respond to the election
form, they will be taken to have agreed that the Company may send or s
upply documents or information by means of its website. However, where
shareholders are provided with documents by means of the Company’s
website, they will be notiﬁed by the Company whenever a relevant document
has been made available on that website. 
A copy of the existing Articles of Association, and a copy marked to show 
the differences between the existing Articles of Association and the Articles 
of Association as proposed to be amended pursuant to resolutions 8 and 9,
will be available for inspection during normal business hours on Monday to
Friday each week (public holidays excepted) at the Company’s Registered
Ofﬁce at 1 Portal Way, London, W3 6RS from the date of this document up 
to and including the date of the Annual General Meeting and at the place of 
the Annual General Meeting from 10.45am until the close of the meeting.
Allotment of shares 
Resolutions 10 and 11 
These resolutions renew the Directors’ authority to issue relevant securities up to
an aggregate nominal amount of £298,762 being a sum equal to one third of the
issued ordinary share capital of the Company at 31 March 2007. The Directors
will also be able to make issues for cash on a non pre-emptive basis. The
proposed limit of £44,814 represents 5% of the nominal amount of the issued
ordinary share capital as at 31 March 2007. The Company had 896,284,916
ordinary shares of 0.1p each in issue at 31 March 2007 and the Company’s
authorised share capital is 1,500,000,000 ordinary shares of 0.1p each. 
The above limits are in line with the guidelines issued by the Investment
Committees of the Association of British Insurers and the National Association
of Pension Funds.
Repurchase of shares 
Resolution 12 
This grants the Company authority to purchase its own shares up to a maximum
amount of 89,628,492 until the Annual General Meeting in 2008. The Companies
Act 1985 permits a company to purchase its own shares provided that the
purchase has been authorised by the Company in a general meeting. It is
common practice for listed companies to seek such authority and the Directors
consider that it is prudent to seek such authority at the Annual General Meeting. 
The amount represents 10% of the ordinary shares in issue as at 31 March 2007.
The authority is limited to the stated upper and lower prices payable for the
shares which reﬂects the requirements of the UK Listing Authority. As at 
4 June 2007 there were 84,010,722 outstanding options granted and
unexercised under all share option schemes operated by the Company which,
if exercised, would represent 9.4% of the existing issued ordinary share capital
of the Company. If this authority to repurchase was exercised in full, such
options would represent approximately 10.4% of the issued share capital at
such date. The Directors would only propose to make share purchases where
the expected effect would be to increase earnings per share and having
reviewed the overall ﬁnancial position of the Company, such purchases were
considered to be in the best interests of the shareholders generally.

Financial Statements Explanatory Notes to the Resolutions continued
Monday to Friday each week (public holidays excepted) at the Company’s
Registered Ofﬁce at 1 Portal Way, London, W3 6RS from the date of this
document up to and including the date of the Annual General Meeting and 
at the place of the Annual General Meeting from 10.45am until the close 
of the meeting. 
2. Proxy voting 
A shareholder who is entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to
appoint a proxy or proxies to attend and, on a poll, to vote on his/her behalf. 
A proxy need not be a member of the Company. To be valid, a form of proxy, 
a form of which is enclosed, and any power of attorney or the authority under
which it is signed or a duly certiﬁed copy thereof must be lodged with the
registrars of the Company, Lloyds TSB, whose details are found on page 21 
of the Annual Report, before 11am on 24 July 2007. Shareholders who return
completed proxy voting forms may still attend the meeting instead of their proxies
and vote in person if they wish. In the event of a poll in which the shareholder
votes in person, his/her proxy votes lodged with the Company will be excluded.
3 . Electronic voting 
Instructions for registering your votes electronically are appended to the form 
of proxy enclosed with this notice. 
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST
electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using the procedures
described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST
sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting
service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. 
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service
to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must
be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s speciﬁcations and
must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in 
the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the
appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously
appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received
by the issuer’s agent (ID 7RA01) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy
appointments speciﬁed in the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time of
receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to
the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is
able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by
CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through
CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting
service providers should note that CRESTCo does not make available special
procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings 
and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy
Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take
(or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member
or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST
sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary
to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by
any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable,
their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, 
to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the
CREST system and timings. 
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the
circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities
Regulations 2001.
4 . Admission 
If you propose to attend the meeting, please detach and bring with you the
attendance slip attached to the form of proxy. You will be asked to show this 
at the entrance and not having it available could delay your admission. 
5 . Proof of identity 
Shareholders and participants may also be required to provide proof of identity.
If you have been appointed as a shareholder’s proxy please make this fact
known on admission to the Lloyds TSB personnel who will direct you to 
a proxy helpdesk.
